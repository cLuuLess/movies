cu: neo

his face is contorted in rage as he rockets upward. gregory is  barely
conscious. seeing this, neo stops, and flings gregory’s body violently
earthward.

neo looks down as  the body falls toward  the city, thousands of  feet
below. he turns away,  just as the distant  gregory is falling out  of
sight. just before he does, the speck of a person pulls up, and  grows
larger and larger as  it returns. a contrail  streaks behind him as  a
rips through  the air.  fists forward,  gregory is  like an mx missile
bearing on neo.

neo turns just in  time to catch both  fists in his chest.  like a cue
ball striking another billiard,  all gregor’s momentum is  transferred
into neo. gregor stops dead in the air as neo is hurtled out of view.

cu: gregor

he is in  shock somehow as  he sees neo  flying away. he  clenches his
fists and flexes his body, then looks down.

we see the ground, thousands of feet below.

                               gregory

                             "holy shit!"

for some  reason, he  starts to  fall. even  as he  claws to  maintain
altitude, his  rational mind  has caught  up with  him and  is somehow
denying the fact that he can fly.
