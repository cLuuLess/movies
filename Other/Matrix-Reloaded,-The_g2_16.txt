int. main bridge (night)

the ship is  quiet. razor sits  at the operator  console, smashing the
keyboard as he forces tetris pieces into place.


int. cockpit

choi is sipping coffee as he nudges the ship to a stop. he speaks into
his headphones.

                                 choi

                          "ok, try it here."


int. main bridge

razor halts his video game playing and flashes to a different  screen.
lines of code come pouring down the screen as he types, then hits  the
enter key with a flourish. the screen flashes, and the familiar scroll
of the matrix cascades down the screens.

                                razor

                             "holy shit."

                                                               cut to:

int. main bridge

                                 choi

                   "what? tell me you got signal."

                             razor (v.o.)

      "no fucking shit i got signal. dude, they’re changing it."

                           choi is annoyed.

                                 choi

                "are you using the right pulse wave?"

                                                               cut to:

int. main bridge

                                razor

                "shut the fuck up and get back here."

the  matrix  scroll  pours  down  at  a  streaking  pace.  it’s almost
impossible to make out the individual characters.

                      choi comes up behind razor

                                 choi

                    "oh my god. what are they - "

                                razor

                    "they’re changing the matrix."

                                 choi

                           "call morpheus."

razor patches into morpheus’ cabin through the headset.


int. morpheus cabin

it’s dark, but  quiet classical music  can be heard.  he’s not in  bed
alone. niobe’s shaded form can be made out behind him.

morpheus sounds awake,  but looks anything  but. he grabs  the buzzing
handset only an arm’s length from him.

                               morpheus

                             "i’m here."

                                razor

                   "sir, you gotta get down here."

morpheus starts  dressing as  he talks.  he puts  a reasurring hand on
niobe’s shoulder.

                               morpheus

                          "proximity alarm?"

                                razor

             "the matrix, sir. the coding is going nuts."

                               morpheus

                          "be right there."
