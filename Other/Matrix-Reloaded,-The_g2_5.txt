morpheus taps him on the forehead. neo blinks and falls back into  the
booth. he stands before them.

                            "how’s tank?"

                               morpheus

 "he’s on bereavement leave with his mother. dozer was the second son
                       she’s lost in this war."

                    his comments set a sober tone.

                               morpheus

  "the nebechanezzer is out of commission for at least a month. but,
                    that’s not giving us a rest."

                               trinity

         "let me guess. we’ve been ordered back out anyway."

                               morpheus

 "yes. this is another special op. i’m in command, niobe and trinity
             are team leaders. neo is our secret weapon."

     flash to: neo, passed out with his mouth open on the couch.

                               morpheus

 "we don’t know exactly what he’s capable of. he may be just tapping
his potential, or he may have already reached it. we are to learn from
                      him, as he does from us."

"why are we always getting screwed? not only do i have to go straight
           back into the shit, but i lose my command, too?"

                               morpheus

"you’ve been assigned to this mission because you’re the best, choi."

                                dujour

 "yeah, and headquarters thinks you might be able to whine the agents
                              to death."
