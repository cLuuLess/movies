int. main deck - night

razor is strapped into one of the interface chairs, his eyes closed.


ext. rest stop

half-dead morpheus drags niobe to the booth.

behind them, agent smith backs away from razor’s dual blades, on long,
one short. whenever razor attacks,  smith backs away. they circle  one
another.

                morpheus puts niobe through the phone.

                      razor forces smith around.

                                razor

              "come on, tough guy, come got some razor."

smith frowns  and moves  forward, but  the whistling  edge of  a blade
makes him  think twice.  razor holds  the short  sword parallel to the
ground, the long sword straight up. he hides his eyes behind the short
sword.

smith’s back is against the sunset. the sun drops below a cloud.

razor flashes  the light  off his  short blade,  directly into smith’s
eyes, blinding him as he strikes with the long sword.

smith, blinded, turns and backs away. razor attacks.

in the  booth, niobe  is gone.  morpheus hangs  up the  phone. he  can
barely stand up enough to reach the handset. when it rings he picks it
up. but he doesn’t disappear.

                               morpheus

                             "reload me."
