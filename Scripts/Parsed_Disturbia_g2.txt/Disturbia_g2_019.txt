23   int. kale's bedroom - that night                                       23

     kale samples some rap clips on i-tunes.    likes what he's
     hearing.

     on the screen - kale moves the cursor to "buy song." the
     account screen pops up. kale types his password.

     after a beat, bold red letters pop up: "the apple id or
     password you entered was invalid or incorrect..." kale types
     it again. same thing. then -- like we all do to be sure,
     kale types his password at a rate of one key per second.
     same thing. kale fumes, smelling a rat.
