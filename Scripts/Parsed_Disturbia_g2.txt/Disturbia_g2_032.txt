     the chase is on.   kale increases his speed.   almost catching
     up to them --

                           brat #2
                   (terrified to brat #1)
               dude, you said he couldn't leave his
               house!!

     kale overhears, stops cold.   he glances to the ankle bracelet:
     flashing red light.

                            kale
               shit!

     kale races back down the street, his shit-stained feet leaving
     tracks as he goes. he cuts through ashley's yard again,
     yelling at the bracelet all the way--

                           kale (cont'd)
               turn green turn green turn green...

     kale races by ashley's parents, leaps back into...
