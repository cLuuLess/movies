     dad's office

     hardwood floor.    ornate, cherry wood desk.     plush leather
     chairs. quiet.

     on the desk -- dad's reading glasses sit on a stack of papers
     next to an antique typewriter.

     the walls -- adorned with framed, poster-size covers of dad's
     books - non-fiction, true account titles: whistleblower -
     the inside story of a real corporate insider; the senator's
     shadows: how eight men conspired to control one.

     on another wall -- a family portrait of jeff, julie, and
     kale - age six; jeff at a book signing, smiling wide...

     kale takes it all in from the doorway. his feet never once
     cross into the room. his eyes say everything. loss, anger,
     regret. he gently pulls the door shut.
