30   int. kale's bedroom - day - later                                    30

     kale reclines in his chair, now furiously swatting the
     racketball against the wall -- with a racket. we pull back
     to reveal scuff marks on the walls and ceiling where kale
     has figured out the exact points to hit it allowing him to
     bounce the ball off multiple walls and return it perfectly
     to his hand. he swats it... and swats it...
