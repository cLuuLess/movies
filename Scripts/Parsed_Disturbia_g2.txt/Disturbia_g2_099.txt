103   int. kale's bedroom - night - seconds later                        103

      giles slams kale down in his desk chair. giles eyes the dv
      cam sitting on the tv. the tape slot's open.

                               giles
                   so where's the tape?

      kale mumbles a muffled "fuck you" under the duct tape.

                               giles (cont'd)
                   you're right, i'll find it later.

      giles sits on kale's bed. eyes the book on serial killers.
      he picks it up, flips through it.

                                giles (cont'd)
                   it's funny, i hear a lot of authors
                   say their first books were easy,
                   it's the second one that's really
                   hard. wonder if your dad thought
                   that.
                       (off kale's glare)
                   see with me, it's the opposite. the
                   very first one was...
                       (sickly reminiscing)
                   ...very difficult... she was very
                   beautiful... fragile... a lot of
                   promise... the others in texas were
                   flings, low class... patty walsh had
                   potential, but so did amy. you saw
                   her, right? when you were watching
                   me? you should feel good, kale, you
                   guys saved her life. i was headed
                   in to kill her when your girlfriend
                   showed up. so, you're a hero, kale.
                   savor the moment.
                       (tosses the book)
                   you have microsoft word?
                       (off kale's questioning
                         look; re: computer)
                   turn it on.

      kale doesn't move.    giles raises the bat:

                               giles (cont'd)
                   i can type, you know.

      kale turns to the computer, lifts his taped wrists to the
      keyboard.

                                giles (cont'd)
                   "dear ashley... i killed ronnie and
                   my mom because...
                        (re: kale not typing)
                   what's wrong? hey, you're the one
                   who couldn't leave me alone.
                   truthfully, i'm sick of covering my
                   tracks. you think i like spending
                   my spare time looking over my shoulder
                   for people like you? word of advice,
                   if you ever need to hurt someone,
                   think everything through. because
                   you do get a taste for it, don't
                   you?

                   but damned if people aren't just
                   waiting to stand in your way... cops,
                   reporters, determined relatives,
                   nosy fucking neighbors... next thing
                   you know, you're on tilt, you can't
                   think straight, you're clocking your
                   teacher in front of the whole class,
                   me... i'm hitting a damned deer...
                   man, that was some shitty luck.
                       (then)
                   anyway, it's pretty clear how we've
                   gotta clean this up. the irony is,
                   you've done all the hard stuff.
                   whaddaya think: "troubled youth
                   finally snapped." maybe because he
                   was jealous of his girlfriend, or
                   maybe he just couldn't deal with the
                   guilt from not saving daddy.
                       (off kale)
                   hey, you googled me.

      giles steps away, turns back to the bed as kale suddenly
      does snap. he leans forward, grabs the lcd computer monitor
      with his taped wrists, stands, whirls around, and hurls it
      at giles, smacking him on the side of his head -- a one in a
      hundred shot! giles goes down.

      but the forward momentum of kale's throw combined with his
      taped ankles causes him to lose his balance. kale falls to
      the floor, scrambles for the baseball bat just inches away --

      giles

      staggers to his feet and charges kale. kale grabs the bat,
      rolls around and swings up at giles, whacking him in the
      chest. giles doubles over as kale frantically plants the
      bat on the floor, using it as a "cane" to pull himself back
      to his feet. he hops toward giles, raises the bat, swings
      it, but giles anticipates, grabs the bat, pulls it forward,
      and reverse jabs kale in the face! kale staggers back, but
      somehow keeps his balance and the bat. he spins around,
      hops to the door into...
