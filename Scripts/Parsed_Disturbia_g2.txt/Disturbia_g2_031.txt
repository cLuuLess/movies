35   ext. kale's yard - day - continuous                                35

     kale walks briskly, menacingly toward them --

                           kale
               you think that's funny?

     the brats grow more concerned, back away as kale draws closer--

                           brat #2
               what are you gonna do, kill us like
               your teacher?

     kale charges them!

                           kale
               not before i shove this shit up your
               ass!

     the brats pedal away. kale races through the sprinkler,
     crossing his yard into the far corner of ashley's, trying to
     cut the brats off as they race down...
