32   int. 2nd floor hallway/window - day - seconds later                  32

     kale goes to the window, tilts his head, trying to see where
     the noise is coming from.

     kale's pov - he's able to make out some bits of movement
     next door, but his view is obstructed by the architecture of
     his house.

     kale steps back from the window, studies it a beat -- then
     opens it, slowly sticks his head out.

     his   pov - a u-haul truck comes into view. it's backed into
     the   driveway next door. alan norris, 43, appears from inside
     the   truck's cab, carrying a moving box. he hands it down to
     his   wife, bonnie, 42, who walks back in the house.

     kale's about to pull his head in when another person comes
     out of the moving truck. she's carrying a box that's
     obscuring her face as she carefully negotiates the incline
     of the moving truck's ramp.

     but her blonde hair and perfect legs look to be about 17.
     we'll soon know her as ashley, the norris' daughter.

     she reaches the end of the ramp. bends over to retrieve
     another smaller box, her back and ass to kale who stares in
     utter disbelief. ashley stacks the boxes, picks them up and
     heads into the house, her face still a mystery.

     kale watches her go.   mesmerized. suddenly, the doorbell
     rings o.s. kale snaps to, yanks his head back in -- and
     kerbongs it on the underside of the window. he drops to the
     floor.

                                 kale
                  goddammit!

     kale staggers to his feet...
