86   ext. giles' back yard/house - night - continuous                   86

                             kale
               ronnie?!

     kale darts to giles' back door, tries the knob -- locked.

                           kale (cont'd)
               ronnie, can you hear me?! giles,
               open the door!!

     the house is still. kale bolts around the side, uneasily
     feeling his way through shadows and low-hanging branches.
