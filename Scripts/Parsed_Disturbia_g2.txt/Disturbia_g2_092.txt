95   int. kale's bedroom - night - continuous                           95

                            kale
               ronnie?!

     no answer. shit. kale grabs the cordless off his bed, clicks
     it on: dead. another lightning flash. he grabs the tape
     out of the camera, buries it in his closet, pulls out his
     racketball trophy then creeps to the door, peers out --

     kale's pov - the hallway's empty.   clear shot to the stairs.
