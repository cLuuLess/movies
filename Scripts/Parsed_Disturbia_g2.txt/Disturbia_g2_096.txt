99   ext. kale's back yard - night - continuous                         99

     kale bolts out the door, but trips on a well-placed garden
     gnome on the steps. giles or the brats must have put it
     there. regardless, it slows kale down. he staggers into
     the yard, screaming for anyone to hear. but the wind and
     thunder drown him out as

     giles

     -- now right behind him -- swings the bat and trips kale up.
     kale falls just short of his kite string boundary line.

      like a quarterback pressing to the goal line, kale lunges
      forward, but --

      giles' hand suddenly grab's kale's ankle just as the ankle
      bracelet is about to cross the line.

      kale screams, digs his hands into the earth, trying to pull
      himself forward, but giles is too strong. he drags kale
      backward, then pins him to the ground, pulls out a roll of
      duct tape, quickly and efficiently wraps some around kale's
      mouth, hands and ankles.

      giles yanks kale up, throws him over his shoulder and heads
      back toward kale's house.
