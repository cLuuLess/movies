93   int. kale's bedroom - night - continuous                          93

     on the tv - just as the camera slides to a stop at the
     bookcase and aims underneath it, kale freezes the image.
     dark, grainy.

     kale grabs his remote, cranks the brightness all the way up
     on his tv.

     kale scoots closer to the tv amidst another flash of lightning
     & much louder clap of thunder.

     on his finger - pressing the frame by frame advance button --

     on the tv -- we start to see something under the bookcase...

     kale presses the button a couple more times.

     on the tv - the next frames are blurred -- this is the point
     where ronnie grabs the camera back -- but --

     kale's finger - presses the advance button one more time.

     on the tv - the next frame pops into focus.

     there, under the bookcase, we see a faded black stamp on the
     back of a woman's hand!

     kale's eyes widen as he keeps pressing the advance button...

     cu - kale's eyes are transfixed on the screen, his face just
     inches away as a few more blurry frames flip by then -- bam --

     the face of the missing girl -- patricia walsh -- pops on
     the screen in sharp focus, her long red hair partially
     covering her ghostly, wide open eyes that stare right into
     camera!

     kale recoils in horror as lightning ignites his room.

                              kale
                      (calling o.s.)
                  ronnie, get your ass up here!

     but a roll of thunder drowns our kale's voice --
