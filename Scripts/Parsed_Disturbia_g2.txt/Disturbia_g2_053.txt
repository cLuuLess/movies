56   int. kale's bedroom - evening - later                            56

     a box of spying crap is dumped onto kale's bed. another dv
     camera, an old, bulky vhs camera, a black and white portable
     tv, couple of tri-pods, walkie talkies, wires... a real mess.
     wider to reveal ronnie:

                           ronnie
               this is all the stuff i could find --

     ashley sits at kale's computer as kale anxiously sifts through
     ronnie's stuff.

                           ashley
               do you know how long giles has lived
               there?

                           kale
               about two or three years.

                           ashley
               so he could've lived in texas...
                   (re: computer screen)
               hey, check this out.

     ronnie goes to ashley, reads the amazon web page for the
     book:

                           ronnie
               "murderer: tell tale signs of a serial
               killer." qualifies for free shipping
               if you pair it with "the shrine of
               jeffrey dahmer."

                           ashley
               the summary lists four main criteria.
               our guy meets at least three. white
               male between the age of twenty-five
               and fifty. he doesn't have any pets,
               right?

                           kale
               not that i've seen --

                           ashley
               you said he lives alone --

                           ronnie
               what's the fourth?

                           ashley
                   (nonchalant)
               sexual dysfunction.



                                              (continued)   d.j. caruso

                                                                    42.

     silence. kale and ronnie trade awkward glances, shaking
     their heads to each other as if reassuring themselves they
     don't suffer from such a condition.

                              ashley (cont'd)
                      (changing the subject)
                  i'm hungry, let's order pizza.
