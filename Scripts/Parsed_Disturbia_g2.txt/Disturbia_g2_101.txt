105   int. dad's office - night - continuous                            105

      ashley shoves kale inside as she spins back, slams the office
      door in giles' face, locks it. giles bangs on the door.

      ashley goes to kale, rips the duct tape off his mouth.   kale
      screams in pain as ashley heads for the desk phone.

                                kale
                   it's dead.

      ashley grabs a pair of scissors off dad's desk, cuts kale's
      ankles and hands free. kale reaches down to the ankle
      bracelet, furiously tugs at it.

                               ashley
                   let me try --

      ashley moves in, tries to cut it loose with the scissors as
      giles suddenly slams something against the door, trying to
      break it down!

                               ashley (cont'd)
                   where's your mom --

                               kale
                       (tugging on bracelet)
                   living room -- tied up -- he got
                   ronnie -- in the kitchen --
                       (then; re: bracelet)
                   goddamn you!!

                               ashley
                       (giving up with
                        scissors)
                   okay, just -- i'll get your mom, you
                   figure out a way to call the cops --

                               kale
                   no, i've gotta get her --

                               ashley
                   kale, you've gotta get outside, get
                   over the boundary -- do you hear me?

                               kale
                       (beat; then; an idea
                        sparking)
                   okay, but -- just follow my lead --
                   we're gonna need stuff --

      ashley and kale glance around for weapons. ashley pockets
      the scissors, grabs a letter opener off dad's desk. kale
      finds his racketball racket and the ball. pockets the ball,
      slips the racket in the back of his shorts, then grabs the
      baseball bat as he heads for the bookshelves near the door
      that leads to the outside porch. he reaches up, runs his
      fingers to the third book on the middle shelf, pulls it out,
      flips it open to reveal a key that drops in his hand.

                               kale (cont'd)
                   once i have his attention, you go
                   get her.

      ashley nods. kale takes the key, heads to the porch door,
      unlocks it with a quiet click. he swings the door open,
      steps out onto...
