77   int. dad's office - night                                             77

     our pov - peering down into ashley's back yard. there's a
     couple of guys passed out on rafts floating in the pool. we
     slowly pan to reveal --

     kale - looking tired, his eyes glazed, sitting at dad's
     computer surfing a website: "brutal killings in austin."

     on the screen - as kale clicks pages, we see flashes of crime
     scene photos from the three murders -- the bodies of the
     three redheads -- bloodied, bruised...

     on kale - he doesn't blink as he clicks on one photo after
     the other. we see a flashes of the victims' eyes -- wide
     open, lifeless...

     we suddenly hear laughter o.s. kale snaps to. he runs a
     hand through his hair, gets up, moves to the window.

     his pov - ashley's pool - a couple of girls giggle as they
     stand at the edge of the pool pouring beer onto the passed-
     out guys' chests.
