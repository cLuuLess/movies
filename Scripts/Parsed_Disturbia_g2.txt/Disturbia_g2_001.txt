1   ext. bishop lake - day                                           1

    the undisturbed beauty of nature serves as our backdrop as
    we move closer to kale and jeff, taking note of their t-
    shirts: jeff's has a silkscreened cartoon rendition of a
    bass wearing aviator goggles with mounted missiles on its
    fins. beneath it, the slogan: "weapons of bass destruction."
    the fish on kale's shirt wears a stock car uniform, a single
    word across the bottom: basscar.

    as jeff steadies kale's hand and pulls away:

                           jeff
               you don't want to scare him off.
               you've got his attention, now just
               play with him. tease him a little.

    kale and jeff watch the water in anxious silence... kale
    inching the line back toward the boat. one more crank, then --

    the black bass suddenly attacks the lure with a tremendous
    slosh of his tail!

                              kale
                 holy shit!

                             jeff
                 it's all you, kale, keep cranking!

    kale cranks fast and furious.    but this is one fish that's
    going down fighting.

                             kale
                 i need reinforcements!

    jeff moves in, grabs the rod and reel from behind kale.

                             jeff
                 heave, laddie!

    they pull.    the rod curls under the weight.

                             jeff (cont'd)
                     (pirate accent)
                 give it all ya got, mate, or you're
                 gonna lose him!

                             kale
                     (laughing; pulling;
                      struggling)
                 dad, your pirate -- impersonation --
                 sucks!!

                             jeff
                 how would ya know, have ya ever met
                 one? i doubt it --

    the bass sloshes furiously around the bait, now just a few
    feet from the boat!

                             kale
                 he's freakin' pulling us in!

                             jeff
                     (laughing)
                 never! no brecht has ever -- lost a
                 fight -- to a fish!

    the bass suddenly snaps free. the line goes limp. jeff and
    kale lose their balance, nearly falling backward. then --



                                                (continued)   d.j. caruso

                                                                     3.

    all becomes silent save for jeff and kale's heavy breathing.
    kale winds the empty line back to the boat, shoots a glance
    to jeff, then throws the rod aside in mock disgust. jeff
    takes a seat in the captain's chair.

                             jeff (cont'd)
                 throw me a --

    kale is already in the cooler. he throws jeff a coke.        both
    sit in silence for a beat. then --

                             jeff (cont'd)
                 hey, at least the weather's great...
                 we're spending quality time together.

                             kale
                     (grabbing pole)
                 that fish is going down.

                             jeff
                     (not missing a beat)
                 let's nab the bastard.

    they both cast their lines --
