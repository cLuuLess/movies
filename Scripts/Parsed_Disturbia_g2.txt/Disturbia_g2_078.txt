81   int. dad's office - day - continuous                              81

     kale enters, goes to the desk, sits at dad's computer,
     clicking keys as ashley and ronnie enter --

                              ashley
                  kale, why are you so --

     ashley and ronnie stop in their tracks at the mess.

     note: up till now, the office has been in reasonably good
     order. but now, it's noticeably different.

     wider - the shades are drawn. soda cans everywhere... papers
     are spread on the floor: printed out full color gruesome
     crime scene photos, black & white autopsy photos of the

                                                (continued)   d.j. caruso

                                                                     79.

     murdered redheads... more pictures of the girl who
     disappeared, patricia walsh. "missing" flyers...

     over the above, ronnie leans down, lifts a couple of books
     out of an amazon.com box: "murderer: tell tale signs of a
     serial killer" and "the shrine of jeffrey dahmer" -- the
     titles ashley was referencing earlier. ronnie shows them to
     ashley who takes a receipt out of a nearby home depot box --
     on the page -- smith's universal garage door remote qty (1)
     $29.99.

     ashley and ronnie turn to kale. they notice on the wall
     behind him, hanging next to his dad's book cover posters, a
     black and white poster-size satellite photo of the
     neighborhood. giles' house is circled and labeled in
     flourescent ink. kale finally looks up, notices them looking --

                              kale
                      (re: satellite poster)
                  ronnie, you've seen this satellite
                  website, right? you can find any
                  location on earth and take a picture --

                              ronnie
                  yeah, for a small fee --

                              ashley
                  kale, what are you doing?

                              kale
                  trying to get to the bottom of this.

                              ashley
                      (delicately)
                  kale, right now, it doesn't look
                  that way.

                              kale
                  what's it look like?

                              ashley
                  like you're determined to turn giles
                  in to who you think he is.

                              kale
                  not who i think.

                              ashley
                      (beat; then)
                  i just didn't realize -- you were
                  this --

                                 kale
                  what, crazy?     maybe i am.   but maybe
                  i'm right.

                               ashley
                  it's not about that, it's about --
                      (beat; then quietly)
                  -- what i see. what ronnie and i
                  are seeing right now. i see a guy
                  who looks like he hasn't slept in
                  days.
                      (peers at dad's book
                        cover posters)
                  i'm seeing you sitting at your dad's
                  desk --

     that gets kale's attention.

                              ashley (cont'd)
                  -- because you lost him before
                  maybe... you ever really knew him.
                  before the world according to kale
                  took a hit from that same stuff you
                  were telling me about, remember?
                  all those curveballs? but it's like --
                  it's like you're still trying to
                  dodge them by forcing pieces together
                  that are never gonna fit... by getting
                  all wrapped up in...
                      (re: mess)
                  this.
                      (beat; then)
                  obsessing's not gonna "protect you,"
                  kale. it's not gonna make the hurt
                  go away.

     kale locks eyes with ashley.       a long beat, then --

                              kale
                  are you two gonna help me or not?

     ashley pauses, shocked she hasn't gotten through to kale.
     then --

                               ashley
                  i want to.

                              kale
                      (picks up a stack)
                  then start looking through these --

                              ashley
                  that's not what i meant.

                              kale
                      (beat; then)
                  well, this is all i need, so -- i
                  guess i'll see you later.

     ashley and ronnie trade looks.       then -- ashley leaves.   ronnie
     turns back to kale.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  so what's your deal? you hanging
                  out or not?

                              ronnie
                  i would, dude, but -- i've gotta
                  pull it together and -- change my
                  underwear. catch you later?

                                kale
                  sure.

     ronnie leaves.       kale sits in silence, his thoughts unreadable --
     jump cut:

     kale falls back in the leather chair, fighting his emotions,
     trying to keep them in check. he glances out to ashley's.
     dark. he peers around the office -- the articles, the books,
     his dad's photos... the family portrait of dad, mom, and
     kale, smiling wide... their lives ahead of them...
