      kale reaches the top of the ladder, steps onto the roof, but
      giles, from below, heaves the ladder upward, tripping kale.
      kale slams down on the roof, smacks the back of his head.

      kale's blurry pov - against a fury of lightning flashes,
      giles races up the ladder and steps onto the roof. stalks
      toward kale.

      kale gets to his feet, draws the racketball racket from his
      shorts, takes out the ball, assumes a professional looking
      serving position and wham! kale beams the ball at giles --
      and misses completely.

                               kale
                   that was a warning!

      giles rushes kale who wails on him with the racket. giles
      ducks, spins around, brings his fist up and punches kale in
      the chest.

      kale drops the racket. it slides away down the roof as kale
      doubles over. but giles grabs kale before he can fall. he
      pulls kale up off his feet, pulls him closer, gets in his
      face. kale summons some strength, tilts his head up and
      headbutts giles.

      giles stumbles back, pulling kale with him. giles slams
      down on the roof. he and kale roll down the incline and
      stop just short of the edge --

      kale looks over, spots his stereo speaker a few feet away.
