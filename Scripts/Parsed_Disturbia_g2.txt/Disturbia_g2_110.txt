      julie's gone. kale's eyes widen. he turns around     as ashley
      suddenly jumps up from behind the sofa brandishing   a butcher
      knife! she exhales in relief at the sight of kale    who rounds
      the back of the couch, sees ronnie's body lying on   the floor
      next to the entire set of butcher knives.

                               kale
                   where's my mom?

                               ashley
                   she went upstairs for you -- where's
                   giles?

                               kale
                   i don't know -- the cops should be
                   here any sec --

      the doorbell rings. kale and ashley whip their heads to the
      door. kale throws a troubled glance out the window --

                               ashley
                   what's wrong?

                               kale
                   no flashing lights -- stay here --

      kale trades ashley the net for the butcher knife.     we then
      follow kale into...
