19   int. kitchen - morning                                               19

     still a mess as we find kale, hair disheveled, rummaging
     through the cabinets. lots of costco-size boxes: crackers,
     pringles... a huge box of twinkies. kale spots a jar of
     peanut butter. he grabs the nearest bowl, pulls a bottle of
     hershey's syrup from the fridge, pours it all into the bowl.

     he's about to throw the syrup bottle in the trash when
     something in the bottom of the can catches his eye. he
     reaches in, pulls out a bill for xbox live: subscription
     canceled.
