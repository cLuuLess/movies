     kale leads ronnie up the stairs and to the window...

                           ronnie
               seriously man, you need some sun.

                               ronnie (cont'd)
                      (re: dv cam)
                  hey, i've gotta show you this.    maui
                  chicks rule.

                              kale
                      (anxious)
                  i've got something to show you, too.
                      (then; slightly crazed)
                  i mean... there's such structure to
                  it, so many layers, but it's invisible
                  if you're not looking close enough...

                              ronnie
                  what are you talking about?

                              kale
                  the world right outside the window.

     kale gestures out the window.       ronnie looks out. they peer
     down to the pilch's backyard.       a ford escort is in the drive.
     besides that, all's quiet.

                              ronnie
                  -- fascinating.

                              kale
                      (eyeing his watch)
                  just wait... and...
                      (then)
                  three... two... one... dog...

     the pilch's dog darts out the back door -- then --

                              kale (cont'd)
                  ...mrs. pilch... saying goodbye to
                  lonnie...

                              ronnie
                  husband?

                              kale
                      (shaking a "no")
                  maid.

     over the above, mrs. pilch, wearing an unflattering tennis
     skirt, exits the house. the dog hops around her as she waves
     back to her heavy set, male maid, lonnie, 35.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  four o'clock every thursday, she
                  goes to the country club to play
                  tennis with betty big-bangs there.

     kale and ronnie watch as mrs. pilch heads down the walkway,
     meets her rail-thin 50-ish female tennis partner at the curb.
     as they walk away, the dog tries to follow but gets zapped
     by the electric fence and yelps back into the house.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  and... ladies disappear... cue white
                  mercedes... mr. pilch... arriving
                  from the office...

     a white mercedes pulls in the driveway.    mr. pilch, 63, gets
     out, carrying briefcase and flowers.

                              ronnie
                  great, that still doesn't explain
                  why you're in a bathrobe at four in
                  the afternoon.

                              kale
                      (pulls ronnie closer)
                  will you just look --

                              ronnie
                  dude, he's gonna see --

                              kale
                  he can't. we don't have any lights
                  on. plus the angle's sharper from
                  ground level, it only seems like he
                  could see us. i did the math.

                              ronnie
                  oh, you did the math.

                              kale
                  optical illusion, line-of-sight
                  doesn't apply to the subject.

                              ronnie
                  kale --

                              kale
                  now tilt your gaze up...

     ronnie and kale's pov - tilting up to the pilch's bedroom
     window - lonnie vacuums as mr. pilch enters the room behind
     him. mr. pilch flips off the light switch, cutting the
     power to the vacuum. lonnie startles, turns around, sees
     pilch standing there with the flowers and a big smile.

     a beat, then -- lonnie jumps in pilch's arms, kissing him
     passionately.

                              ronnie
                  damn!!

                                                (continued)   d.j. caruso

     kale slaps his hand over ronnie's mouth. ronnie pulls away,
     reaches in his pocket, yanks out his asthma inhaler and takes
     a hit. then --

                              ronnie (cont'd)
                      (re: hallway and window)
                  seal this area off, kale.

                              kale
                  c'mon, there's more.

                              ronnie
                  what, i go to maui, you become a
                  stalker?

                              kale
                  no, stalking's for psychos. these
                  are just simple observations...
                  natural side effects of chronic
                  boredom.

     as kale heads away:

                              ronnie
                      (pleading)
                  find your passion, kale.
