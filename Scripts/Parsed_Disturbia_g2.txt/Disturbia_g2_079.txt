82   int. kale's bedroom - night                                            82

     in the darkness, find kale sitting in his video game chair
     staring out at giles' house.

     his pov - giles' garage door is open. giles' silver toyota
     is parked inside next to the mustang. there's a light or
     two on inside giles' house but no signs of movement.

     kale throws intermittent glances out the window as he starts
     to unscrew the back of the dv cam. he lifts the back off,
     then reaches in a nearby box and pulls out a blue tooth
     wireless circuit board. he starts connecting it inside the
     camera... jump cut:

     kale screws the back of the camera on, takes a swig of a
     soda. there's suddenly fierce knocking at kale's front door.
     kale just sits there. staring ahead. more knocking and
     doorbell ringing. kale jumps from his chair, grabs the bat.
