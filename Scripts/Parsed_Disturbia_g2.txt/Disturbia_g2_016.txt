     kale lounges in on the couch watching "the price is right"
     as he spoons the peanut butter from the jar, dips it in the
     bowl of chocolate syrup, devours it. brings up a two-liter
     of mountain dew, takes a big swig to wash it down.

                              kale
                      (to contestant on tv)
                  c'mon, bid a dollar, one dollar --

                              contestant (on tv)
                  i'll bid one dollar, bob.

     kale belches as he raises his spoon, saluting the screen.
     then, after a beat, a look of grave concern crosses his face --
