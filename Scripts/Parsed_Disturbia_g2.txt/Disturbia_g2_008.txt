     kale, a little more cleaned up, wearing a suit, sits between
     julie and his defense attorney.

     julie, noticeably tired, glances at her son, her expression
     a fusion of anger and sympathy. kale's eyes shift her way,
     but his head never turns. the judge mulls over his notes...

                              judge
                  okay, mr. brecht...

     kale's lawyer prompts him to stand.

                              judge (cont'd)
                  you're six months shy of eighteen,
                  that means the assault-two charge
                  you've pled guilty to carries a max
                  of one year in juvey. with these
                  priors, you're up to three.

     the judge lets that sink in.       kale remains silent.

                              judge (cont'd)
                  but losing a parent isn't easy.
                  which is why i'm sentencing you to
                  three months house arrest.

     julie closes her eyes in relief.

                              judge (cont'd)
                  you can thank your counselors and
                  lawyer later. mr. brecht, i just
                  cut you a break. don't test me.

     the judge taps his gavel.
