65   int. kitchen - day - continuous                                    65

     kale enters, notices a few full grocery bags on the counter
     and the coffee maker brewing. he opens the fridge, sees a
     new mountain dew twelve-pack. he cracks open the carton,
     pulls out a can, closes the fridge door revealing

     giles - in the flesh, in kale's kitchen.

     kale jumps, drops the can.    it rolls to giles' feet.

                              giles
                      (picking up the can)
                  whoa, whoa, settle down, slow down.
                  robert giles, your neighbor --
                      (gesturing outside)
                  behind you?

     kale glares, breathing hard. giles taps on the top of the
     dented soda can, hands it to kale. kale doesn't take it.
     note: giles' shirt should have burnt orange somewhere in it,
     either in the pattern, stripes, etc...

                              kale
                  i know, how did you --

     giles puts the soda on the counter as julie comes through
     the kitchen door carrying groceries.

                              giles
                      (to julie)
                  think i startled him.

                      (laughs)
                  oh. kale, i ran into mr. giles at --

                                giles
                  robert...

                               julie
                      (smiles)
                  ...at the grocery. i had a flat
                  tire when i came out. we tried to
                  change it, but --

                              kale
                  dad put those security bolts on --

                              julie
                  and that adapter thingy that unscrews
                  it ended up stripping it instead --

                                giles
                  my fault.

                              julie
                  no, it wasn't. you saved my life.
                      (then to kale)
                  we had it towed to frank's.

                              kale
                      (with attitude)
                  gee, really lucky you were there.

                              giles
                  just glad i could help.
                      (then; favors julie)
                  must be a little difficult when the
                  man of the house is stuck in the
                  house.

     kale reacts to that. there's an awkward silence as kale's
     eyes instinctively glance down to the ankle bracelet.

                              julie
                  oh... no, it's okay, we're managing.

     giles steps closer to kale, bends down to get a closer look
     at the ankle bracelet.

                              giles
                  i've always been curious about those
                  things, do you mind?

                                kale
                  yeah, i do.

                              julie
                  oh c'mon, kale.
                      (to giles)
                  i'm sorry.

                               giles
                  no, no.   it's none of my business.

                              kale
                  that's right.

                              giles
                  whoa, hey, dude... you seem like a
                  straight hitter. you ask me, whoever
                  they are deserved it.

     kale reacts, surprised at how genuine that sounded.

                               julie
                      (stepping in)
                  okay... i don't think that's the
                  case, and --

                              kale
                  i think i'd like to hear his opinion.

                               giles
                  and i think i opened my big mouth
                  again. you're absolutely right.
                      (then; heading for
                       the door)
                  i should go.

                              julie
                  wait, what about your coffee?

                              kale
                  i popped my spanish teacher.

     awkward beat.    giles turns back to julie:

                              giles
                  in that case, cafe con leche, por
                  favor?

                              julie
                      (searching bags)
                  shoot, milk's... still in the car.

     julie heads out the door.       giles turns to kale.   an awkward,
     silent beat. then --

                              kale
                  i like your shirt, by the way.    i
                  mean, the color.

                               giles
                  which one?

                              kale
                  oh, the... that dark orange.   always
                  reminds me of texas.

                               giles
                  yeah?   you a longhorns fan, too?

                              kale
                  sure, absolutely. even though i've
                  never stepped foot in texas --

                              giles
                  me neither. had a lot of friends
                  who went there. i stayed in minnesota
                  till i moved here.

                               kale
                  huh.

                              giles
                  so when you say you "popped" your
                  teacher --

                              kale
                  just a black eye.

                              giles
                  phew, just making sure i wasn't living
                  next to some psycho killer. listen,
                  i get it though. i had plenty of
                  teachers i wanted to just... kill.

     giles quickly adjusts his tone as julie comes back with a
     last bag of groceries:

                              giles (cont'd)
                  but no matter how hard it is to hold
                  back, the high road's always the
                  better choice.

     as giles says this, he casually sits at the kitchen table.
     kale eyes him, about to turn and leave, but:

                              julie
                  kale, could you grab the sugar?
                      (to giles)
                  sugar?

                              giles
                      (favors kale)
                  why not.

     kale quickly grabs the jar of sugar from the counter and
     even thinks to grab a spoon from the drawer. he delivers it
     to giles as julie brings the coffee, sits at the table.

                                 giles (cont'd)
                  thanks, man.

     kale turns to leave again.

                              giles (cont'd)
                  oh, hey, kale...
                      (as kale turns back)
                  nice to finally meet you.

     off kale --

                               ashley (v.o.)
                      (prelap)
                  oooh. that's creepy.
