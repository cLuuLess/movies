24   int. kale's bedroom - days later                                       24

     the shades are drawn. kale's door is closed. find kale
     looking utterly miserable, lounging in bed watching "bikini
     destinations" on hd net. julie enters wearing a business
     suit and name badge emblazoned with the re/max logo. kale
     quickly changes the channel to the local news.

                              julie
                      (heading to the window)
                  more trash tv?

                              news anchor (on tv)
                  ...thirty-three year old patricia
                  walsh was last seen three nights
                  ago...

                              kale
                      (innocently)
                  news.

                                                                   16.

24   continued:                                                          24

     kale points to the tv showing a photo of a smiling patricia
     walsh, vibrant, flowing red hair - "missing" keyed in
     underneath.

     julie shoots him a look, then rips open the blinds.      sunlight
     pours in. she gathers trash off the floor.

                              julie
                  the lawyer's sending some papers
                  over.

                              kale
                  and your point is?

                              julie
                      (heading o.s.)
                  i've got two open houses, you've
                  gotta sign for them. that's the
                  point.

                              kale
                  you canceled my xbox subscription.

                              julie (o.s.)
                  i-tunes, too.
                      (then)
                  you know what else i'm canceling?

     kale turns to julie who suddenly drops a pile of kale's
     clothes on the floor in front of him.

                              julie (cont'd)
                  maid service.
                      (off kale)
                  sorry, you're a felon. and we're
                  broke. i can't do it all, anymore,
                  kale. this isn't gonna be vacation
                  as usual. i want these washed and
                  the kitchen cleaned by the time i
                  get home.

                              kale
                  that might be difficult.

                              julie
                  well let me make it easier.

     julie goes to the tv, unplugs it.

                              kale
                  that's a little dramatic, isn't it?
                  i'm just gonna plug it back --

     julie suddenly yanks a pair of scissors off kale's desk and
     snips the power cord in half.

                                                (continued)     d.j. caruso

                                                                  17.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  what are you, mental?

                              julie
                      (a very stern tone)
                  one more look at that kitchen and i
                  will be.

     julie picks up her keys and briefcase, pecks kale on the
     forehead, leaves.

                              julie (o.s.) (cont'd)
                  you heard what i said about the
                  lawyer?

                              kale
                  yes!
