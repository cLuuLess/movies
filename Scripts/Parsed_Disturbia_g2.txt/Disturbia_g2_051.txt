54   int. entry hall - late afternoon - moments later                       54

     kale and ronnie quietly approach the door.         ronnie suddenly
     pulls kale back.

                              ronnie
                  don't, it could be her!

                              kale
                  it's not gonna be her.

                                ronnie
                  then stop!    just -- let 'em go away.

     the doorbell rings again.         kale heads to the door.

                                kale
                  i have to.

     kale peeps through the peephole --

     distorted peephole pov - ashley.

     kale calmly turns to ronnie.

                               ronnie
                  what?!   what?! speak.

                                kale
                  it's her.

                              ronnie
                  you're full of --

     ronnie tip-toes to the door. one look at ashley and he covers
     his mouth, grabs kale and pulls him back.

                                ronnie (cont'd)
                  shit shit!!    oh my shit!

     both laugh, giggle, acting "girlie," practically spinning in
     circles as they speak in hushed, panicked whispers:

                              kale
                  she totally saw us --

     the doorbell rings again.         kale heads to the door.

                              ronnie
                  we are so busted. don't answer it!

                              kale
                      (re: his bracelet)
                  dude, she knows i'm here.

     kale swings the door open.     ashley stands there a beat.    her
     arms folded. then --

                              ashley
                  what took you so long?
                      (eyeing ronnie in
                       b.g.)
                  the house isn't that big.

                              kale
                  yeah, no, we were playing upstairs --

     ronnie cringes at how that sounded.

                              ronnie
                      (covering)
                  video games...?

                              kale
                      (awkward beat; then)
                  so... what brings you here.

                               ashley
                  oh.   -- locked out.

                              kale
                  do you need to call anyone?

                              ashley
                  thanks, but i'd rather stay stranded
                  if you don't mind.

     kale and ronnie trade glances.

                               ashley (cont'd)
                  may i?

                              kale
                  uh, sure, come on in --

     ashley steps inside, glances around, checking out the place.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  that's ronnie.

                              ashley
                  nice to meet you. video games, huh?
                      (then suggestively to
                       kale)
                  i like to play.

     kale trades a look with ronnie as ashley nonchalantly heads
     up the stairs.

                                 kale
                  excuse me...
