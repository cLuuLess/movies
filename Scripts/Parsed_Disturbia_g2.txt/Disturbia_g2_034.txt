37   int. kale's bedroom - evening                                      37

     on kale - pacing, on cell phone, pressing an ice-filled
     ziplock back to his head.

                              kale
                      (into phone as needed)
                  okay, fine, but if i'd known --

                              parker (v.o.)
                  kale, first times happen. the
                  officers knew that. but next time
                  they will take you to jail.

     kale flips the phone shut, collapses to the bed --

     prelap - the doorbell rings.
