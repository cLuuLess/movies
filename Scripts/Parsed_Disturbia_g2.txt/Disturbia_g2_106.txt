110   ext. garage roof - night - continuous                                 110

      kale hits hard, the wind knocked out of him. he looks over,
      sees his racketball racket lying there. he grabs it, looks
      back up.

      kale's pov - giles stands on the upper roof, smiles as he
      brings up the letter opener.

      kale's eyes widen. he pulls himself to his feet, and sidearms
      the racket up at giles. the racket spins through the air
      like a boomerang and miraculously smacks giles in the hand,
      knocking the letter opener away!

      with kale - he whirls around, races toward the edge of the
      roof... and jumps.

      angle: following behind kale in mid air, we crane up and
      over him peering down to reveal ashley's pool!

      on the ankle bracelet - it flashes red.
