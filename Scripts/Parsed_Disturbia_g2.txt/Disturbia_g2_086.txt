89   int. living room - night - later                                    89

     kale sits on the sofa, staring off. he looks to the stairs
     as julie and parker head down. parker nods to uniform #3
     who's standing next to kale. uniform #3 meets parker and
     julie at the front door. julie quietly nods to them, opens
     the door. a few more inaudible words are exchanged before
     julie gently closes the door behind them.

     julie heads back into the living room, sits across from kale.

                              julie
                      (a beat; then)
                  i'm sorry, kale.

     not the words kale expected.      he looks up --

                              julie (cont'd)
                  i really am. you know, one thing i
                  always told myself was that no matter
                  what, i would always know what was
                  going on with my kid --

                              kale
                  mom --

                               julie
                  let me finish -- because i have to
                  tell you something...
                      (then)
                  i feel like i let you down. i was
                  too caught up in my own grief to see
                  straight. i thought time would heal
                  this and taking a second job was...
                  the answer to keeping a roof over
                  our heads --

                                                  (continued)   d.j. caruso

                                                                    91.

89   continued:                                                            89

                                 kale
                  it was --

                              julie
                      (points to ceiling)
                  that's just wood. do you hear me?
                  we're still not through this --
                  obviously -- it's gonna take more
                  time -- maybe a lot more time -- and
                  that's just gotta be okay, because i
                  know -- it'll get better.
                      (beat)
                  i want us to be us again. i want us
                  to be honest with each other like we
                  used to be. is that possible?

                              kale
                  yeah. i just -- didn't think you'd
                  believe me --

                              julie
                  listen to me. i am always on your
                  side. no matter what. it may not
                  look like it sometimes, but it's the
                  truth. and we'll get through this.
                  okay?

     kale nods.    he stands, goes to julie and hugs her -- tight.
