124   int. kale's bedroom - weeks later                                        124

      cu - kale intently watches.        then:

                                 kale
                   movement.

      ashley joins him at the window.

      their pov - julie, wearing her realtor business suit, walks
      a young couple up giles' driveway and into the back yard...

                               ashley
                   why's your mom doing this again?

                               kale
                   she's whacked. plain and simple. i
                   think she thought it'd be some sick
                   challenge or something -- hey,
                   commission's the same i guess...

      they watch as julie points out the yard to the couple. the
      couple turns back to the house. julie suddenly spins around
      and gives a quick sotto "thumbs up" to kale and ashley!

                                                                    110.

124   continued:                                                           124

                                kale (cont'd)
                   no way.   she can't be serious.

                               ashley
                   hey, if anyone can spin a psycho
                   house into the opportunity of a
                   lifetime, i'd bet on your mom any
                   day of the week.

                               kale
                       (re: the couple)
                   fine, but we still have to seriously
                   question the yayhoos buying the place.

                               ashley
                   whaddaya think, another stakeout?

                               kale
                       (tossing the binoculars)
                   screw that. my mom has another half
                   hour over there at least.

      kale pulls ashley back to the bed. they kiss, but then
      suddenly stop -- sensing something o.s. they both slowly
      shift their heads to see --

      their pov - ronnie, with a head bandage, stands in the
      doorway, aiming his dv camera straight at them.

                               ronnie
                       (don't mind me)
                   i'm not even here.

      off this we --

                                                         smash to black.
