                   he was my best friend. we always
                   talked about what guys talk about...
                   sports, women... food... we were
                   talking about the freakin' fish --
                   this huge, amazing black bass we'd
                   just caught -- and how we'd be eating
                   it for a week... the next thing i
                   know -- i can't hold on... and he's
                   letting go... i was so pissed at
                               (more)

                               kale (cont'd)
                   him, i was so -- he's the one who
                   left, he's the one who gave up, you
                   know? -- but that's b.s. see, the
                   truth is, my dad -- he saved me.
