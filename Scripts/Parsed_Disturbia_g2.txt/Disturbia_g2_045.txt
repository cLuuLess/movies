48   ext. kale's front yard - the next day                             48

     on kale - now clean-shaven, sitting on the front steps. he
     eyes his watch, then stretches his neck. yawns. then he
     sees something o.s.

48   continued:                                                          48

     kale's pov - peering down the street, ashley's stationwagon
     rounds the corner --

     kale hops to his feet, quickly fixes his hair as the
     stationwagon draws closer.

     kale casually strides into the yard, approaching the kite
     string boundary and mailbox. then -- keeping his feet planted
     in what looks to be a very practiced maneuver, he suddenly
     falls forward against the mailbox. reaches around with his
     free hand, opens the door, going to grab the mail inside
     just as

     ashley

     pulls the car into and up the drive.    she glances at kale
     who nods and smiles back.

     as the stationwagon heads up the driveway, kale tries to
     push himself upright -- but his feet slip. he pitches forward
     more. he glances back over his shoulder, sees ashley getting
     out of the car and looking his way. kale struggles under
     his own weight, trying to keep his feet from crossing the
     line -- he looks back to ashley who's now heading toward
     him. a slight smile crosses kale's face as --

                              ashley
                  can i help you?

                              kale
                  nope, no i'm fine.

                              ashley
                      (helping him up)
                  too late.

                              kale
                  thanks, that was really humiliating.

     ashley reaches in the box, grabs the mail, hands it over.

                              ashley
                  please. i think any pride you had
                  left was gone a while ago.

                              kale
                  oh, you mean that thing with the
                  cops? they had the wrong guy, total
                  foul up. i'm kale by the way.

     ashley nods with a semi-polite smile, starts to head away --

                              kale (cont'd)
                  hey, so -- how'd the move go?


                                                  (continued)   d.j. caruso

                                                                 29.

48   continued:    (2)                                                 48

                                 ashley
                  still going.

                              kale
                  i'd help, but...
                      (re: ankle bracelet)
                  i'm a little spatially challenged at
                  the moment.

     ashley walks closer to kale, checks out his ankle bracelet.

                              ashley
                  yeah, you've kinda got the whole
                  martha stewart thing going on --

                              kale
                      (nodding)
                  but minus the 48-hour allowance for
                  office visits. and no lame
                  "apprentice" spin-off.
                      (off her laugh)
                  so where'd you move from?

                              ashley
                  i'm a city girl. born, raised, and
                  now...
                      (glances around; sighs)
                  forcefully relocated.

                              kale
                  that doesn't sound good.

                              ashley
                  i'm telling you, if i have another
                  clueless jock hit on me or one more
                  soccer mom cuts me off in her oversize
                  suv, i'm gonna go postal.

                              kale
                  oh, sorry, i was just gonna see if
                  you wanted to hop in my hummer and
                  cruise to a kegger.
                      (turning away)
                  nice talking to you.

                              ashley
                      (cracking a smile)
                  wait, i --

                              bonnie (o.s.)
                      (from inside house)
                  ashley? can you come in here, please?

48   continued:    (3)                                                  48

                              ashley
                      (quietly to kale)
                  my mom -- she's very polite, always
                  says "please" but she's got that
                  tone, did you notice?

                              kale
                  i know the tone.

                              ashley
                      (heading away)
                  oh, i'm ashley --

                              kale
                  noticed that, too.

     ashley smiles, disappears inside.    kale's in love.
