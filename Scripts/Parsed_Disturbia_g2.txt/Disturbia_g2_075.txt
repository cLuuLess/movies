78   int. kale's bedroom - night - moments later                           78

     kale quietly enters and shuts the door. he's hiding something
     behind his back as he sits on the bed next to a sleeping
     ashley. she stirs, opens her eyes, peers up at him, smiles.

                                                                     69.

                              kale
                  hey.

                              ashley
                  hey... where have you been?

     kale holds up a folded piece of paper, hands it to ashley.
     she curiously eyes kale, then takes it, opens it to reveal a
     printed-out picture of a long-stem red rose. ashley smiles.

                               kale
                  if would have gone to the flower
                  shop, but --

                              ashley
                  i know.

     ashley pulls kale in for a kiss. she pulls away, falls back
     to the bed. her eyes glance down at kale's ankle bracelet.

                              ashley (cont'd)
                  so how much longer?

                              kale
                  oh, two months, twelve days, nineteen
                  hours give or take.

     a beat as the two peer into each other's eyes.       then:

                              kale (cont'd)
                  you know the other night... when you
                  said you thought i'd be more messed
                  up...

                              ashley
                  ...for a guy who killed his teacher.

                              kale
                  i didn't kill my --

                              ashley
                  shhh.
                      (kisses him again)
                  i know. -- i know.

     we get the impression she knows a lot. kale leans in for
     another kiss. but this time, as they lock lips, ashley's
     eyes shoot open.

     her pov - the first hints of daylight out the window.

                              ashley (cont'd)
                  oh my god, what time is it?



                                                (continued)       d.j. caruso

                                                                      70.

                              kale
                  three-thirty.

                              ashley
                  i've gotta go.

     ashley scrambles out of bed for her clothes, getting dressed,
     searching for her shirt. kale spots it behind the bed. as
     he gets up to retrieve it, he hears a noise o.s. kale peers
     out the window --

     his pov - giles is dragging a heavy blue plastic bag down
     the stairs leading to the garage.

                              kale
                  you better see this.

     ashley throws on her shoes, joins kale at the window.

     their pov - giles pulls the bag into the garage next to what
     we presume is the mustang that's now been covered with a
     tarp. (note: the woman's car is still in the driveway.)

     kale grabs the binoculars.

     binocular pov - we catch a glimpse of a few crimson red smears
     on the blue bag as giles heaves it behind the mustang.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  look, quick --

                              ashley
                  what?

     kale gives her the binoculars.      ashley looks over.

                              ashley (cont'd)
                      (sarcastic)
                  that's normal.

     giles' garage door closes.

                              kale
                      (re: woman's car)
                  her car... still hasn't moved...

     ashley pauses, peers out the window again.      she can't help
     but be a little concerned. then --

                              ashley
                  so what do you wanna do?

     off kale --
