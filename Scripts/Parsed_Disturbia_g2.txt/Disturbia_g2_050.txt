53   int. dad's office - the next day                                   53

     on kale - sitting in the leather chair, binoculars raised.

     on the floor next to the chair is a 7-11 bag, a slurpee cup,
     a bag of beef jerky and an automotive magazine with a mustang
     on the cover.

     binocular pov - ashley sits on the roof leaning against her
     closed window. she's reading lolita.

                              ronnie (o.s.)
                  so you don't know what year the
                  mustang is?

     reveal ronnie - sitting at dad's computer looking at the
     fbi's official website.

                              kale
                      (now flipping through
                       magazine)
                  '65 or '66, couldn't tell.

                              ronnie
                  check this out. the feds think your
                  missing girl might be related to
                  three murders in austin. all
                  redheads.

     kale processes that as we suddenly hear a car door slam o.s.

     binocular pov - kale tilts down to see ashley's mom backing
     out the driveway. kale tilts up to ashley's window -- ashley
     ducks back inside her room, disappears.

                              kale
                  movement.

     binocular pov - kale tilts down to the pool, sees ashley
     emerging from the house with a towel that she throws on the
     lounge chair.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  better late than never.

     ronnie joins kale at the window.

     their pov - ashley flips her sandals off one at a time, pulls
     her tank off revealing her bronzed back and bikini top.

                              ronnie
                  dude...

     ashley slinks out of her shorts revealing a "near-thong"
     bikini this time.

                              ronnie (cont'd)
                  dude!!

                              kale
                      (re: bikini)
                  that's definitely new.

     ashley crouches down, runs her fingers through the water.

                              ronnie
                  oh, it's so warm, baby...

     ashley cups her hands, scoops a handful of water from the
     pool, splashes her face... runs her hands through her hair...
     she stands, takes a deep breath, holds it -- then exhales...

                              ronnie (cont'd)
                  cleansing breath...

     ashley stretches her arms high above her head.

                              ronnie (cont'd)
                  concentrate now. this is for the
                  gold.

     ronnie grabs the binoculars from kale, puts them to his eyes,
     moves closer to the window -- but his zoomed-in vision causes
     him to underestimate the distance -- thwump. the end of the
     binoculars hit the window just as ashley dives into the pool --
     ronnie and kale hit the deck as we hear the splash o.s.

                              kale
                  jackass!

                              ronnie
                  dude, there's no way she heard that.

                              kale
                  dick, my deaf aunt in omaha heard
                  that.

     kale grabs the binoculars from ronnie.

     binocular pov - ashley's underwater at the far end of the
     pool. she tucks and pushes off the wall, swims back...

                              ronnie
                      (peering out)
                  she's got great lung capacity.

     on ashley - she suddenly surfaces, hoists herself from the
     water. she spins and sits on the ledge, rings the water
     from her hair. but she suddenly stops -- and shifts her
     gaze up toward kale and ronnie!

                              kale
                      (pulling ronnie down)
                  i think she saw me --

                              ronnie
                  there's no way --

     ronnie grabs the binoculars back.

                              ronnie (cont'd)
                      (re: ashley o.s.)
                  okay, maybe she did.

                                kale
                  seriously?

     kale peeks out --

     their pov - ashley's slipping back into her shorts and tank
     top. she heads to the back door, tries the knob. locked.
     over this, ronnie turns to kale:

                              ronnie
                  her swims always that short?

                              kale
                      (growing concern)
                  no, she usually takes her time --

     they turn back.     ashley's gone.

                              ronnie
                  now where is she?

     the doorbell rings.       kale and ronnie freeze.   then --

                                                                      36.

                  kale                               ronnie
       no.                                  no.
