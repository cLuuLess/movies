79   int. kale's bedroom - day - later                                  79

     on kale - holding up a universal garage door remote still in
     the package.

     ashley and ronnie are on the bed. note: kale is wearing the
     same clothes he was yesterday, the stubble coming back.
     hair more disheveled, eyes a little puffier...

                              kale
                  phase one, steal his code from his
                  opener.

                              ronnie
                  there's more than one phase?

                              kale
                  there's only two. now look, his
                  remote's in the glove compartment of
                  his toyota. all you have to do is
                  pop it open and read me the switch
                  settings. "on" or "off."

                              ronnie
                  for the later purpose of doing what?
                  breaking in to his house?

                              kale
                  no, not breaking in. we're just
                  talking about having access to his
                  garage so we can go in on our own
                  time - when he's not there - to
                  just... to get a closer look at the
                  car, the bag --

                              ronnie
                      (to ashley)
                  all this sounds reasonable to you?

                              ashley
                  i don't know about that, but --

                              kale
                      (re: universal remote)
                  this is good up to thirteen digits --

                              ronnie
                      (realizing)
                  how long have you been planning this?

     ronnie eyes kale with concern.    kale doesn't answer.

                                                 (continued)   d.j. caruso

                                                                  72.

79   continued:                                                         79

     giles suddenly fires up his lawnmower o.s.

     kale's pov - giles pushes the mower around the side of the
     house to the front yard.

                              kale
                  look, if we're gonna do this, it's
                  gotta be now. he takes twenty-one
                  minutes average to mow his front
                  yard... you'll be hearing him the
                  whole time...

     ashley grabs the remote.

                                ashley
                  i'll do it.

                                ronnie
                  no.
                      (beat; then grabbing
                       the remote)
                  it isn't safe.
                      (getting up; macho)
                  let's do it.
