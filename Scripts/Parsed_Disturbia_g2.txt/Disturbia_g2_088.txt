91   int. kale's bedroom - night - short time later                       91

     kale and ronnie watch the video of ronnie's break-in.      they're
     cracking themselves up as we see --

     on the tv - ronnie's feet stumbling through the garage, the
     camera sliding away off the trunk of the mustang, ronnie
     diving for it.

                              ronnie
                  hey, i caught that.

                              kale
                  so that's when the garage door started
                  closing.

                              ronnie
                  yeah, he must have heard me. he
                  came through the inside door --
                      (re: tv screen)
                  this is where i ducked low and
                  started...

     on the tv - ronnie's feet start motoring across the concrete
     floor, racing through the doorway onto the hardwood floor...

                              ronnie (cont'd)
                  ...hauling aaaass...

                              kale
                  that's great.

     on the tv - as before, we're mostly watching ronnie's feet
     as they scamper around giles' house. then -- the camera
     falls away, slides across the floor toward that bookcase,
     its pov -- for a split second - aiming under the bookcase.

                                ronnie
                  dropped it.

                              kale
                  yeah, i lost signal --

     on the tv - this we didn't see earlier -- the camera is
     quickly scooped up by ronnie whose feet dart across giles'
     entry hall floor toward the front door.

                                                (continued)     d.j. caruso

                                                                 95.

91   continued:                                                        91

     we see ronnie's hand reach for the knob.

                              ronnie
                  but i never leave evidence behind.

     on the tv - ronnie's feet dart out giles' front door and
     into the darkness of the yard...

                               ronnie (cont'd)
                  and that's about when you started
                  yelling bloody murder and the shit
                  hit the fan.

     the tv screen goes black.

                              ronnie (cont'd)
                      (getting up)
                  i'm starving. all that running
                  around...

     ronnie heads from the room.

                              kale
                      (re: video)
                  i'm gonna burn this.

     kale gets up, heads to the camera. about to eject the tape,
     when a thought stops him. he pulls the camera off the tv,
     sits on the floor, presses "play", scans back through the
     tape.

     on the tv - the same footage. nothing glaring stands out.
     the camera falls from ronnie's hand, slides to the bookcase.
     ronnie quickly scoops the camera up, keeps running...

                              kale (cont'd)
                  you're not fooling me, giles...

     kale scans the tape back again, this time just to the point
     where ronnie drops the camera.

     on kale - his eyes suddenly narrow -- did he see something?

     kale scans back again.
