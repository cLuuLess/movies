90   int. kale's bedroom - night - later                                   90

     kale enters amidst a few more lightning flashes and distant
     rolls of thunder. he heads to his window, glances out at
     giles' house. dark. the wind's picking up. kale closes
     his window, draws the shade, sticks his cell in the charger.

     he collapses to the bed,      stares at the roof over his head
     for a beat -- then "like      a virgin" suddenly blares on his
     cell phone. kale stares       at it... then jumps from his bed,
     races to the phone, rips      it from the charger, flips it open --

     on the phone's lcd screen - a text message: look at your
     screen. the lcd screen suddenly blacks out. the battery's
     dead.

     a wide eyed kale puts the cell phone on his desk, slowly
     shifts his gaze to his computer monitor -- a grainy image
     suddenly pops on -- shaky at first -- then it finally
     steadies, and clears up. a torso and face come into focus:
     ronnie, lying in the corner of a very enclosed space. eyes
     open, head tilted against the wall. dead.

                                 kale
                  oh my god --

                                                                  92.

90   continued:                                                         90

     nearly hyperventilating, kale leans closer to the screen,
     sees a pile of clothes and a stray racketball trophy lying
     next to ronnie.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  shit --

     kale realizes -- ronnie's in his closet. kale slowly turns,
     eyes his closet door. he then steps toward it, reaches out --
     and slides the closet door open to reveal --

     ronnie - lying dead in the corner.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  ronnie --

     kale kneels down to ronnie who suddenly pops back to life!

                              ronnie
                  boo!

     kale screams, falls back to the floor as ronnie cracks up.

     more lightning flashes and thunder.

     kale staggers to his feet. stunned. not knowing whether to
     hug ronnie or beat the shit out of him.

                              ronnie (cont'd)
                  dude, don't kill me, don't kill me --
                  i can explain --

                              kale
                  how -- how long have you been here?

                              ronnie
                  you should have seen your face --
                      (off kale's glare)
                  i got out his front door. i got
                  lucky. i heard you yelling, but
                  dude, cops were everywhere --

                              kale
                  still, you could have --

                              ronnie
                  what, popped out and said, "oh yeah,
                  officers, my friend's right, i was
                  just in that house, i'd gone to get
                  my cell phone out of the guy's car i
                  broke into earlier..." are you
                  kidding me?

                                                                  93.

90   continued:    (2)                                                  90

                              kale
                      (beat; then)
                  i get it.

     kale paces around, runs a hand through his hair as ronnie
     steps out of the closet, dv cam in hand.

                              ronnie
                  dude, i am sorry. can we just...
                  hug it out?

                              kale
                  why didn't giles tell the cops someone
                  broke in? i mean, he did see you,
                  right?

                              ronnie
                  you know, let's be positive for a
                  change. i thought he did, but maybe
                  he didn't. or maybe he's a nice guy
                  afterall, and he didn't wanna make a
                  big deal of it, you know? i mean,
                  he's a guy, he was a kid once...

     kale eyes ronnie.

                              kale
                  what if he wasn't always a guy?

     ronnie eyes kale for a beat, wondering if he's serious.
     then kale cracks a smile. ronnie cracks up.

                              ronnie
                  but i do have to ask... what was in
                  the bag?

                              kale
                      (as if it were obvious)
                  dead deer.

     kale and ronnie lock eyes a beat. then crack up again.
     both laugh hysterically, slap happy as hell.

                               ronnie
                  naturally...
                      (re: dv cam)
                  hey, you want more evidence,
                  detective?

                              kale
                  i was watching, remember?

     kale grabs the dv cam from ronnie -- ronnie pulls it away.

                              ronnie
                  no, no, this is comedy, it deserves
                  big screen treatment.

     ronnie grabs some wires, starts hooking the camera up to
     kale's tv.

                                                           time cut to:
