    kale's attractive mom, julie, 40, on cordless, preps dinner.

                             julie
                 you're kidding. so i can actually
                 put the burgers away this time?

                             kale
                 yes, be gone with the red meat!

    julie smiles.    jeff grabs the phone from kale.

                             jeff
                     (into phone as needed)
