66   int. kale's bedroom - day - later                                    66

     ashley sits on the bed. she looks damned good, too.        dolled
     up, lipstick. she's just heard the story from kale.

                              kale
                  i know, he's a total freak, right?

                              ashley
                  and very vague... did he genuinely
                  mean it was nice meeting you or was
                  he sending you a "sinister message?"

                              kale
                  are you messing with me?

                              ashley
                  maybe a little. did you even notice
                  my hair?

                              kale
                  so you think it's all a coincidence.
                  we've got the car --

                              ashley
                  with the non dent dent --

                              kale
                  the bumper sticker, the argument,
                  the staring contest -- and now he's
                  showing up in my kitchen --

                              ashley
                  why, because he slashed your mom's
                  tire?

                                                                 61.

                                kale
                  maybe.

     ashley rolls her eyes.

                              kale (cont'd)
                      (pointing out window)
                  her car hasn't moved.

                              ashley
                  it's called "the day after," kale.
                  nobody moves after a night like that.

                              kale
                  well what if she's really "not
                  moving?" what if she's tied in the
                  dungeon with the other girl, starving
                  to death --

                              ashley
                      (getting up)
                  then come up with a rescue plan and
                  get back to me.

                              kale
                  you're leaving?

                                ashley
                  have to.    party.

                                kale
                  whose?

                                ashley
                  uh, mine?

                              kale
                  how is that possible?

                                ashley
                  excuse me?

                              kale
                  well, i mean... sorry, i just didn't
                  think you knew anybody --

                              ashley
                  i don't, i didn't --
                      (off kale's confusion)
                  i met this girl earlier, minnie tyco?

                              kale
                  oh my god, "skinny psycho?!" i sat
                  next to that bitch in spanish --

                              ashley
                      (skipping that one)
                  i told her my parents were outta
                  town --

                              kale
                  and now the whole neighborhood's
                  coming.

                              ashley
                  look, i'm stuck here. so i figured
                  i can either shut myself in and keep
                  hating it or... try to make the most
                  of it.

                              kale
                  hey, i get it. you don't have to
                  explain.

                              ashley
                  kale, you're welcome to come, but --

     kale looks at ashley, realizes what she's referring to as he
     glances down to the ankle bracelet.

                              kale
                      (with attitude)
                  well, i appreciate the thought.
                  really.

                              ashley
                      (returning the tude)
                  glad to hear it.

     ashley turns to leave.

                              kale
                  it's funny, though.

                              ashley
                      (turning back)
                  what?

                              kale
                  i didn't peg you as a conformist.

     ashley glares, furious. she picks up the dv cam and
     binoculars, approaches kale, hands them over with:

                              ashley
                  try to keep these in your drawers
                  tonight, will ya?

     ashley leaves.      a sullen kale stares after her --
