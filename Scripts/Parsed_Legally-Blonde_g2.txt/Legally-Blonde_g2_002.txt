    int. elle's delta gamma room - day - continuous                   2


    the card slides into the pink room, hitting the feet of
    underdog, a tiny chihuahua ~ who picks it up in his mouth
    and trots it over to a pair of perfectly pedicured feet in
    strappy sandals.

    an equally perfectly manicured hand with a "sisters forever"
    charm bracelet dangling from the wrist, scoops up underdog.

    as he rises, we rise with him, passing toned, waxed, tanned
    legs in pink prada pedal pushers and a pair of perky boobs
    encased in a spaghetti-strap top -- until we finally reveal a
    magnificent head of long blonde hair and a sweet, beautiful
    face. this is elle woods, 21, the goddess queen of delta
    gamma. she talks on a pink, fuzzy phone.

                        elle

                  (into the phone)
              i love you, too!
    behind her, a "go usc" banner is pinned to the pink wall. a
    stack of "cosmopolitan"s and "glamour"s teeters on the
    dresser. the closet overflows with trendy, designer clothes
    in a predominance of pink.

                        elle (cont'd)

                  (continuing; into phone)
              i'll see you tonight.
    she hangs up and lets out a squeal of joy, kissing underdog's
    head and taking the card out of his mouth. she reads it,
    touched.

                        elle (cont'd)

                  (continuing)
              "elle and warner forever". aww...
    underdog yips.

                                                                   2
