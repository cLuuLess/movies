      as the reporters continue to mob brooke, elle steps aside to            
      talk to serena and margot.                                   .          

                          serena

                i wish we could stay longer, but i have a
                game.

                          elle

                i can't believe you're a laker girl!


                           margot

                hello!   you're like, a lawyer.


                           elle

                     (grinning)
                not yet.

      enid walks up to the girls.


                           enid

                     (to elle)
                even though you knew your shit today --
                you're still a product of the patriarchy
                and a creation of the male-dominated
                media. and so are your friends.

      she looks at serena.

                           enid (cont'd)                                      

                     (continuing; to serena)
                although -- you're kinda hot. call me.

      she walks off.   serena looks alarmed.


                           elle

                     (hugging them)
                don't worry. she's harmless. i'll see
                you guys soon! thanks for coming!
      she air-kisses them as margot leads a still shell-shocked
      serena away as emmett walks up to elle.
