     professor stromwell is in front of the class.

                          professor stromwell

                so you've filed a claim. now what?
     she looks over to see elle sitting there, typing on her
     laptop.

                          professor stromwell (cont'd)

                    (continuing)
               ms. woods?

                          elle

                don't you also need to have evidence?



                                                         (continued)





                                                                   54.

                          professor stromwell

               meaning?
     everyone now stares at elle.


                        'elle

               meaning you need -- reasonable belief
               that your claim would have, like,
               evidentiary support?

     stromwell is somewhat impressed, but doesn't show it.


                          professor stromwell

               and what kind of evidentiary support does
               this case require? let's ask mr.
               harriman, who clearly believes that i
               might be hungry.
     she looks up at arrogant aaron in the back row. who
     unknowingly has "eat me" written on his forehead. he looks
     back at her, confused, as the students around him snicker.
