39   int. law school hallway - day                                      39

     elle heads for a classroom, amidst a crowd of students who
     eye her like she's an alien. she rounds a corner, seeing --

     warner, in all his handsome glory, looking over his schedule.
     she starts toward him, as if pulled by a magnetic force.
     arrogant aaron sees her passing by.


                             arrogant aaron

                      (seductively)
               h l o t e e. . . . . . .
                el hr.

     elle keeps going, not even noticing him. eyes only for
     warner. arrogant aaron stomps away, pissed at the perceived
     blow-off.

     as elle gets closer to warner, she opts for wandering past
     him, seemingly oblivious to his presence.


                          warner

                    (stunned)
               elle?!

     elle turns, ultra-nonchalant.


                          elle

               warner?! oh my god, i completely forgot
               you were going here!

     he looks at her, confused.    people walk by, staring.


                         warner

               what're you talking about? you're not
               here to see me?


                            elle

               no, silly.    i go here.


                          warner

                    (still confused)
               you go where?

                      uh -- sure.
            she sashays off with a confident smile.
