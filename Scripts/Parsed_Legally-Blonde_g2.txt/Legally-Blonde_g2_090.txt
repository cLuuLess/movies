     donovan, the interns, and associates sit at a large table.


                          gerard

               she's screwing the pool boy.

     elle gasps and makes a face.


                         elle

               there is no way a delta gamma would sleep
               with a man in a shiny shirt. warner,
               back me up here.

     warner shrugs, embarrassed.    sarah looks at donovan.


                          sarah

               i hate to agree ~ but i don't see the
               two of them actually --
                    (wrinkling her nose)
               -- doing it.


                                                           (continued)

                          enid

                women like that will screw anything.

                           elle

                so, because she's beautiful and has a good                
                body, she's easy? what book of feminist                   
                theory did you read iiiai in, enid?                       
     emmett jumps in before war breaks out.                               

                          emmett

                okay, if brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?

                           elle

                my money's on the angry daughter or the
                ex-wife.

                           donovan

                chutney has a trust fund. she didn't
                need the insurance payoff or the
                inheritance.

                          bobby

                what about her mother?

                           donovan

                covered. she was in aspen at the time.
                ten people saw her downing cosmopolitans
                at the caribou club.

                           elle

                al l i know is-- it's not brooke.

                           donovan

                that's touching, elle, but we need an
                alibi.
     elle thinks about this.
