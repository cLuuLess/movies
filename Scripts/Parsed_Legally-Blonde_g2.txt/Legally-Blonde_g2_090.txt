     enrique, 25, latino and hunky as hell, sits in the seat that
     chutney has vacated.

               what did you see when you entered the
               house?

                          enrique

               i saw mrs. windham standing over the body
               of mr. windham.

                          donovan

               was she carrying a weapon?


                        Â· enrique

               no, she was crying her eyes out.

     donovan smiles.

                          donovan

               so she was distraught that her husband
               was dead?


                          enrique

               oh, yes. mrs. windham is the most sweet,
               wonderful woman i know. i have loved her
               since the day she hired me. she could
               never do something this awful. i know
               this because we are very close.

     the others shift uncomfortably, then look at each other. then.,
     back at enrique and his shiny, unbuttoned-to-show-his-pecs
     shirt. the da smiles.
