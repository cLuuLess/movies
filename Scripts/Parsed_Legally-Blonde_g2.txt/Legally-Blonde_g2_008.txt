    warner pulls up in front. it's a starry, romantic night.
    everything should be perfect. it's not.
    elle sits, still in shock, as tears continue to eke out.

                             warner

                  elle, believe me, i never expected to be
                  doing this, but i think it's the right
                  thing to do.

                         elle

               how can it be the right thing if we're
               not together?

                         warner .

               i have to think about my future. and what
               people expect from me.

                          elle

               so you're breaking up with me because
               you're afraid your family won't like me?
                    (through her tears)
               everybody likes me!

               east coast people are different.

                          elle

               just because i ' m not a vanderbilt, all of
               a sudden i ' m white trash? i grew up in
               bel air, warner! across the street from
               aaron spelling! i think most people
               would agree that's way better than a
               vanderb ilt --

                         warner

               i told you, elle.       i need someone --
               serious.

                          elle

               i ' m seriously in love with you -- isn't
               that enough? he looks away.

                              warner

               i ' m sorry.
     she gets out of the car and drags herself up the stairs to
     her sorority house. when she's at the top, she turns back to
     look at him. his perfect cheekbones highlighted by the
     streetlamp.
     he meets her eyes, pained, but determined.       then pulls away,
     leaving her there.
