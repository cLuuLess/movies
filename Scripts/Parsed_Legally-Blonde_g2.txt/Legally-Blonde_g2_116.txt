      elle stomps out of the elevator, as emmett gets in.


                           emmett

      she marches past.   he follows, catching up.                             

                          emmett

                whoa -- why?

                          elle

                law school was a mistake.   getting this
                internship was a mistake.

                          emmett

                what're you talking about? you earned
                it-
      she snorts.

                          elle

                i didn't earn anything. i got this
                internship because donovan liked the way
                i looked. which he made clear .tonight                         
                when he tried to feel me up.                                   
      emmett looks pissed as he processes this.





                                                            (continued)

                          emmett

                    (mind reeling)
                so now you're --?

                           emmett

                are? the hell with donovan. stay.                           

      she stops, giving him a sad smile.                                    


                          elle

                you're ever in california.                                  

      she walks out.   emmett watches her go, hating it.
