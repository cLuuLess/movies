95   int. austen, platt, jaret & donovan - library - day            95


     the associates and interns sit at a table piled high with
     research, as donovan goes over his notes.


                           donovan

..              we've got two interviews tomorrow that
                dick and bobby are gonna handle, and the
                ex-wife in an hour.
     he looks up.


                           donovan (cont'd)

                     (continuing)
                sarah, can you grab me some coffee?

     sarah rises, and fetches the coffee from the side table.


                            donovan (cont'd)

                     (continuing)
                and according to this communique from the
                prison, our client apparently had a visit
                fr om her sister? a miss delta gamma --
     he looks at elle.


                           donovan (cont'd)

                     (continuing)
                anyone you know?

     elle looks up, caught.   the others looks at her.


                           elle

                i went to get her alibi.

     emmett looks over, surprised.



                                                            (continued)





                                                                   77,

                           donovan

                did you get it?


                             elle

                        but i can't tell you what it is.
                yes.

     the others can't believe this.

                           donovan

                why the hell not?

                         ' elle

                i promised her i ' d keep it secret. i
                can't break the bonds of sisterhood!

     now he's pissed.

                           donovan

                fuck sisterhood. this is a murder trial,
                not some scandal at the sorority house.
                i want the alibi.

     sarah sets donovan's coffee down.     watching to see what elle
     will do.


                          elle

                i can't give it to you. all i can tell
                you is that she's innocent.

     an assistant pokes her head in the room.


                           assistant

                mr. donovan? mrs. windham vandermark is
                on line two.

     donovan rises, still annoyed.


                           donovan

                someone reason with her while i take
                this.

     he walks out.     the others look at elle.


                          bobby

                are you crazy? tell him the alibi.


                            elle

              , no!


                           dick

                we're gonna lose the case if you don't.




                                                           (continued)





                                                                       78.

                           elle

                then we're not very good lawyers.

     emmett hides a smile.     warner leans over to elle.   sarah is
     nearby, listening. Â·

                           warner

                     (quietly)
                if you tell him, you'll probably make
                summer associate. who cares.about brooke?
                think about yourself.


                           elle

                i gave her my word, warner.

     sarah watches -- seeing both warner and elle in a different
     light.

     donovan storms back in.


                           donovan

                the ex-wife seems to be unconcerned with
                the fact that her interview is today.
                she's at a spa in the berkshires.                             


                           gerard

                a spa?
                     (to elle)
                isn't that like, your mother-ship?
     elle shrugs and looks at donovan.


                          elle                 .

                i can go if you want.

                           enid

                why you?


                           gerard

                     (to enid)
                have you ever been to a spa?


                            enid

                and subscribe to the doctrine of self-
                hatred imposed upon my gender by male                         
                delusions of the way women are supposed
                to look?                                                      
                     (beat)                                                   .

     donovan motions toward elle. then looks at emmett with a                 
     pointed "get the alibi" look.



                                                            (continued)

                           donovan

                go with her.
