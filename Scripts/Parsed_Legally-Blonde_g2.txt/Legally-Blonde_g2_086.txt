      donovan sits at a long table, next to brooke, a pretty 26-
     .year-old blonde with a perfect body and a sad face. the
      interns and associates sit at the far end of the table taking
      notes. a cop stands guard at the door.


                                donovan

                     what alibi?

     '       ·.       .'


                                brooke

                     i can't tell you.

                      '        donovan

                     you understand you're on trial for
                     murder ?


                               brooke

                     i didn't do it! i walked in, saw my
                     husband lying on the floor, bent down to
                     check his heart, screamed my head off and
                     chutney and enrique ran inside.


                               donovan

                     where they saw you standing over the body
                     covered in his blood.
         she glares at him.

                               brooke

                     why would i kill my husband?

                               donovan

                     insurance? a love affair? pure
                     unadulterated hatred? believe me, the da
                     will come up with plenty of reasons.


                                                                 (continued)

                  he was thirty-four years older than you.
                  that doesn't sound so good to a jury.

     now she's pissed.

                             brooke

                  then show them a picture of his cock.
                  they might put a few things together.

     everyone stiffens except for ell.e, who laughs out loud.


                             donovan    ,   .

                  brooke, i believe you. but a jury is
                  gonna want an alibi.


                            brooke

                  i can't give you that. and if you put me
                  on the stand, i'll lie.

     donovan takes a moment to look at her like she's an idiot.


                             donovan

                  were you with another man?


                             brooke

                  go to hell.


                             donovan

                  i'll take that as a no.


                             brooke

                  are we done for today?


                             donovan

                  i believe we are.
     he stands.    as do his minions.      as they file out, brooke sees
     elle.


                             brooke

                  hey -- i know you.

     elle perks up.
