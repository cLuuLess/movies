7   ext. the ivy - night


    warner and elle are seated at a cozy table on the patio.
    elle takes a sip from her freshly poured champagne flute.
    nervous and excited.

                          elle

               here' s to ~ us.
    warner is slower to sip his.

                         warner

               the reason i wanted to come here tonight
               was to discuss our future.
    elle is on the edge of her seat.

                          elle

               i ' m fully amenable to that discussion.

                         warner

              i mean, we're having a lot of fun now --
              but things are gonna be different when
              i ' m at harvard law school is a completely
              different world. i need to be serious.

                            elle

               of course.

                            warner

              my family expects a lot from me. and i
              expect a lot from me. i .plan on running
              for office some day.

                         elle

              and i fully support that.





                                                          (continued)





                                                                     8.

                          wa r n er

               but the thing is, if i ' m gonna be a
               senator by the time i ' m thirty -- i can't
               keep dicking around.

                         elle

               i completely agree.

                           warner

               t hat 's why i think it's time for us to--
     elle takes a deep breath, filled with anticipation.

                           warner (cont'd)

                   ( ot n ig . . · > . ' .
                    c n iu n )
               i think we should break up.
     elle's champagne glass drops from her hand and crashes onto
     the patio.

                          elle

              what?
    elle starts to flush, completely caught off guard.

                          warner

               i ' m sorry, elle, i just --

                          elle

               you're breaking up with me?!
                    (tearing up)
               i thought you were proposing.

                         warner

               proposing?! elle, if i ' m going to be a
               politician, i need to marry a jackie, not
               a -- marilyn.

                             elle

                    (stunned)
               you're breaking up with me because i ' m
               too -- blonde?

                           warner

               t hat' s not entirely --

                         elle

               then what? my boobs are too big?

                          warner.

               elle -- no --· your boobs are fine --
    her tears start.


                                                          (con tinued )





                                                                  .9.

                                                                         i

                  (2)


    continu ed:



                             elle

                  so when you said you'd always love me,
                  you were just "dicking around"?
    warner looks around the restaurant nervously.

                             warner

                  i do love you, elle. i just can't marry you.
                  you have no idea the pressure i ' m under. my
                  family has five generations of senators. my
                  brother is in the top three at yale law. he                ·
                  just got engaged to a vanderbilt, for crissakes.            
    elle stares at him aghast, tears streaming down her face,
    then pushes her chair away from the table and walks out.

                             warner (cont'd)

                       (continuing)
                  it's not like i have a choice, sweetheart                  

    he follows her out.
