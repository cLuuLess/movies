      he's behind his desk. he motions for her to sit in one of
      the two chairs opposite him.

                               donovan

                 sit down.

                           elle

                 is everything okay?

                          donovan

        .       were right on target. i should"ve
                listened.

                              elle

                        (stunned)
                   thank you.

                               donovan

                   ab ou t the alibi --
      she sighs,

                              elle

                   i ' m sorry, but --

                               donovan

                         (cutting her off)
                   i ' m impressed that you took the
                   initiative to go there and get it. that's
                   what makes a good lawyer. and on top of
                   that, you gained the client's trust and
                   kept it.. that' s what makes a great
                   lawyer. you're smart, elle. smarter than             ··   .
                   most of the guys i have on my payroll.                     
      elle is overwhelmed by his praise.

                             elle

                   wow. that means so much to me to hear you
                   say that.
      donovan walks around his desk and sits in the chair opposite
      her.

                             donovan

                   i think it's time discuss your career                      
                   path. have you thought about where you                     
                   might be a summer associate?

                               elle

                         (still overwhelmed)
                   not really. i know how competitive it       .   ·.
                   a l l is --
      he smiles.

                             donovan

                   you know what competition is really
                   about, don't you?
      eager for his knowledge, elle is on the edge of her seat. he            
      leans in.

                        (continuing)
                   it's about ferocity. carnage.                              

                              (more)

                                                                       100.

                             donovan (cont'd)

                  balancing human intelligence with animal                        
                  diligence. knowing exactly what you want                        
                  and how far you'll go to get it. how far                        
                  will elle go?                                                   
      as he says the last sentence, he slides his hand up her

      thigh.

      sarah walks down the hallway, glancing in donovan's office to see --

      h e r pov --


      donovan's hand sliding up elle's skirt.         she shakes her head
      in disgust, & heads off- not seeing
