     elle slumps down in an inflatable chair, hugging her knees
     and cowering in a wretched little ball. underdog stares at
     her, concerned.
     serena and margot stand in the door.

                          margot

                elle?

                          serena

                where's the rock?

                          elle                                            ·.

                what?!

                he broke up with me!                                         
     serena and margot gasp in horror, rushing to her side.                  

                          serena

                is it a kappa?

                          margot

                it's not a theta --

                           elle

                no -- it's just -- not me.

                          elle

                thank you, serena, but i don't think
                it'll do any good.

                            serena

                  what happened?

     elle starts to lose it again.

                      ;       elle

                  i don't know! everything was normal at
                  first and then he said he needed someone
                  mo r e --

                  maybe it's the grandmother.        have you
                  e v e r me t he r ?
     e l l e wipes her face.

                            elle

                  last month on his birthday. and she
                  liked me! she said i looked like britney
                  spears. why would you say that to
                  someone you didn't like?

     they shrug, mystified.


                             serena

                  how could this happen?

                  i don't know! i don't know anything any

                  i just need to be by myself.


                            serena

                  are you sure?

     elle nods.    the girls rise, hugging her.

                  thank you. i love you, too.
       as they go, margot looks at serena.

                             margot

                  oh, god. what if josh doesn't think i ' m
                  serious enough?    .

                  you're right. phew!
       as the girls go, they shut the door behind them.
       elle gets up and grabs a framed photo of warner, then lies
       down on her bed, clutching it to her heart. underdog leaps
       up and gives her little doggy kisses.
