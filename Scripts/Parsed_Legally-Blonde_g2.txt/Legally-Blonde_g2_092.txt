     elle sits at a conference table with her basket. a door
     opens and a female guard brings brooke into the room. wearing
     a horribly tacky orange jumpsuit.

                          elle

                are you okay? you look so sad...and so
.               orange.

                            brooke

                i ' m glad it's you and not donovan.

                 .          elle

                he means well.      he's really brilliant and
                all.
     brooke sits, not looking convinced.

                           brooke

                he better be, for what i ' m paying him.
     elle pushes her basket forward.

                          elle

                i brought you some necessities. pink
                sheets. aromatherapy candles. loofah.
                and the bible.
     she holds up a "cosmopolitan".

                          brooke

                you're an angel.
     elle squirms in her seat.





                                                            (continued)





                                                                   75.

                           elle

                but i have to tell you the real reason
                i ' m here. professor donovan says we
                really, really need your alibi.

     brooke tears up.


                           brooke

                elle, i can't. you don't understand.


                           elle

                who could better understand than me?

     brooke dabs her eyes with a corner of the pink ralph lauren
     sheets.


                           brooke

                it's so shameful...


                          elle

                whatever it is -- it could save you.

                          brooke

                that's just it -- it would ruin me!

                           elle

                how?

     brooke composes herself. takes a deep breath. looks at elle.

                           brooke

                i have made my fortune on my ability to
                teach women how to perfect their bodies
                with the brooke's butt buster workout.

                           elle

                i know!   you helped me go from a six to a
                four!
     brooke starts to cry again.

                          brooke

                on the day of heyworth's murder, i was --
     she snorts back a sob.

                           brooke (cont'd)

                     (continuing)
                -- getting liposuction.
     elle gasps.



                                                          (continued)





                                                                    76.

                           elle

                no!


                            brooke

                      (completely shamed)
                i ' m a fraud! but it's not like normal
                people can have this ass! if my fans
                knew, i ' d lose everything. i've already
                lost my husband. i rather be in jail
                then lose my reputation!

     elle hugs her to her chest, consoling her.


                           elle

                your secret is safe with me.
