     a downscale, blue-collar salon, with five hair chairs and two        
     manicure stations. old ladies and young waitresses get perms.        
     paulette --early 40s, lower-middle class, hard-edged, plus-          
     sirzed -- looks up as a defeated elle sinks into the manicure        
     chair.(the manicure station is plastered with pictures of            
     rufus, a big, slobbering pit-bull). ·

     elle holds out her hands. paulette dips them into a dish of
     soapy water.

               greek week to study for the lsats, i
               completely neglected my homecoming queen
               duties, i hired a coppola to direct my
               admissions video -- all so i could get my
               boyfriend warner back and now he's                           
               engaged to this awful girl sarah so it

     man in his late 30' s . she blushes and smooths down her hair,     
     knocking over a bottle of nail polish in the process. trying       
     to play it off as she signs for the package.
