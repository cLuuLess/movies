3   int. delta gamma house - living room - day - same time


    a delta gamma/sigma chi barbecue in full swing. beautiful
    college students drink beer and mingle, trying to figure out
    who they're going to sleep with next.
    the main wall of the living room has been designated as a
    "model wall" of delta gamma girls -- elle smiles at us from a
    hawaiian tropic ad and a miss june usc calendar photo. a
    cover of an italian vogue shows a blonde sexpot margot; a usc
    cheerleader poster displays a hard-bodied non-blonde serena
    in a pom-pom pose.
    serena walks up, fending off an admirer.

                        serena

              jeremy, enough! i am not going to formal
              with you.
    jeremy slinks off as margot arrives, agitated.

                        margot

              can someone please tell rick that he is
              not the only sigma chi with a big penis?


                                                         (continued)





                                                                3.


                                                                  3




                     elle (o.s.)

          you guys are so sweet!

elle, a vision of fluffy blondeness, runs down the stairs
toward serena and margot, holding the card.

                          elle (cont'd)

          but i ' m not positive it's gonna happen
          to n i g h t --

                  . serena

          helloo...he just had lunch with his
          grandmother. you know he got "the rock".

                    margot

          why else would she have flown in from
          newport? it's not like she'd fed ex a
          six carat diamond.

                     elle

               (excited)
          you think?

                     serena

          i can't believe you're getting engaged!

           ·    .           .

the three girls jump up and down, squealing and hugging.

                     elle

          c'mon ·-- you have to help me pick out the
          perfect outfit.

as they head toward the door, elle spots amy, a shy girl in a
delta gamma pledge sweatshirt, standing alone.


                     elle (cont'd)

               (continuing)
          amy, what's wrong?


                    amy

          i don't really -- know anyone.


                     elle

               (teasing)
          that's because you spend too much time in
          the library. come with me.
               (to serena and margot)
          i'll meet you outside.
as they go, elle leads amy over to a group of jovial sigma
chi brothers.




                                                       (continued)





                                                                   4.


           ( 2 )                                                        3




                        elle (cont'd)

                 (continuing)
            bra ndon , jason, grant --this is amy.
            why don't you tell her about the time you
            guys went golfing naked?

elle winks at amy and.heads off as the guys launch into their
story.

                      brandon

            it was classic.     jason hit with wood all
            day.

                      grant

            and we never ran out of balls --
amy laughs.
