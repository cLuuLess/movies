serena and margot watch as elle stands in front of a mirror,
trying on a herve leger white mini-dress. sexy and ultra-
tight.                                               ;


                      elle

            too demure?


                        margot

            i think you should go with red. it's the
            color of confidence.

                        elle

            well, i don't want to look like i know
            what's coming. . .

                      serena

            i don't understand why you're completely
            disregarding your signature color.
she holds up a tiny pink slipdress.

                       elle

            he's proposing! i can't look like i
            would on any date. this is the date. the
            night i'll always remember. i want to
            look special. bridal . . . but not like i
            suspect anything.

across the store


a saleswoman looks at her cohort.




                                                          (continued)





                                                                  5.


                                                                       4




                          saleswoman

                  (sot.to)
             there ' s nothing i love more than a dumb
             blonde with daddy's plastic.
she grabs a dress off the clearance sale rack, ripping off
the "half price" tag.


on elle and the girls


                      . serena

             i can't wait to see you wearing the rock!

elle looks at them, suddenly concerned.

                         elle

             wh at if -- you know -- it's not the
             night?


                       margot

             why else would he be taking you to the
             ivy? you've been dating for a year --
             it's not like he's trying to impress you.                     


                        serena                                              

             elle, you've heard the man pass gas in                         
             his sleep. that practically means you're                       
             pre-engaged.                                                  '"
the saleswoman approaches with the dress, kiss-assy smile on
her face.

                        saleswoman

             did you see this one? we just got it in
             yesterday.
elle fingers the dress, then the new price tag, looking back
at the saleswoman, excited.

                       elle

             is this a low-viscosity rayon?

                        saleswoman

             uh, yes -- of course.

                       elle

             with half-loop top-stitching on the hem?

                        saleswoman

                  (smiling a lie)
             absolutely. it's one of a kind.




                                                         (continued)





                                                                             6.


         co nt i nu e d: ( 2 )        .         Â·                                 4



^       elle hands the dress back to her, no longer pretending to be
         excited.


                                  elle

                        it's impossible to use a half-loop
                        topstitch on low-viscosity rayon. it
                        would snag the fabric. and you didn't
                        just get this in, because i remember it
                        from the june vogue a year ago, so if
                        you're trying to sell it to me at full
                        price, you picked the wrong girl.

         the saleswoman slinks off, embarrassed.


                                   margot

                             (to the saleswoman)
                        nice try...

         elle shakes her head and turns back to the girls as she slips
         on her manolo blahnik sandals, doing one last mirror check,
         smoothing down her golden mane.


                                   elle

                             (dramatically)
                        girls, this is it. in a few hours, i'll
                        be the future mrs. warner huntington iii.
