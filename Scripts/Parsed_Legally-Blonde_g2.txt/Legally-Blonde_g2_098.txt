      elle walks down the sidewalk to her dorm, approaching dorky                
      david as he tries to ask out a freshman girl who thinks she's
      a lot cuter than she actually is. she stands with her                      
      freshman friends.                                                          

      -                     dorky david

                 so -- i called your room last night.                            

                               freshman girl

                      (cold)                   '

                 i was thinking maybe we could go out                            
                 sometime.                                                       




                                                               (continued)

                              freshman girl                                    

                uh, n o . . . you're a dork.                                   
          turns back to her friends who all laugh at him.    elle          
      winces as she passes.                                                 

                             dorky david

                      (hopeful)
                i ' m in law school --

      the freshman girl turns back to him.                                     


                             freshman girl

                can't believe you'd even ask. girls like                   
                me don't go out with losers like you.                      

      her friends snicker. elle stops at this and sighs,                   
      acknowledging to herself that she has to help this guy.   she        
      turns and marches back, slapping dorky david across the   face.      
      dorky david is stunned, as is the freshman girl.                     


                            elle

      elle signals with her eyes for him to go along with it.


                           dorky david (cont'd)

      friends watch elle go. after a moment, the girl turns to david.
