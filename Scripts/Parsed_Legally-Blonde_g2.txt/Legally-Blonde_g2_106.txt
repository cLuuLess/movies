      paulette arranges a nail polish display by the door.


                            ups guy (o.s.)

                 i've got a big one for you.
      paulette freezes and slowly turns to find ups guy holding out
      a big package.


                           ups guy (cont'd)

                 can you sign?

      he hands her the computerized tablet and as he does, the pen
      velcroed to the side falls off.
      paulette watches as it falls in slo-mo. realizing that now            
      is the perfect time to try the bend & snap.

      she bends slowly, tush out, knee cocked. she grabs the pen
      and as she prepares to snap back up, ups guy leans over to
      help.

                      (continuing)
                 got it?
      not realizing he's leaning over, she snaps back up --
      clocking him in the nose with her head.

      he reels backward, holding his nose, blood flowing as
      paulette stares at him-in horror.


                              paulette

                 oh my god!
