      elle waits in line for the water fountain, talking on her

      we intercut with paulette as she watches- ups guy being
      carried out by paramedics on a gurney. the ladies of the
      shop flutter around him, concerned.

                 we're about to cross- examine enrique.
                 and don't worry! my friend serena barfed
                 on a guy during "the blair witch project"
                 and end up dating him for three months.
      she hangs up. enrique cuts in front of her in line for the
      water fountain. she glares at him, tapping her foot.
      he finishes getting his drink and turns, looking at her.
