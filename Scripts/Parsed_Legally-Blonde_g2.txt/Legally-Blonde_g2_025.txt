      elle sits in front of amy, as amy quizzes her with practice
      lsat questions. books are piled high around them.
      elle gazes out the.window to see ---warner and some bare-
      chested fraternity boys carrying a keg across the quad. her
      eyes light up and she looks at amy pleadingly. amy shakes her
      head no. elle slumps, then rises and goes to the window,
      closing the shades and getting back to work.

      on video, elle walks across campus with underdog in her
      purse, feigning staged innocence. a random frat boy pinches
       her butt. she slaps his hand, dramatically.

                            elle (cont'd)

                i object!
