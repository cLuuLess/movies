18    int. elle's delta gamma room - day                              18


     elle sits on the floor surrounded by piles of lsat prep
     books, the framed photo of warner, and underdog.
      there's a knock at the door as serena and margot peek inside,
      gasping in horror at the sight of books.

                          margot

                what are you doing?!
      elle smiles brightly at them.

                          elle

                reading about the lsats.
      margot looks at serena, confused.

                           serena

                     (in a horrified whisper)
                my cousin had them. apparently you get a
                really bad rash on your --
      elle interrupts her.

                          elle

                the lsats are an exam.
     she takes a deep breath.

                           elle (cont'd)

                   (continuing)
               girls-- i ' m going to harvard!


                        Â· serena

               what, like on va-kay?


                         margot

               let's all go! road trip!


                         . serena

               wait -- cecil has a condo in tahoe.
               let's go there!

                            elle

               no -- i ' m going to law school at harvard.

     they look at her, confused.


                          margot

               why?!


                          serena

               i mean, i know you're upset and all, but
               can't you just take a sedative?
     elle rolls her eyes at their naivete.

                         elle

               once warner sees me as a serious law
               student, he'll want me back. it's a
               completely brilliant plan!

                          margot

               but isn't it kind of hard to get into law
               school?

                         elle

               i have the highest gpa in delta gamma!
     margot pulls something off her wrist and hands it to elle.

                          margot

               here.   you're gonna need this.

                         elle

               your scrunchie?

                         margot

               my lucky scrunchie.     it helped me pass
               spanish.
     serena rolls her eyes and looks at margot disapprovingly.

               you passed spanish because you gave
               professor montoya a hand-job after the
               final.


                          margot

                    (duh)
               yeah, luckily.
