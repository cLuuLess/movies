43   ext. street/int. elle's convertible boxster- day                43   


     elle drives, wiping the tears from her face. she spots
     something off to the side and swerves her car toward it, a
     gasp of hope escaping her lips.

     her car stops in front of a strip mall salon called "beauty          
     oasis".
