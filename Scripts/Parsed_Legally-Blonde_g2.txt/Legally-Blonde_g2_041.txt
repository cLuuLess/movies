     emmett -- a shy and quirkily handsome 28-year-old who could
     pass for younger -- sits on a bench, going over some papers.
     he looks up and spots elle -- sitting across from him --
     looking traumatized.

                          emmett

                are you okay?
     elle looks up, snapping out of her stupor.

                  that? like, all the time?

                            emmett

                  the professors? yeah, they tend- to do
                  that. socratic method.

                            elle

                  and if you don't know the answer, they
                  just kick you out?
     he smiles.

                            emmett

                  you have stromwell.

                            elle

                      (hopeful)
                  did she do that to you, too?

                              emmett

                  no, but she made me cry once. not in
                  class -- i waited until i got to my room,
                  but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel
                  your balls -- or you know, your
                  whatevers .

                  don't worry. it gets better. who else
                  do you have?
     elle looks at her schedule.

                            elle

                  donovan, royalton and levinson.

                            emmett

                  speak up in donovan's class. he likes
                  people with an opinion. sit in the back
                  for royalton. he tends to spit when he
                  talks about products liability.
     elle makes a face.      he smiles.   liking her.

                and make sure you read the footnotes in
                levinson's class. that's where all her
                exam questions come from.


                             elle

                wow.   i ' m glad i met you.

     she smiles at him, grateful.

                           emmett

                oh, and getting one of stromwell's daily
                quotes right is almost as important as
                acing the mid-term. but you didn't hear
                it from me.

     students trickle out of the building.

               are you a third-year?
     warner walks up, behind emmett, interrupting.


                            warner

               hey.

     elle looks up, pure adoration on her face.

                            elle

               hi!

     emmett rises and walks off.


                            emmett

               good luck.

                    (calling after him)
               thanks again for your help!

     warner remains standing, still somewhat uncomfortable with
     her presence here.


                            warner

               s o -- uh -- how was your first class?


                         elle

               fine. except for this horrible girl who
               made me look bad in front of my civ pro
               professor. but no biggie. you're here
               now.

                how was your summer?

     she pats the bench beside her.     he doesn't move.

                     (distracted)

                do anything exciting?
     a female hand snakes around warner's chest from behind.
     warner turns and brings the owner of the hand around to his
     side, presenting her.


                          warner

                    (nervous)
               urn, hey, have you met sarah?

     sarah, the horrible girl herself, holds out her hand to elle,
     full of contempt.


                             sarah

               hi.     sarah knottingham.

     elle stares at her. sarah tucks a piece of her mousy brown
     hair behind her ear and there it is -- the rock.

               sarah was my girlfriend at prep school.
               we got back together over the summer at
               my grandmother's birthday party.

     elle looks stricken.     sarah gives her a smug smile.

                 famous at our club.
     she says it in a way that is anything but flattering.   in
     fact, it's completely condescending.

                           sarah (cont'd)

                     (continuing; pointedly)

                excuse me.

     she rushes off.    sarah watches her go, a smug grin on her
