14     int. elle's delta gamma room - day                                   14


     spread out on the bed are pictures of elle and warner: the
     sigma chi formal; their homecoming queen and king "wave";                   

                                                              (continued)

     a 60's party; mardi gras night; beach weekend at coronado.
     next to the pictures are thirty dried ecuardorian long-
     stemmed pink roses, remnants of their one year anniversary.
     in the center sits elle, wearing warner's old oversized sigma
     chi t-shirt, clutching a gund teddybear. depressed and
     looking like hell, she speaks to an unseen confidante.

                i just love him so much! i loved him the
                first moment i saw him. he's beautiful
                and smart and someone i totally respect.
                and i did everything i could to make him
                love me, but it wasn't enough. now what
                am i supposed to do? i planned my whole
                future around him. my life was going to
                be all about warner. now what's it going
                to be about?
     she looks up -- waiting. staring back at her is underdog --
     who sadly has no answers for her.
