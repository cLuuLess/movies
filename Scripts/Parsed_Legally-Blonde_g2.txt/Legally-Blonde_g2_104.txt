106   int. elle's dorm room - night                                   106


      elle, in sweats and a pony-tail, pours over a mammoth-sized
      deposition. a knock sounds.

                              elle

                 come in.

      sarah enters.


                              sarah

                      (re the depo)
                 you done with that yet?
      elle hands the deposition over.

                          elle

                take it. i've read it twenty times.
      she grabs another one off of the stack and begins reading.
      sarah lingers.

                              sarah

                i believe her, too. i don't think she's
                having an affair with enrique.

                          elle

                too bad you and i are the only ones.

                             sarah

                 i ' m still can't believe you didn't tell
                 donovan the alibi.
      elle looks up, defensive.

                           elle

                 it's not my alibi to tell --

                              sarah

                      (interrupting)
                 i know. i thought that was very --
                 classy of you.          .

                              elle

                      (surprised)
                 really? thanks.
      sarah starts to go, then stops.


                                                             (continued)

                                 sarah

y                   have you ever noticed that donovan never
                    asks warner to bring him coffee? he's
                    asked me at least a dozen times.
          elle shrugs.

                              elle

                    men are helpless.     you know that.                      
          sarah lingers, leaning on the edge of the couch.

                              sarah

                    warner can't even do his own laundry.

                                 elle

                    i know.     he has it sent out.

                               sarah


                                                                          -

                    did you know he got wait-listed when he
                    appli ed? his father had to make a call.

                               elle

                         (stunned)
                    you're kidding!
          a knock sounds on the open door and margot and serena poke
          their heads in.

                                 margot and serena

                    surprise!


                               elle

                    oh, my god!                       ' -.
          sarah watches as elle jumps up to hug the girls, who each
          have a bottle of veuve cliquot in their hands.

                               elle (cont'd)

                         (continuing)
                    what're you doing here?!

                              serena

                    we're on our way to the bridal show in                    
                    new york so we thought we'd rescue you                    
                    from law school for the night.

                               margot

                         (tempting her)
                    we have a limo downstairs and lots more
                    of these.
          she wiggles her champagne bottle.

                 you guys -- i can't. we're in the middle
                 of a trial.

                              serena                                            

                 where's warner?

                     (confused)                                                 
                 at the office ~                                                
      margot and serena look over at her.                                       

                             margot

                 oh, how sweet!        you made friends with a
                 nerdy girl.

                             elle

                 margot!

                            serena

                 bring her, too.
                      (to sarah)
                 c'mon. you can wear one of elle's
                 outfits.

                               sarah

                             margot

                      (to elle)
                 speaking of which, can you please put on
                 some party clothes? you look like
                 someone rolled you in something sticky
                 and dragged you through a k-mart.

                            elle

                     (torn)
                i can't believe you guys are actually
                here -- but this case is important. i'll                        
                make it up to you after finals, okay? i
       --      promise. i really want to do a good job.
      margot and serena stare at her, realizing she means it.

                           serena

                 okay. . . call us if you change your mind.
      they start to head out. margot hands sa-rah the bottle of champagne.

                             margot

                 here.


                                                                 (continued)

      she spots the rock on sarah's finger and grabs her hand.


                            margot (cont'd)

                      (continuing)
                 jesus. talk about a rock. you must be
                 better in bed than you look.

      elle hustles them out the door.

                            elle

                 i'll call you as soon as it's over, okay?                  
                 sisters forever?

      she shuts the door behind them.    then looks at sarah.


                            elle                                            

                      (continuing)
                 sorry about that.

      sarah sets down the veuve.


                            sarah

                 save it.

      she smiles at elle.

                            sarah (cont'd)

                      (continuing)
                 we'll drink it after we win.

      elle smiles .
