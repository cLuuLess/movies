     a party filled with people who are no fun to party with.
     nametags denote which famous defendant everyone is dressed as.
     menenedez's, tonya harding's, and buttafuco's pepper the room.

     elle, decked out in a playboy bunny costume -- looking sexy
     as hell -- strides in. people roll their eyes and ignore
     her. elle continues on.

     nearby -- enid, dressed as lizzie borden, axe in hand/ is in
     the midst of a tirade against some guy dressed like william
     kennedy smith.


                         enid

               the english language is all about subliminal
               domination. take the word "semester". it's a
               perfect example of this school's
               discriminatory preference of semen to
               ovaries. that's why i ' m petitioning to have
               next term be referred to as winter ovester.

     the guy backs up in fright. as elle passes, enid looks over.

                           enid (cont'd)

                    (continuing)
               hey , elle-- i've been meaning to ask you
                    (re her boobs)
               -- are those real?

     elle snorts.


                         elle

               enid, please -- silicone is so 90's.



                                                           (continued)





                                                                    48.
