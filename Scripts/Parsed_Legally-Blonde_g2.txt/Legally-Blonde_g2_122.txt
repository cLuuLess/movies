                 first, your honor, i ' d like to point out                   
                 that not only is there no proof in this                      
                 case, but there's a complete lack of mens                    
                 rea, which by definition tells us that                       
                 there is no crime without a vicious will.                    
      the da rolls her eyes, as do the lawyers present.                       

                          judge                                           ·

                i am aware of the meaning of mens rea.                     
                what i am unaware of is why you're giving                  
                me a vocabulary lesson instead of                          
                questioning your witness.                                  
      flustered, elle turns to chutney.                                       

                          elle                                                

                okay -- ms. windham, when you uh arrived                      
                back at the house? was your father there?                     

                          chutney

                not that i saw. but like i said, i went
                straight upstairs to take a shower.           '   ,

                          elle

                and when you came downstairs, what happened?

                          chutney

                i saw brooke standing over his body,
                drenched in his blood.

                          elle

                but mrs. windham didn't have a gun?

                          chutney

                no, she'd stashed it by then.
      brooke rolls her eyes.

                          emmett                                              

                move to strike that from the record, your                     
                honor. speculation.

                            judge

                stricken.
      elle mentally kicks herself for not doing this herself.                  
      eirimett gives her a reassuring nod. she takes a deep breath,       ·     
      then continues on.

                            chutney

                 no.   i was in the shower.

                            elle

                 so at some point in the -- twenty
                 minutes? -- you were in the shower, your
                 father was shot?

                            chutney

                 i guess.
      elle paces a bit. underdog watches from her purse on the
      table, intrigued by her line of questioning.

                your father was shot while you were in
                the shower?

      gerard looks at emmett.

                           gerard

                where's she going with this?


                           emmett

                have a little faith.


                           elle

                but you didn't hear the shot, because you
                were in the shower.

                          chutney

                    (annoyed)
                yes. i was washing my hair.

      elle's onto something, but not sure what.                           .    


                           elle

                miss windham, can you tell us what you'd
                been doing earlier in the day?


                           chutney

                i got up, went to starbucks, went to the
                gym, got a perm, and came home.


                           elle

                where you got in the shower.


                             chutney

                       (impatient)
                yes.

                i believe the witness has made it clear                        
                that she was in the shower.                                    
      people start to murmur.    donovan snickers.    sarah looks
      worried.                                                                 

                           elle

                yes, your honor. had you ever gotten a                .       .
                perm before, miss windham?


                             chutney

                       (confused)
                yes.

      the beginnings of a smile start to spread across elle's face.

                 how many, would you say?

                            chutney

                 two a year since i was twelve. you do the
                 math.

                              elle

                 you know, a girl in my sorority, tracy
                 marcinko, got a perm once. even though we                   
                 all told her not to ~ curls really                          
                 weren't the right look for her --
                      (chummy)
                 she didn't have your bone structure.

       chutney almost smiles.

                              elle (cont'd)

                        (continuing)
                 but, thankfully, that same day, she
                 entered the pi kap wet t-shirt contest
                 where she was completely hosed down from
                 head to toe.

       donovan shakes his head at her incompetence.

                              da joyce rafferty

                 objection.    why is this relevant?
       emmett clears his throat, worried. elle turns around, giving
       him a "trust me" look. then turns back to the judge.


                            elle

                      (to the judge)
                 i have a point. i promise.


                            judge

                 then make it.

       elle looks at chutney.                                   ..           


                            elle

                 chutney, why is it that tracy marcinko's
                 curls were ruined when she got hosed
                 down?


                            chutney

                 because they got wet.


                           elle

                 that's right. because isn't the first
                 cardinal rule of perm maintenance that
                 you are forbidden to wet your hair for at
                 least twenty-four hours after getting a
                 perm at the risk of de-activating the
                 ammonium thiglycolate?

       chutney pales.

                              chutney

                 yes --
      elle continues.


                             elle

                 and wouldn't someone who's had -- thirty
                 perms ? -- throughout her lifetime, be
                 well aware of this rule?

      chutney doesn't answer.     she just glares at brooke.

                            elle (cont'd)

                      (continuing)
                 and if you, in fact, were not washing
                 your hair, as i suspect you were not,
                 since your curls are still intact,
                 wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?

      chutney continues to glare.

                            elle (cont'd)

                      (continuing)
                 and if you in fact, heard the gunshot,
                 then brooke windham wouldn't have had
                 time to hide the gun before you got
                 downstairs. which would mean that you
                 would've had to have found mrs. windham
                 with a gun in her hand to make your story
                 sound plausible. isn't that right?


                           chutney

                 she's younger than i am. did she tell
                 you that? how would you feel if your
                 father married someone younger than you?


                           elle

                 you, however, had time to hide the gun,
                 didn't you, chutney? after you shot your
                 father?

      brooke looks at chutney in horror, realizing.


                            chutney

                 i didn't mean to shoot him --                                ·
