                 what're you so happy about? you're on
                 trial for murder.

                              brooke

                 get up.

                              donovan

                 what?

                           brooke

                 you're fired. i have new representation.

                              donovan

                 who?
      the door of the courtroom bangs open and elle strides in,
      dressed in a prada mini-dress, underdog in her purse. she
      blows a bubble, lets it pop, then sets her briefcase down
      next to donovan's.

      she nudges him aside.      donovan looks at brooke.

                              donovan

                 she's a law student.       she can't defend

                            judge

                 counselors, now.    all of you.
      elle, donovan and emmett head up, as does the da.      elle hands
      the judge the case book.

                            elle

                 elle woods, your honor. rule 3:03 of the                     
                 supreme judicial court states that a law                     ·

                 i have no problem with this.


                             donovan

                 i do.   i'm not allowing it.


                            elle

                      (pointedly)
                 but you agreed last night. in the
                 office? when we were discussing my
                 "career"?

      the implication lingers in the air, as donovan glares at her.


                            judge

                      (reading the casebook)
                 the ruling also states that you need a
                 licensed attorney to supervise you. mr.
                 donovan?


                            donovan

                 that, i won't agree to.

      emmett steps forward.


                             emmett

                 i ' m supervising, your honor.                               

      elle smiles at him. donovan looks from emmett to elle,
      completely derailed.


                            judge

                 well, then, ms. woods.    proceed.

      elle walks back to the table with a grin.       warner looks shocked.

      paulette beams, the ups guy in the nose brace, next to her.

      serena and margot, now in attendance, stand clapping and
      squealing in a completely inappropriate way.


                              serena

                 go, elle!
      donovan takes a seat in the audience.    as he passes by brooke:


                            donovan

                 enjoy prison.

      the judge looks at brooke.


                            judge

                 mrs. windham, you do realize what you're
                 doing?


                            brooke

                 absolutely.
      as donovan sits, margot leans over.

                 don't fuck with a delta gamma.


      at the defense table


      sarah leans forward to elle, who gathers her notes.


                            sarah

                 kick some butt.

      elle looks at her, surprised.


                            judge

                 ms. woods, call your first witness.


                            elle

                 i'd like to recall chutney windham as a
                 defense witness.
      the crowd murmurs.     donovan rolls his eyes.
