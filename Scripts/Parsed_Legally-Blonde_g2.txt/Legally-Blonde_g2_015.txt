16   int. upscale manicure shop - day                                   16   


     a row of uniformed manicurists and their classy clients.                
     chattering away. therapy in full session. serena sits in
     front of her regular nail technician.


                          serena

               it was awful. we all thought she'd be
               the first to walk down the aisle and now
               she's totally adrift.

     the nail technician shakes her head in shared girl-power-
     angst -- looking over at elle, who sits in the waiting area,
     shell-shocked, but showered.                                            

     elle picks up the only magazine left on the table -- "town &
     country". she wrinkles her nose. an old lady next to her
     reads "seventeen". elle looks at her, begrudging the access
     to teen beauty tips, and flips through "town & country"
     n oisily until she freezes on-- the engagement section. she
     gasps.

                          elle

               oh, my god!                    .
     she looks at a photo of a horse-faced young woman standing
     next to a three-years-older version of warner. she turns to
     the old lady next to her.


                          elle (cont'd)

                    (continuing)
               do you know who this is?

     the old lady looks.


                           old lady

               no.


                          elle

               it's warner's older brother!


                           old lady

               who?

     elle continues, undaunted.




                                                          (continued)





                                                                  16.

                            el le

               he just got engaged to this -- this very
               unfortunate-looking girl.
                    (reading)
               "third year yale law student putnam bowes
               huntington iii and his fiance layne
               walker vanderbilt, first year yale law."
     she turns to the old lady.

                          elle (cont'd)

                    (continuing)
               this is the type-of girl warner wants to
               marry. this is what i need to become to
               be serious.
     the old lady looks at the picture.

                            old lady

               butt ugly?

                         elle

               no -- a law student.
     elle rushes out.   serena looks after her.

                          serena

               elle?
                    (turning back to her nail
                     technician)
               she'll never get him back with those
               cuticles.
