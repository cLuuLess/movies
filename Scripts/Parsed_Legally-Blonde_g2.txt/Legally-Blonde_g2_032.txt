               sweetheart, you don't need law school.
               law school is for people who are boring
               and ugly and serious. and you, button/
               are none of those things.

     sapphire is in agreement.

               you were first runner-up in the miss
               hawaiian tropic contest. why throw all
               that away?


                          elle

               because this is what i want. i've worked
               hard for it. don't you understand that
               this is important to me?

                going to harvard is the only way i can
