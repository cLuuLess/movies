86   int. austen, jaret, platt and donovan - conference room     86


     professor donovan opens his briefcase as elle, sarah, enid
     and warner hang on his every word.

                           professor donovan

               we're defending brooke windham, whose
               very wealthy husband was found shot to
               death in their beacon hill mansion.

                         sarah

               gold digger?

                           professor donovan

               you'd think so, since the stiff was
               sixty, but she was rich on her own. some
               kind of fitness empire. you can buy her
               exercise tapes on infomercials.
     elle frowns.

                           elle

               wait a minute -- are we talking about
               brooke daniels?
     donovan checks his papers.

                             professor donovan

               m a i d e n name--daniels.
                    (looking up)
               you know her?

                           elle

               she was a delta gamma! not in my pledge
               class or anything -- she graduated ,five
               years ahead of me. but i used to take her
               class at the la sports club. she's
               amazing!
     the others looks at each other and roll their eyes.

                          professor donovan

               amazing how?


                         elle

               she could make you drop three pounds in
               one class. she's completely gifted!

                           professor donovan

               well, in all likelihood, she's completely
               guilty as well. she was seen standing
               over her husband's dead body.


                                                         (continued)

                                                                      6

                             wa rn er

               b y who?

                          sa rah

                    (correcting him)
               whom?

                          professor donovan

               his twenty-seven year old daughter and
               the pool boy.


                         elle

               maybe she found him like that.

                          p ro f es s or donovan

               that's the story she'll be telling the
               jury. we just have to prove it.

     emmett walks in and sits.

                           emmett

               sorry i ' m late.
     elle looks at him, confused.

                               p r o fe s so r donovan

               this is emmett kerrigan, another associate.                   
               top three in his class and former editor of
               h a r v a r d law review. you've probably seen                
               h i m lurking around campus doing my research.

                         em me tt                                            

               or napping on the quad.          .                            
     elle smiles at him.    he smiles back.   almost shy.


                          warner

                    (to donovan)
               what about the murder weapon?


                          p r o fe s so r donovan

               the gun is missing. the coroner said
               he'd been dead thirty minutes dead when
               the cops arrived -- giving brooke plenty
               of time to stash it.


                            elle

               there's no    way brooke could've done this -
               - exercise    gives you endorphins,
               endorphins    make you happy -- happy people
               don't kill    their husbands!
     sarah and enid snort.

                                professor donovan

                     you don't really believe she's innocent?


                                elle

                     of course, i do!

         emmett looks at her.


                                emmett

                     then we may actually have a case.

         he looks over at donovan, who's not so sure.
