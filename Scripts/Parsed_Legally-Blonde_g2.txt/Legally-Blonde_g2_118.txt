                did you go in there knowing how you were
                going to discredit mr. salvatore?


                           donovan on tv

                absolutely. it's a little thing i like
                to call strategy.

      he gives the reporters a smug smile.


      in the waiting room

      brooke looks away from the tv. emmett is next to her,
      prepping her for the following day.


                          brooke

                is he always such an ass?

                           emmett

                     (containing himself)
                he's the top defense attorney in the
                state. of course he's an ass.

 ..j                    but is he an ass that's gonna win my case?                   

                                  emmett

                        he's an ass that's gonna try.                                

                                   brooke

                        he thinks i ' m guilty, doesn't he?

                                  emmett

                        that's not what's important.

                                  brooke

                        to me it is. he doesn't trust me. why
                        should i trust him?
              emmett thinks for a moment. then looks at brooke.                      

                                  emmett

                        you're right. why should you?
