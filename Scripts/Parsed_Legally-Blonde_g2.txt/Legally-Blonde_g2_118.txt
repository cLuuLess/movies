      elle sits in front of paulette, dejected.   not even bothering
      with a manicure.


                            paulette

                     (upset)
                you can't go home!


                            elle

                what's the point of staying? all people
                see when they look at me is blonde hair
                and big boobs. no one's ever going to
                take me seriously. the people at law
                s chool don't, warner doesn't -- i don't
                even think my parents take me seriously.
                they wanted me to grow up and become a
                victoria's secret model who marries a
                rock star. now, for the first time, it
                seemed like someone expected me to do
                something better with my life than wear
                underwear for a living. but i was kidding
                mys elf -- donovan didn't see me as a
                lawyer. he saw me as a piece of ass.

                                                                   103.

                             elle (cont'd)

                 just like everyone else. it turns out, i
                 am a j oke.

      she stands up.

                           elle (cont'd)

                     (continuing)
                the hell with law school. i just came to
                say goodbye.


      in a nearby chair


      professor elspeth stromwell spins around, nails drying,
      facing elle.

                          professor stromwell

                if you let one stupid prick ruin your
                life, you're not the girl i thought you
                were.

      elle looks at her, shocked, as professor stromwell stands and
      goes.
