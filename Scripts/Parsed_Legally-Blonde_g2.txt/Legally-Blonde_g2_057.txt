                if she spreads her legs, maybe --


                            arrogant aaron

                     (adjusting his crotch)
                only if i ' m feeling generous.


                         elle (o.s.)

               what is this?

     they turn around to find elle standing there.


                          claire

               we're betting on how much longer you're
               going to last.

                           elle

                    (stung)
               what?


                          sarah

               look around, elle.      do you actually think
               you belong here?

     they all stare at her.


                           elle

                    (hurt)
               why wouldn't i?


                          enid

               because the rest of us provide some
               worthwhile value to society?


                         arrogant aaron

               hold on, now -- every society needs a
               bimbo. who are we supposed to sleep with
               after we get rich?


                                                               (continued)

     elle looks like she's been slapped. the others laugh at
     aaron's esteemed wit.


                          elle

                you know what? all of you can just kiss
                my ass.
     she yanks off her bunny tail and throws it at them. hurt and
     anger in her eyes. then walks out of the room.


'                          elle (cont'd)

                     (continuing; to herself)
                you're about to see just how valuable
                elle woods can be.
     she stomps out of the house.
