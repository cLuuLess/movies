73   int. criminal law class - day                                   73

     "the state v. latimer" is written on the board. a pony-
     tailed, less made-up elle takes notes on her lap-top, as
     warner makes an argument.


                              warner

             . according to swinney v. neubert, swinney,
              who was also a private sperm donor, was
               allowed visitation rights as long as he
               came to terms with the hours set forth by
               the parents. so, if we're sticking to
              past precedent, mr. latimer wasn't
               st al ki ng -- he was clearly within his
               rights to ask for visitation.


                          professor donqvan

               but swinney was a one-time sperm donor,
               and in our case, the defendant was a
               habitual sperm donor, who also happens to
               be harassing the parents in his quest for
               visitation.

                                                                      55.

                             warner

                  but , without this man's sperm --the
                  child in question would not exist.

     he grins and looks around as the class murmurs their
     agreement.

                             professor donovan

                  now you're thinking like a lawyer.

     emmett enters from the back, holding a file.        he stands there
     quietly, watching. Â·
     elle tentatively raises her hand.


                            professor donovan (cont'd)

               ms. woods?
     sarah looks at claire.


                           sarah

                    (sotto)
               the idiot speaks.


                          elle

               although mr. huntington makes an
               excellent point, i have to wonder if the                       
               defendant kept a thorough record of each                       
               sperm emission made throughout his life?

     the class titters.    elle grows annoyed.


                           professor donovan

                    (bemused)
               why do you ask?

     elle's hesitancy is replaced by conviction.

                             elle

               well, unless the defendant attempted to                        
               contact every single one-night- stand to
               determine if a child resulted in those
               unions -- then he has no parental claim
               whatsoever over this child. why this
               s p e rm ? why now?      '

     emmett's mouth twitches into a smile.





                                                              (continued)





                                                                      56.

                       (continuing)
                  for that matter, all masturbatory
                  emissions where his sperm was clearly not
                  seeking an egg could be termed reckless
                  abandonment.

     warner's mouth hangs open. as does sarah's and the rest of
     the class. donovan smiles.

                             professor donovan

                  i believe you've just won your case.

     elle grins.           :
