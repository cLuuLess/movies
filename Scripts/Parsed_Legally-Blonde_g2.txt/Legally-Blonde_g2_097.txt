     mrs. windham vandermark, late 40s, brunette, east coast hoity- 
     t o i t y -- lies on a table like a corpse, stiff with mud, 
     cucumbers over her eyes. elle and emmett poke their heads in.

                          elle

                mrs. windham vandermark?

                           emmett

                we're here from austen, platt, jaret &
                donovan --

                           mrs. windham vandermark

                so, you found me.

     emmett looks at elle.

                           emmett

                     (sotto)
                she's naked.

                            mrs. windham vandermark

                i ' m covered in very expensive egyptian
                mud ··-- hardly naked.

                          elle

                    (to emmett)
                i'll cover her -- parts.
     elle settles on three washcloths, strategically placed.

                so, i hear the tart from california shot    -                 
                heyworth.                                                     

                           emmett

                well, that's what we're trying to prove
                didn't happen. do you have any reason to
                believe it did?

                          mrs. windham vandermark

                i never met the woman, but from what my
                daughter tells me, she's quite the cun--

                           elle

                     (interrupting her)
                she's not!


                                                           (continued)





                                                                    82.

                           emmett

                did your daughter ever say anything to
                you about brooke and heyworth's
                relationship?

                          mrs. windham vandermark

                aside from the fact that he found her on                       
                an infomercial? she said they humped like                      
                gorillas . chutney could hear them all
                the way in the pool house.


                             emmett

                i ' m sure that was very awkward for
                chutney.
                      (sotto)
                much as it is for me, hearing you tell
                about it.

                           mrs. windham vandermark

                but i guess it wasn't enough for brooke.

                           emmett

                why do you say that?

                          mrs . windham vandermark

                haven't you seen the cabana boy?


                            elle

                      (uneasy)
                ys. . . .
                e


                           mrs. windham vandermark

                like i said, i've never met brooke, but i
                have seen her from a distance. when i ' d
                come over to pick up the alimony check
                that heyworth forgot to mail every month,
                she'd be out by the pool, with mr. hot
                pants hovering over her with some pink
                drink.


                            emmett

                hovering?


                           mrs . windham vandermark

                i didn't stick around long enough to
                watch him stick his swizzle stick in her
                mouth, but i ' d bet my next check that
                that ' s where he was about to put it .
