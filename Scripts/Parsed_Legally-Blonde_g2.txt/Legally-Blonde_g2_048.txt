         warner and his study group, sarah and claire included, sit at
         a table, going over their outlines. elle walks up to the
         table, holding a basket of muffins, bright smile on her face.



                                                            (continued)





                                                                     43.

                            elle

     '        i ' m here to join your study group. and
                look! i brought sustenance!
     she holds up the muffins as the others look up, frowns all
     around.

                            warner

                    (nervously looking at sarah)
               elle, what're you doing here?
     elle pulls up a chair from another table and holds up a
     muffin.                       '

                         elle

               who's first?
     she sits down next to warner.

                          sarah

               our group is full.

                         elle

               oh, god, was this like an rsvp thing?

                            claire

               no, it's like a smart people thing.     and
               like sarah said, we're full.

                         warner

               come on ~ we can make room for one more.
     sarah looks at warner with evil eyes.

                            sarah

               we've already assigned the outlines, and
               everyone has started theirs',

                          claire

                    (to warner)
               besides, you wouldn't let the fat guy
         _    join.

                         warner

               he tried to watch me take'a shower!
     sarah looks at elle.

                          sarah

               the answer is no.
     warner looks at her, feeling guilty. he shrugs an "i'm
     sorry", but elle's perkiness has gone.


                                                             (continued)





                                                                    44.


50              (2)                                                   50


      she gathers up her muffins and stands, clutching the basket
      to her chest as she goes.

                          elle

                then i guess i'll leave you alone.
      she walks away, completely deflated, passing by the raging
      feminist study group. enid calls out.


                          enid

                maybe there's a sorority you could join
                instead.
     elle stops and looks at her.

                           elle

                     (to enid)
                you know, if you'd come to a rush party,
                i would've at least been nice to you.


                          enid

                before you voted against me and called me
                a dyke behind my back?


                          elle

                i don't use that word. only mean people
                use that word. you must've heard it from
                sarah.                     .
     she looks back at warner's table and walks off. as she does.,
     she's nearly mowed down by a gaggle of nerds led by dorky             
     david, who knock the muffins out of her hands. she stands             
     there, even more depressed.
