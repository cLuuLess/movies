            professor elspeth stromwell, a tough-as-nails grande dame in
            her 50' s , addresses the class. laptops abound -- except for
            elle, who has a fuzzy pink notebook and a pen with a pink
            plastic heart on the end.

                                    professor stromwell

                      a legal education means you will learn to
                      speak in a new language. you will be
                      taught to achieve insight into the world
                      around you, and to sharply question what
                      you know.
            everyone soaks this up.        including elle.

                the seat you've picked is yours for the
                next nine months of your life. enjoy it.
                and those of you in the front row,
                beware.      .    ..
     el le , in the front row, between two unshowered braniacs, Â·
     looks around, panicked. one of the braniacs passes her the 
     seating chart and she has no choice but to sign her name.
     in the back, arrogant aaron nudges his friend and smiles.

                "the law is reason free from passion."
                does anyone know who spoke those immortal
                words?
     dorky david raises his hand.

                              professor stromwell (cont'd)

                       (continuing)
                yes?


                          dorky david

                    (confidently)
               aristotle.

     professor stromwell approaches him the way cruella de ville
     approaches a puppy.


                          professor stromwell

               are you sure?

     now he's not.

                             dorky david

               yes?


                             professor stromwell

     ~        would you be willing to stake your life
               on it?

                          dorky david

                i think so...

                           professor stromwell

               h o w about --

     she spins around, roughly poking another student in the head.

                     (scared)
                i don't know.


                            professor stromwell

                well, i recommend knowing before
                speaking.. the law leaves much room for
                interpretation -- but very little for
                self-doubt.

     as she turns away --

                and you were right. it was aristotle.

     the class half-laughs in relief.


                            professor stromwell (cont'd)

                     (continuing)
                i assume you've all read pages 1- 48 and
                are now well-versed in subject matter
                jurisdiction.
     elle looks around, surprised, as students open their books.

                           professor stromwell (cont'd)

                     (continuing)
                who can tell us about gordon v. steele?

     silence.   stromwell looks down at the seating chart.

                            professor stromwell (cont'd)

                     (continuing)
                ivan greenstein?

     intense ivan straightens in his' seat.

                           ivan

                gordon sued her doctors for malpractice.

                           professor stromwell

                and what did the dispute entail?
                     (looking at her chart)
                let's call on someone in the hot zone.
                elle woods? elle looks up, distressed.




                                                           (continued)

                           elle

                uh... i wasn't aware that we had an
                assignment.

                           professor stromwell

                     (looking at her chart)
                sarah knottingham?

     sarah knottingham -- a prim and preppy blue-blood brunette,
     dressed in pearls and a sweater set -- looks up.


                           professor stromwell (cont'd)

                     (continuing)
                do you think it's acceptable that ms.
                woods is unprepared?
     sarah looks over at elle. elle gives her a mortified smile.
     sarah turns back to professor stromwell.

                           sarah

                no, i don't.


                           professor stromwell

                would you support my decision to ask her
                to leave and return to class only when
                she is prepared?

                           sarah

                absolutely.
     elle can't believe that this girl would betray her. having
     no choice,, she gathers her purse and goes, completely
     humiliated. professor stromwell returns to the matter at
     hand.

                          professor stromwell

                now, ms. knottingham, did diversity
                jurisdiction'exist in this case?
