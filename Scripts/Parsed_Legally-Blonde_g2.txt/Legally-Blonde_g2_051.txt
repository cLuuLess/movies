53   int. elle's dorm - hallway - day - same time                        53   


     sarah and claire walk past elle's room, the door of which is
     ajar.

                            sarah

                it's not just any halloween party. it's a
                "come as your favorite defendant" party.

                           claire

                that-'s genius.
     elle pops her head out of the room.

                            elle

                     (excited)
                no way! someone at this school is
                actually having a party?
     sarah and claire turn around.      elle's face falls when she
     sees that it's them.

                            sarah

                no.


                          claire

                you must've heard us wrong.

                            sarah

                sorry. looks like you'll be staying home
                ton ig ht. alone.
     they continue on as elle goes back into her room, snubbed.
