     elle sits, glaring at sarah, who keeps waving her "the rock"
     in elle's direction, as she plays footsie with warner.

     professor donovan -- 40s, a big fan of himself, salt and
     pepper hair, no time for bullshit -- stands before the class.

                          professor donovan

                i should warn you that in addition to
                competing against each other for the top
                grade in this class, you'll also be
                competing for one of my firm's highly
                coveted four internship spots next year
                where you will get to assist on actual
                cases. let the bloodbath begin. now,
                let's commence with our usual torture --
     he looks around.


                          professor donovan (cont'd)

                    (continuing)
               ms . woods --

     sarah and her bitchy, clone-like friend claire exchange
     knowing glances.


                          sarah

               this should be amusing.

                ·        professor donovan

               would you rather have a client who
               committed a crime malum in se or malum
               prohibitum?


                          elle

               neither.


                          professor donovan

               why not?


                          elle

               i'd rather have a client who's innocent.

     elle smiles, proud of her answer. the class snickers. warner
     frowns.


                          professor donovan

      .        dare to dream, ms. woods. ms.
                knottingham? which would you prefer?

                              sarah

                   malum prohibitum. because the client
                   would've committed a regulatory
                   infraction as opposed to a dangerous
                   crime.
         elle raises her hand.

                              professor donovan

                   yes?   ms. woods?

                            ' elle                '    ..

                   i changed my mind. i ' d pick the
                   dangerous one.
         she looks pointedly at sarah.

                               elle (cont''d)

                         (continuing)
                   i ' m not afraid of a challenge.
         sarah glares back at her. warner looks between the two of             

                                                        ·                      

         them, worried.
