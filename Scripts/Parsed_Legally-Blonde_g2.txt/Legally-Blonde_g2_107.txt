      elle grabs emmett's arm as he whispers with donovan.


                             elle

                he's gay!    enrique is gay!


                             emmett

                what?!
      she grabs warner as he's passing.


                           elle

                warner, what kind of shoes do i have on?

      he looks down at her prada sandals.


                             warner

                pink ones.


                             elle

                see?

      donovan frowns, not seeing.

                           donovan

                what are you talking about?


                             elle

                he's gay -- he isn't brooke's lover!
                he's making it up. whoever killed
                heyworth is paying him off.

                             emmett

                back up.     how do you know he's gay?

                             elle

                gay men know designers.     straight men
                don't.
      she points at warner, who shrugs. brooke leans over.

                          brooke

                what's going on?

                           elle

                enrique's gay. i ' m sure of it.'


                                                            (continued)





                                                                   95.


109                                                                 109




                          brooke

                he did leave a cher tape in the pool
                house once --
      donovan scoffs.

                          donovan

                while i appreciate your masterful legal                   
                theory, i have a murder trial to attend                   
                to.
      he grabs emmett's arm and pulls him aside as they confer on
      more serious matters. emmett looks at her as if to say
      "sorry", before he looks back at donovan.
      brooke looks at donovan, then back at elle, rolling her eyes.
      elle sits down, pissed. warner is next to her.

                          elle

                thanks for the backup.

                          warner

                how was i supposed to know what kind of
                shoes you had on?
      she looks at him like he's a complete idiot, as the judge
      takes his seat.
