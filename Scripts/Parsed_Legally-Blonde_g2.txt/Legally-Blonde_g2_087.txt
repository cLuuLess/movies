                i ' m going to.show you a little maneuver
                my mother taught me when i was in junior
                high. in my experience, it has a 98%
                success rate in getting a man's attention
                an d when used appropriately--an 83%                      
                rate of return on a dinner invitation.
     the hairstylists and clients listen, intrigued.                      .

                it's called the "bend & snap".
                     (acting)
                "oh, look! there's something on the
                floor that i need to pick up!" bend...                    
     she slowly bends down, as if to pick up something, sticking          
     out her tush, knee cocked. she slids her hand down her               
     cocked leg until her hand touches the floor and she snaps            
     back up, boobs a'bouncing.
