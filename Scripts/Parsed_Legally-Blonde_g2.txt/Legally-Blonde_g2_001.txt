    int. delta gamma house - day                                      1

    "head over heels" by the go-go's plays as we wind through a
    flock of abstract, silky, golden strands -- pulling back, to          
    discover that the strands are hair on a blonde girl's head.           
    but not just any blonde girl, a girl in delta gamma, the
    blondest, most beautiful sorority at usc.

    we pull back further to see that she's signing a handmade
    card. she holds it up ~ over her shoulder, we see hearts              
    and glitter surrounding and "good luck tonight!" and "elle            
    and warner forever!."

    she carries the card out of her room and we follow her across
    the hall, into the room of --

    three blonde cheerleaders, who stop practicing their pom-pom
    routine to sign the card. as they finish, we follow the card
    girl out and into the room of --

    a blonde girl in a tank top and shorts, working out on a
    stairmaster as "general hospital" plays on a tiny tv. she
    signs the card while continuing to exercise. we move on, to           
    the room of--

    a blonde girl making out with her boyfriend who stops long
    enough to sign the card, as her boyfriend nibbles on her
    neck. she hands the card back and we head into the room of --

    a blonde party girl who pours a pink frozen margarita into a
    glass from the blender, then passes it down to another blonde         
    girl, assembly-line style. the card goes one way, being
    signed, as the drinks go the other.

    once the card arrives back in the card girl's hands, we
    follow her out of the room and down the hall until she
    reaches the very last and biggest door --
    she puts a kiss mark on the card, then kneels down and slides
    the card under the door.
