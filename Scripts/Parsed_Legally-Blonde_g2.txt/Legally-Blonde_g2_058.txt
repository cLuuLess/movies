     a hot pink laptop is yanked off the shelf.

                                                                 cut to:


     elle, still in her bunny suit, minus the tail, stands in
     line, paying for the laptop. people gape at her, but she's
     oblivious in her resolve.

     emmett walks up behind her in line.   he clears his throat,
     trying not to look at her costume.

     elle turns, seeing him.


                             elle

                don't ask.

                           emmett

                wasn't gonna.                                -

     she marches off.   laptop in hand.
