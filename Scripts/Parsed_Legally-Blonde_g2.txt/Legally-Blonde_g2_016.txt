               harvard law school?

                         elle

               that's right.

                         advisor

               but it's a top three school --

                            elle

                   (offended)

                yes, but your major is fashion
                merchandising. harvard won't be
                impressed that you aced "history of
                lycra". what are your backups?

                           elle

                i don't need backups.      harvard is the
                school i' m going to.
      he decides to humor her.

                          advisor

                well, then. you'll need excellent
                recommendations from your professors, a
                heck of an admissions essay and at least
                a one-seventy-five on your lsats.

                i once had to judge a theta chi tighty-
                whitey contest. trust me-- i can handle
                anything.
