     emmett drives, elle is shotgun.

                           elle

                explain to me why you're so anti- brooke.


                           emmett

                uh, for starters, she won'-t give us an
                al i bi --

                           elle

                aside from that.


                           emmett

                she's completely untrustworthy.


                           elle

                why?


                           emmett

                she married an old man, she's made a
                living on telling women they're too fat,
                she hawks her crap on the home shopping
                network...

                          elle

                a) he's an old man with a really big
                penis. b) she never told me i was fat.
                and c) victoria principal sells on that
                network.

                           emmett

                and d) brooke is obviously hiding
                something.

                          elle

                but maybe it's not what you think.

                           emmett

                bu t maybe it is--         .

     they're quiet for a moment.     she looks at him.


                           elle

                you're kind of being a butt-head right
                now.





                                                            (continued)





                                                                        80.

                           emmett

                     (amused)
                how do you figure?


                           elle

                because people aren't always what they
                seem to be and you refuse to see that.
                have a little faith. you might be
                surprised.
     they're quiet again while he thinks about this.         he looks
     over at her.

                          emmett

                i can't believe you called me a butt-
                head. no one's called me a butt-head
                since ninth grade.


                           elle

                maybe not to your face...

     she gives him a teasing smile.        he smiles back at her,
     shaking his head.
