    we hear over...

                              gabriel (v.o.)
                you know the problem with
                hollywood? they make shit.
                unbelievable, unremarkable shit.
                i'm not some grungy filmmaker-
                wannabee searching for
                existentialism through a haze of
                bong-smoke. it's easy to pick
                apart bad acting, short-sighted
                directing, or the purely moronic
                stringing together of words many
                of the studios term as prose. no,
                i'm talking the lack of realism.
                realism. not a pervasive element
                in the modern american cinematic
                vision.
