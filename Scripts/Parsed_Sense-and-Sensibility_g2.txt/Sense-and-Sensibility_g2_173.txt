               ext. barton cottage - garden - eve

               elinor is standing by the gate, looking out. mrs dashwood 
               comes down the path to join her. she links arms with elinor 
               and they stand in silence for a beat.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         your father once told me not to allow 
                         you to neglect yourself. now i find 
                         that it is i who have neglected you 
                         most.

                                     elinor
                         no, mamma.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         yes, i have. we all have. marianne 
                         is right.

                                     elinor
                         i am very good at hiding.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         then we must observe you more closely.

               a pause.

                                     elinor
                         mamma?

                                     mrs dashwood
                         yes, my darling?

                                     elinor
                         there is a painful difference between 
                         the expectation of an unpleasant 
                         event and its final certainty.

               mrs dashwood squeezes elinor's arm tightly.
