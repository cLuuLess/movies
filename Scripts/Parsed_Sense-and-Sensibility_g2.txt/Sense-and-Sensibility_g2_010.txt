               ext. roadside inn - day

               john and fanny are waiting as the ostlers make the final 
               adjustments to their carriage. the landlord hovers, waiting 
               for a tip.

                                     john
                         a hundred pounds a year to their 
                         mother while she lives. would that 
                         be more advisable? it is better than 
                         parting with the fifteen hundred all 
                         at once.

               he displays some coins in his hand. fanny removes one and 
               nods.

                                     fanny
                         but if she should live longer than 
                         fifteen years we would be completely 
                         taken in. people always live forever 
                         when there is an annuity to be paid 
                         them.

               john gives the coins to the landlord.
