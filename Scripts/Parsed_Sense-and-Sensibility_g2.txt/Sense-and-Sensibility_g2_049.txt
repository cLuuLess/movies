               ext. barton park - front steps - eve

               a soldierly man of about forty (colonel brandon) is 
               dismounting from his horse. from within we hear marianne's 
               song begin. his head snaps up to the windows. an expression 
               of pained surprise comes into his melancholy, brooding eyes.
