               they carry the piano into the parlour and to the dashwoods' 
               joyful astonishment it fits perfectly. mrs dashwood reads 
               out the letter that has accompanied it.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         'at last i have found a small enough 
                         instrument to fir the parlour. i 
                         expect to follow it in a day or two, 
                         by which time i expect you to have

                         it is not just for me! it is for all 
                         of us.
