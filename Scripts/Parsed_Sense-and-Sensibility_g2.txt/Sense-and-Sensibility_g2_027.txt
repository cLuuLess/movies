               int. norland park - drawing room - another day

               john is reading a newspaper. mrs dashwood sits across from 
               fanny, who thumbs through a fashion-plate magazine. elinor 
               is at a desk by the window writing a letter we see the words 
               'of course we should like to leave as soon as possible'. 
               suddenly she hears a commotion outside. margaret runs past 
               the window brandishing a stick. edward follows, and proceeds 
               to teach her the first principles of sword-fighting. they 
               feint and parry, edward serious and without a hint of 
               condescension, margaret concentrating furiously. edward 
               suddenly turns, as though feeling elinor's gaze. she smiles 
               but looks away quickly.
