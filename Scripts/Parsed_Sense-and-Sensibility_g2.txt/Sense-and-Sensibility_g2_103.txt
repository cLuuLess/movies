               ext. grand crescent leading to ballroom entrance - night

               so many carriages have entered the crescent to deliver the 
               guests that gridlock has occurred and people are forced to 
               walk to the entrance. we see mrs jennings, marianne, elinor 
               and lucy alighting from their carriage and picking their way 
               through the mud, their skirts raised above their ankles. 
               elinor nearly trips and is obliged to grab onto lucy in order 
               not to slip into the dirt.
