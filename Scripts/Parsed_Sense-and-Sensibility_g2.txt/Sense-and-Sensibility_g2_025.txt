               int. norland park - entrance hall outside library - day

               edward is standing outside keeping a discreet lookout. the 
               door is half open and he can hear elinor trying to coax 
               margaret out. fanny walks by with a butler to whom she is 
               giving instructions. edward pretends to examine the mouldings 
               and she passes on unsuspecting.

                                     elinor (v.o.)
                         won't you come out, dearest? we 
                         haven't seen you all day. mamma is 
                         very concerned.

               more silence. edward thinks hard. he makes a decision.
