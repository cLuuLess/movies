               later. the lovers walk slowly, their heads almost touching, 
               their words low and intimate.

                                     elinor
                         your mother, i suppose, will hardly 
                         be less angry with robert for marrying 
                         lucy.

                                     edward
                         the more so since she settled the 
                         money upon him so irrevocably--

                                     elinor
                         --no doubt because she had run out 
                         of sons to disinherit.

                                     edward
                         her family fluctuates at an alarming 
                         rate. then, in london, when you told 
                         me of the colonel's offer, i became 
                         convinced that you wanted me to marry 
                         lucy and that--well, that you and 
                         colonel brandon...

                                     elinor
                         me and colonel brandon!

                                     edward
                         i shall not forget attempting to 
                         thank him for making it possible for 
                         me to marry the woman i did not love 
                         while convinced he had designs upon 
                         the woman i did--do--love.

               edward stops walking. he looks at elinor and realises he can 
               stand it no longer.

                                     edward
                         would you--can you--excuse me--

               he takes her face in his hands and kisses her.
