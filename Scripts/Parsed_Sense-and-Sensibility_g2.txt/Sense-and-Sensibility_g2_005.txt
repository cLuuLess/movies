               int. john and fanny's town house - dressing room - day

               john is standing in mourning clothes and a traveling cape. 
               he is watching, and obviously waiting for, a pert woman (fanny 
               dashwood) who is standing by a mirror looking at him keenly.

                                     fanny
                         what do you mean, 'help them'?

                                     john
                         dearest, i mean to give them three 
                         thousand pounds.

               fanny goes very still. john gets nervous.

                                     john
                         the interest will provide them with 
                         a little extra income. such a gift 
                         will certainly discharge my promise 
                         to my father.

               fanny slowly turns back to the mirror.

                                     fanny
                         oh, without question! more than 
                         amply...

                                     john
                         one had rather, on such occasions, 
                         do too much than too little.

               a pause as fanny turns and looks at him again.

                                     john
                         of course, he did not stipulate a 
                         particular sum.
