               int. barton cottage - parlour - day

               close on the accounts book, covered in blots and crossed-out 
               sums. pull up to reveal marianne labouring over it. her 
               sickness has left her slightly short-sighted and she uses a 
               pince-nez that makes her look like an owl.

               elinor is sewing and mrs dashwood is snoozing. margaret goes 
               up and looks over marianne's shoulder. she frowns at the 
               spider's web of ink.

                                     margaret
                         you'll go blind if you're not careful.

               betsy brings in coals for the fire. mrs dashwood rouses 
               herself.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         is thomas back from exeter, betsy?

                                     betsy
                         yes, ma'am--he brung back two lovely 
                         fillets for you.

               mrs dashwood looks nervously at elinor like a child who has 
               been caught out.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         beef is far less expensive in exeter, 
                         and anyway they are for marianne.

               elinor laughs and rolls her eyes to heaven. betsy turns on 
               her way out to remark:

                                     betsy
                         sixpence a piece, miss dashwood. oh, 
                         and he says mr ferrars is married, 
                         but i suppose you know that, ma'am.

               there is a stunned silence. everyone looks at elinor.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         fetch thomas to us, betsy.

               betsy leaves. they all sit very still. margaret is about to 
               talk to elinor about it but marianne stops her. thomas enters.

                                     thomas
                         beg pardon, miss dashwood, but they 
                         was the cheapest in the market--

                                     mrs dashwood
                         it was a very good price, thomas, 
                         well done. would you be so kind as 
                         to build up the fire a little?

                                     thomas
                              (relieved)
                         yes, ma'am.

               there is a pause.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         who told you that mr ferrars was 
                         married, thomas?

               thomas builds up the fire as he answers. he tells the story 
               with pleasure.

                                     thomas
                         i seen him myself, ma'am, and his 
                         lady too, miss lucy steele as was--
                         they were stopping in a chaise at 
                         the new london inn. i happened to 
                         look up as i passed the chaise and i 
                         see it was miss steele. so i took 
                         off my hat and she inquired after 
                         you, ma'am, and all the young ladies, 
                         especially miss dashwood, and bid me 
                         i should give you her and mr ferrars's 
                         best compliments and service and how 
                         they'd be sure to send you a piece 
                         of the cake.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         was mr ferrars in the carriage with 
                         her?

                                     thomas
                         yes, ma'am--i just seen him leaning 
                         back in it, but he did not look up.

               elinor screws up her courage.

                                     elinor
                         did--

               but she cannot continue. marianne glances at her 
               compassionately and takes over.

                                     marianne
                         did mrs ferrars seem well?

                                     thomas
                         yes, miss marianne--she said how she 
                         was vastly contented and, since she 
                         was always a very affable young lady, 
                         i made free to wish her joy.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         thank you, thomas.

               he nods and leaves, confused by the silent atmosphere. elinor 
               sits for a moment, then gets up and walks out.
