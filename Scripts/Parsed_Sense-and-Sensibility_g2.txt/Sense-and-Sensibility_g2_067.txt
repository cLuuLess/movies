               int. barton cottage - parlour - day

               elinor leads in willoughby. mrs dashwood greets him with 
               outstretched arms.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         mr willoughby! what a pleasure to 
                         see you again!

                                     willoughby
                         the pleasure is all mine, i can 
                         asstire you. i trust miss marianne 
                         has not caught cold?

                                     marianne
                         you have found out my name!

                                     willoughby
                         of course. the neighbourhood is 
                         crawling with my spies.

               he suddenly produces a bunch of wild flowers from behind his 
               back and offers them to marianne with a courtly, humorous 
               bow.

                                     willoughby
                         and since you cannot venture out to 
                         nature, nature must be brought to 
                         you!

                                     marianne
                         how beautiful. these are not from 
                         the hothouse.

               willoughby sees brandon's flowers.

                                     willoughby
                         ah! i see mine is not the first 
                         offering, nor the most elegant. i am 
                         afraid i obtained these from an 
                         obliging field.

                                     marianne
                         but i have always preferred wild 
                         flowers!

                                     willoughby
                         i suspected as much.

               elinor takes the delicate flowers from willoughby.

                                     elinor
                         i will put these in water.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         our gratitude, mr willoughby, is 
                         beyond expression--

                                     willoughby
                         but it is i who am grateful. i have 
                         often passed this cottage and grieved 
                         for its lonely state--and then the 
                         first news i had from lady allen 
                         when i arrived was that it was taken. 
                         i felt a peculiar interest in the 
                         event which nothing can account for 
                         but my present delight in meeting 
                         you.

               he is merry, spirited, voluble--a breath of fresh air. elinor 
               brings back willoughby's flowers and places them next to 
               brandon's on the side table.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         pray sit down, mr willoughby.

               she indicates a chair but willoughby sees a book lying on 
               marianne's footstool, picks it up and--to her great delight--
               sits down on the stool at her feet.

                                     willoughby
                         who is reading shakespeare's sonnets?

               everyone answers at once.

                                     marianne/elinor/mrs dashwood
                         i am. / we all are. / marianne.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         marianne has been reading them out 
                         to us.

                                     willoughby
                         which are your favourites?

               it is a general question but marianne gaily commandeers it.

                                     marianne
                         without a doubt, mine is 116.

                                     willoughby
                         let me not to the marriage of true 
                         minds admit impediments. love is not 
                         love which alters when it alteration 
                         finds, or bends with the remover to 
                         remove--then how does it go?

                                     marianne
                         '0, no! it is an ever-fixed mark.'

               willoughby joins in the line halfway through and continues. 
               elinor and mrs dashwood exchange glances. clearly, their 
               contribution to this conversation will be minimal.

                                     willoughby
                         'that looks on storms'--or is it 
                         tempests? let me find it.

               willoughby gets out a tiny leatherbound book.

                                     willoughby
                         it is strange you should be reading 
                         them--for, look, i carry this with 
                         me always.

               it is a miniature copy of the sonnets. marianne is delighted, 
               and, mutually astonished at this piece of synchronicity, 
               they proceed to look up other favourites, chatting as though 
               they were already intimates.

               mrs dashwood smiles at elinor with satisfaction. elinor, 
               amused, picks up her sewing. margaret stares. willoughby and 
               marianne are oblivious to everything but each other.
