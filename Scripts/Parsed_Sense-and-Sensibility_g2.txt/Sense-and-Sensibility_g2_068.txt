               ext. barton cottage - garden path - day

               willoughby is leaving. he has a flower from marianne's bunch 
               in his buttonhole and is on his horse, looking about as virile 
               as his horse. everyone has come out to say goodbye, marianne 
               supported by elinor and mrs dashwood.

                                     willoughby
                         till tomorrow! and my pocket sonnets 
                         are yours, miss marianne! a talisman 
                         against further injury!

                                     marianne
                         goodbye! thank you!

               he gallops off. they all wave. margaret follows him down the 
               road for a while.

                                     elinor
                         good work, marianne! you have covered 
                         all forms of poetry; another meeting 
                         will ascertain his views on nature 
                         and romantic attachments and then 
                         you will have nothing left to talk 
                         about and the acquaintanceship will 
                         be over.

                                     marianne
                         i suppose i have erred against 
                         decorum. i should have been dull and 
                         spiritless and talked only of the 
                         weather, or the state of the roads.

                                     elinor
                         no, but mr willoughby can be in no 
                         doubt of your enthusiasm for him.

                                     marianne
                         why should he doubt it? why should i 
                         hide my regard?

                                     elinor
                         no particular reason, marianne, only 
                         that we know so little of him--

                                     marianne
                         but time alone does not determine 
                         intimacy. seven years would be 
                         insufficient to make some people 
                         acquainted with each other and seven 
                         days are more than enough for others.

                                     elinor
                         or seven hours in this case.

                                     marianne
                         i feel i know mr willoughby well 
                         already. if i had weaker, more shallow 
                         feelings perhaps i could conceal 
                         them, as you do--

               then she realises what she's said.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         marianne, that is not fair--

                                     marianne
                         i am sorry, elinor, i did not mean

                                     elinor
                         i know. do not trouble yourself, 
                         marianne.

               elinor turns back into the house.

                                     marianne
                         i do not understand her, mamma. why 
                         does she never mention edward? i 
                         have never even seen her cry about 
                         him, or about norland.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         nor i. but elinor is not like you or 
                         i, dear. she does not like to be 
                         swayed by her emotions.
