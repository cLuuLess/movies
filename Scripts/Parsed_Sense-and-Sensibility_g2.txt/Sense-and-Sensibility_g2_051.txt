               int. sir john's carriage - night

               the dashwoods are returning home. a row is in progress.

                                     marianne
                              (to margaret)
                         as for you, you have no right, no 
                         right at all, to parade your ignorant 
                         assumptions--

                                     margaret
                         they are not assumptions. you told 
                         me.

               elinor stares at marianne. marianne colours and attacks 
               margaret again.

                                     marianne
                         i told you nothing--

                                     margaret
                         they'll meet him when he comes, 
                         anyway.

                                     marianne
                         that is not the point. you do not 
                         speak of such things before strangers--

                                     margaret
                         but everyone else was--

                                     marianne
                         mrs jennings is not everyone.

                                     margaret
                         i like her! she talks about things. 
                         we never talk about things.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         hush, please, now that is enough, 
                         margaret. if you cannot think of 
                         anything appropriate to say, you 
                         will please restrict your remarks to 
                         the weather.

               a heated pause.

                                     margaret
                         i like colonel brandon too. he's 
                         been to places.
