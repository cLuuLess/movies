               int. norland park - dining room - early eve

               the entire family, with the exception of margaret, is present. 
               betsy is serving food in an atmosphere of stiff silence. 
               cutlery clinks. john chews loudly. marianne is rigid with 
               resentment. mrs dashwood maintains a cool, removed dignity. 
               elinor tries to play hostess.

                                     elinor
                         how is mrs ferrars?

                                     fanny
                         my mother is always in excellent 
                         health, thank you. my brother robert 
                         is in town with her this season and 
                         quite the most popular bachelor in 
                         london! he has his own barouche.

               in the brief silence which follows this, fanny surreptitiously 
               checks the hallmark on her butterknife.

                                     elinor
                         you have two brothers, have you not?

                                     fanny
                         indeed, yes. edward is the eldest 
                         mamma quite depends upon him. he is 
                         traveling up from plymouth shortly 
                         and will break his journey here.

               mrs dashwood looks at elinor pointedly. john notices.

                                     john
                              (to mrs dashwood)
                         if that is agreeable to you, of 
                         course.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         my dear john this is your home now.

               fanny looks about, barely able to conceal her satisfaction.
