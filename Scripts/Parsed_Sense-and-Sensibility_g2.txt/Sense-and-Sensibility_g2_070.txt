               after dinner. tea has been served. elinor, colonel brandon, 
               mrs dashwood and mrs jennings play at cards. in a far corner 
               of the room, marianne is concentrating as she draws a 
               silhouette.

               willoughby's profile glows behind the screen in front of 
               her, she looks up and stops, gazing, bewitched, at his beauty. 
               the lips move--a whisper: marianne. then, louder: haven't 
               you finished? he moves out from behind the screen, eyes full 
               of laughter. they look at each other.
