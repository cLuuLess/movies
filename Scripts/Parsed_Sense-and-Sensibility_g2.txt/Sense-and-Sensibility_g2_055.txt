               ext. barton park - gardens - day

               an outdoor luncheon is in progress. colonel brandon is talking 
               to mrs dashwood. occasionally he looks over towards marianne, 
               who is playing bilboquet with sir john and margaret. mrs 
               jennings nudges elinor hard and gestures to brandon.

                                     mrs jennings
                              (stage whisper)
                         besotted! excellent match, for he is 
                         rich and she is handsome.

                                     elinor
                         how long have you known the colonel?

                                     mrs jennings
                         oh, lord bless you, as long as ever 
                         i have been here, and i came fifteen 
                         years back. his estate at delaford 
                         is but four miles hence and he and 
                         john are very thick. he has no wife 
                         or children of his own, for--

               mrs jennings lowers her voice to a stentorian whisper.

                                     mrs jennings
                         --he has a tragic history. he loved 
                         a girl once--twenty years ago now--a 
                         ward to his family, but they were 
                         not permitted to marry...

               elinor is intrigued.

                                     elinor
                         on what grounds?

                                     mrs jennings
                         money. eliza was poor. when the father 
                         discovered their amour, she was flung 
                         out of the house and he packed off 
                         into the army. i believe he would 
                         have done himself a harm if not for 
                         john...

                                     elinor
                         what became of the lady?

                                     mrs jennings
                         oh, she was passed from man to man--
                         disappeared from all good society. 
                         when brandon got back from india he 
                         searched for heaven knows how long, 
                         only to find her dying in a poor 
                         house. you have seen how it has 
                         affected him. once i thought my 
                         daughter charlotte might have cheered 
                         him up, but she is much better off 
                         where she is.

               elinor is silent with amazement at this unexpected history.

                                     mrs jennings
                         look at him now, though. so attentive. 
                         i shall try an experiment on him.

                                     elinor
                         oh no, please, dear mrs jennings, 
                         leave the poor colonel alone.

                                     mrs jennings
                         no, no, it is just the thing--all 
                         suitors need a little help, my dear

               mrs jennings winks at elinor and rubs her hands as though 
               about to perform a magic trick.

                                     mrs jennings
                              (trillingly)
                         colonel brandon!

               brandon looks up.

                                     mrs jennings
                         we have not heard you play for us of 
                         late!

                                     colonel brandon
                         for the simple reason that you have 
                         a far superior musician here.

               he indicates marianne, who smiles absently.

                                     mrs jennings
                         perhaps you did not know, miss 
                         marianne, that our dear brandon shares 
                         your passion for music and plays the 
                         piano forte very well.

               marianne looks at brandon in some surprise.

                                     mrs jennings
                         play us a duet!

               brandon looks at mrs jennings warningly but she ignores him.

                                     mrs jennings
                         i'll trow you know quite as many 
                         melancholy tunes as miss marianne!

               her tone is so knowing that marianne frowns uncomfortably.

                                     mrs jennings
                         come! let us see you both side by 
                         side!

               marianne rises impatiently.

                                     marianne
                         i do not know any duets. forgive me, 
                         colonel.

               she moves away. mrs jennings chuckles.
