                         this reproach from you! you, who 
                         confide in no one.

                                     elinor
                         i have nothing to tell.

                                     marianne
                         nor i. we have neither of us anything 
                         to tell. i because i conceal nothing 
                         and you because you communicate 
                         nothing.
