               ext. meadow near barton cottage - day

               having been denied their trip, the dashwoods and willoughby 
               have set out an impromptu picnic. willoughby is wandering 
               restlessly about.

               the weather is sublime.

                                     willoughby
                         frailty, thy name is brandon!

                                     marianne
                         there are some people who cannot 
                         bear a party of pleasure. i think he 
                         wrote the letter himself as a trick 
                         for getting out of it.

                                     mrs dashwood
                              (indulgently)
                         you are a very wicked pair, colonel 
                         brandon will be sadly missed.

                                     willoughby
                         why? when he is the kind of man that 
                         everyone speaks well of and no one 
                         wants to talk to.

                                     marianne
                         exactly!

                                     elinor
                         nonsense.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         colonel brandon is very highly 
                         esteemed at the park.

                                     willoughby
                         which is enough censure in itself.

                                     elinor
                              (half laughing)
                         really, willoughby!

                                     willoughby
                              (imitating mrs jennings 
                              perfectly)
                         come, come, mr impudence--i know you 
                         and your wicked ways--oh!

               he gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing 
               her walk. he comes up to elinor and puts his head on her 
               shoulder.

                                     willoughby
                         come, miss dashwood, reveal your 
                         beau, reveal him, i say! let's have 
                         no secrets between friends! let me 
                         winkle them out of you!

               elinor hits him on the nose with her teaspoon and he waddles 
               off to marianne.

                                     willoughby
                              (as mrs jennings)
                         i declare, miss marianne, if i do 
                         not have you married to the colonel 
                         by teatime, i shall swallow my own 
                         bonnet.

               marianne laughs. willoughby drops the parody suddenly.

                                     willoughby
                         as if you could marry such a 
                         character.

                                     elinor
                         why should you dislike him?

               there is indeed an edge to willoughby's raillery. he flicks 
               elinor an almost alarmed glance and then sweeps marianne to 
               her feet and starts to dance around the garden with her.

                                     willoughby
                         because he has threatened me with 
                         rain when i wanted it fine, he has 
                         found fault with the balance of my 
                         curricle and i cannot persuade him 
                         to buy my brown mare. if it will be 
                         of any satisfaction to you, however, 
                         to be told i believe his character 
                         to be in all other respects 
                         irreproachable, i am ready to confess 
                         it. and in return for an 
                         acknowledgement that must give me 
                         some pain.
                              (he is slowing down)
                         you cannot deny me the privilege...
                              (slower still)
                         of disliking him...
                              (and stopping)
                         as much as i adore...

               he and marianne are standing looking at each other. the 
               expression on willoughby's face is heart-stopping. margaret 
               has stopped eating and is staring with her mouth open.

               elinor glances at mrs dashwood but she is gazing up at them 
               with almost as many stars in her eyes as marianne.

               suddenly willoughby breaks the mood by swinging away from 
               marianne and gesturing to the house.

                                     willoughby
                         --this cottage!

               the tension is broken. margaret starts to chew again.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         i have great plans for improvements 
                         to it, you know, mr willoughby.

                                     willoughby
                         now that i will never consent to. 
                         not a stone must be added to its 
                         walls. were i rich enough, i would 
                         instantly pull down combe magna and 
                         build it up again in the exact image 
                         of that cottage!

                                     elinor
                         with dark, narrow stairs, a poky 
                         hall and a fire that smokes?

                                     willoughby
                         especially the fire that smokes! 
                         then i might be as happy at combe 
                         magna as i have been at barton.

               he looks at marianne, who has gone to sit at her mother's 
               feet.

                                     willoughby
                         but this place has one claim on my 
                         affection which no other can possibly 
                         share.

               marianne is so irradiated with happiness that she looks like 
               an angel.

                                     willoughby
                         promise me you will never change it.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         i do not have the heart.

                                     elinor
                         or the money.
