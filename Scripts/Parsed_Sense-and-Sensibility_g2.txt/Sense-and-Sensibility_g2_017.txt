               int. norland park - elinor's bedroom - day

               elinor is sitting with a little pile of parcels. she puts a 
               shawl into some paper and ties it with ribbon as marianne 
               thunders in, looking mutinous.

                                     marianne
                         fanny wishes to know where the key 
                         for the silver cabinet is kept.

                                     elinor
                         betsy has it, i think. what does 
                         fanny want with the silver?

                                     marianne
                         i can only presume she wants to count 
                         it. what are you doing?

                                     elinor
                         presents for the servants. have you 
                         seen margaret? i am worried about 
                         her. she has taken to hiding in the 
                         oddest places.

                                     marianne
                         fortunate girl. at least she can 
                         escape fanny, which is more than any 
                         of us is able.

                                     elinor
                         you do your best. you have not said 
                         a word to her for a week.

                                     marianne
                              (truculently)
                         i have! i have said 'yes' and 'no'.
