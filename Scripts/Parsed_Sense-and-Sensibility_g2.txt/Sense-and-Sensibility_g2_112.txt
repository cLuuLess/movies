               int. mrs jennings's house - bedroom - night

               marianne is sitting on the bed staring into space. elinor is 
               kneeling by her, holding her hands.

                                     elinor
                         dearest, was i right to tell you?

                                     marianne
                         of course.

                                     elinor
                         whatever his past actions, whatever 
                         his present course, at least you may 
                         be certain that he loved you.

                                     marianne
                         but not enough. not enough.
