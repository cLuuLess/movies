               int. norland park - drawing room - day

               everyone except margaret is present. edward has just shaken 
               bands with elinor. he behaves with great respect to the 
               dashwoods and seems embarrassed by fanny's pro prietorial 
               air.

                                     fanny
                         but where is miss margaret? i declare, 
                         mrs dashwood, i am beginning to doubt 
                         of her existence! she must run 
                         positively wild!

                                     mrs dashwood
                         forgive us, mr ferrars. my youngest 
                         is not to be found this morning. she 
                         is a little shy of strangers at 
                         present.

                                     edward
                         naturally. i am also shy of strangers 
                         and i have nothing like her excuse.

                                     marianne
                              (dangerous)
                         how do you like your view, mr ferrars?

               elinor glances at her warningly but edward replies with 
               careful consideration.

                                     edward
                         very much. your stables are very 
                         handsome and beautifully kept, mrs 
                         dashwood.

                                     fanny
                         stables! edward--your windows overlook 
                         the lake.

                                     edward
                         an oversight, fanny, led me to the 
                         wrong room. i have rectified the 
                         situation and am happily settled in 
                         the guest quarters.

               marianne and elinor look at each other in surprise. fanny 
               looks furious.

               mrs dashwood smiles warmly at edward.

               close on elinor. she is impressed.
