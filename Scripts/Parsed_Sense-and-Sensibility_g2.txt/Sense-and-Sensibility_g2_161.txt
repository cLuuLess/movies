               int. cleveland - elinor and marianne's bedroom - later

               marianne lies in the grip of her fever. elinor sits watching 
               her. slowly she rises and walks to the bed. when she speaks, 
               her tone is very practical.

                                     elinor
                         marianne, marianne, please try--

               suddenly, almost unconsciously, she starts to heave with dry 
               sobs, wrenched out of her, full of anguish and heartbreak 
               and all the more painful for being tearless.

                                     elinor
                         marianne, please try--i cannot--i

                         have tried to bear everything else--
                         i will try--but please, dearest, 
                         beloved marianne, do not leave me 
                         alone.

               she falls to her knees by the bed, gulping for breath, taking 
               marianne's hand and kissing it again and again.

                                                                  dissolve:
