               int. mrs jennings's house - study - day

               elinor is waiting. the maid announces edward and he walks in 
               momentarily. they are alone for the first time in months and 
               for a moment, neither speaks.

                                     elinor
                         mr ferrars.

                                     edward
                         miss dashwood.

               elinor indicates a seat for him but neither sits.

                                     elinor
                         thank you for responding so promptly 
                         to my message.

                                     edward
                         i was most grateful to receive it. i--
                         miss dashwood, god knows what you 
                         must think of me...

                                     elinor
                         mr ferrars--

               he interrupts her, desperate to explain.

                                     edward
                         i have no right to speak, i know--

               elinor has to stop him.

                                     elinor
                         mr ferrars, i have good news. i think 
                         you know of our friend colonel 
                         brandon?

               edward looks completely bewildered.

                                     edward
                         yes, i have heard his name.

               elinor starts to speak rather faster than usual.

                                     elinor
                         colonel brandon desires me to say 
                         that, understanding you wish to join 
                         the clergy, he has great pleasure in 
                         offering you the parish on his estate 
                         at delaford, now just vacant, in the 
                         hope that it may enable you--and 
                         miss steele--to marry.

               edward cannot at first take it in. elinor sits down.

                                     edward
                         colonel brandon?

                                     elinor
                         yes. he means it as testimony of his 
                         concern for--for the cruel situation 
                         in which you find yourselves.

               now edward sits--in shock.

                                     edward
                         colonel brandon give me a parish? 
                         can it be possible?

                                     elinor
                         the unkindness of your family has 
                         made you astonished to find friendship 
                         elsewhere.

               edward looks at elinor, his eyes full of growing 
               comprehension.

                                     edward
                         no. not to find it in you. i cannot 
                         be ignorant that to you--to your 
                         goodness--i owe it all. i feel it. i 
                         would express it if i could, but, as 
                         you know, i am no orator.

                                     elinor
                         you are very much mistaken. i assure 
                         you that you owe it almost entirely 
                         to your own merit--i have had no 
                         hand in it.

               but edward clearly believes she has been instrumental in the 
               offer. he frowns slightly before speaking with rather an 
               effort.

                                     edward
                         colonel brandon must be a man of 
                         great worth and respect ability.

               elinor finds some relief in saying at least one thing that 
               she truly means.

                                     elinor
                         he is the kindest and best of men.

               this makes edward seem even more depressed. he sits silent 
               for a moment but then rouses himself to action.

                                     edward
                         may i enquire why the colonel did 
                         not tell me himself?

                                     elinor
                         i think he felt it would be better 
                         coming from... a friend.

               edward looks at elinor, his eyes full of sadness.

                                     edward
                         your friendship has been the most 
                         important of my life.

                                     elinor
                         you will always have it.

                                     edward
                         forgive me.

                                     elinor
                         mr ferrars, you honour your promises--
                         that is more important than anything 
                         else. i wish you--both--very happy.

               they rise. she curtsies. he bows.

                                     edward
                         goodbye, miss dashwood.

               edward leaves silently. elinor stands stock-still in the 
               middle of the room.
