               int. mrs jennings's house - drawing room - day

               marianne and elinor have changed from their traveling clothes 
               and are having a cup of tea. at least, elinor is. marianne 
               is pacing up and down in front of the window.

                                     elinor
                         john and fanny are in town. i think 
                         we shall be forced to see them.

               there is a faint knocking from somewhere. marianne jumps.

                                     elinor
                         i think it was for next door.

               marianne looks out of the window.

                                     marianne
                         yes, you are right.

               she sits down with a rueful smile. suddenly a much louder 
               rap is heard and they both jump. we hear a bustling 
               downstairs. marianne can hardly breathe. she goes to the 
               drawing-room door, opens it, goes out, comes back in. we 
               hear a man's voice.

                                     marianne
                         oh, elinor! it is willoughby, indeed 
                         it is!

               she turns and almost throws herself into the arms of colonel 
               brandon.

                                     marianne
                         oh! excuse me, colonel--

               she leaves the room hastily. elinor is so ashamed of 
               marianne's rudeness that she does not at first notice 
               brandon's mood of tense distress.

                                     elinor
                         colonel brandon, what a pleasure to 
                         see you! have you been in london all 
                         this while?

                                     colonel brandon
                         i have. how is your dear mother?

                                     elinor
                         very well, thank you.

               silence.

                                     elinor
                         colonel, is there anything--

               but brandon interrupts her.

                                     colonel brandon
                         forgive me, miss dashwood, but i 
                         have heard reports through town... 
                         is it impossible to--but i could 
                         have no chance of succeeding--indeed 
                         i hardly know what to do. tell me 
                         once and for all, is everything 
                         finally resolved between your sister 
                         and mr willoughby?

               elinor is torn between discomfiture and compassion.

                                     elinor
                         colonel, though neither one has 
                         informed me of their under standing, 
                         i have no doubt of their mutual 
                         affection.

               brandon stands very still.

                                     colonel brandon
                         thank you, miss dashwood. to your 
                         sister i wish all imaginable 
                         happiness. to mr willoughby, that 
                         he... may endeavour to deserve her.

               his tone is heavy with some bitter meaning.

                                     elinor
                         what do you mean?

               but he recollects himself.

                                     colonel brandon
                         forgive me, i--forgive me.

               he bows and leaves abruptly. elinor is deeply troubled.
