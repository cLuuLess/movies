               int. norland park - mr dashwood's bedroom - night

               in the dim light shed by candles we see a bed in which a man 
               (mr dashwood, 52) lies his skin waxy, his breathing laboured. 
               around him two silhouettes move and murmur, their clothing 
               susurrating in the deathly hush. doctors. a woman (mrs 
               dashwood, 50) sits by his side, holding his hand, her eyes 
               never leaving his face.

                                     mr dashwood
                              (urgent)
                         is john not yet arrived?

                                     mrs dashwood
                         we expect him at any moment, dearest.

               mr dashwood looks anguished.

                                     mr dashwood
                         the girls--i have left so little.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         shh, hush, henry.

                                     mr dashwood
                         elinor will try to look after you 
                         all, but make sure she finds a good 
                         husband. the men are such noodles 
                         hereabouts, little wonder none has 
                         pleased her.

               they smile at each other. mrs dashwood is just managing to 
               conceal her fear and grief

                                     mrs dashwood
                         but marianne is sure to find her 
                         storybook hero.

                                     mr dashwood
                         a romantic poet with flashing eyes 
                         and empty pockets?

                                     mrs dashwood
                         as long as she loves him, whoever he 
                         is.

                                     mr dashwood
                         margaret will go to sea and become a 
                         pirate so we need not concern 
                         ourselves with her.

               mrs dashwood tries to laugh but it emerges as a sob. an older 
               manservant (thomas) now enters, anxiety written on every 
               feature.

                                     thomas
                         your son is arrived from london, 
                         sir.

               mr dashwood squeezes his wife's hand.

                                     mr dashwood
                         let me speak to john alone.

               she nods quickly and he smiles at her with infinite 
               tenderness.

                                     mr dashwood
                         ah, my dear. how happy you have made 
                         me.

               mrs dashwood makes a superhuman effort and smiles back. she 
               allows thomas to help her out. she passes john dashwood as 
               he enters, presses his hand, but cannot speak. john takes 
               her place by the bed.

                                     john
                         father...

               mr dashwood summons his last ounces of energy and starts to 
               whisper with desperate intensity.

                                     mr dashwood
                         john you will find out soon enough 
                         from my will that the estate of 
                         norland was left to me in such a way 
                         as prevents me from dividing it 
                         between my families.

               john blinks. he cannot quite take it in.

                                     john
                         calm yourself, father. this is not 
                         good for you.

               but mr dashwood continues with even greater determination.

                                     mr dashwood
                         norland in its entirety is therefore 
                         yours by law and i am happy for you 
                         and fanny.

               john looks torn between genuine distress and unexpected 
               delight.

                                     mr dashwood
                         but your stepmother my wife and 
                         daughters are left with only five 
                         hundred pounds a year, barely enough 
                         to live on and nothing for the girls' 
                         dowries. you must help them.

               john's face is a picture of conflicting emotions. behind 
               them is the ominous rustling of parchments.

                                     john
                         of course

                                     mr dashwood
                         you must promise to do this.

               a brief moment of sincerity overcomes john's natural 
               hypocrisy.

                                     john
                         i promise, father, i promise.

               mr dashwood seems relieved. suddenly his breathing changes. 
               john looks alarmed. he rises and we hear him going to find 
               the doctor.

                                     john
                         come! come quickly!

               but it is we who share the dying man's last words.

                                     mr dashwood
                         help them.
