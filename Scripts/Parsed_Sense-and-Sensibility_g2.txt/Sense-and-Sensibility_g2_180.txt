                         it must be. he said he would arrive 
                         today. you must play him the new 
                         song, marianne.

               suddenly there is a yell from margaret's tree.

                                     margaret
                         edward!

               margaret practically throws herself out of the tree onto the 
               grass.

                                     margaret
                         it is edward!

               the women look at each other in complete consternation.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         calm. we must be calm.
