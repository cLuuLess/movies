               int. mrs jennings's house - bedroom - night

               elinor wakes up. the flickering of a candle has disturbed 
               her. she sits up in bed and sees marianne sitting at the 
               desk in her nightgown, writing another letter.

                                     elinor
                         marianne, is anything wrong?

                         nothing at all. go back to sleep.
