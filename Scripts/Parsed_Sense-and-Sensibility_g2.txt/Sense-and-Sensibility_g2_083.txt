               int. barton cottage - parlour - day

               elinor, margaret and mrs dashwood enter to find willoughby 
               standing in a frozen attitude by the fireplace.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         willoughby! what is the matter?

                                     willoughby
                         i--forgive me, mrs dashwood. i am 
                         sent--that is to say, lady allen has 
                         exercised the privilege of riches 
                         upon a dependent cousin and is sending 
                         me to london.

               he cannot look any of them in the eye.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         when--this morning?

                                     willoughby
                         almost this moment.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         how very disappointing! but your 
                         business will not detain you from us 
                         for long, i hope?

                                     willoughby
                         you are very kind--but i have no 
                         idea of returning immediately to 
                         devonshire. i am seldom invited to 
                         allenham more than once a year.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         for shame, willoughby! can you wait 
                         for an invitation from barton cottage?

                                     willoughby
                         my engagements at present are of 
                         such a nature--that is--i dare not 
                         flatter myself--

               the atmosphere is thick with tension. willoughby flicks a 
               glance at the three women staring at him in mute astonishment.

                                     willoughby
                         it is folly to linger in this manner. 
                         i will not torment myself further.

               he rushes past them and out of the cottage. they follow him 
               to the door.
