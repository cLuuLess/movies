               int. mrs jennings's house - breakfast room - day

               a silent breakfast. marianne is red-eyed from crying and 
               limp from lack of sleep. mrs jennings is dressed to go out, 
               pulling on her gloves and bustling as usual. pigeon enters 
               with a letter on a salver. he offers it to marianne. she 
               seizes it and runs out of the room. mrs jennings chuckles.

                                     mrs jennings
                         there now! lovers' quarrels are swift 
                         to heal! that letter will do the 
                         trick, mark my word.

               she goes to the door.

                                     mrs jennings
                         i must be off. i hope he won't keep 
                         her waiting much longer, miss 
                         dashwood. it hurts to see her looking 
                         so forlorn.

               she leaves and elinor finds herself alone with lucy, who 
               loses no time in sharing her new-found happiness.

                                     lucy
                         what a welcome i had from edward's 
                         family, miss dashwood--i am surprised 
                         you never told me what an agreeable 
                         woman your sister-in-law is! and mr 
                         robert--all so affable!

                                     elinor
                         it is perhaps fortunate that none of 
                         them knows of your engagement. excuse 
                         me.

               elinor rises and leaves.
