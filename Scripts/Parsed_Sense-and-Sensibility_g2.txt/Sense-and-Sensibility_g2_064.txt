               the rain has cleared. sir john's horse munches grass 
               contentedly by the side of the road.

                                     sir john (v.o.)
                         mr willoughby is well worth catching, 
                         miss dashwood--miss marianne must 
                         not expect to have all the men to 
                         herself!
