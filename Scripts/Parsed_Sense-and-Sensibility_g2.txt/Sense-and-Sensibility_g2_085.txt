               int. barton cottage - parlour - day

               they all rush back into the parlour.

                                     elinor
                         meg, dearest, please ask betsy to 
                         make a cup of hot tea for marianne.

               margaret nods dumbly and goes. mrs dashwood has her arms 
               around marianne.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         what is wrong, my love?

                                     marianne
                         nothing! please do not ask me 
                         questions!

               marianne struggles free.

                                     marianne
                         please let me be!

               she runs off upstairs and we hear her bedroom door slamming. 
               there is a moment of stunned silence.

                                     elinor
                         they must have quarreled.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         that is unlikely. perhaps this--lady 
                         allen--disapproves of his regard for 
                         marianne and has invented an excuse 
                         to send him away?

                                     elinor
                         then why did he not say as much? it 
                         is not like willoughby to be 
                         secretive. did he think marianne was 
                         richer than she is?

                                     mrs dashwood
                         how could he?

               she gestures to the room and then looks at elinor with a 
               frown.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         what is it you suspect him of?

                                     elinor
                         i can hardly tell you. but why was 
                         his manner so guilty?

                                     mrs dashwood
                         what are you saying, elinor? that he 
                         has been acting a part to your sister 
                         for all this time?

               mrs dashwood is getting defensive. elinor pauses to think.

                                     elinor
                         no, he loves her, i am sure.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         of course he loves her!

                                     elinor
                         but has he left her with any assurance 
                         of his return? cannot you ask her if 
                         he has proposed?

                                     mrs dashwood
                         certainly not. i cannot force a 
                         confidence from marianne and nor 
                         must you. we must trust her to confide 
                         in us in her own time.

                                     elinor
                              (shaking her head)
                         there was something so underhand in 
                         the manner of his leaving.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         you are resolved, then, to think the 
                         worst of him.

                                     elinor
                         not resolved--

                                     mrs dashwood
                              (cold)
                         i prefer to give him the benefit of 
                         my good opinion. he deserves no less. 
                         from all of us.

               she stalks out of the room and starts up the stairs. elinor 
               follows her.

                                     elinor
                         mamma, i am very fond of willoughby--

               mrs dashwood goes into her bedroom and shuts the door. elinor 
               is halfway up the stairs. she meets a wet-eyed margaret coming 
               down with a cup of tea.

                                     margaret
                         she would not let me in.

               elinor takes the cup and margaret runs out into the garden 
               in tears.

               the sound of sobbing also comes from marianne's room, and 
               now from mrs dashwood's as well. elinor sits down helplessly 
               on the stairs and drinks the tea.
