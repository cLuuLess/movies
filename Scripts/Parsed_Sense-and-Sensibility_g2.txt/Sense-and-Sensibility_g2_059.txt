               int. barton cottage - dining room - day

               rain is thudding against the window from which mrs dashwood 
               turns, looking very worried.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         marianne was sure it would not rain.

                         which invariably means it will.

               but we can see she is trying to conceal her anxiety from her 
               mother. there are noises in the hall.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         at last!

               margaret runs into the room dripping wet.

                                     margaret
                         she fell over! she fell down--and 
                         he's carrying her!
