               ext. the hill - day

               marianne has reached the top. soaked to the skin, she stands 
               with the storm raging around her, staring at the spires of 
               combe magna, the place that would have been her home. rain 
               streaks her face and the wind whips her hair about her. 
               through frozen lips she whispers:

                                     marianne
                         love is not love which alters when 
                         it alteration finds or bends with 
                         the remover to remove: 0, no! it is 
                         an ever-fixed mark that looks on 
                         tempests and is never shaken...
