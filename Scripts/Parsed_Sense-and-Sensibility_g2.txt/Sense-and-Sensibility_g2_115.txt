               int. john and fanny's town house - drawing room - day

               lucy is sitting with fanny, who is doing some pointless 
               basketwork. lucy hands fanny rushes.

                                     lucy
                         poor miss marianne looked very badly 
                         t'other day. when i think of her, 
                         deserted and abandoned, it frightens 
                         me to think i shall never marry.

                                     fanny
                         nonsense. you will marry far better 
                         than either of the dashwood girls.

                                     lucy
                         how can that possibly be?

                                     fanny
                         you have ten times their sense and 
                         looks.

                                     lucy
                         but i have no dowry.

                                     fanny
                         there are qualities which will always 
                         make up for that, and you have them 
                         in abundance. it would not surprise 
                         me if you were to marry far and away 
                         beyond your expectations.

                                     lucy
                         i wish it might be so. there is a 
                         young man--

                                     fanny
                         ah ha! i am glad to hear of it. is 
                         he of good breeding and fortune?

                                     lucy
                         oh both--but his family would 
                         certainly oppose the match.

                                     fanny
                         tush! they will allow it as soon as 
                         they see you, my dear.

                                     lucy
                         it is a very great secret. i have 
                         told no one in the world for fear of 
                         discovery.

               fanny looks up, curious to know more.

                                     fanny
                         my dear, i am the soul of discretion.

                                     lucy
                         if i dared tell...

                                     fanny
                         i can assure you i am as silent as 
                         the grave.

               lucy leans forward to whisper in fanny's ear.
