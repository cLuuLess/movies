               mr palmer and charlotte are sitting at the breakfast table. 
               brandon is pacing. the rain has stopped.

                                     charlotte
                         you'll wear yourself out, colonel! 
                         do not worry! a day or two in bed 
                         will soon set her to rights!

                                     mr palmer
                         you can rely upon harris, colonel. i 
                         have never found a better physician.

               enter elinor with dr harris.

                                     colonel brandon
                              (urgent)
                         what is your diagnosis?

                                     dr harris
                         it is an infectious fever that has 
                         taken far more serious hold than i 
                         would have expected in one so young. 
                         i would recommend the hasty removal 
                         of your child, mr palmer--

               charlotte runs out of the room screaming.

                                     charlotte
                         mrs bunting! mrs bunting!
