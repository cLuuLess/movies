               int. cleveland - drawing room - day

               charlotte, mr palmer and elinor are waiting anxiously. baby 
               thomas has been removed. elinor is staring out of the window.

                                     charlotte
                         one thing is certain--she will be 
                         wet through when she returns.

                                     mr palmer
                         thank you for pointing that out, my 
                         dear. do not worry, miss dashwood--
                         brandon will find her. i think we 
                         can all guess where she went.
