               int. norland park - drawing room - eve

               dinner is over. john and fanny are examining plans of the 
               norland estate, looking for somewhere to build a hermitage. 
               edward is reading out loud. elinor embroiders and listens. 
               mrs dashwood and marianne make up the rest of the audience, 
               the latter in a state of high impatience.

                                     edward
                         no voice divine the storm allayed no 
                         light propitious shone, when snatched 
                         from all effectual aid, we perished 
                         each alone: but i beneath a rougher 
                         sea, and whelmed in deeper gulfs 
                         than he.

               marianne jumps up and goes to him.

                                     marianne
                         no, edward! listen.

               she takes the book from him and reads the stanza with 
               passionate brio.

                                     marianne
                         can you not feel his despair? try 
                         again.

               rather mortified, edward starts again, but not before 
               receiving a sympathetic look from elinor which seems to 
               comfort him a little.
