               int. barton park - drawing room - eve

               dinner is over. marianne sits listlessly by the window. mr 
               palmer is hiding behind a newspaper. sir john and margaret 
               are looking at a map and discussing routes through china. 
               lucy, charlotte, mrs dashwood and mrs jennings are at cards. 
               elinor is reading.

                                     charlotte
                         oh! if only this rain would stop!

                                     mr palmer
                              (from behind the paper)
                         if only you would stop.

               mrs jennings and charlotte laugh at him.

                                     mrs jennings
                         'twas you took her off my hands, mr 
                         palmer, and a very good bargain you 
                         made of it too, but now i have the 
                         whip hand over you for you cannot 
                         give her back!

               the heavy silence behind the paper attests to the unhappy 
               truth of this statement.

                                     mrs jennings
                         miss marianne, come and play a round 
                         with us! looking out at the weather 
                         will not bring him back.

                                     charlotte
                              (sotto voce)
                         she ate nothing at dinner.

                                     mrs jennings
                         mind, we are all a little forlorn 
                         these days. london has swallowed all 
                         our company.

               charlotte and mrs jennings start to gossip about the 
               disappearances of brandon and willoughby. lucy walks over 
               and sits by elinor, who politely puts aside the book.

                                     lucy
                              (low)
                         dear miss dashwood, perhaps now we 
                         might have our--discussion.

                                     elinor
                         our discussion?

               lucy looks around at mrs jennings and lowers her voice still 
               further, so that elinor is obliged to move her chair nearer.

                                     lucy
                         there is a particular question i 
                         have long wanted to ask you, but 
                         perhaps you will think me impertinent?

                                     elinor
                         i cannot imagine so.

                                     lucy
                         but it is an odd question. forgive 
                         me, i have no wish to trouble you--

               she looks away coyly as if deciding whether to speak.

                                     elinor
                         my dear miss steele--

                                     charlotte
                              (interrupting)
                         miss dashwood, if only mr willoughby 
                         had gone home to combe magna, we 
                         could have taken miss marianne to 
                         see him! for we live but half a mile 
                         away.

                                     mr palmer
                         five and a half.

                                     charlotte
                         no, i cannot believe it is that far, 
                         for you can see the place from the 
                         top of our hill. is it really five 
                         and a half miles? no! i cannot believe 
                         it.

                                     mr palmer
                         try.

                                     elinor
                         you have my permission to ask any 
                         manner of question, if that is of 
                         any help.

                                     lucy
                         thank you. i wonder, are you at all 
                         acquainted with your sister-in-law's 
                         mother? mrs ferrars?

               elinor sits back in deep surprise.

                                     elinor
                         with fanny's mother? no, i have never 
                         met her.

                                     lucy
                         i am sure you think me strange for 
                         inquiring--if i dared tell--

                                     mrs jennings
                              (shouting over)
                         if she tells you aught of the famous 
                         'mr f', lucy, you are to pass it on.

               elinor tries to ignore mrs jennings, who is keeping a curious 
               eye on them.

                                     lucy
                         will you take a turn with me, miss 
                         dashwood?

               lucy rises and takes elinor's arm. she guides her as far 
               away as possible from mrs jennings and charlotte.

                                     elinor
                         i had no idea at all that you were 
                         connected with that family.

                                     lucy
                         oh! i am certainly nothing to mrs 
                         ferrars at present--but the time may 
                         come when we may be very intimately 
                         connected.

                                     elinor
                              (low)
                         what do you mean? do you have an 
                         understanding with fanny's brother 
                         robert?

                                     lucy
                         the youngest? no, i never saw him in 
                         my life. no, with edward.

                                     elinor
                         edward?

               elinor stops walking.

                                     elinor
                         edward ferrars?

               lucy nods.

                                     lucy
                         edward and i have been secretly 
                         engaged these five years.

               elinor is frozen to the spot.

                                     lucy
                         you may well be surprised. i should 
                         never have mentioned it, had i not 
                         known i could entirely trust you to 
                         keep our secret. edward cannot mind 
                         me telling you for he looks on you 
                         quite as his own sister.

               elinor walks on mechanically. disbelief has set in.

                                     elinor
                         i am sorry, but we surely--we cannot 
                         mean the same mr ferrars?

                                     lucy
                         the very same--he was four years 
                         under the tutelage of my uncle mr 
                         pratt, down in plymouth. has he never 
                         spoken of it?

                                     elinor
                              (awareness dawning)
                         mr pratt! yes, i believe he has.

                                     lucy
                         i was very unwilling to enter into 
                         it without his mother's approval but 
                         we loved each other with too great a 
                         passion for prudence. though you do 
                         nor know him so well as i, miss 
                         dashwood, you must have seen how 
                         capable he is of making a woman 
                         sincerely attached to him. i cannot 
                         pretend it has not been very hard on 
                         us both. we can hardly meet above 
                         twice a year.

               she sniffs and produces a large handkerchief which she holds 
               to her eyes so that the monogram is clearly visible. ecf.

               elinor, seeing the copy of the handkerchief she has held so 
               dear, moves quickly to a chair and sits down.

                                     lucy
                         you seem out of sorts, miss dashwood--
                         are you quite well?

                                     elinor
                         perfectly well, thank you.

                                     lucy
                         i have not offended you?

                                     elinor
                         on the contrary.

               mrs jennings has been watching. now she rises, unable to 
               contain herself.

                                     mrs jennings
                         i can stand it no longer, i must 
                         know what you are saying, lucy! miss 
                         dashwood is quite engrossed!

               mrs jennings starts to bear down on them. lucy whispers with 
               real urgency.

                                     lucy
                         oh, miss dashwood, if anyone finds 
                         out, it will ruin him--you must not 
                         tell a soul! edward says you would 
                         not break your word to save your 
                         life! promise me!

               ecu on elinor's face.

                                     elinor
                         i give you my word.

               mrs jennings looms over them.

                                     mrs jennings
                         well, what can have fascinated you 
                         to such an extent, miss dashwood?

                                     charlotte
                         tell us all!

               elinor cannot speak but lucy glides smoothly in.

                                     lucy
                         we were talking of london, ma'am, 
                         and all its--diversions.

                                     mrs jennings
                         do you hear, charlotte?

               mrs jennings claps her hands delightedly.

                                     mrs jennings
                         while you were so busy whispering, 
                         charlotte and i have concocted a 
                         plan!

                                     charlotte
                         it is the best plan in the world.

                                     mrs jennings
                         i make for london shortly and i invite 
                         you, lucy, and both the misses 
                         dashwood to join me!

               elinor cannot hide her dismay. marianne springs from her 
               seat.

                                     marianne
                         london!

                                     margaret
                         oh, can i go! can i go?

                                     mrs dashwood
                         you know perfectly well you are too 
                         young, dearest.

                                     mrs jennings
                         i shall convey you all to my house 
                         in berkeley street and we shall taste 
                         all the delights of the season--what 
                         say you?

                                     margaret
                         oh, please can i go? i'm twelve soon.

                                     charlotte
                         mr palmer, do you not long to have 
                         the misses dashwood come to london?

                                     mr palmer
                         i came into devonshire with no other 
                         view.

               elinor exerts herself.

                                     elinor
                         mrs jennings, you are very kind, but 
                         we cannot possibly leave our mother...

               lucy's calculating eyes turn to mrs dashwood with alacrity.

                                     lucy
                         indeed, the loss would be too great.

               a chorus of objections goes up, particularly from mrs 
               dashwood, who is both delighted and relieved to see marianne 
               with a smile on her face.

                                     mrs jennings
                         your mother can spare you very well.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         of course i can!

                                     charlotte
                         of course she can!

                                     sir john
                         and look at miss marianne--it would 
                         break her heart to deny her!

                                     mrs jennings
                         i will brook no refusal, miss 
                         dashwood!

               marianne claps her hands, her eyes ablaze with joy. mrs 
               jennings takes elinor's hand.

                                     mrs jennings
                         let you and me strike hands upon the 
                         bargain--and if i do not have the 
                         three of you married by christmas, 
                         it will not be my fault!
