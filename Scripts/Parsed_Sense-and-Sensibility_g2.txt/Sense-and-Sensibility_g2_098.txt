               ext. greenwich arcade - london - day

               the palmers, mrs jennings, john, fanny, lucy, elinor and 
               marianne are walking through the arcade. additional wealth 
               has evidently encouraged fanny sartorially and she sprouts 
               as much fruit and feathers as a market stall. lucy is holding 
               elinor's arm in a pinionlike grip. mrs jennings is gossiping 
               with charlotte.

               marianne's good looks are heightened by her feverish 
               expectation of seeing willoughby at every step, and many 
               young men raise their hats to her and turn as she passes.

                                     marianne
                         where is dear edward, john? we expect 
                         to see him daily.

               fanny stiffens. lucy's sharp eyes dart hither and thither. 
               mrs jennings senses gossip. elinor steels herself.

                                     mrs jennings
                         and who is 'dear edward'?

                                     charlotte
                         who indeed?

               fanny smiles glacially.

                                     fanny
                         my brother, mrs jennings--edward 
                         ferrars.

               mrs jennings looks at elinor in sly triumph.

                                     mrs jennings
                         indeed! is that ferrars with an f?

               she and charlotte chuckle to each other. lucy looks at elinor.
