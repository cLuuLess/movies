               int. barton cottage - parlour - day

               marianne is on the sofa by the window. she is pale, 
               convalescent and calm. different somehow. she listens intently 
               as brandon reads her the poem.

                                     colonel brandon
                         nor is the earth the lesse, or loseth 
                         aught. for whatsoever from one place 
                         doth fall, is with the tide unto 
                         another brought...

               we move back to find mrs dashwood and elinor at the other 
               end of the room, sewing peacefully.

                                     mrs. dashwood
                         he certainly is nor so dashing as 
                         willoughby but he has a far more 
                         pleasing countenance. there was always 
                         a something, if you remember, in 
                         willoughby's eyes at times which i 
                         did not like.

               elinor listens patiently as her mother rewrites history. we 
               cut back to brandon as he finishes reading.

                                     colonel brandon
                         'for there is nothing lost, but may 
                         be found, if sought...

               he looks up at marianne. a soul-breathing glance. she smiles 
               as he closes the book.

                                     marianne
                         shall we continue tomorrow?

                                     colonel brandon
                         no--for i must away.

                                     marianne
                         away? where?

                                     colonel brandon
                              (teasing)
                         that i cannot tell you. it is a 
                         secret.

               he rises to leave.

                                     marianne
                              (impulsive)
                         but you will not stay away long?

               close on brandon's reaction.
