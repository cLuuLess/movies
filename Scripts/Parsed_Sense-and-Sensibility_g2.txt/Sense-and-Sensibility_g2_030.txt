               ext. fields near norland - day

               edward and elinor are on horseback. the atmosphere is 
               intimate, the quality of the conversation rooted now in their 
               affections.

                                     elinor
                         you talk of feeling idle and useless 
                         imagine how that is compounded when 
                         one has no choice and no hope 
                         whatsoever of any occupation.

               edward nods and smiles at the irony of it.

                                     edward
                         our circumstances are therefore 
                         precisely the same.

                                     elinor
                         except that you will inherit your 
                         fortune.

               he looks at her slightly shocked but enjoying her boldness.

                                     elinor
                         we cannot even earn ours.

                                     edward
                         perhaps margaret is right.

                                     elinor
                         right?

                                     edward
                         piracy is our only option.

               they ride on in silence for a moment.

                                     edward
                         what is swabbing exactly?
