               ext. london tenements - night

               a district of extreme poverty, populated by the lowlife of 
               london: footpads, dogs, rats and scavengers of all kinds. in 
               the distance a tavern belches forth drunken revellers who 
               sway and reel into the night.

               a hooded horseman pulls up his exhausted steed at the entrance 
               to a slum. he dismounts and looks up at one of the windows. 
               the rags hanging there twitch as if someone is watching for 
               him. he strides inside.
