               fanny leads edward in. she sniffs with distaste.

                                     fanny
                         i have never liked the smell of books.

                                     edward
                         oh? no. the dust, perhaps.

               as they speak, edward notices a large atlas retreating 
               apparently all by itself across the floor. someone is 
               obviously under the table, pulling it out of sight. he 
               registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to shield 
               it from fanny. he turns back, searching for something to 
               divert her.

                                     edward
                         i hear you have great plans for the 
                         walnut grove.

                                     fanny
                         oh yes! i shall have it pulled down 
                         to make room for a grecian temple.

               there is a stifled wail from under the table, which edward 
               covers with a cough.

                                     edward
                         how picturesque. will you show me 
                         the site?

               and he ushers fanny out, flicking a quick glance over his 
               shoulder at the fugitive's foot.
