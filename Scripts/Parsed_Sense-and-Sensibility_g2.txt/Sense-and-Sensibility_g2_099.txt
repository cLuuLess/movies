               int. mrs jennings's house - hall - eve

               mrs jennings, lucy, elinor and marianne return from their 
               outing. marianne immediately assails pigeon.

                                     marianne
                         are there any messages, pigeon?

                                     pigeon
                         no, ma'am.

                                     marianne
                         no message at all? no cards?

                                     pigeon
                              (affronted)
                         none, ma am.

               marianne sighs with disappointment and starts up the stairs. 
               mrs jennings looks archly at elinor.

                                     mrs jennings
                         i note you do not inquire for your 
                         messages, miss dashwood!

                                     elinor
                         no, for i do not expect any, mrs 
                         jennings. i have very little 
                         acquaintance in town.

               and she follows marianne firmly upstairs. lucy watches her 
               go, and mrs jennings chuckles and turns to her.

                                     mrs jennings
                         she is as sly as you, lucy!
