               int. norland park - morning room - day

               mrs dashwood is ruminating sadly. marianne rushes in holding 
               a letter.

                                     marianne
                         mamma, look. this has just arrived.

                                     mrs dashwood
                              (reading from the 
                              letter)
                         'i should be pleased to offer you a 
                         home at barton cottage as soon as 
                         ever you have need of it' why, it is 
                         from my cousin, sir john middleton!

                                     marianne
                         even elinor must approve the rent.

               mrs dashwood looks at the letter again and thinks.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         has elinor not yet seen this?

                                     marianne
                         no i will fetch her.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         wait. no. let us delay.

                                     marianne
                         why?

                                     mrs dashwood
                         i think--i believe that edward and 
                         elinor have formed an attachment.

               marianne nods, a little reluctantly.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         it would be cruel to take her away 
                         so soon and devonshire is so far.

               mrs dashwood makes her decision. she takes the letter and 
               hides it in the pocket of her gown. marianne looks on 
               frowningly.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         why so grave? do you disapprove her 
                         choice?

                                     marianne
                         by no means. edward is very amiable.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         amiable but?

                                     marianne
                         but there is something wanting. he 
                         is too sedate his reading last night.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         elinor has not your feelings, his 
                         reserve suits her.

               marianne thinks for a little.

                                     marianne
                         can he love her? can the ardour of 
                         the soul really be satisfied with 
                         such polite, concealed affections? 
                         to love is to burn to be on fire, 
                         all made of passion, of adoration, 
                         of sacrifice! like juliet, or 
                         guinevere or heloise.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         they made rather pathetic ends, dear.

                                     marianne
                         pathetic! to die for love? how can 
                         you say so? what could be more 
                         glorious?

                                     mrs dashwood
                         i think that may be taking your 
                         romantic sensibilities a little far.

                                     marianne
                         the more i know of the world, the 
                         more i am convinced that i shall 
                         never see a man whom i can truly 
                         love.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         you require so much!

                                     marianne
                         i do not! i require only what any 
                         young woman of taste should a man 
                         who sings well, dances admirably, 
                         rides bravely, reads with passion 
                         and whose tastes agree in every point 
                         with my own.
