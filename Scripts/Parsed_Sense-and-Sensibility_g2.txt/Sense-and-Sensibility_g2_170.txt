               ext. downs near barton cottage - day

               elinor and marianne walk on. suddenly, marianne stops.

                                     marianne
                         there.

               she indicates a spot on the ground but elinor can see nothing 
               and is momentarily alarmed. marianne gazes at the ground and 
               breathes in deeply.

                                     marianne
                         there i fell, and there i first saw 
                         willoughby.

                                     elinor
                         poor willoughby. he will always regret 
                         you.

                                     marianne
                         but does it follow that, had he chosen 
                         me, he would have been content?

               elinor looks at marianne, surprised.

                                     marianne
                         he would have had a wife he loved 
                         but no money--and might soon have 
                         learned to rank the demands of his 
                         pocket-book far above the demands of 
                         his heart.

               elinor regards marianne admiringly. marianne smiles sadly.

                                     marianne
                         if his present regrets are half as 
                         painful as mine, he will suffer 
                         enough.

                                     elinor
                         do you compare your conduct with 
                         his?

                                     marianne
                         no. i compare it with what it ought 
                         to have been. i compare it with yours.

                                     elinor
                         our situations were very different.

                                     marianne
                         my illness has made me consider the 
                         past. i saw in my own behaviour 
                         nothing but imprudence--and worse. i 
                         was insolent and unjust to everyone--

               elinor tries to stem the flow but marianne continues.

                                     marianne
                         --but you--you i wronged above all. 
                         only i knew your heart and its sorrows 
                         but even then i was never a grain 
                         more compassionate. i brought my 
                         illness upon myself--i wanted to 
                         destroy myself. and had i succeeded, 
                         what misery should i have caused 
                         you?

               elinor embraces her. they stand with their arms round one 
               another in silence for a moment. then marianne breaks away 
               and speaks with great good humour and energy.

                                     marianne
                         i shall mend my ways! i shall no 
                         longer worry others nor torture 
                         myself. i am determined to enter on 
                         a course of serious study---colonel 
                         brandon has promised me the run of 
                         his library and i shall read at least 
                         six hours a day. by the end of the 
                         year i expect to have improved my 
                         learning a very great deal.
