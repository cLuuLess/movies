               int. grand ballroom - eve

               the great ballroom is crammed with guests all determined to 
               enjoy themselves despite the considerable inconveniences 
               caused by noise, heat and overcrowding. men are sweating 
               profusely, women dab their brows, rack punch is being 
               swallowed by the gallon, flirting is conducted at fever pitch 
               and all conversation is inordinately loud. only the dancers 
               have a modicum of space in which to perform their mincing 
               steps. mrs jennings and her brood bump into the palmers.

                                     charlotte
                              (screeching)
                         this is very merry!

               mrs jennings then spots fanny, who is conducting a desultory 
               conversation with an overpowdered acquaintance. she drags 
               elinor, marianne and lucy over to her.

                                     mrs jennings
                         there you are! goodness, how hot it 
                         is, mrs dashwood. you are not alone, 
                         i trust?

                                     fanny
                         indeed not. john is just gone to 
                         fetch my brother--he has been eating 
                         ices.

               lucy clutches at elinor's sleeve.

                                     mrs jennings
                         your brother! i declare, that is 
                         good news indeed. at long last!

               and she beams her approval upon elinor.

                                     lucy
                              (whispering)
                         miss dashwood, i declare i shall 
                         faint clean away.

               fanny has seen john threading his way towards them and waves 
               at him. there is someone behind him. lucy preens. john bows 
               to them.

                                     john
                         mrs jennings, may i present my brother-
                         in-law?

               he turns to reveal a good-looking young man with a vacuous 
               smile.

                                     john
                         mr robert ferrars!

                                     robert
                         my dear ladies--we meet at last!

               there is a general bowing and shaking of hands. elinor is 
               relieved. lucy drops a low curtsy.

                                     mrs jennings
                         so you must be the younger brother? 
                         is mr edward not here? miss dashwood 
                         here was counting on him!

               robert looks elinor up and down. he exchanges glances with 
               fanny before he speaks.

                                     robert
                         oh! he is far too busy for such 
                         gatherings--and has no special 
                         acquaintance here to make his 
                         attendance worthwhile.

               mrs jennings looks at elinor in puzzlement.

                                     mrs jennings
                         well, i declare, i do not know what 
                         the young men are about these days--
                         are they all in hiding?

               elinor looks down, agonised with embarrassment.

                                     mrs jennings
                         come, mr robert, in the absence of 
                         your brother, you must dance with 
                         our lovely miss dashwood!

                                     robert
                              (not best pleased)
                         it would be my honour.

               he turns to lucy and bows.

                                     robert
                         and perhaps miss steele might consider 
                         reserving the allemande?

               lucy curtsies again. robert escorts a most unwilling elinor 
               onto the dance floor.

                                     robert
                         you reside in devonshire, i b'lieve, 
                         miss dashwood?

                                     elinor
                         we do.

                                     robert
                         in a cottage?

                                     elinor
                         yes.

                                     robert
                         i am excessively fond of a cottage. 
                         if i had any money to spare, i should 
                         build one myself.

               luckily for elinor the set changes and she is obliged to 
               turn away from robert. she wheels round to face her new 
               partner. it is willoughby! they both stop dancing and stare 
               at each other aghast. a traffic jam starts and they are forced 
               to take hands and resume the steps.

                                     willoughby
                              (stiff)
                         how do you do, miss dashwood?

               elinor does not know quite how to respond.

                                     elinor
                         i am well, thank you, mr willoughby.

               she looks about for marianne, instinctively wanting to keep 
               her away from willoughby.

                                     willoughby
                         how is your--family?

                                     elinor
                              (cold)
                         we are all extremely well, mr 
                         willoughby--thank you for your kind 
                         inquiry.

               willoughby is shamed into silence. then he sees marianne. at 
               the same moment the music pauses. marianne looks up. in the 
               brief moment of relative quiet, her great cry rings across 
               the room.

                                     marianne
                         willoughby!

               everyone turns to look as marianne rushes towards him with 
               both arms outstretched, her face luminous with joy. as the 
               noise of the room builds again and people change their 
               partners, we are aware that many are surreptitiously watching. 
               marianne reaches him but willoughby stands with his arms 
               frozen at his side. marianne gives a little confused laugh.

                                     marianne
                         good god, willoughby! will you nor 
                         shake hands with me?

               willoughby looks extremely uncomfortable and glances towards 
               a group of very smart people who are watching him closely. 
               central to this group is a sophisticated woman who frowns at 
               him proprietorially.

               willoughby shakes marianne's hand briefly. behind her, mrs 
               jennings is giving an animated commentary to fanny and john, 
               while lucy whispers in robert's ear as they go past to join 
               the set.

                                     willoughby
                              (strangled)
                         how do you do, miss marianne?

                                     marianne
                         willoughby, what is the matter? why 
                         have you not come to see me? were 
                         you not in london? have you nor 
                         received my letters?

               willoughby is sweating with tension.

                                     willoughby
                         yes, i had the pleasure of receiving 
                         the information which you were so 
                         good as to send me.

                                     marianne
                              (piteously)
                         for heaven's sake, willoughby, tell 
                         me what is wrong!

                                     willoughby
                         thank you--i am most obliged. if you 
                         will excuse me, i must return to my 
                         party.

               he bows, white to the teeth, and walks away to join the 
               sophisticated woman.

                                     marianne
                         willoughby!

               he is drawn away by his party, some of whom look back at 
               marianne with a mixture of curiosity and condescension. 
               marianne almost sinks to her knees. elinor supports her.

                                     elinor
                         marianne! come away!

                                     marianne
                         go to him, elinor--force him to come 
                         to me.

               mrs jennings has come up, full of concern.

                                     elinor
                         dearest, do not betray what you feel 
                         to everyone present! this is not the 
                         place for explanations--

                                     mrs jennings
                         come along, dear.

               they almost have to drag marianne away. mrs jennings turns 
               back to the dashwood party. fanny and john have practically 
               imploded with embarrassment and are distancing themselves as 
               much as possible from the source. lucy and robert are dancing 
               nearby.

                                     mrs jennings
                         will you come, lucy?

                                     lucy
                         oh, are we leaving so soon?

                                     robert
                         if i might be so bold, mrs jennings, 
                         it would be our pleasure to escort 
                         your young charge home.

                                     lucy
                         how very kind!

                                     mrs jennings
                         that is very handsome--

               she rushes off to follow marianne and elinor. we stay for a 
               moment with lucy and robert who have left the set.

                                     robert
                         she actually sent him messages during 
                         the night?

               cam rises to show the dashwoods exiting past the whispering, 
               sneering faces of the crowd.
