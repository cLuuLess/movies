               ext. barton cottage - garden path - day

               marianne and elinor are coming down the path together. 
               marianne is dressed to go out. the argument has evidently 
               started indoors and is being continued here.

                                     marianne
                         if there was any true impropriety in 
                         my behaviour, i should be sensible 
                         of it, elinor--

                                     elinor
                         but as it has already exposed you to 
                         some very impertinent remarks, do 
                         you not begin to doubt your own 
                         discretion?

                                     marianne
                         if the impertinent remarks of such 
                         as mrs jennings are proof of 
                         impropriety, then we are all offending 
                         every moment of our lives--

               the conversation is halted by the arrival of colonel brandon 
               on horseback.

                                     colonel brandon
                              (dismounting)
                         miss dashwood! miss marianne!

                                     elinor
                         good morning, colonel!

                                     colonel brandon
                         i come to issue an invitation. a 
                         picnic on my estate at delaford--if 
                         you would care to join us on thursday 
                         next. mrs jennings's daughter and 
                         her husband are traveling up 
                         especially.

                                     elinor
                         thank you, colonel, we shall be 
                         delighted.

               at that moment, willoughby's curricle hoves into view and 
               marianne's face lights up.

                                     colonel brandon
                              (to marianne)
                         i will of course be including mr 
                         willoughby in the party.

               even marianne is a little embarrassed and recollects her 
               manners. she smiles kindly at brandon.

                                     marianne
                         i should be delighted to join you, 
                         colonel!

               the colonel helps her into the curricle, exchanging nods 
               with willoughby, who is regarding him with some suspicion.

                                     willoughby
                         good morning, miss dashwood; good 
                         morning, colonel.

                                     marianne
                         the colonel has invited us to 
                         delaford, willoughby!

                                     willoughby
                         excellent. i understand you have a 
                         particularly fine pianoforte, colonel.

               the undercurrents of this conversation are decidedly tense.

                                     colonel brandon
                         a broadwood grand.

                                     marianne
                         a broadwood grand! then i shall really 
                         be able to play for you!

                                     willoughby
                         we shall look forward to it!

               marianne smiles her perfect happiness at him and he whips up 
               the horses. they drive off, waving their farewells.

               brandon looks after them for a silent moment, and then 
               collects himself and turns to elinor, who is less than 
               satisfied with their behaviour.

                                     colonel brandon
                         your sister seems very happy.

                                     elinor
                         yes. marianne does not approve of 
                         hiding her emotions. in fact, her 
                         romantic prejudices have the 
                         unfortunate tendency to set propriety 
                         at naught.

                                     colonel brandon
                         she is wholly unspoilt.

                                     elinor
                         rather too unspoilt, in my view. the 
                         sooner she becomes acquainted with 
                         the ways of the world, the better.

               colonel brandon looks at her sharply and then speaks very 
               deliberately, as though controlling some powerful emotion.

                                     colonel brandon
                         i knew a lady like your sister--the 
                         same impulsive sweetness of temper--
                         who was forced into, as you put it, 
                         a better acquaintance with the world. 
                         the result was only ruination and 
                         despair.

               he stops, and briskly remounts his horse.

                                     colonel brandon
                         do not desire it, miss dashwood.
