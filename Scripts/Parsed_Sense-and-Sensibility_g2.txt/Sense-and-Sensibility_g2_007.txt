               int. norland park - mrs dashwood's bedroom - day

               mrs dashwood is rushing about, mourning ribbons flapping, 
               putting her knick-knacks into a small valise. the room is in 
               chaos. a young woman (elinor dashwood) looks on helplessly.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         to be reduced to the condition of 
                         visitor in my own home! it is not to 
                         be borne, elinor!

                                     elinor
                         consider, mamma! we have nowhere to 
                         go.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         john and fanny will descend from 
                         london at any moment, followed no 
                         doubt by cartloads of relatives ready 
                         to turn us out of our rooms one by 
                         one do you expect me to be here to 
                         welcome them? vultures!

               she suddenly collapses into a chair and bursts into tears.

                                     elinor
                         i shall start making inquiries for a 
                         new house at once. until then we 
                         must try to bear their coming.
