               int. norland park - dining room - eve

               the entire family is present. everyone is watching mrs 
               dashwood, who has just made her announcement.

                                     edward
                         devonshire!

               he is devastated. fanny is thrilled. mrs dashwood looks at 
               him with compassion and then at elinor, who is trying to 
               keep calm.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         my cousin sir john middleton has 
                         offered us a small house on his 
                         estate.

                                     john
                         sir john middleton? what is his 
                         situation? he must be a man of 
                         property.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         he is a widower. he lives with his 
                         mother-in-law at barton park and it 
                         is barton cottage that he offers us.

                                     fanny
                         oh, a cottage! how charming. a little 
                         cottage is always very snug.

                                     edward
                         but you will not leave before the 
                         summer?

                                     mrs dashwood
                         oh, my dear edward, we can no longer 
                         trespass upon your sister's good 
                         will. we must leave as soon as 
                         possible.

                                     margaret
                         you will come and stay with us, 
                         edward!

                                     edward
                         i should like that very much.

                                     fanny
                         edward has long been expected in 
                         town by our mother.

               mrs dashwood ignores fanny.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         come as soon as you can, edward. 
                         remember that you are always welcome.

               int/ext. norland park - stables - day

               elinor has come to say goodbye to her horse. she strokes the 
               soft face sadly. then she senses someone and turns to find 
               edward standing nearby.

                                     edward
                         cannot you take him with you?

                                     elinor
                         we cannot possibly afford him.

                                     edward
                         perhaps he could make himself useful 
                         in the kitchen?

               elinor tries to smile. edward looks at her for a long moment 
               and then comes closer.

                                     edward
                         miss dashwood--elinor. i must talk 
                         to you.

               the use of her christian name--and in such a loving tone--
               stops elinor's breath altogether.

                                     edward
                         there is something of great importance 
                         i need... to tell you--

               he comes closer still. the horse breathes between them. elinor 
               is on fire with anticipation but edward looks troubled and 
               has less the air of a suitor than he might.

                                     edward
                         --about--about my education.

                                     elinor
                              (after a beat)
                         your education?

                                     edward
                         yes. it was less... successful than 
                         it might have been.

               edward laughs nervously. elinor is completely bewildered.

                                     edward
                         it was conducted in plymouth--oddly 
                         enough.

                                     elinor
                         indeed?

                                     edward
                         yes. do you know it?

                                     elinor
                         plymouth?

                                     edward
                         yes.

                                     elinor
                         no.

                                     edward
                         oh--well--i spent four years there--
                         at a school run by a--a mr pratt--

                                     elinor
                         pratt?

               elinor is beginning to feel like a parrot.

                                     edward
                         precisely--mr pratt--and there, i--
                         that is to say, he has a--

               as edward flounders, a familiar voice cuts through this 
               unexpected foray into his academic past.

                                     fanny
                         edward! edward!

               they turn to find fanny powering down upon them, waving a 
               letter. edward steps back, glancing almost guiltily at elinor, 
               who is as confused as we are.

                                     fanny
                         i have been all over for you! you 
                         are needed in london this instant!

                                     edward
                         fanny, i am leaving this afternoon 
                         as it is--

                                     fanny
                         no, no, that will not do. family 
                         affairs are in chaos owing to your 
                         absence. mother is quite adamant 
                         that you should leave at once.

               fanny is determined. she obviously has no intention of leaving 
               him alone with elinor. edward turns to elinor, frustration 
               in every muscle, his jaw set tight.

                                     edward
                         excuse me, miss dashwood.

               fanny drags edward off, leaving elinor to gaze sadly after 
               them.
