               ext. norland park - margaret's tree-house - day

               elinor comes to the foot of a large tree from which a small 
               staircase issues.

                                     elinor
                         margaret, are you there? please come 
                         down. john and fanny will be here 
                         soon.

               a pause. elinor is about to leave when a disembodied and 
               truculent young voice stops her.

                                     margaret (v.o.)
                         why are they coming to live at 
                         norland? they already have a house 
                         in london.

                                     elinor
                         because houses go from father to 
                         son, dearest not from father to 
                         daughter. it is the law.

               silence. elinor tries another tack.

                                     elinor
                         if you come inside, we could play 
                         with your atlas.

                                     margaret (v.o.)
                         it's not my atlas any more. it's 
                         their atlas.

               close on elinor as she ponders the truth of this statement.
