               int. coffee-house - covent garden - day

               fanny, john and robert are drinking chocolate together.

                                     robert
                         apparently they never were engaged.

                                     fanny
                         miss grey has fifty thousand pounds. 
                         marianne is virtually penniless.

                                     john
                         she cannot have expected him to go 
                         through with it. but i feel for 
                         marianne--she will lose her bloom 
                         and end a spinster like elinor. i 
                         think, my dear, we might consider 
                         having them to stay with us for a 
                         few days--we are, after all, family, 
                         and my father.

               he trails off. fanny exchanges an alarmed glance with robert. 
               she thinks fast.

                                     fanny
                         my love, i would ask them with all 
                         my heart, but i have already asked 
                         miss steele for a visit and we cannot 
                         deprive mrs jennings of all her 
                         company at once. we can invite your 
                         sisters some other year, you know, 
                         and miss steele will profit far more 
                         from your generosity--poor girl!

                                     john
                         that is very thoughtful, fanny. we 
                         shall ask elinor and marianne next 
                         year, then... certainly!
