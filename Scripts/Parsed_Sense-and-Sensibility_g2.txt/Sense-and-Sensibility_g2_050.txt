               int. barton park - music room - eve

               everyone watches marianne as she plays and sings. behind 
               them we see brandon entering. but he stays in the shadow of 
               the door and no one notices him. close on his face. he gazes 
               at marianne with an unfathomable look of grief and longing. 
               he breathes in deeply. suddenly, elinor feels his presence 
               and looks around at him. after a few moments, she turns back, 
               slightly puzzled. the song finishes. everyone claps. the man 
               ventures out into the light and sir john springs from his 
               seat.

                                     sir john
                         brandon! where have you been? come, 
                         come and meet our beautiful new 
                         neighbours!

                                     mrs jennings
                         what a pity you are late, colonel! 
                         you have missed the most delightful 
                         singing!

               brandon bows to the company and smiles slightly.

                                     colonel brandon
                         a great pity, indeed.

               elinor looks at him, even more puzzled.

                                     sir john
                         mrs dashwood, may i present my dear 
                         friend colonel brandon? we served 
                         together in the east indies and i 
                         assure you there is no better fellow 
                         on earth--

                                     margaret
                         have you really been to the east 
                         indies, colonel?

                                     colonel brandon
                         i have.

                                     margaret
                         what is it like?

               margaret is quivering with fascination.

                                     sir john
                         like? hot.

               but colonel brandon knows what margaret wants to hear.

                                     colonel brandon
                              (mysteriously)
                         the air is full of spices.

               margaret smiles with satisfaction.

                                     sir john
                         come, miss dashwood--it is your turn 
                         to entertain us!

                                     elinor
                         oh no, sir john, i do not--

                                     sir john
                         --and i think we can all guess what 
                         key you will sing in!

               sir john and mrs jennings are bursting with their new joke.

                                     sir john/mrs jennings
                         f major!

               they fall about.
