               int. norland park - breakfast room - day

               fanny, mrs dashwood, elinor and john are at breakfast. 
               marianne enters. elinor catches her eye and indicates fanny 
               with a slight motion of her head. marianne makes a face.

                                     marianne
                              (very polite)
                         good morning, fanny.

               fanny is rather startled.

                                     fanny
                         good morning, marianne.

               elinor is relieved.

                                     marianne
                              (to fanny)
                         how did you find the silver? is it 
                         all genuine?

               elinor rushes in before marianne gets any further.

                                     elinor
                         pray, when may we expect the pleasure 
                         of your brother's company?

                                     fanny
                         edward is due tomorrow. and my dear 
                         mrs dashwood, in view of the fact 
                         that he will not be with us for long, 
                         i wondered if miss margaret would 
                         mind giving up her room to him the 
                         view is quite incomparable from her 
                         windows and i should so much like 
                         edward to see norland at its best.

               marianne slams her cup down and throws a furious look at 
               elinor.
