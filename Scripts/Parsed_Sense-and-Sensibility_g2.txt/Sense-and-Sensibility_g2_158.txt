               int. cleveland - elinor and marianne's bedroom - night

               marianne's eyes glitter with the fever. elinor wipes her 
               brow. suddenly she speaks.

                                     marianne
                         who is that?

               she is looking at the end of the bed.

                                     marianne

                                                                  dissolve:
