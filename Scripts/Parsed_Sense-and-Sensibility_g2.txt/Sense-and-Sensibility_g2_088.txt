               int. barton cottage - elinor and marianne's bedroom - day

               marianne is sitting by the window looking out at the rain 
               through tear-swollen eyes. willoughby's sonnets are on her 
               lap.

                                     marianne
                         how like a winter hath my absence 
                         been from thee, the pleasure of the 
                         fleeting year! what freezings have i 
                         felt, what dark days seen! what old 
                         december's bareness everywhere!
