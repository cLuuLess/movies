               ext. barton cottage - garden and surroundings - day

               the cottage nestles in the first buds of spring. a piece of 
               rope hangs down from the branches of a tree in the garden. 
               it starts to wave about wildly and we see margaret emerging 
               and climbing down. she has built herself a new tree-house.

                         what though the sea with waves 
                         continuall doe eate the earth, it is 
                         no more at all.
