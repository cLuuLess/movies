               int. norland park - breakfast room - day

               fanny is standing by the window looking out. we see her pov 
               of elinor and edward walking in the garden.

               mrs dashwood enters, pauses for a moment and then joins fanny 
               at the window. fanny pretends not to have been watching but 
               mrs dashwood looks down at the lovers and then smiles sweetly 
               at her.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         we are all so happy that you chose 
                         to invite edward to norland. he is a 
                         dear boy and we are all very fond of 
                         him.

               fanny does a bit of quick thinking.

                                     fanny
                         we have great hopes for him. much is 
                         expected of him by our mother with 
                         regard to his profession

                                     mrs dashwood
                         naturally.

                                     fanny
                         and in marriage. she is determined 
                         that both he and robert will marry 
                         well.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         of course. but i hope she desires 
                         them to marry for love, first and 
                         foremost? i have always felt that, 
                         contrary to common wisdom, true 
                         affection is by far the most valuable 
                         dowry.

                                     fanny
                         love is all very well, but 
                         unfortunately we cannot always rely 
                         on the heart to lead us in the most 
                         suitable directions.

               fanny lowers her voice confidingly.

                                     fanny
                         you see, my dear mrs dashwood, edward 
                         is entirely the kind of compassionate 
                         person upon whom penniless women can 
                         prey--and having entered into any 
                         kind of understanding, he would never 
                         go back on his word. he is quite 
                         simply incapable of doing so. but it 
                         would lead to his ruin. i worry for 
                         him so, mrs dashwood. my mother has 
                         always made it perfectly plain that 
                         she will withdraw all financial 
                         support from edward, should he choose 
                         to plant his affections in less... 
                         exalted ground than he deserves.

               it is impossible for mrs dashwood not to get the point. she 
               is appalled and furious.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         i understand you perfectly.

               she sweeps off.
