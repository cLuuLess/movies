               int. barton cottage - parlour - day

               tense silence reigns. everyone tries to busy themselves. 
               betsy enters.

                                     betsy
                         mr ferrars for you, ma'am.

               edward follows her in, looking white and agitated.

                                     mrs dashwood
                              (rising)
                         edward! what a pleasure to see you.

                                     edward
                         mrs dashwood. miss marianne. margaret. 
                         miss dashwood. i hope i find you all 
                         well.

               he bows formally to each of them, lingering on elinor, who 
               is looking firmly at her lap. he looks anxious.

                                     marianne
                         thank you, edward, we are all very 
                         well.

               there is a pause while they all search for an appropriate 
               remark. finally margaret decides to have a go at polite 
               conversation.

                                     margaret
                         we have been enjoying very fine 
                         weather.

               marianne looks at her incredulously.

                                     margaret
                         well, we have.

                                     edward
                         i am glad of it. the... the roads 
                         were very dry.

               mrs dashwood decides to bite the bullet.

                                     mrs dashwood
                              (giving him her hand)
                         may i wish you great joy, edward.

               he takes her hand somewhat confusedly and accepts her offer 
               of a seat. there is an awful silence. marianne tries to help.

                                     marianne
                         i hope you have left mrs ferrars 
                         well?

                                     edward
                         tolerably, thank you.

               there is another bone-crunching pause.

                                     edward
                         i--but edward cannot seem to find 
                         any words.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         is mrs ferrars at the new parish?

               edward looks extremely confused.

                                     edward
                         no--my mother is in town.

               he plucks up the courage to look at elinor again and is 
               evidently not much comforted by what he sees.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         i meant to enquire after mrs edward 
                         ferrars.

               edward colours. he hesitates.

                                     edward
                         then you have not heard--the news--i 
                         think you mean my brother--you mean 
                         mrs robert ferrars.

               they all stare at him in shock.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         mrs robert ferrars?

               elinor has frozen. edward rises and goes to the window.

                                     edward
                         yes. i received a letter from miss 
                         steele--or mrs ferrars, i should say--
                         communicating the... the transfer of 
                         her affections to my brother robert. 
                         they were much thrown together in 
                         london, i believe, and... and in 
                         view of the change in my 
                         circumstances, i felt it only fair 
                         that miss steele be released from 
                         our engagement. at any rate, they 
                         were married last week and are now 
                         in plymouth.

               elinor rises suddenly, edward turns and they stand looking 
               at one another.

                                     elinor
                         then you--are not married.

                                     edward
                         no.

               elinor bursts into tears. the shock of this emotional 
               explosion stuns everyone for a second and then marianne makes 
               an executive decision. wordlessly, she takes margaret's hand 
               and leads her and mrs dashwood out of the room.
