               int. barton cottage - parlour - day

               mrs dashwood runs back into the parlour, jittering with 
               excitement and anxiety.

                                     marianne
                         mr john willoughby of allenham!

                                     mrs dashwood
                         what an impressive gentleman!

                                     marianne
                         he lifted me as if i weighed no more 
                         than a dried leaf!

                                     elinor
                         is he human?

               marianne hits elinor. mrs dashwood tends to her ankle.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         tell me if i hurt you.

                                     elinor
                              (regarding marianne's 
                              ecstatic expression)
                         she feels no pain, mamma. margaret, 
                         ask betsy to make up a cold compress, 
                         please.

                                     margaret
                              (leaving reluctantly)
                         did you see him? he expressed himself 
                         well, did he not?

                                     mrs dashwood
                         with great decorum and honour.

                                     marianne
                         and spirit and wit and feeling.

                                     elinor
                         and economy--ten words at most.

               from below stairs we can hear margaret wailing wait for me!

                                     marianne
                         and he is to come tomorrow!

                                     elinor
                         you must change, marianne--you will 
                         catch a cold.

                                     marianne
                         what care i for colds when there is 
                         such a man?

                                     elinor
                         you will care very much when your 
                         nose swells up.

                                     marianne
                         you are right. help me, elinor.

               margaret comes back with the bandages.

                                     margaret
                         what has happened?

                                     elinor
                         we have decided to give you to the 
                         gypsies.

               elinor and marianne go upstairs. margaret whispers to mrs 
               dashwood.

                                     margaret
                         will they be married before edward 
                         and elinor, do you think, mamma?

                                     mrs dashwood
                         margaret, you are worse than mrs 
                         jennings.
