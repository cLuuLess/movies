               int. barton cottage - parlour - day

               marianne is carried in, surrounded by elinor, mrs dashwood 
               and margaret.

                                     the stranger
                         it is a twisted ankle.

                                     marianne
                         do not be alarmed, mamma.

               the stranger deposits marianne on the sofa. they look straight 
               into each other's eyes. electric.

                                     the stranger
                         i can assure you it is not serious. 
                         i took the liberty of feeling the 
                         bone and it is perfectly sound.

               elinor raises her eyebrows at marianne, who blushes to her 
               roots.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         sir, i cannot even begin to thank 
                         you.

                                     the stranger
                         please do not think of it. i'm 
                         honoured of be of service.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         will you not be seated?

                                     the stranger
                         pray excuse me--i have no desire to 
                         leave a water mark! but permit me to 
                         call tomorrow afternoon and inquire 
                         after the patient?

                                     mrs dashwood
                         we shall look forward to it!

               he turns to marianne and smiles. she smiles back gloriously. 
               he bows, and sweeps out of the room.

                                     marianne
                              (hissing)
                         his name! his name!

               mrs dashwood silences her with a gesture and follows him out 
               with all the solicitous charm she can command while margaret 
               pokes her head around the door to watch. elinor is removing 
               marianne's boot and trying not to laugh at her.
