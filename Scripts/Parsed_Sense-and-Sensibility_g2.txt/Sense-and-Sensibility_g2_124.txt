               ext. mrs jennings's house - day

               the palmers' carriage stands outside the house. colonel 
               brandon helps marianne in beside elinor before mounting his 
               horse to ride alongside. mrs jennings waves goodbye from the 
               steps. the carriage moves off. mrs jennings blows her nose, 
               looks up and down the street in search of gossip and goes 
               back indoors with a sigh.
