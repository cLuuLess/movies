               mrs bunting, a rather baleful nanny, looks on as mr palmer 
               holds up a screaming baby in a frilly bonnet for everyone's 
               inspection.

                         we are very proud of our little 
                         thomas, colonel--and his papa has 
                         such a way with him...

               brandon flicks a glance at mr palmer for whom holding a baby 
               comes as naturally as breathing underwater.
