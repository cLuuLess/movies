               ext. pond near barton park - another day

               brandon strides along in hunting gear, a gun slung under one 
               arm, his dog trotting behind him with a duck clamped between 
               its jaws. the bulrushes catch his eye and he slows, then 
               stops. he stands for a moment deep in thought. then he takes 
               his hunting knife, cuts one and walks off contemplatively.
