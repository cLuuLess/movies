       mules are loaded up with burlap bags containing 3,000 kilos
       of heroin.

       the mule train approaches the jungle that surrounds the
       opium farm. nate's thai thugs, left behind in sniper
       positions in the trees, stand ready to open fire if they
       have to as frank, nate, the soldiers and mules pass below.

       they seem to have made it, winding back down through the
       jungle with the mules. suddenly a barrage of gunfire erupts
       from the trees - a couple of nate's men are hit as the rest
       dive for cover, shouting "vietcong," and returning the fire.
       frank drops down from his mule, gets a pistol out and shoots
       into the trees. bullet-severed palm fronds rain down.

                              frank
                 give them half!

       nate, pinned down by the mules, can't hear him over the
       noise.

                              frank
                 cut half of them loose!      the mules!

       nate cuts the mule-train tether in the middle, slaps at the
       animals. as the freed mules disappear into a wall of trees
       the shooting subsides, then stops altogether. smoke from
       all the gunfire rises like mist around the half dozen thais
       and americans lying dead on the ground.
