232   int. courtroom - later - day                                     232

      the same judge who sends a collection plate around sits
      before richie and laurie and their attorneys.

                                sheila
                   your honor, a lot has been said here
                   today about how unsavory mr. roberts'
                   environment is for a child. how
                   dangerous it is. i'm sorry, but this is
                   our world. this is where we live and we
                   tell him, protect us. we give him that
                   responsibility, and then say, oh, but we
                   don't trust you to raise a child. we
                   don't think you're fit for that.

                                richie
                   i'm not.

                                                                      (cont)

                                                                          92.

           silence. sheila looks at him, but he's looking at laurie,
           and speaks to her like they're alone in the room:

                                     richie
                        you're right. this is no place for him.
                        around me. take him. the further away
                        the better. for him.

           the lights on the rockefeller christmas tree blink on to
           applause. a carol begins and continues over:

           seats covered with christmas presents. doc, driving, sees
           trupo's car parked out front frank's penthouse.

           doc pulls to the curb outside frank's building. as the
           doorman helps doc with the big christmas tree tied to the
           roof of the car, frank crosses to trupo's car with a couple
           of bottles of crystal tied with holiday bows.

                                     frank
                        here you go, boys.   merry christmas.
