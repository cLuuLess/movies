      as richie rushes out to the hallway he can hear footfalls
      echoing in the stairwell. he starts down, taking the stairs
      five at a time, chases teddy down two flights -                      

      teddy yanks open a door, runs down a corridor, bangs into            
      an apartment. richie reaches the apartment just as teddy is          
      goes out onto an exterior balcony -                                  
      richie continues along the interior corridor, running                
      parallel to teddy on the balcony, who trips over some debris         
      and garbage, looking over his shoulder for richie -                  

      richie cuts through another apartment to head him off, but           
      the door to the balcony is nailed shut. so are the windows.          
      richie looks around, grabs a small portable television and,          
      just as teddy runs past, hurls it through a window at him,           
      hitting him in the head.                                             

      he falls hard, dazed. richie hurries through the broken              
      window. teddy comes to and fights back, until richie breaks          
      his femur with his bare hands. teddy howls in excruciating
      pain -
