           the laundry truck comes past a guard gate, leaves the base,
           drives past a stand of trees. as it passes, richie, parked            
           by his detectives' cars, recognizes the young driver - who's          
           wearing the same yankee baseball cap in his t.o. photo.               

           as richie and his detectives climb into their cars, two               
           lucas cars fold in behind the laundry truck. the detectives           
           follow at a distance -
