145   ext. east harlem - day                                          145

      richie curbs the cab as the guy goes into a dingy pizza
      parlor. richie climbs out, crosses the street. coming past
      the place, he tries to look inside without breaking stride.



                                                                     (cont)

                                                                      59.
                                
145   continued:                                                      145


      from around a corner, striding toward him, come four men
      looking like gestapo thugs in leather coats, manicured hair -
      the princes of the city. richie detours into an alley as
      they enter the restaurant.

      richie peers in at the restaurant kitchen through a grimy
      basement window. watches trupo and his siu detectives burst
      in, guns drawn. they rough everybody up, get some down on
      the floor. one detective gathers the money and stuffs it in
      a bag. another gathers the dope. the mechanic tries to
      protest and trupo slaps him down with his pistol.

      richie keeps watching as the ny cops arrest no one - but
      take the dope and the money (richie's money) - and stride
      out as abruptly as they appeared, like bandits. as they
      come past richie -

                                richie
                   that's my money.

                                siu det 1
                   the fuck are you. what money?

      richie shows them his bureau of narcotics id.                            

                                richie
                   the bills are sequenced and registered
                   with the essex county prosecutors office.
                   all begin with cf3500. take a look.

      one of them checks some of the bills and sees he's right.

                                siu det. 2
                   goddamn it, i thought we had a score.
                   i thought i had a fucking chris-craft
                   sitting in my driveway.

                                richie
                   honest mistake. just give it back to me.

                                siu det. 1
                   this time.

      three of the four cops laugh. it's an affable gang of
      thieves. the one who doesn't laugh hangs back as the others
      start off. he examines richie's new jersey id.                           

                                trupo
                   when's the last time i was in jersey?
                   let me think. never. what're you doing
                   coming over here without letting anybody
                   know? you don't know you can get hurt
                   doing that?
                                (more)
                                                                      (cont)

                                  trupo (cont'd)
                            (trupo smiles; richie smiles)
                     you got your money. now, never, ever,
                     come into the city again unannounced. you                  
                     come in to see a fuckin broadway show you
                     call ahead first to see if it's okay with
                     me.

        trupo pats him on the back and leaves with the others.                  

                                  toback v.o.
                     what do we hate most? isn't it the
                     transgressions of others we fear we're
                     capable of ourselves?
