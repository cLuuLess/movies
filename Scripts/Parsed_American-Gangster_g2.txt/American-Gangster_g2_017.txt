       as is his custom, frank eats breakfast alone. a middle-
       aged waitress appears when he's done, picks up his plate
       and refills his coffee.

                                 frank
                    thank you, charlene.      last one.

                                 charlene
                    it's all right with me, frank, you can
                    stay all day if you want, but i wouldn't.
                    it's nice outside.

                                 frank
                    then maybe i'll have to go for a walk.
                    just cause you said so.

       she smiles and leaves. frank pours some sugar in his
       coffee. someone taps on the window and he looks up, sees
       two servicemen - one in uniform - one he recognizes.
