     joe louis has come over to speak to frank at his table.

                               joe louis
                  it's a tax thing. it's a mistake my
                  lawyers will straighten out, but for the
                  time being it's a headache -

                               frank
                  how much you owe?

                               joe louis
                  it's nothing, like - fifty grand.

     frank isn't sure if it's an honor or a curse to have a
     celebrity like joe louis asking to borrow money, but nods.

                                frank
                  sure.   don't worry about it.

                                joe louis
                  thank you.   i'll pay you back soon as -

                               frank
                  joe. it's a gift. not a loan.       you
                  don't owe me nothing.

     jackie glides into the club with his magazines and
     entourage. frank watches him make the rounds, lingering at
     miss puerto rico's table and holding her hand longer than he
     should with his girlfriend on his arm. frank glances to
     teddy wearily, then to doc, alone at the next table like a
     sentry. frank doesn't have to say he's ready to leave. doc
     knows the look. gets up.
