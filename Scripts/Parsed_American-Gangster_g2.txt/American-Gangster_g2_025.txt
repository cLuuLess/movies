29   ext. parking lot / richie's car - later - night                  29   

     richie and rivera sit in their car in silence, staring out            
     at the car with the money in it. eventually -                         

                               richie
                  this isn't a couple of bucks.

                               rivera                                      
                  it's the same thing.   in principle.

                               richie
                  we're talking about principle?

                               rivera                                      
                  richie, a cop who turns in this kind of
                  money says one thing: he'll turn in cops
                  who take money. we'll be pariahs.
                               richie
                  we're fucked either way.

                               rivera                                      
                  not if we keep it. only if we don't.
                  then we're fucked, you're right. but not
                  if we keep it.

                               richie
                         (more to himself)
                  yes, we are.

                               rivera                                      
                  goddamn it, did we ask for this? did we
                  put a gun to someone's head and say, give
                  us your money? cops kill cops they can't                 
                  trust. we can't turn it in.                              

     they regard each other again in silence ...

                                                                 15.
