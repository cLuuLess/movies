     hot dog stand. bumpy hands a hot dog to frank, holds out
     another to the shepherd. to camera:

                               bumpy
                  what right do they have cutting out the
                  suppliers, the middlemen, buying direct,
                  putting americans out of work ... this
                  is the way it is now, frank.

     frank nods. the vender hands him a napkin. the shepherd
     is still with him, but bumpy is gone, and the gulls and the
     people on the roller coaster squeal as frank comes out of
     his meditative trance with an idea.
