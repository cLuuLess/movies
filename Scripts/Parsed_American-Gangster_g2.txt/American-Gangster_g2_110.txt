158   int. tosca's mansion - later - day                              158

      as servants stand by, tosca and his wife and their only
      guests - frank and ana - finished with lunch, get up from
      the table in the formal formal dining room.

                                                                     (cont)

                                                                      64.

      as mrs. tosca leads ana off to give her a tour of the house,
      the men head off the other way.

                                tosca
                   she's a lovely girl.    you should marry
                   her.

                                frank
                   too many things to look after right now
                   to think about that.

                                tosca
                   frank. that's a mistake. if i may say.
                   don't take her for granted, girl like
                   that.

      they enter a rich, wood-paneled study lined with books.

                                tosca
                   you interested in history, frank? the
                   events that have brought us to where we
                   are today? you know who was? bumpy.

                                frank
                   bumpy was interested in a lot of things.

                                tosca
                   i always wonder if people know when
                   history's being made. and what they're
                   doing at the time. this, for instance,
                   could be a historic moment, and you're
                   sipping a glass of ice water.

      droplets snake down frank's glass. he senses tosca has
      finally gotten around to why he was invited here.
                                tosca
                   bumpy and i did a lot of business
                   together, as you know. whatever he
                   needed, he'd come to me and i'd do my
                   best to provide it. he came to me, i
                   didn't go to him, is the point i'm trying
                   to make. you know why?

                                frank
                   he didn't have what you needed. you had
                   what he needed. we've always had to come
                   to you.

                                 tosca
                   yes.   until now.

      tosca studies frank, who is a study in inscrutability.

                                                                      (cont)

                                                                     65.
                               
158   continued:                                                     158


                                tosca
                   monopolies are illegal in this country,
                   frank, because no one can compete with a
                   monopoly. if they let the dairy farmers
                   do that, half of them would go out of
                   business tomorrow.

                                frank
                   i'm just trying to make a living.

                                tosca
                   which is your right. because this is
                   america. but not at the unreasonable
                   expense of others. that's un-american.
                          (he studies frank)
                   you know the price you pay for a gallon
                   of milk doesn't represent its true cost
                   of production. it's controlled. set.

                                frank
                   i set a price i think is fair.

                                tosca
                   it's very unfair, in fact. your
                   customers are happy, but what about your
                   fellow dairy farmers? you're not
                   thinking of them.

                                frank
                          (very calmly)
                   i'm thinking of them as much as they ever
                   thought of me.

                                tosca
                   all right. i can see you're getting
                   excited. don't get excited. that's not
                   why i invited you to my home. to get
                   excited.

      frank doesn't look excited at all. he's the picture of
      calm. tosca smiles benignly and gets up.

                                tosca
                   here, i got something for you.
