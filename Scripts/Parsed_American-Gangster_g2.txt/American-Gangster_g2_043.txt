55   ext. bangkok - street vender - day                               55

     steam and neon.    frank and nate at a crowded stand.

                               nate
                  no one i know can get that much. it'd
                  have to be pieced together from several
                  suppliers and none of it's gonna be 100-
                  percent pure.

                               frank
                  that's not what i want.

                               nate
                  i know that. but that means dealing
                  with the chiu-chou syndicates in cholon
                  or saigon - if they'll deal with you -

                               frank
                  no, even then it's too late. it's been
                  chopped. i want to get it where they get
                  it. from the source.

     nate stares at him ... then laughs.       frank doesn't.

                               nate
                  you're gonna go get it.

                              frank
                  why not.

                               nate
                  you're gonna go into the fuckin jungle -

                                                                    (cont)

                                                                      23.
                                
55     continued:                                                       55


                                 frank
                    i've lived in jungles all my (life) -

                                nate
                    no. this is the jungle. tigers.
                    vietcong. the fuckin snakes alone will
                    kill you.

aa56   int. new jersey board of bar examiners - day                   aa56   

       a room of student-type desks and no character. richie,                
       and fifty others, have been here for hours taking the exam            
       less than half of them will pass.                                     

a56    ext. jungle - day                                               a56

       a motley bunch of thai thugs and black american soldiers
       with automatic weapons ride mules through the dense jungle
       with nate and frank, who - armed with a pistol, a rifle and
       ammo bandolier like pancho villa - is enjoying himself.
       from his pov, the jungle canopy suddenly opens up on a poppy
       field the size of manhattan. frank stares down at it.

b56    ext. jungle rise / opium farm - day                             b56

       on the ground now with their small private army, nate speaks
       with one of the thais, then translates for frank.

                                 nate
                    he says this whole area's controlled
                    by the kuomintang - chiang kai-shek's
                    defeated army.

       some of whom they can see down below on the opium farm -
       chinese soldiers with outdated weapons. frank tips his head
       to nate at some other figures below -

                                 frank
                    they ain't chinese.

       a handful of better-armed american sentries at the perimeter
       of the farm. cia. frank, nate and the others hang back as
       one of the thais steps ahead to speak to the guerillas.

c56    ext. opium farm - later                                         c56

       the processing center for the entire region. the thai
       translator is with frank to negotiate with a vanquished
       chinese general. other americans and thais guard them
       while the chinese with their cia advisors guard them.

                                                                   24.
                            




d56   int. bamboo dwelling - later - day                            d56

      the chinese general examines frank's papers - passport,
      visa, bank receipts - and lots of cash - then studies frank.

                             general
                how would you get it into the states?

                             frank
                what do you care?

                             general
                who do you work for in there?

                             frank
                what do you care?

                             general
                who are you really?

                             frank
                it says right there.   frank lucas.

                             general
                i mean, who you represent?

                             frank
                me.

      the man doesn't believe it, but lets it go.

                             general
                you think you're going to take a hundred
                kilos of heroin into the us and you don't
                work for anyone? someone is going to
                allow that?

      frank shrugs. the general regards one of his men.       in
      chinese, subtitled:

                             general
                i don't believe a word of this.

      the general regards the cash and paperwork again for a
      moment. and, to frank:

                             general
                after this first purchase, if you're not
                killed by marseilles importers - or their
                people in the states - then what?



                                                                   (cont)

                                                                     25.
                               
d56   continued:                                                     d56


                                frank
                   then there'd be more. on a regular basis.
                   though i'd rather not have to drag my ass
                   all the way up here every time.

      the man regards frank for a long moment.       glances back to
      the cash and paperwork again. finally -

                                general
                   of course not.

e56   ext. jungle army lz - vietnam - day                             e56

      torrential monsoon rains. dripping camouflage. nate and
      frank climb down from the huey. frank no longer wears the
      bandolier. now a press card dangles from his neck.

f56   int/ext. tent / jungle army lz - later - day                    f56

      stripes on the uniform of a black colonel with nate under a
      canopy. outside, in the distance, in the rain, frank hangs
      out with some other black servicemen.

                                colonel
                   where's it now?

                               nate
                   bangkok. i can bring it here or anywhere
                   in between.

                                colonel
                   a hundred kilos.
                          (nate nods)
                   i never seen that much dope in one place.
                                nate
                   it's bigger than an amana refrigerator-
                   freezer.

g56   int/ext. jungle army lz - later - day                           g56

      nate and frank watch the colonel emerge from the tent and
      cross through the rain on duck-boards to another tent to
      speak with a white officer, a 2-star general.

                                nate
                   fifty grand. in advance. that'll
                   cover them, the pilots and the guys on
                   the other end.

                                frank
                   give them a hundred.

                                                                     (cont)

                                                                       26.
                                 
g56   continued:                                                       g56


                                nate
                   fifty, to cover them all.

                                frank
                   a hundred. and it's all i got left. so
                   if that dope doesn't arrive, for whatever
                   reason -
                          (embraces nate and whispers)
                   cousin or no cousin - don't let me down.

      he holds out a business envelope fat with money. nate
      hesitates, knowing frank has just said he'll kill him if
      things don't go right, then takes it.

                                nate
                   i'll let you know when it's in the air.
