72    ext. greensboro, north carolina - dusk                           72

      a clapboard house set down on a piece of land that was
      probably once worked by sharecroppers. an elderly woman
      framed in a lit kitchen window, doing dishes.

      dark yew trees and scavenged, discarded cars and car parts
      like patches of rusty snow. crickets and bullfrogs. from a
      mound of dirt, a young man hurls a baseball to another with
      a catcher's mitt exactly sixty feet away. the kid's got a
      major league arm.

      a glow spills out from a detached shed where a short man in
      his early 30's works on a stock car.

     a greasy phone on the workbench rings and another
     disreputable-looking man, thumbing through a magazine,
     answers.

                               jimmy
                  yeah ... for you.

                                teddy
                  who is it?

     jimmy doesn't know, sets it down. teddy comes over wiping
     his hands on a rag, takes the phone.

                                teddy
                  yeah.
