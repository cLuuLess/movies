      a napoleonic statue of the same man on horseback in a
      fountain outside a castle-like mansion. next to it "ride"
      three others on marble horses - a woman and two children.

                               tosca
                   pull -

      a clay pigeon sails out across the manicured garden. a
      shotgun blast shatters it. the man with the gun - albert
      tosca - hands another to frank. as frank sets to shoot, ana
      can seen behind them, with tosca's wife in the opulent
      house, looking uncomfortable.

                                mrs. tosca
                   the whole place was imported brick by
                   brick from gloucestershire.

                                ana
                   it's very nice.

      mrs. tosca nods. ana nods. a strained silence thicker than
      the tapestries settles over them until -

                               frank
                   pull -

      the shotgun booms -
