           lou toback looks from a surveillance photo of the wedding
           party in his hands, to richie's table of organization: the
           lucas brothers and cousins - in the streets of new york and
           new jersey, arranged in some imagined hierarchy.

                                  toback
                     not your typical day in the life of a
                     dope man, richie.

                                  richie
                     neither was bumpy johnson's and he owned
                     harlem.

                                toback
                   you think frank lucas took over for bumpy
                   johnson? his driver? that's a little
                   far-fetched.

                                 richie
                   is it?   everything he does, he does like
                   bumpy.

                                toback
                   bumpy never wore a chinchilla coat in his
                   life.

                                richie
                   we haven't seen that again. that
                   apparently has been retired to the
                   closet.
