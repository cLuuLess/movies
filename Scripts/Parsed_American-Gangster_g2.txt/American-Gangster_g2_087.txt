115   ext. army base - north carolina - dusk                       115

      the same plane on the tarmac here, taxiing. a pile of
      discarded tv boxes outside a supply warehouse.

      at the perimeter of the base, black servicemen transfer
      heavy taped-up duffel bags from an army jeep to a station
      wagon, hoisting those that won't fit inside onto a roof
      rack. two lucas brothers tie them down with twine.
116   int/ext. car / highway - near washington dc - dusk           116

      the station wagon heading north on a rain-slicked highway,
      the canvas tarpaulin on top flapping. in the distance, the
      spire of the washington monument glows.
