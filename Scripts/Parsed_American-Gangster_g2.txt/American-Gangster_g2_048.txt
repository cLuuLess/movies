70      ext. army base, new jersey - dusk                                70
        silence. marshland. a beat-up chevy parked alongside a
        perimeter fence. frank waits by the car as a military jeep
        with its lights out comes across a firing range. it slows,
        stops. in it, the silhouettes of three servicemen, black,
        armed with m-16's. silence again, before:

                                  army captain
                     open the trunk.

        frank does it, then stands aside as the other servicemen
        drag four large taped-up duffel bags from the jeep to his
        car, lift them into his trunk and slam it shut.
