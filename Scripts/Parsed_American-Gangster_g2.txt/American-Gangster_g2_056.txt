     as frank leads his brothers down the sidewalk, the towncar
     that was parked at the teaneck house, driven by frank's body-
     guard, doc, follows alongside at the same pace they walk.

                            frank
               i was with him every day for fifteen of
               them, looking after him, taking care of
               things, protecting him, learning from
               him.

     the brothers can't help but notice the storekeepers who wave
     to frank, the women who smile, the men who step out of his
     path like there's a red carpet under his polished shoes.

               why? because he didn't own the    company.
               he thought he did. he didn't.     he only
               managed it. someone else owned    it. so
               they owned him.

                            frank
               nobody owns me. because i own my
               company.

                            frank
               and my company sells a product that's
               better than the competition's at a price
               that's lower.

     frank stops outside an apartment door.

               what are we selling, frank?
