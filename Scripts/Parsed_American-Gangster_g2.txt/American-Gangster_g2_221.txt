322    ext. newark - near stephen crane projects - morning           322

       red top's van makes a turn. as abruzzo's makes the same
       turn behind it, the infamous stephen crane projects rise up
       in his windshield.

       his foot comes off the gas. as the gun car passes, he
       sees jones's car slow. teddy's car approaches from another
       direction into the projects, and abruzzo sees spearman pull
       over. then the laundry truck turns in, and richie's slows
       to a stop, like abruzzo's, outside the grounds of the
       foreboding towers. the gospel music ends.

       doc waits in the car while frank buys some flowers at a
       cemetery flower stand. the surveillance car cruises past.
