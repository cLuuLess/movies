     frank comes into the coat check area where doc waits with
     his overcoat. as frank slips into it, miss puerto rico -
     returning from the ladies room - comes through.

                                ana
                  hi.   i'm ana.

                               frank
                  i'm frank.



                                                                     (cont)

                                ana
                   you're frank and this is your place.
                          (he doesn't say whether
                           it is or not)
                   why's it called small's? why don't you
                   call it frank's?

                                frank
                   because i don't have to.

      he smiles, and it's hard to tell which is more enchanted
      with the other.
