165        int. frank's penthouse - continued                                165

           ana's reflection in the vanity mirror as frank slips the
           engagement ring on her finger. she wipes at a tear, then
           gets up and hugs him.

                                      ana
                        yes.

           she kisses him.     admires the ring.     and -

                                     ana
                        i bought you something, too.

           she crosses past the tv, takes a garment bag down from her
           side of the closet, lays it on the bed next to frank's suit
           jacket. she takes hold of the zipper but doesn't
           immediately pull it, hoping perhaps to create some dramatic
           tension.

                                      frank
                        what is it?

           she unzips the bag like she's unveiling great art. but
           instead of seeing what's inside, we're allowed only frank's
           reaction: his smile of anticipation slowly changing to
           chagrin.

           richie observes celebrities and gangsters arriving in
           limousines - sammy davis jr. and his wife, joe louis and
           his, tosca and some of his guys - then enters the arena as
           another limo pulls up. ana climbs out.

                                     ana
                        come on. you look great.
                               (no one else emerges)
                        you want to miss the fight? come on.

           finally, a patent leather shoe pokes out, sets down on the
           curb. then its mate beside it. the shoes step away from
           the limo and -
