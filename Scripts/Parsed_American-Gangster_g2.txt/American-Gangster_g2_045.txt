57    ext. stephen crane projects - morning                            57

      as richie's car turns a corner, the stephen crane projects -
      the most foreboding place on earth - rises up: three dark
      30-floor towers planted on war-torn grounds where a long-ago
      torched and abandoned patrol car sits like a monument.

      he parks and moves through an agitated all-black crowd, past
      an ambulance outside one of the towers, through oppressive
      heat. it's riot weather.
