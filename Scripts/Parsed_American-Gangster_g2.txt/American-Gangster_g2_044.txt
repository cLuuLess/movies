      the nurse/paramedic who stitched up his hand is in richie's
      bed making so much noise he's worried someone will call the
      cops. the phone rings. and won't stop. neither will the
      nurse as richie answers it -

                                rivera v/o                                      
                   richie? richie, i'm in trouble.    this
                   fuckin guy "made" me - i don't know how
                   but he did. he went for his gun. i had
                   to do it, i swear to god. now they're
                   going to kill me.

      richie can hear in sander's voice how serious it is and
      manages to disentangle himself from the woman.
