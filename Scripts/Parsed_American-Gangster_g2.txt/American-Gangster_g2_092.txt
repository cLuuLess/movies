122   int. bus - moving on 116th street - day                      122

      the driver checks his watch:   3:59.   turns his almost-empty
      bus up 8th avenue.

123   int/ext. frank's parked chevy - harlem - day                 123

      air conditioner full blast. radio announcing the time: 4
      o'clock. frank glances out the wet windshield of the chevy
      and watches 116th street transform:

      it's as if an outdoor market has just opened its stalls.
      junkies and dealers emerging from the alleys, storefronts,
      tenements and side streets - from the street itself it seems
      - snarling the cars and delivery trucks caught unaware.
      small blue cellophane packets - and only blue - are pulled
      from pockets and change hands. in alleyways it's cooked up
      and sucked into syringes, and in dank, grim, indescribably
      filthy rooms, plunged into veins -

124   and the reverse:                                             124

      10 and 20 dollar bills changing hands - decks of cash
      rubber-banded together - put into envelopes and delivered
      to the lucas brothers, to:

123   continued:                                                      123
