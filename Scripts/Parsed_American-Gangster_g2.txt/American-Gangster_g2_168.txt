        alone in the empty building, he stares at the t.o.: the
        higher echelon italians like tosca; lower echelon harlem
        guys like charlie williams and frank lucas.

        he gets up then, untacks frank's photograph from its lowly
        position and moves it to a place no black has ever occupied -
        to the top of the pyramid - above the mafia.

        toback regards frank's picture at top of the lucas t.o.

                               richie
                  ins, fbi, irs - i can't get anything out
                  of them. nothing on his travel, his bank
                  accounts, property holdings - nothing.

                               toback
                  that's because they all think you're on
                  the take and you think they are.

                               richie                                         
                  they don't want this to stop. it                            
                  employs too many people. cops, lawyers,                     
                  judges, probation officers, prison                          
                  guards. the day dope stops coming into                      
                  this country, a hundred thousand people                     
                  lose their jobs.                                            
        toback isn't as sure the corruption of the official world is
        that complete.

                                spearman
                  richie.   excuse me.

        spearman gestures to a couple of men in suits who want to
        talk to him.

        richie and tobacke regard the two stone-faced fbi agents -

                               richie
                  who took it out?
                         (nothing from the agents)
                  if there's a contract on me, it would be
                  nice to know who took it out.
                                                                     (cont)

                                                                          90.

                                 fbi agent
                    we can't say without compromising our
                    source. you understand.

                                   richie
                    no.    i don't. not when it's my life.

                                 fbi agent
                    if you want, we can assign someone to
                    you.

                                    richie
                    who?    fbi?   you're going to protect me?

       richie almost laughs at the thought, looks to toback.             in
       fact, none of this is funny.

c231   ext. street - newark - night                                      c231

       walking toward his apartment down its dark street, bag of
       groceries in arm, richie becomes aware someone is following
       him. he slows to let the figure get closer, closer, then
       turns fast, drops the guy and puts a gun to his head.

                                   man
                    don't shoot!    for god's sake.

       richie keeps the gun pressed against the guy's forehead.

                                   richie
                    talk.

                                 man
                    are you richard roberts?      i got a
                    subpoena.
