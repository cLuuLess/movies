                 they basically control the market with
                 it. what the fuck has happened to the
                 world, frank?

                 fuckin crooks.

       rossi, who looks more like a middle-aged accountant than the
       italian dope supplier he is, makes two espressos.

                 sad about bumpy.

                 things are never going to be the same in
                 harlem. the girls, the clubs, the music -
                 walk down the street, nobody bothers you
                 because bumpy's making sure of it.
                        (hands frank one of the

       guys barge into a room, steal money from a crap game at
       gunpoint - cops push guys against a bar, empty their pockets
       - a dealer shoots another dealer in an alley -
