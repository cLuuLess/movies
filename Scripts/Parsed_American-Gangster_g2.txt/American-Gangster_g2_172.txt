238   int. frank's penthouse - later - night                          238

      ana hangs tinsel on the tree as frank gives the shepherd
      some dog toy presents he's bought. more to himself:

                                frank
                   bumpy hardly ever went out at a certain
                   point. he stayed in - read - watched tv -
                   played chess. i thought he chose to lead
                   a quiet life. he didn't. he couldn't go
                   out without something happening.

                                ana
                   we can still go out.

                                frank
                   where? with who? everyone i know is
                   under surveillance. i can't even be with
                   my family at christmas anymore.

      he gets up, pets the dog, and looks out the window at
      christmas angels stretched across the street, at people on
      the sidewalk, wondering perhaps which of them are undercover
      cops, at trupo's car, still parked outside.

                                ana
                   why don't you just pay who you have to
                   pay?

                                frank
                   i do pay them, i pay them all. cops,
                   accountants, lawyers, who don't i pay?
                   everybody. i pay them a fortune, it
                   doesn't matter. it doesn't satisfy them.
                   the more you pay, the more they expect.
                                (more)

                                                                     (cont)

                                                                             94.
                                       
238        continued:                                                        238
                                     frank (cont'd)
                        you can't start with them because they
                        can't stop. it's like dope. they
                        always want more.

           ana looks vulnerable. frank almost feels bad that it's his
           life and problems that have put them here. eventually, to
           try to turn it around -

                                     frank
                        put on something nice, we're going out.

         frank and ana emerge from a service elevator, come down   a
         dark hall and out the back door to an alley to where doc
         waits with the car in the falling snow.
