           charlie has come to visit. a christmas carol plays as frank
           strings the tree with some lights.

                                     frank

                        that. i been paying them since i was ten
                        - put more of their kids through college
                        than the national merit award. this is
                        different, this special investigations

                   they're fucking crooks.   no code of
                   ethics.

      frank plugs the cord in and the tree lights up.

                                frank
                   someone's been following me. besides

      they regard each other.    the carol continues over:
