        richie, at his desk, looks up to see trupo walking through
        the squad room, followed by spearman.

                                  spearman
                     said he'll only talk to you.

        trupo's attitude has completely changed from the first time
        they met. he talks to richie now like a fellow conspirator -


                                                                        (cont)

                                 trupo
                    from what i hear, it was the corsicans.
                    the french connection, fernando rey, the
                    exporters frank has put out of business.
                    now, i can take care of him in new york,
                    but i don't want to have to worry every
                    time he drives across the bridge to
                    jersey someone's gonna take another shot
                    at him.

       richie gives nothing away even as it stuns him that trupo
       would speak to him this blatantly.

                                 trupo
                    we need to start working together. we
                    need to step up our efforts. next time
                    their aim could be better. we need to
                    keep this cash cow alive.

       jimmy racine comes in - sees trupo - and leaves - but not
       before trupo has seen him. and now he sees the lucas table
       of organization he didn't notice when he came in. gets up
       and walks over to it now and takes a closer look. sees
       frank's picture at the top, like enemy number 1.

                                 trupo
                    jesus. what the fuck you doing here?
                    you actually going to arrest frank lucas?
                    what's the matter with you?

                                 richie
                    i'm crazy. can't you tell that? i'm
                    crazy enough to shoot someone and make it
                    look like an accident next time he comes
                    over the bridge without my permission.
                    get the fuck out of new jersey.

       they regard each other a moment before trupo turns to leave.

       a large tv shows chaotic scenes in saigon. the us is
       pulling out of vietnam. tosca has come to see how frank is
       recovering, and finds him, agitated, too long in bed even
       though it's only been a day, changing into a nice shirt,
       putting on his shoes -

                                 frank
                    "i can guarantee you peace of mind,"
                    you said. do i look like a man with
                    peace of mind to you? they shot at my
                    wife. who does that?
                                 (more)
                                                                      (cont)

                                                                       100.
                                 
c265   continued:                                                      c265
                                 frank (cont'd)
                    who was it, which one of your people?
                    i'll take that gun away and shove it up
                    their ass.

                                 tosca
                    i don't know that it was any of them,
                    frank. neither do you.

                                 frank
                    then maybe i'll kill them all just to
                    make a fuckin point.

       tosca seems more philosophical about it - like bumpy might
       have been - but it wasn't him who was shot at.

                                 tosca
                    you want to know who it was? i can
                    tell you. it was a junkie. or a rival.
                    or some dumb ass kid trying to make a
                    name for himself. or someone you forgot
                    to pay off. or slighted without
                    realizing it. or someone you put out of
                    business by being too successful.
                           (pause)
                    success has a lot of enemies. your
                    success is who took a shot at you. how
                    you gonna kill it? by being
                    unsuccessful? you can be successful and
                    have enemies, or unsuccessful and have
                    friends. it's the choice we make.
