    a male paramedic attends to campizi's bloodied face while a
    female paramedic cleans richie's bloodied hand.

                               campizi
                  i swear to god, richie, i didn't know it
                  was you. i would never slam a door on
                  your hand. knowingly.

                               richie
                  you bit my fuckin hand -

     richie lunges at him, hits him again with his injured hand -
     which hurts richie more than it does campizi. the
     paramedics manage to pull him away.

                               campizi
                  what can we do, richie? you don't want
                  to do this. for old times sake, what can
                  we do? who do you want? who can i give
                  you? you want big sal's bookie? you want
                  his accountant? i'll give him to you.

     richie regards him a moment. a policy ring's accountant
     wouldn't be bad. he glances back to his paramedic dabbing
     at his bloody hand, and notices she's not bad-looking. she
     smiles back.
