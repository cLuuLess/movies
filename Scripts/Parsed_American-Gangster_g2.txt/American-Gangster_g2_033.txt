     the sounds of the gulls and surf and roller coaster begin to
     fade as frank throws the stick again.

                            bumpy v/o
               sends the fast nimble sheep out front,
               and the others follow as the shepherd
               walks quietly behind -

     the dog retrieves the stick, but this time - somehow - it's
     to bumpy's hand he returns it. frank listens attentively.

                            bumpy
               he's got the stick - the cane - and
               he'll use if he has to.

                               bumpy (cont'd)
                  but most of the time he doesn't have to.
                  he moves the whole herd - quietly.

     bumpy smiles and tosses the stick.
