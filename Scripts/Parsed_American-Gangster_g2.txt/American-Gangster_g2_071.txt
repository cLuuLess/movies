95   int. small's paradise - night                                    95

     a still-powerful older man in a nice suit rises from his
     chair to wild applause. from the stage -

                               singer
                  mr. joe louis, ladies and gentlemen.

     joe bows graciously, gives a little wave to the crowd, and
     sits back down as the band starts up again.

     at another table, frank sits with charlie williams and
     rossi, slightly older dope men. like frank, they favor
     expensive tailored suits. their dates, too, are nicely
     dressed - not too much make-up or jewelry. frank's glance
     moves from joe louis and his wife to a beautiful young woman
     at the table.

                               frank
                  who's the beauty queen?

                               charlie
                  she is a beauty queen.    no kidding.
                  miss puerto rico.
     her glance crosses frank's briefly but is yanked to the
     entrance of the club when frank's brothers come in with
     their wives and girlfriends. teddy's in a parrot green
     suit, gold chains, hat, acting like he owns the place.
