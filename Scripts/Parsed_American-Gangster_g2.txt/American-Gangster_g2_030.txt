     richie has moved to a small desk cluttered with law
     textbooks. he cracks one open to study for the new jersey            
     bar exam as he eats the soup out of the pot he heated it in.         
     above him on the wall is a framed photograph of joe louis            
     standing over a sprawled-on-the-mat billy conn.
