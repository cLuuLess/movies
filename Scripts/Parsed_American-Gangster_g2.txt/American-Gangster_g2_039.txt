49      ext. park - newark - day - same time                            49

        the sound of the plane growls and fades overhead as richie's
        ex-wife keeps an eye on their son playing on a grassy area.

                                richie
                  i'm sorry.

                               laurie
                  i don't know, richie.

                               richie
                  it couldn't be avoided. next weekend
                  i'll be able to take him.

        she regards him with a weary look, but he's looking over at
        one of the other - better-looking - moms in the park.

                                laurie
                  i'm moving.

        he looks back, not sure he heard right.

                                richie
                  what?   where?

                               laurie
                  to the st. regis, what do you care.
                         (pause)
                  my sister's.

                               richie
                  your sister's. in vegas?

        he glances away to a sound: shattering glass.        some teen-
        agers breaking bottles on the ground.

                               richie
                  you can't move to vegas.     not with
                  michael anyway.

                               laurie
                  what am i supposed to do with him?       leave
                  him with you? there's a picture.


                                                                      (cont)

                                                                       20.
                                 
49   continued:                                                          49


                               richie
                         (to the vandals)
                  hey, you want to shut up over there?

     the teenagers ignore him. he tries to ignore them, but it's
     hard with the constant noise.

                               richie
                  no court will allow it for one thing.
                  i won't allow it.

                                 laurie
                  you?

                               richie
                  when am i supposed to see my son?

                               laurie
                  last weekend!

     their son glances over at them. richie looks over at the
     teenagers again breaking bottles, then back to laurie.

                               richie
                  laurie, you can't raise a kid in las
                  vegas.                                                        

                               laurie
                  oh, like this is a good environment.
                  around your friends. there are less                           
                  creeps in vegas.                                              

                               richie
                  what's he going to grow up to be in a                         
                  mobbed up place like that? what are you                       
                  thinking?

                               laurie
                  i'm thinking - richie - of him!

                                 richie
                  goddamn it -

     the noise of the glass is driving him crazy. he strides
     over to the teenagers, who look at him like, what are you
     gonna do, old man, it's four against one.

                               richie
                  i told you nice to shut the fuck up.
                  now i'm gonna kill you.

     he pulls out his gun and aims it at one of them, then the
     others. all instinctively try to cover their heads.
                                                                       (cont)

                                                                       21.
                                 
49      continued:                                                       49


                                  richie
                     pick up the fuckin glass!

        as they dive to their knees to do what they're told, laurie
        walks away with her son, who looks back over his shoulder at
        his father with his gun out.
