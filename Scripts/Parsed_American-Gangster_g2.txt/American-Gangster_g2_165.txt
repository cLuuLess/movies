222   int. teddy's car - moving - night                                 222
      frank and teddy driving in silence.        eventually -

                                frank
                   you don't go over there any more.

      teddy doesn't like it, but nods. suddenly his face is
      illuminated by light reflecting in the rear view mirror, an
      unmarked police car behind them, flashing its brights.

                                frank
                   it's all right, pull over, what are they
                   going to do? give us a ticket?

      but teddy isn't as calm as he begins to pull over.

                                                                     85.
