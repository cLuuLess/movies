      dial tone: the police sergeant has hung up on him.           richie       
      throws the phone. the paramedics stare at him.                            

                                paramedic
                   you got no back-up? why is that?                             

      the only other person who would know the answer to that is
      rivera, who just shakes his head in despair.                              

                                richie
                   bandage his head.

                                paramedic
                   detective ... he's dead.

                                richie
                   i know he's fucking dead. bandage his
                   head, clean him up, put him on a gurney
                   and prop it up so he's sitting. and open
                   his eyes.
