142   int. gas station garage - day                                   142

      undercover in a wise guy's cashmere sweater and slacks,
      richie watches the mechanic count the $10,000 he's given
      him.

                                richie
                   it's got to be `blue magic.'

                                mechanic
                   yeah, yeah, it's `blue.' you can pick
                   it up here tomorrow. where's the rest of
                   the money?

                                richie
                   that's half. i'll give you the other
                   half tomorrow when you give -

                                mechanic
                   no, no, no, i don't do that.    go fuck
                   yourself.

      richie rather reluctantly hands over the rest of the 20k.

143   int/ext. spearman's car - moving - near gw bridge - day 143
      spearman watches the pickup truck driven by the mechanic
      change lanes up ahead - heading for the george washington
      bridge - and glances over concerned to richie, who is
      changing the cashmere sweater for an old t-shirt.

                                spearman
                   he's going into new york.   are we?

                                richie
                   what are they going to do, arrest us?

                                spearman
                   they could. new york cops.     they can
                   do worse than that.

                                richie
                   we're not losing that money.    go.


                                                                     (cont)

      as spearman follows the truck, the george washington bridge,
      linking jersey to manhattan, looms in the windshield ...
