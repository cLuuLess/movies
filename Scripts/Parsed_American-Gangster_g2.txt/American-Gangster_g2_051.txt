     divorced couples in custody battles wait with their                       
     attorneys in a packed courthouse. an lawyer carrying papers               
     clipped with a $10 bill, comes past richie, who's sitting                 
     with his lawyer, a woman he's probably slept with.                        

                               sheila
                  i'm not talking about your proclivities,
                  richie. those i only know too well. i'm
                  talking about being a cop.

                               richie
                  about taking money? i don't care about                       
                  money. i don't do that.                                      

                               sheila
                  because it'll come out. you're going to
                  have to sit down with shrinks and social
                  workers, her lawyers, the judge, lots of
                  questions.


                                                                      (cont)

                               richie
                  what's going on there?                                       

     the judge's assistant rearranging the pre-trial cases in                  
     order of the amount of gratuity clipped to each - $5, $10,                
     $20 bills.

                               richie                                          
                  no, the money.                                               

                               sheila                                          
                  scheduling. what about your friends                          
                  from the neighborhood? you still hang
                  out with them?

                               richie
                  i play softball on sundays with some
                  guys.

                                 sheila
                  wise guys.    that's going to look good.

                               richie
                  i grew up with them, big deal.

                               sheila
                  what about anthony zaca?                                     

                               richie
                  what about him?
                               sheila
                  richie, i'm just trying to understand
                  things your wife has said. if they're
                  not true, tell me.

                               richie
                  yeah, tony's one of them.

                               sheila
                  is he also your son's godfather?

     richie nods. sheila glances over to where richie's ex-wife
     sits with her own lawyer across the room.

                               sheila
                  do you really care about this? or do
                  you just not want her to win - ever. how
                  often do you see your son as it is?

                                                                      (cont)

                                                                      34.

                                richie
                  not enough.   but she wants to make it                       
                  never.                                                       

                               sheila                                          
                  yeah, all right. give me a twenty.                           
                         (richie doesn't reach for                             
                          his wallet)                                          
                  well, i'm not going to sit here all day.                     

     she takes a twenty from her purse and carries it up to the                
     judge's assistant clipped to their paperwork.                             

                                bailiff
                  all rise -
