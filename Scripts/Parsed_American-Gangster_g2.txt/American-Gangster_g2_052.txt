74   ext. house - teaneck, new jersey - day                             74

     frank and the dog in the back yard of a suburban house.
     his neighbors - those he can see - are white. he hears a
     sound - cars arriving - and crosses toward the house where
     a sold "for sale" sign leans against a half-built kennel.

     out front, a caravan of cars and pickup trucks - north
     carolina plates - loaded with boxes and suitcases - has just
     arrived. exhausted from the drive but excited to be here,
     the travelers climb out: frank's five brothers, their wives
     and kids, and their mother.

     teddy thinks it's the right place. the others aren't as
     sure. the house is too nice. there's a new lincoln towncar
     parked outside the garage. they'll probably be shot for
     trespassing.
     the front door opens and frank comes out, trailed by his
     dog. he first gathers his mother in an embrace, then each
     of his startled brothers.
