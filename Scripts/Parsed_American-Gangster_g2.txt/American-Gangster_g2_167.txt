224    int. richie's apartment - night                                     224

       richie comes in, opens the fridge and stares in, his mind
       elsewhere. a ringing phone pulls him out of it.

                                    richie
                    yeah.   tony.    how's it going?

225    int/ext. tony zaca's house - day                                    225

       tony's wife and daughters can be seen in the suburban
       backyard. here in the kitchen tony and richie watch kernels                 
       of popcorn bounce off the inside walls of the first amana                   
       microwave oven. it's noisier than modern ones.                              

                                 richie                                            
                    the fuck is a `micro' wave?                                    
                                                                          (cont)

                                tony                                            
                   it's a scientific force like atomic                          
                   energy. it rearranges the molecules.                         

                                 richie                                         
                   of what.                                                     

                                tony                                            
                   of anything. of popcorn. you don't                           
                   want to put your head in there.                              

      tony rakes out the plain, `pre-microwaveable' popcorn,                    
      using his hand. gives some to richie. half of it's burnt.                 

                                tony                                            
                   i can get you one of these. just like                        
                   this, brand new. i'll have it delivered.                     

                                 richie                                         
                   no, thanks.   i don't want one.                              

      tony hands richie some snapshots: the zaca family on the                  
      slopes of a resort, and in and outside a beautiful snow-
      dotted cabin.

                                richie
                   this is nice, where's this?

                                 tony
                   aspen.   just got back.    had a great time.                 

                                richie
                   i'd like to ski aspen some day.
                                tony
                   know who we met? burt reynolds. i'm not
                   kidding. lot of people from hollywood go
                   up there now, buying up everything.

                                richie
                   this is your place?

                                tony
                   are you kidding? you know what it's
                   worth? ski-in-ski-out, five bedrooms,
                   sauna, everything. we were guests.
                          (pause)
                   no ... no, that's your place.

      everything seems to stop. richie becomes aware of the
      sounds around them, the girls splashing around outside ...


                                                                       (cont)

                                                                       88.
                                 
225   continued:                                                       225


                                tony
                   isn't there something we can do - about
                   leaving the big guy alone? you know who
                   i mean.

      what richie knows is that no matter what he does or says at
      this point he's got a problem.

                                richie
                   if i don't report what you just said
                   to me, you know i could be in a lot of
                   trouble. if i do, then it's you.

                                tony
                   i'm hoping you won't do that.

      richie considers the room itself, measuring the odds of
      microphones and a recorder being in it somewhere.

                                tony
                   i'm not taping it. how do you know?
                   because we're friends and i'm telling
                   you. this is a real offer.                                

                                richie                                       
                   from who, your uncle?                                     
                          (tony doesn't say)                                 
                   why would you do this? why would you                      
                   risk our friendship?                                      

                                tony                                         
                   because i care what happens to you.                       

                                richie                                       
                   you shouldn't have done it.                               

                               tony                                          
                   i had to. i had no choice. neither do                     
                   you. leave frank lucas alone.                             

                                richie                                       
                   he's not important enough for you to do                   
                   this.                                                     

                                 tony                                        
                   yes, he is.                                               

      richie stares at tony, then puts the pictures in his hand.

                                richie
                   tell marie i'm sorry i had to leave.
                   you can tell her why.

                                                                     89.
