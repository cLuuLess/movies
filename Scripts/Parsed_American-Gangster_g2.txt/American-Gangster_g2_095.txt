132   int. frank's penthouse apartment - night                         132

      the penthouse is now richly decorated. the r & b music
      playing through a state-of-the-art stereo system. it's a
      kind of office party for frank's brothers, cousins, wives
      and girlfriends, distributors like rossi and other east
      harlem guys, charlie williams, couple of cops on frank's
      payroll, and the chemical bank vice president.

                                banker
                   you got a stockbroker, frank?

                                frank
                   i deal with enough crooks as it is.

      the banker jots down a name and phone number on the back of
      one of his business cards.

                                banker
                   this one couldn't be more honest. ask
                   around. he's got a lot of clients in the
                   business. you can't leave all your money
                   in safety deposit boxes; give him a call.

      the banker hands him the card and moves on. frank's trying
      to have a good time, but the level of noise and revelry is
      beginning to make him uncomfortable.

                                 charlie
                   frank.   this is mike sibota.

      sibota tries not to look as nervous as he feels.
                                                                      (cont)

                                 frank
                   mr. sibota.   what can i get you?

                                sibota
                   a left-hander from what charlie tells me.
                   your nephew?

      frank points to his nephew, stevie, across the room.

                                frank
                   it's been his dream all his life to play
                   for the yankees - and he's good enough.

                                sibota
                   so i hear. you have him come see me.
                   we'll give him a try-out.

      as the scout hands his card to frank, we whip over to where
      teddy, his driver jimmy racine and their girlfriends, coked
      up, are laughing as a black cop, flashing his detective's
      shield, pretends to frisk jimmy.

                                detective
                   what's this?
                          (taking a .45 from jimmy's
                           pocket)
                   oh, that's it, i'm taking you in.

                                jimmy
                          (joking)
                   you can't take me in for that, i got       a
                   license for that, motherfucker.

                                detective
                          (gives the gun back)
                   this then -
                          (the pile of coke on the
                           coffee table)
                   but first -

      the cop sucks up a line before pretending to cuff jimmy.

                                detective
                   all right, now i'm arresting you.

      everybody laughs.    teddy peels $100's from a money clip.

                                 teddy
                   let him go.   this is for you.

                                detective
                   what is that, a bribe?     oh, now you're
                   all under arrest.
                                                                       (cont)

                                                                     54.

      the cop pretends to arrest them all, but what he doesn't
      pretend is the hand he puts on jimmy's girlfriend's breast
      as he frisks her.

                                jimmy
                   what is that?

      it was quick but jimmy saw it, even though his girlfriend
      didn't react. the cop, oblivious, is cuffing teddy now.

                                detective
                   i'm taking you all in.

                                jimmy
                   i said, what the fuck was that?

                                detective
                   what was what?

      the room explodes with a boom and the detective crumples to
      the floor, clutching at his leg, blood running through his
      fingers onto the carpet. frank stares.

                                jimmy
                   oh, he's all right. i just shot him in
                   the leg. you got a health plan, what are
                   you complaining about. he's fine. here -
                          (peels off some money)
                   five hundred all right? six? look, he's
                   feeling better all the time.

      suddenly, frank grabs jimmy and throws him against the wall.
