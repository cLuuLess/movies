          trupo snaps the suitcase open revealing five half-kilo bags
          of uncut heroin in clear plastic bags. the other cops pull
          from the grocery bags: a pyrex mixing bowl, flour sifter,
          boxes of milk-sugar, latex kitchen gloves, a medical scale,
          and yellow baggies.

          hands peel back the distinctive black and green "evidence"
          tape on the clear plastic bags. dump the heroin into twenty
          yellow baggies. a half-kilo of lactose is poured into each
          of the now-empty property room bags.

                                 trupo
                    now just enough for the reagent test.

          he removes one tablespoon of heroin from each of the
          baggies, and the now-almost-heroin-free powder is mixed
          through the flour sifter, poured back into the clear bags,
          the tape resealed, the bags returned to the suitcase.
