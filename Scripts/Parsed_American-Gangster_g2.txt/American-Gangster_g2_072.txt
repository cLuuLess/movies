96   int. back room - small's paradise - later                        96

     frank hustles teddy into an empty back room.

                               frank
                  what is this?

     he turns teddy so he's facing a mirror.

                               teddy
                  what. these are clothes.     this is a very
                  nice (suit) -


                                                                    (cont)

                                                                    43.

                               frank
                  i'm wearing clothes. these are clothes.
                  those -
                         (teddy's in the mirror)
                  - are a costume. with a sign on it that
                  says arrest me. you look like fuckin
                  jackie fox.

                               teddy
                  what's wrong with jackie.    i like jackie.

                               frank
                  you like jackie? you want to be
                  superfly? go work for him, end up in a
                  cell with him.

     teddy pulls himself from frank's grasp. smooths his shirt,
     adjusts his hat. frank tries to explain to him:

                               frank
                  the guy making all the noise in the room
                  is the weak one. that's not who you want
                  to be.

                               teddy
                  he wants to talk to you by the way.     i
                  told him i'd tell you.

     frank stares at his brother's reflection in the mirror.

                               frank
                  you and jackie were talking about me?

                               teddy
                  not about you. we were talking. he said
                  he wanted to talk to you about something.

     frank clearly wants nothing to do with jackie fox.

                               frank
                  i'm taking you shopping tomorrow.

                               teddy
                  i went shopping today.

                               frank
                  you go shopping every day.    like a girl.
