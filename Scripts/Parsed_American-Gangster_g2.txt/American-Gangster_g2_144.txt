200   ext. central park - later - twilight                          200

      the lincoln and security cars and trupo's shelby parked.
                             frank
                       (to ana)
                stay in the car

      as frank and doc climb out, frank motions to his other
      security men to remain calm, he'll handle this.

                             trupo
                hello, frank.

      if frank is surprised trupo knows his name, he doesn't show
      it, or anything else except an air of professional courtesy.

                             frank
                detective.

      trupo looks in at ana in the back seat, smiles at her. she
      turns her head away and closes the door. trupo leads frank
      away for a private conversation -
                                                                   (cont)

                                                                       76.
                                 
200   continued:                                                       200


                                trupo
                   you sure you done the right thing?
                   she's a beautiful girl - there's no
                   question - but she's got an attitude
                   on (her) -

                                  frank
                   listen   to me. before you say another
                   word -   about her - or me - remember that
                   you're   saying it on the most important
                   fuckin   day of my life.

                                trupo
                   man walks around in a fifty thousand
                   dollar chinchilla coat and he never even
                   bought me a cup of coffee? something
                   wrong there.

                                frank
                   i don't know what you're talking about.

                                trupo
                   you pay your bills, frank?

                                frank
                   you want to keep talking, talk to my
                   lawyer, here's his card. you call him,
                   because we're done here -

                                trupo
                   do you pay your bills, i asked you.

                                frank
                   if you're not getting your share, it's
                   not my fault, go ask the chief of police.

                                trupo
                   what's my share? you don't even know me.
                   maybe i'm special.

                                frank
                   no, you're all the fuckin same.

                                trupo
                          (shows his shield)
                   what does that say?
                          (frank ignores him)
                   special - investigations - unit. see
                   that word there? "special."
                          (he takes out a restaurant
                           business card)
                   ten grand, first of each month, delivered
                   here.
                                                                       (cont)

                                                                        77.
                                  
200   continued:                                                        200


      frank ignores the card, stares at trupo like he's a fool.

                                frank
                   detective ... there are some things you
                   don't do. this is one of them. not on a
                   man's wedding day.

      frank's resolve throws trupo off his rhythm.           he manages:

                                trupo
                   have a nice honeymoon.
