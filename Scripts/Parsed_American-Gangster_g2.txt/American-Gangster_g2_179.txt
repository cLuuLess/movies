           frank sees the car again, coming around the corner, walks
           briskly back to where ana waits. the car is almost upon
           them as he grabs her by the wrist and pulls her hard along

           as frank pushes in past the doors with ana, the windows

           frank off the floor like a presidential bodyguard, hustles
