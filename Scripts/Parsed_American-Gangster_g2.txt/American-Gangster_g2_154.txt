      the detectives' cars parked behind a warehouse. richie
      peers into binoculars at: teddy's car parked by frank's
      outside another warehouse loading dock. frank gets out,
      discusses something with his brother, comes past jimmy to
      some men in bloody white coats.

      he talks to them, returns to his car, takes a valise from
      the trunk. he snaps it open revealing stacks of cash, hands
      it over and walks to a semi-truck, glancing once in richie's
      direction. though he can't see anyone there he gives a wave
      to them - or is it to the truck driver to pull out -
