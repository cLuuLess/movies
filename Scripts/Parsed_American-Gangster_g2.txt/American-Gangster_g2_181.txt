           the brothers watch as a private doctor attends frank's
           wounds. he seems all right fine except for the fact that
           someone had the fucking nerve to take a shot at him - and
           charlie he sees in the newspaper - gunned down, dead, lurid
           weegee-like photo of him on the front page.
                                  teddy
                     was it jackie?
                            (frank doesn't say)
                     i'll fuckin kill him whether it was or
                     not, you tell me to.
                            (nothing from frank)
                     what do you want us to do, frank? we
                     can't just sit here and -

                                  frank
                     who didn't like charlie?   everybody liked
                     charlie ...

                                  ana
                     who shot at us?
                            (frank can't tell her)
                     it doesn't matter. we're leaving.

                                                                       (cont)

                                                                        97.

      she pulls a drawer open. takes out their passports.
      begins packing. the brothers watch, not sure what to do,
      or say. to them -

                                 frank
                   go home.   go see your kids.

      he obviously wants to talk to ana alone. pulls away from
      the doctor. they all leave. ana keeps packing.

                                frank
                   what are you doing?     where've you been?

                                ana
                   we're leaving from here.      money's in
                   the car.

                                  frank
                   what money?

                                ana
                   everything from your mother's house.

                                  frank
                   in your car?

                                  ana
                   yes.

                                frank
                   where's the car?

                                  ana
                   out front.
                                frank
                   with ten million dollars in it?

                                ana
                   i didn't count it.

                                frank
                   are you crazy? take it back to teaneck.
                   what are you doing driving around without
                   security? doc'll take you back.

                                ana
                   we're not going there, we're going to the
                   airport. we're leaving the country.

                                  frank
                   to go where?    no, we're not.

                                                                        (cont)

                                                                        98.
                                  
255     continued:                                                      255


                                  ana
                     frank, charlie's dead. they tried to
                     kill us. what else has to happen - ?

        he grabs her and holds her to calm her down.

                                   frank
                     shhh.   come on, now.   shhh.

        he holds her close, waits for her breathing to slow before:

                                  frank
                     where are we going to go? spain?
                     china? which fuckin place is it going
                     to be?

                                  ana
                     we can go anywhere we want.     we can live
                     anywhere.

                                  frank
                     we can run and hide is what you're
                     saying.

        he slowly shakes his head: that's something he'll never do.

                                  frank
                     this is where i'm from. this is where
                     my family is. my business. my mother.
