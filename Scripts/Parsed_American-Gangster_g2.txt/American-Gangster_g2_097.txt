      richie sifts through the morning mail at his desk. stops                   
      on an envelope from the new jersey bar association. as he                  
      works up the nerve to open it, spearman, jones and abruzzo                 
      organize the italian wise guys' photos on the t.o.                         

                                jones
                   ice pick paul goes here -

                                abruzzo
                   no, he's under benny two-socks -

                                jones
                   no, you're thinking of benny the bishop.
                   benny two-socks is tosca's deadbeat son-                      
                   in-law.
                                spearman
                   jonesy's right.                                               

      richie comes over, studies the table of organization a                     
      moment, then begins untacking the photos from the top down -               

                                jones
                   what're you doing?     we just -

                                richie                                           
                   for a cop the uppermost thing is the                          
                   arrest. for a prosecutor, the arrest is                       
                   nothing without the evidence to convict.                      
                   we don't have any real evidence on anyone                     
                   on this board, so they're coming down.                        
                   we're starting over from the street.                          



                                                                        (cont)

                                                                     56.

                   what are you, a prosecutor all of a                        
                   sudden?                                                    

      richie tacks his exam results onto the t.o.       he passed.
