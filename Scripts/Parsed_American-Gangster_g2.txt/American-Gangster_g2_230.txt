331    ext. stephen crane projects - morning                        331

       the tall buildings cast long shadows of dread on every
       activity below, no matter how routine: a woman pushing a
       stroller, guys shooting hoops, a couple arguing, kids on
       bikes, old men resting on a graffiti-covered bench.

       the unmarked cars drive slowly through it all. the place
       teeters on the brink of violence you can feel as gangs move
       under the shadow of the towers.
