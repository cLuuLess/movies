       frank, on a wooden folding chair at bumpy's grave, hears
       the gunning of engines and barking of cops. he turns to see
       doc being handcuffed on the ground by the towncar. glances
       to a lone figure walking toward him over a rise. richie.

       richie arrives at the grave. regards the monument to
       ellsworth johnson, and frank sitting calmly regarding him.
       richie glances around the peaceful surroundings ...

                              richie
                 what kind of trees are these?

       frank looks at the trees, then at richie, with equal
       serenity.

                              frank
                 you think you got frank lucas.      you
                 got nothing.

       richie cuts the tags off a new, inexpensive suit. slips               
       the jacket on, which seemed somehow to fit a little better            
       at the store. cuts the tags off a tie.

       someone throwing up in a stall. the toilet flushes, the               
       door opens and richie steps up to a sink, regards his face            
       in the mirror. under the fluorescent lights - maybe under             
       any kind - his skin is a shade of death. he splashes water            
       on it and tries to gather himself.
