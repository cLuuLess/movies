86   int. police gym - later - day                                    86     

     richie's changing into his street clothes.

                               richie
                  but it's federal. i'd have to answer
                  to who? fbi?

                               toback
                  me and the u.s. attorney. no one else.
                  no fbi. hoover knows better than to mix
                  his men with dope. too much temptation
                  for the feeble-minded.

     though he's not in much of a position to refuse the
     assignment, richie still isn't convinced it's a good idea.
     toback levels with him -
                               toback
                  richie, a detective who doesn't have
                  the cooperation of his fellow detectives
                  can't be effective.

                               richie
                  you know why i don't have it.

                               toback
                  doesn't matter.

                               richie
                  no, they're all on the take and i'm not                    
                  and it doesn't matter to anyone. instead
                  of giving you a medal for turning in
                  money, they bury you.



                                                                    (cont)

                                                                    41.
                              
86   continued:                                                       86


                               toback
                  it's fucked up. you're right. maybe                        
                  this's an opportunity away from all that.                  

     they regard each other.    eventually -

                               richie
                  i'll do it, but only like this: i
                  don't set foot in a police station again.
                  i work out of a place of my own. and i
                  pick my own guys. guys i know wouldn't
                  take a nickel off the sidewalk.

                               toback
                  done.
