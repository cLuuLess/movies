219   int. jackie fox's club - dusk                                 219

      jackie's club looks like a set from a blaxploitation film.
      frank and teddy, led by a bodyguard, come past some turkey
      carcasses and other remnants of thanksgiving to where jackie
      and a couple friends cavort with some naked girls.

                              jackie
                frank.   welcome.

                             frank
                we need to talk.

                              jackie
                great.   girls, get out.

      the girls gather their things and leave. frank wipes at a
      modern leather chair with his handkerchief, throws it away,
      sits. jackie lays out a couple lines, offers frank a rolled
      up hundred dollar straw. frank shakes his head, no thanks.

                             jackie
                you talked to charlie. you want to hear
                more about my black coalition. let me
                explain it to you -

      but first, let me suck up a line of coke -

                             frank
                that's not why i'm here.
                       (jackie glances up from the
                        powder. no?)
                everybody's happy, jackie. charlie, baz,
                the cops, the italians, everybody.
                everybody except you.

                             jackie
                i'm happy.

                             frank
                then i don't understand. why do you have
                to take something that's perfectly good
                the way it is, and wreck it?

      jackie doesn't seem to understand.

                             frank
                brand names mean something, jackie.
                consumers rely on them to know what
                they're getting. they know the company
                isn't going to try to fool them with an
                inferior product. they buy a ford, they
                know they're gonna get a ford.

                                frank (cont'd)
                   not a fuckin datsun.
                          (his look says, right?)
                   blue magic is a brand name; as much a
                   brand name as pepsi. i own it. i stand
                   behind it. i guarantee it and people
                   know that even if they don't know me any
                   more than they know the chairman of
                   general foods.

                                jackie
                   what the fuck are you talking about,
                   frank?

                                frank
                   what you're doing, as far as i'm
                   concerned, when you chop my dope down to
                   five percent, is trademark infringement.

      that.   that's what this is about.      jackie nods, but -

                                jackie
                   with all due respect, frank, if i buy
                   something, i can do whatever i want with
                   it.

                                frank
                   that's not true. that's where you're
                   wrong.

                                jackie
                   if i buy a car, i can paint it, god damn
                   it.

                                frank
                   jackie, you don't need to. you don't
                   need to make more money than you can with
                   blue the way it is. no one does. at a
                   certain point it's just greed.

                                jackie
                   what do you want, frank?    you want me to
                   call it something else?

                                frank
                   i have to insist. you call it blue
                   magic, that's misrepresentation.

                                jackie
                   fine. i'll call it red magic, even
                   though it doesn't sound as good.

                                frank
                   that's all i'm saying.   wrap it in red
                   cellophane and -
                                                                     (cont)

                                                                       84.

                                 jackie
                   pink magic.   black magic -

                                frank
                   whack it down to nothing, tie a bow
                   around it and call it blue dogshit if you
                   want, just don't let me catch you doing
                   this again.

      jackie regards frank for a long moment ...

                                jackie
                   catch me? insist? infringement? i
                   don't like these words as much as please -
                   thank you - sorry to bother you, jackie.
                   these are better words to use you come
                   into my place without an invitation.

      jackie waits to hear a kinder word but frank doesn't offer
      one. jackie nods, fine, okay, but it's more like a warning.
