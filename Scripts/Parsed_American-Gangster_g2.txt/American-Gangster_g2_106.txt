144   ext. east harlem street - day                                   144

      the pickup pulls to the curb outside a pleasant avenue
      grocery store. as the guy enters the place, spearman's car
      stops long enough for richie to climb out, and continues on.

      richie crosses the street, tries to see who the guy is
      talking to inside, but he's just buying a cup of coffee to
      go. spearman's car turns the corner to circle around the
      block. as soon as it's gone, the man emerges from the
      restaurant with the coffee and walks straight at richie who
      has to double back quickly not to be seen

      richie sees a delivery truck double-parked, guys unloading
      crates. hears a horn and knows it's must be spearman stuck
      on the side street. the mechanic starts his truck.
      desperate not to lose him (and his money), richie hurries               
      over to a taxi stopped at a light, flashes his badge.                   

                               richie
                   get out.

                               taxi driver
                   what?

                                richie
                   get the fuck out of the car!

      the driver realizes the man outside his taxi is crazy and
      tries to get his window rolled up. reaching in, richie gets
      his arm stuck, pulls at the lock, yanks the door open, drags
      the driver out, breaking the cabbie's arm, and jumps in.

      he swings the cab into opposing lanes to get around traffic,
      screeches around the corner, glimpses the truck far up ahead
      - guns the engine, flies through a red light, glances at his
      mirror at the cars that just missed him almost colliding -

      the truck turns up ahead, and richie barrels through another
      red light, turns the corner and keeps the truck, a couple
      car-lengths ahead - in sight.
