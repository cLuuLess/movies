115	int. cab.  cairo street.  o/s shepheard's hotel.  night.

the cab driver is asleep. a loud pop! jerks him awake.  in the back of 
the car geoffrey has opened the champagne.  he lets it overflow, then 
takes a swig.  he notices the startled driver and puts up an apologetic 
arm.

back, violently.  they disappear.

			cabbie

and he throws a silencing wad of money onto the seat by the cabbie.
