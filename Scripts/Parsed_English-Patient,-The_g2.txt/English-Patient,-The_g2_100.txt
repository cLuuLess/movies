178	ext.    the cave of swimmers.    day.

he has wrapped katharine in the silk folds of her parachute and emerges 
from the near the familiar cleft in the rock, struggling with the 
exertion of the climb as they approach the cave of swimmers.  he has a 
large water bottle slung around his neck and a haversack, and is loaded 
like a pack horse.  katharine opens her eyes.

			katharine
				(whispering)
		why did you hate me?

			almÁsy
		what?

			katharine
		don't you know you drove everybody mad?

			almÁsy
		don't talk.

			katharine
				(gasping)
		you speak so many bloody languages
		and you never want to talk.

they stagger on.  he suddenly notices a stain of gold at her neck.  
it's saffron, leaking from a silver thimble which hangs from a black 
ribbon.

			almÁsy
				(overwhelmed)
		you're wearing the thimble.

			katharine
		of course.  you idiot.  i always wear it.
		i've always worn it.  i've always loved you.

almásy cries as he walks - huge sobs, no words - convulsed with the 
pain of it.  they approach the cave.


179*.	int.    cave of swimmers.    day.

almásy comes through in shadows, carrying katharine, blocking out the 
light that pours into the entrance of the cave.  once inside, he sets 
her down incredibly gently, makes a bed of blankets and the parachute.  
he turns on his flashlight.

			katharine
		it's so cold.

			almÁsy
		i know.  i'm sorry.  i'll make a fire.
		i'll be back.

			katharine
				(panicking suddenly)
		don't leave me!

			almÁsy
		i'm just going to find things for the fire.


179a*.	int.    cave of swimmers.    torchlight.

almásy returns with the stocks of acacia twigs the expedition had 
cached.  as he makes the fire, the light sends his shadow flitting 
across the walls.

			katharine
		shall we be all right?

			almÁsy
		yes.  absolutely.

			katharine
				(with a laugh)
		oh dear.

			almÁsy
				(as he works)
		listen to me, katharine.  you've broken
		your ankle and i'm going to have to try
		and bind it.  i think your wrist might be
		broken, too - and some ribs, which is
		why it's hurting you to breathe.  i'm
		going to have to walk to el taj.  given
		all the traffic in the desert these days
		i should bump into one army or another
		before i reach there - or fenelon-barnes
		and his camel.  and then i'll be back 
		and we'll be fine, and i'll never leave you.

the fire is lit and he comes over to her, kneels beside her.

			katharine
		do you promise?  i wouldn't want to die
		here.  i wouldn't want to die in the desert.
		i've always had a rather elaborate funeral
		in mind, with particular hymns.  very
		english.  and i know exactly where i
		want to be buried.  in our garden.  where
		i grew up.  with a view of the sea.  so
		promise me you'll come back for you.

			almÁsy
		i promise i'll come back.  i promise
		i'll never leave you.  and there's
		plenty of water and food.  you
		can have a party.

he kisses her tenderly.  pulls out his herodotus and lays it beside 
her.  then he puts down the flashlight.

			almÁsy
		and a good read.
				(of the flashlight battery)
		don't waste it.

			katharine
		thank you.
				(clouds over)
		will you bury geoffrey?  i know
		he's dead.

			almÁsy
		i'm sorry, katharine.

			katharine
		i know.

			almÁsy
		every night i cut out my heart but 
		in the morning it was full again.

he's tearing strips from the parachute with his knife.  as he starts to 
bind her wrist he gets her to talk, trying to distract her from the 
pain.

			almÁsy
		tell me about your garden.

			katharine
				(tries to focus)
		our garden, our garden - not so much
		the garden, but the copse alongside it,
		wild, a secret way plunging down to the
		shore and then nothing but water
		between you and france.  the devil's
		chimney it was called -
				(he pulls tight on the binding)
		the devil's chimney, i don't know why.
				(he kisses her)
		darling.  my darling.
