almásy has led the whole party into the heart of the cave.  now madox 
comes alongside him at the wall, his flashlight joining almásy's and 
increasing the visibility of the paintings.  a dark-skinned figure, 
apparently in the process of diving into water, comes clearly into 
view.  then others supine, arms outstretched.

a hive of activity.  the team has set up trestles to catalogue the 
finds as the bedouin come out with baskets of detritus, which they 
empty onto a growing heap as the cave is cleared out.  entering the 
cave, almásy passes with camera equipment, just as d'ag emerges 
carrying the corpse of a perfectly preserved desert fox.  d'ag gestures 
to almasy with his customary enthusiasm, holding up the body of the 
fox.
