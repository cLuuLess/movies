51	int.    shepheard's hotel.    cairo.    evening.

the long bar.  the exploration team are drinking at a table.  they are 
not entirely off-duty - alm√°sy and madox as ever ponder the maps.  
geoffrey clifton appears, arms waving.

			clifton
		gentlemen, good evening!

he sits down.   madox hails the waiter.

			d'agostino
		how is your charming wife?

			clifton
		uh, marvelous.  she's in love with
		the hotel plumbing.  she's either in
		the swimming pool - she swims for
		hours, she's a fish, quite incredible -
		or she's in the bath.  actually,
		she's just outside.
				(responding to their
bewildered expressions)
		chaps only in the long bar.

			madox
				(standing, embarrassed)
		of course.  well, we should all go
		out onto the terrace.

			clifton
		oh no, really.  she has her book.

			madox
		i won't hear of it.  none of us will.
