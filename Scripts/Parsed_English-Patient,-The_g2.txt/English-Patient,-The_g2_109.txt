192	int.    the monastery stables.    day.

kip is working at a blacksmith's forge in the stables.  he is heating 
pieces of metal.  he has arranged his material on a bench - a bayonet, 
a rifle, a piece of bomb casting.

	hana enters, goes up, hugs him from behind.

			hana
		what are you up to?

			kip
		that gun at lahor, kipling's cannon -
		zamzammah - remember?  that was 
		made out of the metal of ordinary things.  
		i want to make an ordinary thing
		out of guns.

his bayonet is thrust into the forge.  it's red hot.

			kip
		when i went to england i was amazed at
		what went on, the waste - i'd been taught
		to re-use everything, the dung from a cow
		to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a
		typewriter - india could live for a 
		hundred years on what i saw thrown away.

			hana
		i should go to the house, get breakfast.

			kip
		the lamp was burning all night in his
		room.  caravaggio was there with him.

she goes to kiss him.   he is over the fire and protests.

			kip
		this is hot!

			hana
				(teasing him)
		nya-nya-nya!


193*.	int.    the patient's room.    day.

caravagio is injecting the patient with morphine.

			caravaggio
		and did you never see katharine?  you
		never got back to the cave?

			the patient
		yes, i got back there finally to keep
		my promise.  to come back for her.
		and then of course i couldn't... i
		couldn't even do that properly.
