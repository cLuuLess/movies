212	int.    tiger moth.    day.

inside the cockpit:  the couple as at the front of the film.  almásy 
obliterated by goggles and helmet.  katharine behind him, slumped 
forwards as if sleeping.

almásy banks across the plateau of the gilf kebir and glances down.  in 
a ravine is a sudden oasis of white acacias.  he is mesmerized.

and then it's gone and he passes into the earth without maps - the 
desert - as it stretches out for mile after mile.

		the lamp's gone out and i'm writing
		in the darkness...

almásy, the english patient, begins to sing - szerelem, szerelem - 
until that also fades and is replaced by the woman's tender lament 
heard at the beginning of the film, singing for all that has been lost.

the sound of gun fire...
