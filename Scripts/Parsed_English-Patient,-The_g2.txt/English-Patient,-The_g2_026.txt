40	ext.    the monastery gardens.    noon.

the tortoise heads towards the trough, to the gurgling accompaniment.  
it reaches the shade only to be greeted by the obstacle of some tennis 
shoes, a frock.  it clambers over as the water begins to belch out.  
hana, naked, kneeling in the trough, receives the shower with a great 
yelp of shivering joy.


41*.	ext.    the monastery cloisters.    night.

it's dark, but something is going on here.  hana is caught by the stray 
shafts of moonlight.  she is scratching something on the flagstones.  
her skirt is bunched up around her thighs.  she throws something in the 
air.  it's a spile, used to tap into the maple tree for syrup.  it 
lands with a crack.  suddenly she is flying across the space, a hop, a 
skip, a jump.  then turns at the other end, dips for the stone, then 
back again, in this blindman's version of hopscotch.


42*.	int.    train.    italy 1944.    before dawn.

as hana hops and jumps in the shadows she is suddenly on a train in 
1944.  a hospital train ploughs through the night carrying the wounded 
back to naples.

hana walks through a long carriage.  her hair is long.  she could be 
ten years younger than the hana at the monastery.  and easy.  she stops 
at the bunk of a new patient.  hana bends to the boy.  he's had 
shrapnel in his legs and cheek.  she speaks softly to him.

			hana
		how are you?

			boy
		okay.

			hana
		your leg will be fine.  a lot of shrapnel
		came out - i saved you the pieces.

			boy
		you're the prettiest girl i ever saw.

			hanna
				(she hears this every day)
		i don't think so.

			boy
		would you kiss me?

			hana
		no, i'll get you some tea. wait till
		you're in naples.  you'll find a
		girl there.

			boy
				(innocent)
		just kiss me.  it would mean
		such a lot to me.

			hana
				(tender, believing him)
		would it?

she kisses him, very softly, on the lips.

			boy
		thank you.

he closes his eyes.  is almost instantly asleep.  hana smiles, 
continues along the compartment.  voices call out.

			#1 injured man
		nurse - i can't sleep.

			#2 injured man
		nurse?  would you kiss me?

			#3 injured man
		you're so pretty!

			#4 injured man
		hinky-dinky parlez-vous!

			hana
				(good-naturedly waving
away their joke)
		very funny.  go to sleep.

she gets into a corridor.  mary is coming the other way.  she carries a 
blood-soaked bundle.  hana questions her appalled expression.

			mary
		don't ask.
