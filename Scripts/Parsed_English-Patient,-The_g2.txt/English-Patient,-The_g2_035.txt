53	int.    shepheard's hotel.    night.

the ballroom.  a dance finishes.  almásy takes over from d'agostino to 
partner katharine.  they dance beautifully.  the others remain on the 
terrace in deep conversation.

			katharine
		why did you follow me yesterday?

			almÁsy
		excuse me?

			katharine
		after the market, you followed me
		to the hotel.

			almÁsy
		i was concerned.  as i said, women in
		that part of cairo, a european women,
		i felt obliged to.

			katharine
		you felt obliged to.

			almÁsy
		as the wife of one of our party.

			katharine
				(sardonic)
		so why follow me?  escort me, by
		all means.  following me is
		predatory, isn't it?

the dance finishes.  they walk back to their table, where almásy leads 
katharine back to her seat next to clifton.

			clifton
		i was just saying, i'm going to cable
		downing street, see if i can't stir up
		a few shillings - katharine's mother
		and the pm's wife are best -

			katharine
				(interrupting)
		darling, for goodness' sake!

			clifton
		well, she is!


54*.	int.    the patient's room.    day.

hana, having already replaced the bedlinen, is standing on a stepladder 
trying to hang home-made drapes around the bed as caravaggio knocks 
tentatively, then comes in.

			caravaggio
		hello.

			the patient
		finally!  so you're our
		canadian pickpocket?

	he goes to help hana, they work as he talks.

			caravaggio
		thief, i think, is more accurate.

			the patient
		i understand you were in africa.
		whereabouts?

			caravaggio
		oh, all over.

			the patient
		all over?  i kept trying to cover
		a very modest portion and still failed.
				(to hana)
		are you leaving us?  now's our
		opportunity to swap war wounds.

			hana
		then i'm definitely going.

and she exits.  the men consider her.

			caravaggio
		does she have war wounds?


55*.	int.    the monastery.    hana's room.    day.

as hana walks up her stairs she finds herself overhearing their 
conversation as it threads up through the hole in the ceiling.  she 
strips her own bed of the curtain she uses for a sheet.

			the patient
		i think anybody she ever loves
		tends to die on her.

			caravaggio
		are you planning to be the exception?

			the patient
		me?  you've got the wrong end of
		the stick, old boy.
				(a pause)
		so - caravaggio - hana thinks you
		invented your name.

			caravaggio
		and you've forgotten yours.

			the patient
		i told her you would never invent
		such a preposterous name.

			caravaggio
		i told her you can forget everything
		but you never forget your name.


56*.	ext.    beach cabin.    italy.    day.    1944.

hana is still listening but now she's outside a cabin.  she's in her 
uniform, clearing things away.  the cabin door is ajar.  an officer 
moves around, then sits to make notes.

			officer (o/s)
		what about your rank or serial number?

			the patient (o/s)
		no.  i think i was a pilot.  i was found
		near the wreckage of a plane by the
		bedouin.  i was with them for some time.

this convalescence hospital has been fashioned from a long row of 
bathing cabins on the coast, complete with campari umbrellas and metal 
tables, at which are seated the bandaged and the dying and the 
comatose, staring out to sea or in slow, muted conversation.  hana 
walks up to the patient's cabin.  he is propped up with a view of the 
sea, which is interrupted by the pacing officer.  hana has a blanket 
and a chart for the patient's bed.  she busies herself.

			officer
		do you remember where you were born?

			the patient
		am i being interrogated?  you should be
		trying to trick me.  ask me about
		tottenham hotspur.  or buckingham palace.
		about marmite - i was addicted.  or make
		me speak german, which i can, by the way.

			officer
		why?  are you german?

			the patient
		no.  

			officer
		how do you know you're not german if
		you don't remember anything?

			the patient
		you tell me.  i remember a lot of things.
		i remember a garden, plunging down to
		the sea - the devil's chimney we called
		it - and there was a cottage at the
		bottom, right on the shore, nothing
		between you and france.

			officer
		this was your garden?

			the patient
		or my wife's.

			officer
		then you were married?

			the patient
		i think so.  although i believe that
		to be true of a number of germans.
		might i have a glass of water?

hana pours him a glass of water.  he notices her.

			the patient
		thank you.
				(he sips)
		look - my lungs are useless -
				(makes a small gap with
his fingers)
		i've got this much lung...the rest
		of my organs are packing up -
		what could it possibly matter if i
		were tutankhamun?  i'm a bit of
		toast, my friend - butter me and
		slip a poached egg on top.

hana leaves, smiling at the patient's irascibility, sharing this with 
the officer, who frowns.  the interview continues.
