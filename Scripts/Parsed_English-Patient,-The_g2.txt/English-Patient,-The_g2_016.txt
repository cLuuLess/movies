25	int.   library.   day.

hana comes in, gathers up another armful of books and carries them out 
to continue her stair repairs.


26*.	int.    the patient's room.    day.

hana enters.

			the patient
		what was all the banging?  were you
		fighting rats or the entire german army?

			hana
		i was repairing the stairs.  i found a
		library and the books were very useful.

hana shrugs.  she's attending to him, pulling back the sheets, plumping 
up the pillows.  he's short of breath.

			the patient
		before you find too many uses for these
		books would you read some to me?

			hana
		i think they're all in italian, but i'll
		look, yes.  what about your own book?

			the patient
				(reluctant)
		my book?  the herodotus?  yes, we
		can read him.

hana picks up the book and hands it to him.  then she starts rummaging 
in her pockets.

			hana
		oh - i've found plums.  we have plums
		in the orchard.  we have an orchard!

she has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.

			the patient
		thank you.

his mouth works with the pleasure of the taste, a little juice escaping 
from the mouth.  hana mops it up.

			the patient
		the plumness of this plum.

a noise, gurgling sound, disturbs them.

			the patient
		what's that?


27	int/ext.    the monastery.    day.

hana comes through the cloisters into the garden as the gurgling 
increases.  she's in time to catch the tortoise arriving once again in 
the water trough just as it starts to gush with water.  she shouts up 
to the patient's open window.

			hana
		water!
				(bends to the tortois)
		you hear it, too, don't you!
