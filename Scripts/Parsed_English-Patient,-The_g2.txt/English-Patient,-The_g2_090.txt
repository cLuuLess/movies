162	int.    bomb shaft.    day.

back in the shaft, kip works away, his fingers shaking with the cold 
from the oxygen he's using to freeze the fuse.  suddenly there's a 
violent tremor.  the ground is shuddering, and the bomb slips horribly.  
kip grabs at it helplessly as if trying to stop a man from falling, 
instead it falls on him pushing him into the sludge.
