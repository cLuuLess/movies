122	ext.    the monastery.    hana's garden.    day.

hana is gardening, close to the crucifix, which is now a full-fledged 
scarecrow.  broken bottles, fragments of stained glass and shards from 
a mirror are hung from the crossbar, syringes too, all jangling and 
tinkling and catching the sunlight.

kip and hardy drive off to work on their motorcycles.  she watches 
them, catching kip's careless wave to her.  she looks briefly at 
herself in a piece of mirror dangling from the scarecrow.
