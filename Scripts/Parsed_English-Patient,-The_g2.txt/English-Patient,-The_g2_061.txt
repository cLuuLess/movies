113	ext.    cairo street.   o/s  shepheard's hotel.    day.

the approach to the shepheard's hotel.  geoffrey clifton in a taxi, 
champagne between his knees.

the car ahead of them screeches to a halt as a woman hurries across the 
street.  the driver honks his horn angrily.  the woman puts up a hand 
in apology as she skips across the street to another taxi.  it's 
katharine - she's dressed for a date, carries flowers, an overnight 
bag.

geoffrey, at first excited, is troubled by the accouterments.  then he 
sees katharine skip and his whole being punctures.

katharine's cab roars off.  his own car jerks forward.

			clifton
		stop!

			cabbie
		please?

			clifton
		stop here.

			cabbie
		yessir.

geoffrey sits in the cab.  fifty yards short of the hotel.  the world 
rushes by.  he finds a cigarette.
