114	int.    almÁsy's rooms.    late day.

katharine is in bed.  almásy has just put a record on.  it's the folk 
song heard at the beginning of the film.  he slips back under the 
covers.  their clothes are scattered around the room.  he lies over a 
happy katharine.  she listens.

			katharine
		this is - what is this?

			almÁsy
		it's a folk song.

			katharine
		arabic?

			almÁsy
		no, no, it's hungarian.  my daijka
		sang it to me.

			katharine
				(as they listen)
		it's beautiful.  what's it about?

			almÁsy
				(as if interpreting)
		it's a long song - szerelem means 
		love...and the story - there's a
		hungarian count, he's a wanderer,
		a fool.  for years he's on some kind
		of quest, who knows what?  and then
		one day he falls under the spell of a
		mysterious english woman - a
		harpy - who beats him and hits him
		and he becomes her slave.  he sews
		her clothes, he worships the hem of -

katharine had thought for a few seconds he was serious, then she 
catches on and starts to beat him.

			almÁsy
				(laughing)
		ouch!  see - you're always beating me..!

			katharine
		you bastard, i was believing you!

they embrace, he lies over her, considering her naked back.

			almÁsy
		i claim this shoulder blade - oh no,
		wait - i want this!

he turns her over, kisses her throat, then traces the hollow 
indentation.

			almÁsy
		this - what's it called? - this place,
		i love it - this is mine!
				(katharine doesn't know)
		i'm asking the king permission to
		call it the almasy bosphorous.

			katharine
				(teasing)
		i thought we were against ownership?
				(kissing him)
		i can stay tonight.

the luxury of this makes them both sad.  the duplicity.  almásy rolls 
away on to his back.

			almÁsy
		madox knows, i think.  he's tried to
		warn me.  he keeps talking about
		anna karenina.  i think it's his idea
		of a man-to-man chat.  its my idea
		of a man-to-man chat.

			katharine
		this is a different world - is what
		i tell myself.  a different life.
		and here i am a different wife.

			almÁsy
		yes.  a different wife.
