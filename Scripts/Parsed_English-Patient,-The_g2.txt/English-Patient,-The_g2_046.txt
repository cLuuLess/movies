84	int.    car.    night.

inside the cabin, the sand swirling around them, katharine and almásy 
sit without speaking.  dawn is trying to break through.  he pours a 
little water into a mug so that they can wash out their eyes and noses 
and mouths.  she takes her silk scarf and first dries her eyes with it, 
then dries his.

			katharine
		this is not very good, is it?

			almÁsy
		no.

			katharine
		shall we be all right?

			almÁsy
		yes.  absolutely.

			katharine
		yes is a comfort.  absolutely is not.
