117	ext.    spice market.    cairo.    dawn.

the morning prayers rise out from the city's three minarets.  almásy 
stops at a stall, which is just preparing to open for the day.  he 
picks up a silver thimble, points at it to the merchant who gives him a 
price.  without comment, almásy produces the money and, beaming, hands 
the thimble to katharine.

			almÁsy
		i don't care to bargain.
				(she smiles)
		it's full of saffron, just in case
		you think i'm giving it to you to
		encourage your sewing.

			katharine
		that day, had you followed me
		to the market?

			almÁsy
		of course.  you didn't need to slap
		my face to make me feel as if you'd
		slapped my face.

			katharine
				(loving him, but frightened)
		shall we be all right?

			almÁsy
		yes.  yes.
				(shrugs)
		absolutely.
