37	ext.    basecamp at pottery hill.    morning.

the next morning.  almásy and madox prepare to take off.  as they talk 
clifton's rupert bear taxis past them, a wave from clifton and 
katharine.  madox is very disturbed by what almásy is telling him.

			madox
		what did you think you were
		doing in his tent?

			almÁsy
		looking for the fossils.  why should we
		wait until we're in london?  this girl 
		was probably twelve years old.

			madox
				(getting into the plane)
		you shouldn't go into another man's tent.
		it's inexcusable.

			almÁsy
		her hands and feet were tied.

			madox
		what did you do?

			almÁsy
		i looked at them.  they're shrubs,
		small trees.  exquisite.  and
		fossilized, rock hard.

he walks away to the nose of the plane.

			madox
		i was talking about the girl.

			almÁsy
		cut the ropes.  i left a note,
		on his blanket.
				(gleefully)
		at the next geographical society i 
		shall await with great interest the
		announcement of the fenelon-barnes
		slave knot.  the girl wouldn't leave, 
		of course.  her father had sold her
		for a camel.

he turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
