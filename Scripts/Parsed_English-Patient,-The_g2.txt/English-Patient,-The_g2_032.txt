50	ext.    cairo market.    1938.    day.

a street market in full sway, a locals-only affair, blazing with noise 
and bustle and barter.  emerging from a thicket of women and begging 
children, katharine clifton carries her purchase of an exotic-looking 
rug.  from nowhere she is joined by almásy.

			almÁsy
		how much did you pay?

			katharine
				(delighted)
		hello!  good morning.

			almÁsy
		they don't see foreign women in this
		market.  how much did you pay?

			katharine
		seven pounds, eight, i suppose.  why?

			almÁsy
		which stall?

			katharine
		excuse me?

			almÁsy
		you've been cheated, don't worry,
		we'll take it back.

			katharine
				(bristling)
		i don't want to go back.

			almÁsy
		this is not worth eight pounds,
		mrs. clifton.

			katharine
		i don't care to bargain.

			almÁsy
		that insults them.

			katharine
				(turning to face him)
		i don't believe that.  i think you are
		insulted by me, somehow.  you're a
		foreigner too, aren't you, here,
		in this market?

			almÁsy
				(of the carpet)
		i should be very happy to obtain
		the correct price for this.  i apologize
		if i appear abrupt.  i am rusty at
		social graces.
				(tart)
		how do you find cairo?  did you
		visit the pyramids?

			katharine
		excuse me.

he stands as she continues, pushing past him, shrugging off the 
children, boiling.
