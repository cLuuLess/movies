202	int.    cave of swimmers.    torchlight.

a flashlight flickers in the cave.  almÁsy appears.

katharine's corpse lies where he left her - a ghost on a bed of silk 
and blankets.  the chill of the cave has preserved her.  she could be 
asleep.  she clutches the herodotus.

			almÁsy
		katharine, my darling.

he sobs, whispering to her.  he's terribly cold, exhausted.  he slips 
underneath the covers to be next to her, and closes his eyes.

			almÁsy
		i'm so tired.


203*.	int.    the patient's room.    day.

the patient is slipping away.  hana is reading from the last pages of 
the herodotus where katharine has written in the margins.

			hana
		my darling, i'm waiting for you - how
		long is a day in the dark, or a week?

the patient looks across and what he sees is katharine beside him in 
the bed, smiling, stroking his head, speaking to him.
