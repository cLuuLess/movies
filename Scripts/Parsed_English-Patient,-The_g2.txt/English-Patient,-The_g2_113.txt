198	int.    hana's room.    evening.

kip comes into the room.  hana sits in the corner.  she is nervous of 
him, his look, his intensity.

			kip
		will you come with me?

			hana
		of course.  when?

			kip
		i mean home.  india.

			hana
		kip... i -

			kip 
				(interrupting this)
		i know - here i am always a brown man,
		there you would be always a white woman.

			hana
		is that what you think?  is that what
		you think i think?

			kip
		it's what i've learned.

			hana
		i'm thinking about your heart, not
		your skin.  and how to reach it.  and
		that i don't think i can.  a bomb
		has ruined us, just not the bomb
		i thought would ruin us.

she stands, goes to him.

			hana
		i've clung to you.  i've clung to you.
		kip.  life  a raft.  

			kip 
				(clinging to her)
		then come with me.
