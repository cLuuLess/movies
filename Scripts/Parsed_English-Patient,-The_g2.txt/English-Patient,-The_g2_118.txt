205	int.    the patient's room.    day.

the bed is empty, the mattress stripped.  hana stands in the doorway, 
then sees the herodotus on the bedside table.

she picks it up, goes to the page of katharine's letter, continues to 
read.

		we die, we die rich with lovers and
		tribes, tastes we have swallowed...


206*.	ext.    lane outside the monastery garden.    day.

caravaggio is at the gate to the monastery.  the truck we saw before is 
waiting with him.  the partisan with his head bandana and shotgun 
remains the same, but now there are children in the back and a woman 
sits behind the man, nursing a two-year-old.

			caravaggio
		hana!  come on!

he gets up into the balustrade, tentatively finds his balance, then 
starts to walk, heel to toe - slowly, and then with more confidence - 
along the long thin line of stone.  the children watch intently.  he 
turns and bows.

			katharine (o/s)
		...bodies we have entered and swum up
		like rivers, fears we have hidden in
		like this wretched cave...


207*.	ext.    the monastery cloisters.    day.

hana walks across the cloisters, passing the chalked hopscotch squares, 
leaving it all behind.  then she stops, bends, retrieves a snail shell, 
keeps going.  katharine's voice continues.
