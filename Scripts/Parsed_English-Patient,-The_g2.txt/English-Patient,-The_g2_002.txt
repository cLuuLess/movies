2	ext.    the desert.    1942.    day.

the pilot has been rescued by bedouin tribesmen.  behind them the 
wreckage of the plane, still smoking, the arabs picking over it.  a 
silver thimble glints in the sun, is retrieved.  another man comes 
across a large leather-bound book and takes it over to the pilot.  the 
pilot is charred.  his helmet has melted into his head.  he's oblivious 
to this, cares only about the woman who crashed with him.  he twists 
frantically to find her.  two men pick him up and carry him across to a 
litter where they carefully wrap him in blankets.
