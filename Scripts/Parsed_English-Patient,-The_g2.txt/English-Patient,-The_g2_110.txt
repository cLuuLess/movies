194	int.    the monastery stables.    day.

kip hammers the metal into its new shape.  he stops, distracted by 
something he's listening to on his crystal set.  it's new he seems not 
to fully understand, about a bomb dropping on japan.  a new kind of 
bomb.

the metal glows a vivid red on the anvil.
suddenly kip slops it into the trough of water, sending a great hissing 
column of steam.


195*.	int.    the patient's room.    day.

caravaggio sits by the patient.

			caravaggio
		you get to the morning and the
		poison leaks away, doesn't it?
		black nights, fucking black nights,
		when you want to howl like a dog.
		i thought i would kill you.  you
		killed my friends, you ruined my
		hands.  but the girl was always
		here, like some guardian angel.

			the patient
		you can't kill me.  i died years ago.

			caravaggio
		no, now i can't kill you.

kip storms into the room, walks straight up to the patient and points a 
gun at him.  caravaggio is taken by surprise.

			caravaggio
		kip - what are - ?

			kip
		stay out of this.

			the patient
		kip?

			kip
		i looked up to you, uncle.  my brother
		always said i was a fool.  never trust the
		british, he said: the deal-makers, the
		map-makers; never shake hands with them.

			the patient
		what are you talking about?

			kip
		what have i been doing all this time?
		do you know how many mines i've seen? -
		more mines than there are soldiers, more -
		how many mines we've put in the ground
		ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped
		out of the sky.  and now this.

he approaches the bed.  caravaggio tries to intervene.

			caravaggio
		kip, listen -

kip sings the rifle at him, knocking him to the floor.

			kip
		i said keep out of this!

he pulls of his earphones and rams them around the patient's head, 
dropping the set onto the bed.  the patient listens, coughing.

			kip
		can you hear?  can you hear what they're
		celebrating?  i listened to you, uncle.
		sitting at your feet - always sitting at
		somebody's feet - trying to learn.  the
		right way to hold a teacup, otherwise
		you're out, the pukkah knot in your tie -
		as if everything can be explained in
		terms of a cricket bat and an accent.

			caravaggio
		kip -

			kip
		kip! - it's not even my name because
		you can't say it.  kirpal singh bhuller
		is my name.

hana runs in, alerted by the commotion, stunned by what she sees.

			caravaggio
		well, then ask him his name!

			hana
				(getting in between kip and the patient)
		what's happened?  kip!  what's happening?
		don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.

			kip
		they're excited!  they're happy about
		destroying a whole city.  would they
		do that to a white man's city?  never!

			the patient
				(pulling off the earphones)
		go on, do it.  i don't need to hear any more.

			caravaggio
		kip, listen, he lost everything because
		he wasn't english - jesus! - shoot me,
		i'm more english than he is!

kip levels the gun at the patient.  then breaks it open, throws it down 
on the bed, next to the earphones, from which the news continues to 
leak, some words audible - eunola gay... hiroshima... and from 
different voices - it was beautiful!  just beautiful!  bang! the 
biggest bang you ever saw!
