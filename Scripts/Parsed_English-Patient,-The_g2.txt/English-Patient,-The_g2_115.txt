200	int.    the patient's room.    day.

hana comes in carrying flowers and sets them down on the table next to 
a clutch of morphine ampoules.  she picks up the hypodermic to prepare 
his injection.  she takes a phial.  the patient reaches out and pushes 
two more towards her.   their eyes meet, then he shovels another, then 
all of them.  she looks at him.  it's a massive, lethal dose.

hana starts to prepare the injection, her eyes filling with tears.  the 
patient nods, smiles, whispers.

			the patient
		thank you.  thank you.

she kisses him, gently on the mouth.  he closes his eyes.

			the patient
		read to me, will you?  read me to sleep.
