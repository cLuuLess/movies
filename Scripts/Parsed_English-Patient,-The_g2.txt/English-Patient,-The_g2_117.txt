		...the fire is gone now, and i'm
		horribly cold.  i really ought to
		drag myself outside but then
		there would be the sun...

she passes the flashlight across the wall, the painted figures dancing 
in the pale light.

			katharine (o/s)
		i'm afraid i waste the light on the 
		paintings and on writing these words...
