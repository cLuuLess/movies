		why don't you go?
				(wiping his eyes)

156*.	int.    the monastery, landing and stairs.    night.

hana leaves the room, then turns and sees a tiny lamp on the floor, 
it's made from a snail shell and oil.  she bends to it curiously, then 
sees a second lamp half-way down the stairs, then a third further down.  
she smiles in the light, then follows the trail.
