165	ext.    village square.    night.

a tiny piazza where the sappers and the villagers are having their own, 
more raucous, victory feste.  there are accordions, there's dancing, 
and there's hardy, stripped to some exotic underpants, a large tattoo: 
doris inside a heart, clambering up the equestrian statue in the middle 
of the fountain.  he's astride the horse and now straining to get up to 
the tip of the outstretched sword, so that he can hang the union jack 
flag he has in his mouth.

blackler, one of the sappers, is hardy's assistant.  he's drunk and 
slips from his ladder, falling flat on his back into the fountain with 
a great splash, to much hilarity.
