36	int.   fenelon-barnes tent.   pottery hill.   night.

pitch black and then a torch flickers on as almásy enters fenelon-
barnes' tent.  he pulls apart his luggage, quickly and methodically.  
he finds what he is looking for inside a trunk:  a large fossilized 
branch; a collection of stone leaves, wrapped in a piece of tarpaulin.  
then he's distracted by a noise from fenelon-barnes' bed.  almásy 
stiffens, turns to investigate.  there's a lump in the cot.  a dog?  
almásy eases back the blanket to reveal a young girl, no more than 
fourteen, bound hand and foot.  he holds the torch to her face.
