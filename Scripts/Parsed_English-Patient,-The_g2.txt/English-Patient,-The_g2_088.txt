160	ext.    a viaduct north of the monastery.    day.

kip is lowered by a pulley into the shaft the sappers have made around 
the bomb.  hardy supervises.  the bombs huge - 2, 000 lbs, and 
protrudes ostrich-like from the pit, its nose sunk into a pool of 
sludge at the base of the viaduct.

kip steps off and sinks knee deep in mud, grunting in disgust.   
warily, he touches his huge opponent, feeling the condition of the 
case.  he wipes the metal.  reveals a serial number, calls it out to 
hardy, who's perched on the bank.

			kip
		serial number - kk-1p2600.

he's hypnotized by the number: kk-1p: a bomb with his name on it.
