109	int.    the patient's room.    day.

hana's piano continues.  upstairs, caravaggio chats with the patient 
while working his arms to raise a vein, a boot-lace tied around it, 
preparing an injection for himself, tapping the syringe.  during this:

			the patient
		i have come to love that little tap of
		the fingernail against the syringe.  tap.


110*.	int.    monastery library.    day.

hana plays.  gun shots punctuates the music.  she's totally engrossed 
and only hears the second or third shot.  her hands falter, she looks 
up to see a sikh soldier running across the field waving his arms, his 
revolver held aloft.  he approaches the door, his face creased with 
anxiety, and raps on the shattered frame.  it's kip.

she gets up and walks past kip standing at the door, and continues the 
seven or eight feet to the right and out into the garden via the hole 
ripped out of the wall.

			hana
		excuse me.  yes?
				(of the doors)
		i don't have the key to that door.

			kip
		the germans were here.  the germans 
		were all over this area.  they left mines
		everywhere.  pianos were their favorite
		hiding places.  

			hana
		i see.
				(then mischievous)
		then may be you're safe as long as
		you only play bach.  he's german.

kip is looking around the piano.  hana giggles.

			kip
		is something funny?

			hana
		no, but, no, not at all.  i'm sorry.
		you came to the doors, that's all and -
				(a little laugh)
		#name?
		worried about mines.  that's all.

			kip
		i've met you before.

			hana
		i don't think so.

hana bends to see what kip's looking at under the piano.  wires run 
from the wall to the instrument onto which is taped an explosive 
charge.   if hana had succeeded in moving the piano she would have 
triggered the charge.  kip looks at hana who conceals her dismay with a 
shrug.


110a*.	ext.    the monastery garden.    dusk.

across from the terrace, hardy and kip are putting up their tents.  
caravaggio stands, chatting amiably to them, holding a haversack, 
smoking a cigarette.


111*.	int.    the patient's room.    dusk.

hana looks down from the patient's room, watching the tents go up.

			hana
		he wants us to move out, says there
		could be fifty more mines in the building.
		he thinks i'm mad because i laughed at
		him.  he's indian, he wears a turban.

			the patient
		sikh.  if he wears a turban, he's a sikh.

kip glances up at the window.  hana, suddenly shy, backs away.

			hana
		i'll probably marry him.

			the patient
		really?  that's sudden.

			hana
		my mother always told me i would
		summon my husband by playing the piano.

she goes over to the patient's bed.

			hana
		i liked it better when there were
		just the two of us.

			the patient
		why?  is he staying?

			hana
		with his sergeant.  a mr. hardy.

			the patient
		we should charge!  doesn't anyone
		have a job to do?

			hana
		they have to clear all the local roads
		of mines.  that's a big job.  they won't
		stay in the house.  they're putting up
		their tent in the garden.

			the patient
		in that case, i suppose we can't charge.


112*.	int.    office, british hq.    cairo.    day.

a small office, shared by two men, and a mountain of filing cabinets 
and paper.  there are aerial maps all over the walls.  clifton is on 
the telephone, while his colleague, rupert douglas, works at the desk.

			clifton
				(into the phone)
		darling, it's me, i'm sorry,
		something's come up.
				(katharine responds)
		don't sulk - i'll be back tomorrow
		evening.  i promise.
				(katharine responds)
		okay my precious, i love you.

rupert makes a face at his friend's sentimentality.  clifton beams.

			rupert
		i didn't know you were going anywhere?

			clifton
		i'm not.  i'm going to surprise her.
		it's our anniversary.  she's forgotten,
		of course.  what's the symbol for your
		first anniversary?  i should get something.
		is it paper?
				(he knocks sharply on the wall)
		moose!  moose, you there?  first
		anniversary - is it cotton?

			caravaggio
		is what cotton?

			clifton
		first wedding anniversary.

			rupert
				(of clifton)
		he's hopeless!

			clifton
		your day will come, my sausage.

			caravaggio
		your first anniversary is paper.
