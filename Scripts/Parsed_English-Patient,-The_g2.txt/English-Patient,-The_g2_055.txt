102	int.    the monastery kitchen.    night.

caravaggio comes into the kitchen.  hana is slumped at the table, her 
back naked.  the jug of water in front of her.  she's sobbing, her 
shoulders heaving.  caravaggio approaches tentatively.

			caravaggio
		hana?
				(he touches her shoulder)
		hana?  are you alright?

			hana
				(without raising her head)
		don't touch me if you're going to
		try and fuck me.

			caravaggio
				(soothing)
		i'll have some of your water.  it's hot.

she reaches for her blouse, wraps it around herself.  her face is read 
with weeping.

			caravaggio
				(gently)
		you have to protect yourself from 
		sadness.  this is the thing i've learned.
				(drinking the water)
		you're in love with him, aren't you?
		your patient.  do you think he's a saint
		or something?  because of the way he 
		looks?  i don't think he is.

			hana
		i'm not in love with him.  i'm in love
		with ghosts.  and so is he.  he's in
		love with ghosts.

			caravaggio
		who are his ghosts?

			hana
		ask him.

			caravaggio
				(he holds up his hands)
		what if i told you he did this to me?

			hana
				(stung)
		what?  how could he have?  when?

			caravaggio
		i'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't
		even know.  it's like he slammed a
		door in cairo and it trapped my 
		fucking hands in tobruk.

			hana
		i don't know what that means.

			caravaggio
				(shrugs)
		ask him.  ask your saint who he is.
		ask him who he's killed.

			hana
				(furious)
		please don't creep around this house.


103*.	int.    the patient's room.    day.

hana sits reading from the herodotus.  she shows the patient the page 
where a christmas cracker wrapper covered in handwriting has been glued 
in.

			hana
		tell me about this, this is in your
		handwriting - december 22nd -
		betrayals in war are childlike 
		compared with our betrayals during
		peace.  new lovers are nervous and
		tender, but smash everything - for
		the heart is an organ of fire...
				(she looks up)
		i love that, i believe that.
				(to him)
		who is k?

			the patient
		k is for katharine.
