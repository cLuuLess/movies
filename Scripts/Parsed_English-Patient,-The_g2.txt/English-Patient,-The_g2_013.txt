22	ext.    basecamp at pottery hill.    late day.

the party is in the shade of the tents.  almásy joins the group.  madox 
nods over to the clifton plane.

			madox
		marvelous plane.  did you look?

			clifton
				(beaming at almásy)
		isn't it?  wedding present from
		katharine's parents.  i'm calling it
		rupert bear.  hello.  geoffrey clifton.

			madox
		we can finally consign my old bird
		to the scrapheap.

	almásy smiles and walks on towards the others.

			d'agostino
		mrs. clifton - count almasy.

			katharine
				(smiling, offering her hand)
		geoffrey gave me your monograph when
		i was reading up on the desert.
		very impressive.

			almÁsy
				(stiff)
		thank you.

			katharine
		i wanted to meet a man who could write
		such a long paper with so few adjectives.

			almÁsy
		a thing is still a thing no matter what
		you place in front of it.  big car, slow
		car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.

			clifton
				(joining them and joining in)
		a broken car?

			almÁsy
		still a car.

			cliffton
				(hands them champagne)
		not much use, though.

			katharine
		love?  romantic love, platonic love,
		filial love - ?  quite different things,
		surely?

			clifton 
				(hugging katharine)
		uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind
		of love.  excessive love of one's wife.

			almÁsy
				(a dry smile)
		there you have me.
