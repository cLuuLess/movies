a flashlight squirts into the cave.  almásy treads cautiously along the 
narrow winding passage.  he comes to an open cavern and takes his 
flashlight up to a wall.  paintings emerge, figures, animals,  ancient

almásy is astonished by what he sees.

the others watch as a flashlight bobs and jerks among the rocks as 
almásy comes scrambling down, transformed into an excited teenager.
