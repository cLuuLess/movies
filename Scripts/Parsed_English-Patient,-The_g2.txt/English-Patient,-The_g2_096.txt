168	ext.    the monastery.    approaching dawn.

kip has pulled out all of hardy's gear.  now he starts on the tent.  
hana comes out into the step.  kip turns, his eyes brimming, sees her, 
sighs, then turns back and kicks at the pegs, collapsing the tent.

now he's trying to fold a shirt.  hana takes it from him.  she folds 
it.  then together they start to fold the tent, kip orchestrating, not 
wanting to talk.  finally, kip looks at hana, stiff with emotion.

			kip
		i was thinking yesterday - yesterday! -
		the patient, hardy: they're
		everything that's good about england.
		i couldn't even say what that was.
		we didn't exchange two personal words,
		and we've been together through some
		terrible things, some -
				(incredulous)
		he was engaged to a girl in the village! -
		i mean -
				(looks at hana)
		and us - he never once... he didn't
		ask me if i could spin the ball at
		cricket or the kamasutra or -
		i don't even know what i'm 
		talking about.

			hana
		you loved him.
