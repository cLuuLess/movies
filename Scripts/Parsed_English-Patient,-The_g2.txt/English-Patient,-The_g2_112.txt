197	int.    the patient's room.    evening.

the patient becomes aware of something in the room, opens his eyes, 
squints into the darkness and sees a figure hovering against the wall.  
he's in the cave, he thinks, he's seeing the painted figures moving, 
he's seeing the swimmer.

kip - bare chested, no turban, hair loose - stands in the shadows at 
the foot of the patient's bed.
