the train is arriving.  hana hangs out of a window, scouring the crowds 
to find her sweetheart, stuart mcgann, a young canadian captain, who 
seeing her runs up to her window.

			hana
		where are we going?  i don't want to be
		kissing in a crowd.  i have six hours.

she jumps out of the moving door and into his arms.

			stuart
				(laughing at her ferocity)
		whoa - give me a chance!

			hana
		sorry.  i took a benzedrine.

the station is full of desperate people trying to make do.  the couple 
hurry through, oblivious to anyone except each other.

			stuart
		i've got a surprise.  a boat!  we can go
		to capri.  it's got a cabin, it's private.

			hana
