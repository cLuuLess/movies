166	int.    the patient's room.    night.

hana and caravaggio are still dancing.  the music has stopped.  
caravaggio changes the record.  hana goes to kip for a second, beaming, 
before caravaggio has snatched her away again.  the patient taps along 
to the music.

			the patient
		who knows the bosphorus hug?

			hana
		never heard of it.

			the patient
		that was a dance we invented at
		the international sand club.

			caravaggio
				(cryptic)
		what?  you and madox?  or you
		and katharine clifton?

			the patient
				(a small laugh)
		what?

there's a muddled thud in the distance, kip's ears prick up.  he 
glances for an instant out of the window.

			hana
				(anxious, of the noise)
		what was that?

she is spinning with caravaggio.  when she comes round again, kip has 
gone.
