106	int.    corridors.    ambassador's residence.    day.

a corridor.  almásy appears and almost immediately collides with the 
man dressed as santa claus.  he moves to one side.  

			clifton
		have you seen katharine?

			almÁsy
				(taken aback)
		what?

			clifton
		it's geoffrey under this.

			almÁsy
		i haven't, no.  sorry.


106a*.	int.    side room in ambassador's residence.    day.

geoffrey continues scouting the warren of tiny rooms that run off the 
central courtyard.  he finds katharine sitting in one, smoking, 
surrounded by oppressive and elaborate tiling.  clifton wonders briefly 
how almásy had missed katharine.

			clifton
		darling, i just heard.  you poor
		sausage, are you all right?

			katharine
		i'm fine.  i got hot.

			clifton
		lady h said she thought you might be -

			katharine
		i'm not pregnant.  i'm hot.  i'm too hot.

			clifton
		right.

			katharine
		aren't you?

			clifton
		sweltering.
				(taking off his hat and beard)
		come on, i'll take you home.

			katharine
		can't we really go home?  i can't breathe.
		aren't you dying for green, anything
		green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel
		rain on your face?  it's christmas and 
		it's all - i don't know - if you asked me
		i'd go home tomorrow.  if you wanted.

			clifton
		sweetheart, you know we can't go
		home, there might be a war.

			katharine
				(poking at his costume)
		geoffrey, you do so love putting
		on a disguise.

			clifton
		i do so love you.
				(he kisses her head)
		what do you smell of?

			katharine
		what?

			clifton
		marzipan!  i think you've got marzipan
		in your hair.  no wonder you're homesick.


107*.	int.    the patient's room.    evening.

the patient lies alone in his room.  clifton's face stares back at him 
from among the frescoes.  then something distracts him.

			the patient
		are you outside?

a beat and then caravaggio shuffles in.  like an old boxer.

			caravaggio
		i can't hide anymore.
				(jerks up his hands)
		i breathe like a dog.  i lose my
		balance.  stealing's got harder.

caravaggio stares at the herodotus.

			caravaggio
		why do i feel if i had your book i
		would know everything?

			the patient
		i don't even know if it is my book.
		the bedouin found it in the plane,
		in the wreckage.  it's mine now.  
		i heard your breathing and thought
		it might be rain.  i'm dying for rain -
		of course i'm dying anyway - but i
		long to feel rain on my face.

caravaggio comes close, scrutinizing the face, trying to repair the 
features.  exasperated.

			caravaggio
		is it you?  if i said moose... i look
		different, fuck, why shouldn't you?

			the patient
				(impassive)
		moose.

			caravaggio
				(a different tack)
		first wedding anniversary - what
		do you call it?

			the patient
		i don't know.  paper.  is it?  paper?
				(sharp, not wanting to think)
		i don't remember.
