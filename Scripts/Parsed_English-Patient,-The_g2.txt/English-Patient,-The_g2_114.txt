199	ext.    the monastery.    day.

next morning and kip has attached what he was making in the forge - a 
new handle - to the pump.  now he works it, producing a steady stream 
of water.  his motorbike is against the wall.  he goes to it.  
caravaggio is watching.  he hugs kip, wrapping his arms around the boy 
like a bear.


199a*.	ext.    hana's vegetable garden.    day.

hana stands by her vegetable garden.  kip stops the motorbike.  she 
goes to him, stands, fastens the top button of his coat.  you feel she 
might jump on the seat behind him.  but she doesn't.

			hana
		i'll always go back to that church.
		look at my painting.

			kip
		i'll always go back to that church.

			hana
		so one day we'll meet.

he nods, winds up the throttle, and is gone.
