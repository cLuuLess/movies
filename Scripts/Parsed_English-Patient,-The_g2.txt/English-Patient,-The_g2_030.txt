48	int.    the patient's room.    day.

hana carries in a tray.  there's omelette on the plate.

			hana
		there's a man downstairs.  he
		brought us eggs.
				(shows him the omelette)
		he might stay.

			the patient
		why?  can he lay eggs?

			hana
		he's canadian.

			the patient
				(brittle)
		why are people always so happy when
		they collide with someone from the same
		place?  what happened in montreal when
		you passed a man in the street - did you
		invite him to live with you?

			hana
		he needn't disturb you.

			the patient
		me?  he can't.  i'm already disturbed.

			hana
		he won't disturb us then.  i think
		he's after morphine.
				(she's cut the omelette
into tiny pieces)
		there's a war.  where you come from
		becomes important.  and besides - 
		we're vulnerable here.  i keep hearing
		noises in the night.  voices.

the patient says nothing.  she puts a spoonful of the omelette into his 
mouth.  he grunts.
