99	int.    emergency field hospital tent.    late day.

jan is washing out of her helmet, and stands naked in her socks.  hana 
is using a flannel to wash jan's back.  a couple of other girls like, 
exhausted, on their cots.  the mud is everywhere.  another nurse is 
making tea out of an adapted plasma can on their tiny primus.

mary comes in and flops down.  she's given blood and is pale and 
enervated.

			mary
		okay, type os, the vampires wait.
		everybody's giving a pint.

			jan
		ugh!  if they were sucking it out
		i wouldn't mind.  it's the needle
		i can't stand.

			hana
				(laughing)
		you're a nurse - how ca you be
		frightened of needles!
