52	ext.    shepheard's hotel terrace.    night.

katharine appears with geoffrey to join the arriving explorers.  she 
looks exquisite in her evening clothes.  madox brings her to her seat.  
there is dancing inside, and couples walk to and from their tables.  
katharine manages to produce a dazzling smile which includes everyone 
except almásy.

			madox
		mrs. clifton, you'll have to forgive
		us.  we're not accustomed to the
		company of women.

			katharine
		not at all.  i was thoroughly 
		enjoying by book.
				(indicating they should all sit 
and then nodding at almásy
before greeting the others)
		please.  signor d'agostino, herr bermann.

			clifton
		the team is in mourning, darling.

			katharine
		oh really?

			madox
		i'm afraid we're not having much luck
		obtaining funds for the expedition.

			katharine
		how awful.  what will you do?

			madox
		a more modest expedition, or even wait a
		year.  remind our families we still exist.

			clifton
				(astonished)
		good heavens, are you married, madox?

			madox
		very much so.  we are all, save my
		friend here.

he nods at almasy.  clifton appears tremendously relieved.

			clifton
		i feel much better, don't you darling?
		we were feeling rather self-conscious.
		let's toast, then.  to absent wives.

			d'agostino
				(toasting katharine)
		and present ones.

			katharine
				(toasting almásy)
		and future ones.
