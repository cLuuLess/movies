10	ext.    italian hill road.    day.

kip, the sikh lieutenant, and hardy, his sergeant, explore the road 
ahead of the becalmed convoy, using saucer-like metal detectors and 
headsets.  kip is young, lithe, contained, utterly focused as they inch 
along the debris-strewn road.  he stiffens as he registers metal.  with 
a bayonet he carefully scrapes at the mud-caked surface.  something 
gleams.  suddenly, a pair of feet walks across his vision as hana 
hurries past, walking carelessly up the road.  it's so surreal that 
neither man registers at first, and then kip is shouting.

			kip
		hey!  hey!  stop!  hey!

			hardy
		don't move!  stand absolutely still!

 hana stops.  hardy gingerly follows her footsteps.

			hardy
				(as he approaches)
		good, that's good, just stay still for me
		and then we're going to be fine.

he arrives at hana.  then grabs her.  he'd like to slap her face.

			hardy
		what are you doing?!  what the bloody 
		hell do you think you're doing?

by way of an answer she looks at the ground ahead of her feet.  jan's 
bracelet lies in the mud.  hardy bends down and collects the mangled 
bracelet, presses it into hana's hands.
