136	ext.    road block.    tuscany.    dusk.

kip and hana have been detained at a road block.  kip is being 
questioned at a sentry post, his papers over-thoroughly inspected and 
accompanied by several meaningful glances at hana, who waits, standing 
by the motorcycle.  one of the soldiers saunters over and returns her 
papers.

			soldier
		and you're definitely traveling with
		him of your own free will?

			hana
		yes.

			soldier
				(clearly disapproving)
		just wanting to be sure.  and he's
		taking you to church?

			hana
				(deadpan)
		yes.  we're going to a funeral.  a cow has
		died.  and in his religion they're sacred.

the soldier isn't sure what to make of this.  he signals to his 
companion who returns kip's papers.  kip walks back to the motorcycles.  
he says nothing.  he kicks the starter.  hana gets on, slides her arms 
lovingly around him.
