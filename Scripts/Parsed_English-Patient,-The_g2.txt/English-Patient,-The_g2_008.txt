12	int.    red cross truck.    continuous.

hana sees all this as she sits blankly inside the truck, the patient 
swaying alongside her.  she puts out her hand to steady him.


13*.	ext.    convoy site, italy.    dusk.

the convoy is making a pitstop.  the trucks are silhouetted in a line.  
hana helps lift the patient's stretcher onto the ground.  she bends to 
him.

			hana
		do you need something?

the patient nods.  hana gets up to prepare morphine injection from a 
small kit.  mary arrives.  touches hana gently, conscious of her grief 
for jan's death.

			mary
		are you okay?  oh god, hana, you were
		like sisters.

			hana
				(sighs angrily)
		we keep moving him - in and out of the
		truck.  why?  he's dying.  what's the point?

			mary
		well, we can't hardly leave him.  do
		you mean leave him?  we can't.

hana has settled down beside the patient's stretcher.  she draws 
herself up against the night.  on the hill above, she can see the 
outline of a small monastery in the moonlight.  she's crying, her face 
a frozen mask.

			hana
		i must be a curse.  anybody who loves me,
		anybody who gets close to me -
		or i must be cursed.  which is it?

the patient laces her fingers into his crabbed hand.
