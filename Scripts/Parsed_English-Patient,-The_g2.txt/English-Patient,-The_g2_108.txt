190	ext.    railway track.    the desert.    evening.

alm√°sy, silhouetted against the evening sky, walks back down the track, 
three hundred miles away from the dying katharine clifton, no way now 
of saving her.  he is a tiny speck in the vast desert.  his heart 
broken.  he sinks to his knees in despair.


191*.	int.    the patient's room.    night.

the patient is exhausted.  he has said aloud what has tortured him.  
his failure to save katharine.  he looks at caravaggio.

			the patient
		so yes.  she died because of me.
		because i loved her.  because i 
		had the wrong name.
