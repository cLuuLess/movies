186	int.    cave of swimmers.    torchlight.

katharine has been writing in the herodotus.  the torchlight flickers.  
she shakes the torch.   it flickers again.  then goes out.  absolute 
blackness.  the sound of her trembling breath.


187*.	ext.    a train.    the desert.    dusk.

a train scuttles through the desert.


187a*.	int.    the train.    the desert.    dusk.

almásy is handcuffed to the metal grille of the goods compartment.  
he's lying down amongst a bunch of other prisoners and their little 
bundles of possessions in this makeshift cell - some arabs, some 
italians.

a sergeant pushes a lavatory-bound prisoner along the corridor, leaving 
behind a young private who sits on a packing case, with a rifle across 
his lap, reading a penguin edition of gulliver's travels.  almásy is in 
complete despair to be on the train.  he tries to move, but he's locked 
tight to the grille.  he rattles the cuffs against the metal.

			almÁsy
		excuse me.
				(the soldier looks up)
		i also need to use the lavatory.

			soldier
		you'll have to wait.
				(calls up the corridor)
		sarge!  jerry wants to use the lav -
		says it's urgent.

			almÁsy
		where are we going, please?

			soldier
		to the coast.  benghazi.  soon be there.
		get a boat home.  you'll be all right.

almÁsy can't bear this news.  the sergeant returns.

			sergeant
		what's up?

			almÁsy
		cramps.  it's urgent.

			sergeant
		go on then - you take him.
