104	ext.  ambassador's residence, december 1938.  day.

a christmas party for the troops.  the incongruous attempts to create a 
traditional christmas in the dusty heat of cairo.  

the party is in the courtyard of the moorish palace which serves as the 
private residence of the british ambassador, sir ronnie hampton.  lots 
of wives, including lady hampton and katharine help serve tea and cake 
to the soldiers who sit at rudimentary tables with paper plates and 
paper hats.  a man dressed as santa claus is giving out presents - 
penguin paperbacks, chocolate.  music blares out from a loudspeaker.  
officers and civilians walk the parameter.  one of these, arriving, is 
almasy.  he sits in the shade, catches katharine's attention.  
katharine brings him over a cup of tea and a plate with christmas cake 
on it.

			almÁsy
		say you're sick.

			katharine
		what?  no!

			almÁsy
		say you're feeling faint - the sun.

			katharine
				(but a frisson)
		no.

			almÁsy
		i can't work.  i can't sleep.

lady hampton calls impatiently.

			lady hampton
		katharine!

			katharine
		coming.
				(to almásy)
		i can't sleep.  i woke up shouting
		in the middle of the night.  geoffrey
		thinks it's the thing in the desert,
		the trauma.

			almÁsy
		i can still taste you.

			katharine
				(waving at another woman who
pushes a trolley with teapots)
		this is empty, just coming!

			almÁsy
		i'm trying to write with your taste
		in my mouth.
				(as she leaves)
		swoon.  i'll catch you.

almásy sits watching the party.  the santa claus is dragged outside by 
some excited children.  almásy picks at his cake removing the thick 
marzipan icing.  he's writing on a christmas cracker wrapper, smoothing 
it out - december 22nd.  betrayals in war are childlike compared with 
out betrayals du...

katharine, attending to a raucous table, suddenly sags at the knees, 
and swoons.  people rush to her.

			katharine
		i'm fine.  how silly.

			officer's wife
				(helping her to her feet)
		it's the heat.

			lady hampton
		you should sit down, darling.
				(to the others)
		she's quite all right.
				(escorts katharine away)
		are you pregnant?

			katharine
		i don't think so.

			lady hampton
				(squeezing her arm)
		how romantic.  with fiona i fell
		over every five minutes.  ronnie
		christened me lady downfall.

			katharine
		i think i might go inside and sit
		down for a few minutes.

			lady hampton
		i'll come with you.

			katharine
		no, please.  i shall be absolutely fine.

they pass almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
