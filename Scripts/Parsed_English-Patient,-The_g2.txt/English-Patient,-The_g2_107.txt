189	int.    train.    the desert.    evening.

almásy arrives at the rear of the train, passes the kitchen carriage, 
where arabs sweat over the boiler.  he pulls open the back door only to 
surprise a guard, who's lolling casually, enjoying the sunset.  almásy 
shoots him with his stole rifle.  he clambers over the guard rail and 
leaps off the train - tumbling into the desert sunset.
