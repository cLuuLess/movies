167	ext.    village square.    italy 1945.    night.

	kip's motorbike skids into the tiny piazza.

a military ambulance is already there.  dade and spalding are presiding 
as the paramedics take two bodies into the rear of the truck.  the 
shattered fountain, the sluiced flagstones, shining wet and slick, give 
some clues as to what's happened, as do the elderly standing in the 
shadows, the distressed girls, arm in arm.  one girl, young and quite 
striking, is particularly inconsolable, her grief sobbed out at the 
doors of the ambulance.

spalding salutes kip, who waves his salute away, just wanting to know 
what happened.

			spalding
		booby trap.  they was running up the
		union jack, sir, up off that statue -
		it just went off.

			dade
		should have been me.  it was my idea
		but sergeant hardy climbed up, sir,
		him and blackler.

kip goes to the ambulance.  spalding tries to stop him.

			spalding
		sir - you don't want to look.

kip steps into the back of the ambulance, bends over both bodies, does 
look, then comes out, past the weeping girl.

			kip
		who's that girl?

			dade
		his fiancee, sir.

			kip
				(astonished)
		hardy's?

			dade
		kept it a bit dark.
