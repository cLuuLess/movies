38	ext.    gilf kebir plateau.    morning.

both planes are scouting the gilf kebir region.  geoffrey flies up 
alongside madox and wiggles his wings.  madox waves.

they're flying over a distinctive group of granite massifs, crater-
shaped hills.  the broken towers of the gilf kebir.  almasy is 
distracted by them.  he turns to madox and points down, indicating they 
should explore them.

madox gestures to the cliftons to photograph the massifs.  a thumbs up 
from geoffrey.


39*.	int.    the patient's room.    morning.

hana gives the patient his injection, now she begins to change the 
sheet.  the light streams in from the open window.  she looks up at the 
green hills rolling away from the monastery, the village in the 
distance.

			hana
		i should try and move your bed.  i want
		you to be able to see the view.  it's
		good, it's a view from a monastery.

			the patient
		i can already see.

			hana
				(bending down to his level)
		how?  how can you see anything?

			the patient
		not the window - i can't bear the light
		anyway - no, i can see all the way to 
		the desert.  i've found the lost fossils.

			hana
		i'm turning you.

an awkward moment as she rolls him on to his back.  he grunts with the 
pain.  she washes him very tenderly.

			the patient
		zerzura, the white city of acacias, the
		oasis of little birds.  as me about the
		scent of acacia - it's in this room.  i can
		smell it.  the taste of tea so black it
		falls into your mouth.  i can taste it.
		i'm chewing the mint.  is there sand in my
		eyes?  are you cleaning sand from my ears?

			hana
		no sand.  that's your drugs speaking.

			the patient
		i can see my wife in that view.

			hana
		are you remembering more?

			the patient
		could i have a cigarette?

			hana
		are you crazy?

			the patient
		why are you so determined to
		keep me alive?

			hana
		because i'm a nurse.
