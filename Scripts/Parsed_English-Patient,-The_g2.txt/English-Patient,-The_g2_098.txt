173	ext.    garden.    night.

kip is in the tent, looking out of the flap, waiting for hana.


174*.	int.    the monastery kitchen.    night.

kip walks in looking for hana.


174a*.	int.    the patient's room.    night.

kip enters, sees hana is not with the patient, hears his uneven 
breathing, then goes out.  from the shadows of the room, caravaggio 
shifts position.   he's slumped on the floor, staring at the man prone 
in the bed.


174b*.	int.    hana's room.    night.

into her bedroom, kip can't find her there either.  he turns to go, 
walking down the wooden stairs, until her voice stops him in his 
tracks.  she's in the shadows of the eaves.

			hana
		sometimes i need you to find me.


175*.	int.    the patient's room.     night.

the patient's eyes open to see caravaggio at the morphine.

			the patient
		hana tells me you're leaving.

			caravaggio
				(preparing the injection)
		there are going to be trials, they
		want me to interpret, don't they
		know i'm allergic to courtrooms?

			the patient
		we shall miss you.

he delivers the injection.  the patient sighs.  caravaggio takes off 
his jacket.  a pistol is stuck in his waistband.  the patient sees it.

			caravaggio
		so, i come across the hospital convoy
				(holds up the syringe)
		i was looking for this stuff, and some
		nurse, mary, hana's friend, tells me
		about you and hana, hiding in a
		monastery, in purdah, whatever it is -
		retreat -
				(he administers his own injection, 
using his teeth grip the sleeve)
		how you'd come in from the desert
		and you were burned and you didn't
		know your name but you knew the
		words to every song there was and
		you had one possession -
				(picks it up)
		#name?
		full of letters and cuttings, and then
		i knew it must be you.

			the patient
		me?

			caravaggio
		i'd seen you writing in that book.  
		at the embassy in cairo, when i
		had thumbs and you had a face.
		and a name.

			the patient
		i see.

			caravaggio
		before you went over to the germans,
		before you got rommel's spy across the
		desert and inside british headquarters.
		he took some pretty good photographs -
		i saw mine in that torture room in 
		tobruk, so they made an impression.  

			the patient
		and you thought you'd come and
		settle the score?

			caravaggio
		you were the only man who knew
		the desert well enough, the only
		man who would cross seventeen
		hundred miles of nothing.

			the patient
		i had to get back to the desert. i made a
		promise.  the rest meant nothing to me.

			caravaggio
		what did you say?

			the patient
		the rest meant nothing to me.

			caravaggio
		there was a result to what you did.
		it wasn't just another expedition.
				(holds up hands)
		it did this.  if the british hadn't
		unearthed your nosey photographer
		in cairo thousands of people could
		have died.

			the patient
		thousands of people did die, just
		different people.

			caravaggio
		but you were among the british, they 
		were your friends - why betray them?

			the patient
				(a bitter laugh)
		is that what you thought?  that i
		betrayed the british?  the british
		betrayed me.  the british betrayed me.

almásy sits on a ridge transferring map of information from his 
herodotus onto a sheet of paper.  he looks up at the sound of clifton's 
approaching steerman.  he folds up the map and sticks it inside one of 
clifton's champagne bottles and lodges it between the rocks.

 
176a*.	int.    steerman.    day.

clifton is flying the steerman up to gilf kebir.  from the air it's 
possible to make out almásy scrambling down from the ridge towards 
where the stones indicate a landing area, carrying the last of the 
materials from the cave of swimmers.  almásy waves in recognition and 
welcome.
