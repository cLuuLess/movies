188	int.    the train corridor.    the desert.    day.

the soldier pushes almásy along the corridor.  they arrive outside the 
lavatory.  the soldier is distracted for a split second.  enough for 
almásy to elbow him savagely in the stomach, winding him, then he kicks 
him repeatedly in the head.  he wraps his cuffs around the soldier's 
neck and - yanking them together and twisting - produces a tiny, 
efficient and sickening snap.

he finds the key to the handcuffs, unlocks them, grabs the soldier and 
drags him into the empty lavatory.
