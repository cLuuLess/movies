159	ext.    the monastery stables.    early morning.

hardy knocks cautiously on the door of the stables.  eventually hana 
opens the door.

			hardy
		i was looking for the lieutenant singh.

			hana
		he's sleeping.

			hardy
		only we have to go to work.

			hana
		i'll tell him.  what is it?  is it a mine?

			hardy
		a bomb.  at the viaduct.

she closes the door, then reappears.

			hana
		does he have to go?

			hardy
		pardon me?

			hana
		what if you couldn't find him...?
				(hardy's bewildered)
		sergeant, not today, please.
		not this morning.

kip comes to the door, winding his turban.

			kip
		what's happening?  am i needed?

			hardy
		i'm afraid so, sir.

kip hurries to his tent.  hana follows him.

			hana
		don't go.  i'm frightened.  i can love
		a coward, i can't love another dead man.

			kip
		this is what i do.  i do this every day.

and he's ready, hardy having wheeled out their motorcycles.  he gets on 
his, and they're away, hana hardly able to look.
