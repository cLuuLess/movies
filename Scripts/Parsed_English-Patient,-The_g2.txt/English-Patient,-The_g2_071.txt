124	int.    the patient's room.    day.

during this, hana comes through with the tray, finds kip perched on the 
window, relishing his skirmish with the patient, who has condensed milk 
dribbling down his neck.

			kip
		brick platform opposite the old
		ajaib-gher -

			the patient
		#name?
		natives called the lahore museum.

			kip
		it's still there, the cannon, outside the
		museum.  it was made of metal cups
		and bowls taken from every household
		in the city as tax, then melted down.
		then later they fired the cannon at my
		people - comma - the natives.

			the patient
		so what do you really object to - the
		writer or what he's writing about?

			kip
		what i really object to, uncle, is
		your finishing all my condensed milk.
				(snatching up the empty can)
		and the message everywhere in your
		book - however slowly i read it - that
		the best destiny for india is to be ruled
		by the british.

			the patient
		hana, we have discovered a shared
		please - the boy and i.

			hana
		arguing about books.

			the patient
		condensed milk - one of the truly
		great inventions.

			kip
				(grinning, leaving)
		i'll get another tin.

hana and the patient are alone.

			hana
		i didn't like that book either.  it's
		all about men.  too many men.
		just like this house.

			the patient
		you like him, don't you?  your
		voice changes.

			hana
		i don't think it does.
				(a beat)
		anyway, he's indifferent to me.

			the patient
		i don't think it's indifference.

kip comes bounding in with a fresh can.

			the patient
		hana was just telling me that you
		were indifferent -

			hana
				(appalled)
		hey! - 

			the patient
		#name?

			kip
		well, i'm indifferent to cooking, not
		hana's cooking in particular.
				(stabbing at the tin with a bayonet)
		have either of you ever tried 
		condensed milk sandwiches?

126.				int.    the patient's room.   morning.

caravaggio and the patient are singing - an arab song which they both 
know from cairo days.  thunder accompanies them.  it's pouring.  
suddenly the door is flung open and hana, kip and hardy appear.  they 
have the stretcher with them.


127*.	ext.    the monastery cloisters.    morning.

a whoop precedes the headlong rush of kip, hardly and caravaggio as 
they cart the patient across the cloisters like manic stretcher-
bearers.  hana is with them, holding an umbrella over the patient who 
bounces uncomfortably.  he is nervous, a little giddy.  the rain 
buckets down.

			the patient
				(no irony)
		careful - careful!


127a*.	ext.    the monastery garden.    morning.

the storm tour includes a trip around the pond.  the patient pushes 
away the umbrella, lets the rain drench him.   he grins at hana.

			the patient
		this is wonderful!

			kip
				(to hana)
		what's he saying?

			hana
		he's saying it's wonderful!


128*.	int.  library of the department of egyptology.  day.

madox and almásy are camped in one corner of the library, hunched over 
their maps and papers and journals and clashing furiously over the site 
of the next part of the expedition.

			madox
				(pushing away his charts)
		and i'm telling you there's nothing
		there to explore.

			almÁsy
		no, because you can't see from the air!
		if you could explore from the air life
		would be very simple!
				(he yanks up a map)
		look!  what is that?  is that a wadi?
		that whole spur is a real possibility...

			madox
		which we've overflown twice.

			almÁsy
		which we couldn't explore because
		of rocks, because of cross-winds,
		it's sloppy.
				(stabbing another location)
		and here - and here - we could be
		staring at zerzura.

	other readers look over at this unseemly skirmish.

			madox
		so - on thursday you don't trust
		bell's map - bell was a fool, bell
		couldn't draw a map, but on friday
		he's suddenly infallible?

almásy is surprised by madox' anger.

			madox
		and where are the expedition maps?

			almÁsy
		in my room.

			madox
		those maps belong to his majesty's
		government.  they're confidential.
		they shouldn't be left lying around
		for any tom, dick or mary to have
		sight of.

			almÁsy
		what's the matter with you?

			madox
		don't be so bloody naïve.  you know
		there's a war breaking out.
				(he tosses a slip of paper onto
the map, recites its message)
		this arrived this morning.  by order
		of the british government - all
		international expeditions to be
		aborted by may 1939.
