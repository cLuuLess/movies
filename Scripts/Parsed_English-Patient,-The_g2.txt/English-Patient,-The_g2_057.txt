105	int.  store room.  ambassador's residence.  day.

a small storeroom inside the palace - brooms, mops, cleaning equipment.  
outside, the party is visible as opaque shadows through the beveled 
glass of the ornate window.  the sound of carols sung by the enlisted 
men gives way to a version of silent night played on a solitary 
bagpipe.  inside, alm√Åsy and katharine make love in the darkness.  
everything is too fast, desperate, standing up, grabbing, hoisting 
clothes.
