21	ext.    pottery hill.    day.

the base of a hill seems composed entirely of pottery jars.

d'agostino emerges over the brow of a dune, leading madox and almásy.  
the other members of the team are already there - bermann, a german 
photographer and fouad, egyptologist from cairo.

			madox
				(to almásy, astonished)
		my god, look at this!

they bend to touch the jars, literally hundreds of them, mostly broken, 
piled on top of each other.  bermann approaches them, carrying his 
tripod.

			bermann
		incredible, hmm?  quite incredible.

			d'agostino
		i've never seen anything like it.  there 
		would have been enough water here to
		serve an army.

			almÁsy
				(gloomily)
		which means we're in the wrong place.

almásy speaks with a slight but unmistakable european accent.

			d'agostino
		why?

			almÁsy
		would you stockpile water near to an
		oasis?  there can't be a natural spring
		within fifty miles of here.

			fouad
		or they didn't know of one.

			bermann
		so, it may not be zerzura, still
		incredible.

			d'agostino
				(nodding, delighted)
		a pottery hill!

			almÁsy
		a wild goose chase.

			madox
				(firmly)
		no.

almásy gives him a look.  but madox will have none of it.

			madox
		no.  now we look in the other places.
		we're eliminating.

the unmistakable buzz of an aeroplane distracts them.

			madox
		good, and here comes reinforcements.


21a*.	ext.    base camp at pottery hill.    day.

later and a smart new aeroplane, a steerman, makes a smooth landing on 
the flat desert.  the expedition team drives over to meet the arrivals.  
almásy is not with them.  he's walking, apparently not so enthusiastic.

a young, kissed and newly-married couple emerge from the plane.  they 
are geoffrey and katharine clifton.

and it's immediately clear that katharine is the woman in the plane-
crash at the beginning of the film.

madox makes all the introductions.  hands are shaken, hellos all round, 
as the couple disembark in their leather flying gear.  geoffrey removes 
his helmet and, in what we will come to know as an ubiquitous gesture, 
produces a bottle of champagne and sets off the cork with a flourish.

			clifton
		i hereby christen us the international
		sand club!
