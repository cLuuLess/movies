               ext. josie's parents' house - night

               rob opens the door still dressed in his tiki post outfit. 
               he takes one look at josie and knows that things are not 
               good.

                                     josie
                         are mom and dad here?

                                     rob
                         no. they're at the franklin hint 
                         expo at the skokie holiday inn.

                                     josie
                         good.

               she shoves her way into the house. rob follows.
