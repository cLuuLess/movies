               the kids all have bananas and condoms. they are in various 
               stages of putting the condom over the banana. anita walks 
               among them, clearly more comfortable with her role now.

                                     anita
                         okay. i know it's hard.

               titters from the group.

                                     anita
                         difficult. but safe sex is really 
                         important. i try to practice it 
                         every day.

               josie reacts.

               angle on kirsten & kristen. their condoms are snugly on 
               their bananas. they stare at josie.

                                     kristen
                         wait, rewind. do you really think 
                         she hooked-up with our rob? they're 
                         so--different.

                                     gibby
                         sometimes opposites attract.

                                     kirsten
                         yeah. look at bert and ernie.

               we angle on anita. she's walking authoritatively up the 
               aisle towards the front.

                                     anita
                         so just..imagine the bananas are 
                         the real thing.

               she takes a rather large banana off a desk and looks at 
               it. she snorts.

                                     anita
                         in a land called "every man's 
                         fantasy".

               she looks up, sees the real miss kitterman

               (we can tell from the model of a uterus she carries), 
               standing outside the door and waving. without missing a 
               beat, anita pulls down a shade on the door and locks it.

               angle on: josie and tracy still struggling with condoms.

                                     tracy
                         god, i can't do this.

                                     josie
                         maybe because we're not supposed 
                         to be having sex with bananas.

                                     tracy
                         you know what, though? i feel like 
                         i'm really ready to do it. to have 
                         sex for the first time.

                                     josie
                         wow. that's big. i mean sex is a 
                         really big deal. you shouldn't do 
                         it until you know you've found the 
                         right person.

               angle on sam, listening. josie is oblivious.

                                     josie
                         you know, adele penguins pick one 
                         mate. they spend their whole life 
                         looking for that one other penguin 
                         and when they find it, they know. 
                         that's the penguin they stay with 
                         for the rest of their lives.

                                     tracy
                         but i'm not a penguin.

                                     sam
                         it's an analogy.

               a surprised josie looks up to see sam next to her. she 
               lets her condom go. and it flies off her banana into his 
               face. josie turns to tracy.

                                     josie
                         excuse me. i have to go die now.

               the class is interrupted by sydney over the loudspeaker:

                                     sydney (o.s.)
                              (over speaker)
                         hey guys--sydney again! don't forget--
                         no going into the library cuz of 
                         that little asbestos problem. and 
                         about prom

               everyone freezes. dead silence.

                                     sydney
                         really bad news. we just got the 
                         word from intelligence-- northglen 
                         high is doing the millennium too!

               complete chaos. screaming terror. a girl faints. sera 
               squeezes her banana so hard it oozes out of its skin. other 
               kids are beating their bananas against desktops. brett, 
               the football player, absentmindedly peels his banana and 
               begins eating it.

                                     sam
                         all right guys, let's calm down. 
                         calm down.
                              (no response)
                         sit!

               they all do, including anita.

                                     sam
                         now look. let's focus. prom theme. 
                         we need a new idea.

                                     anita
                         oh! how about "under the sea?"

               she's met with a round of "boos". anita reacts.

                                     anita
                         well excuse me.

                                     sam
                         what about the "roaring twenties" 
                         or "the 80's"?

               the class lets out a giant groan on that one.

                                     gibby
                         what do you think we are? amateurs?

                                     guy
                         josie.

                                     sera
                         that's not a theme.

                                     guy
                         no, josie will have the answer.

               a long beat. expectant faces all turn to josie. she looks 
               at tracy.

                                     josie
                         how about--'
                              (coming to her)
                         meant for each other--famous couples 
                         throughout history?

               another beat as the class considers.

                                     guy
                              (smiles and nods)
                         yeah. that's it.

               the class suddenly concurs.

                                     class
                         yeah. /that's it. /rufus.

               josie soaks in all the approval like a sponge.

                                     josie
                         thanks. thank you.

               josie looks from sam and anita's smiling faces to find guy 
               smiling at her.

               close up on a banner reading: "millennium". it comes down, 
               replaced by one that reads: "meant for each other... widen
