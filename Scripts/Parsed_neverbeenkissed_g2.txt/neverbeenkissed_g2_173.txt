               the staff from the sun times sits in box seats up front. 
               rigfort joins them, carrying a huge load of hot dogs.

                                     rigfort
                         i got weiners. hot weiners.

               rigfort sits next to gus. behind them sit bruns, his hair 
               finally growing in and howard, now down to just a sling.

                         i love this. sun times readers, 
                         out here, making a personal 
                         connection to one of our reporters. 
                         this is amazing, isn't it? weiner?

               gus takes a weiner.

                                     gus
                         yeah, it is.

                                     rigfort
                              (studying his weiner)
                         wait a minute...

               rigfort pulls something small and shiny out of the bun.

                                     rigfort
                         there's a bolt in my weiner.

               then he turns back to howard and smiles.

                                     rigfort
                         hey howard, what are you doing for 
                         the next month?

               howard's face falls.
