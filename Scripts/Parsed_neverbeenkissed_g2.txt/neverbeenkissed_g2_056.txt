               int. gus's office - day

               close on a newspaper headline: "the court - site for 
               parties, drugs and weekend arrests" - as gus throws the 
               newspaper down on his desk.

               josie sits across the desk from him. she reads the headline, 
               looking very surprised.

                                     gus
                         josie, i am appalled.

               josie picks up the paper, and starts reading intently.

                                     josie
                         jeez, so am i. i had no idea that 
                         these kids- let's see- turn to a14-

               she tries to turn to a14, but gus grabs the paper out of 
               her hands in a rage.

                                     gus
                              (trying to keep his 
                              cool)
                         no, i am appalled that i have a 
                         reporter in there, undercover, for 
                         almost three weeks now- i had to 
                         read about this in the tribune.

                                     josie
                         oh. right.

               gus angrily tries to fold the paper back 'up. he's having 
               a hard time. josie tries to help, but he yanks it away. 
               gus reads aloud from the newspaper.

                                     gus
                         responding officers found minors, 
                         marijuana, and cheap wine coolers 
                         when they responded to a call to 
                         break up a party at what southglen 
                         high schoolers have come to call 
                         "the court." seventeen-year-old 
                         kristen rey says, "yeah, everyone 
                         who's anyone is at the court on 
                         saturday night."

                                     josie
                              (disbelieving)
                         kristen got a quote?

               gus looks up at josie.

                                     josie
                         yes, urm, she's right. i have 
                         learned it is a very popular place 
                         for the young people to go.

                                     gus
                         have you been there?

                                     josie
                         uhh, no.

                                     gus
                         have you been to any parties?

                                     josie
                         well, how would you define to 
                         parties"? because we ordered a 
                         deli platter at this one denominator 
                         drill session--

               gus looks like he may combust. he opens the newspaper, 
               finds what he's looking for, and shoves it in josie's face. 
               it is a picture of all of the popular kids at southglen- 
               kristen, kirsten, gibby, guy- they are all posing for the 
               picture at the court, smiling and holding beers.

                                     gus
                         this is where the stories are. you 
                         are going to become friends with 
                         these people. you are going to 
                         party with them. you are going to 
                         hang out with them on weekends. 
                         when they go to prom, you are going 
                         to be in their same damn limo!

                                     josie
                         gus i, the popular kids and i, we 
                         just don't- i mean, i don't think 
                         i can do this.

               he points to the picture in the paper of the popular kids.

                                     gus
                         do you even know these kids?

                                     josie
                              (trying)
                         they hid my car--

               gus leans in very close.

                                     gus
                         get to know them. very well. your 
                         job and my job depends on it.

                                     josie
                              (very small)
                         depend on it. no s. your subject 
                         is plural.

                                     gus
                         out!

               josie grabs her knapsack and does.
