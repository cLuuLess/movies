               gibby stands staring at a skeleton with rob and the cool 
               girls.

                         all right--that's it. just water 
                         and ex-lax till prom.

                                     rob
                         hey--josie's dad invented that 
                         stuff. josie's like the heiress to 
                         the ex- lax fortune.

                         yeah. she's loaded. she spends all 
                         her vacations on the family yacht 
                         in the south of france.
