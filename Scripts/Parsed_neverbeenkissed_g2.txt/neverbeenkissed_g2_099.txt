               ext. baseball dugout - day

               rob sits with a bunch of baseball players. matz and packer, 
               the studs of the team, come into the dugout and join them.

                                     packer
                         hey rob, thanks for showing me 
                         that new grip. it totally changed 
                         my swing.

                                     rob
                         no problem, man.

               they do one of those elaborate, fraternity-like handshakes. 
               out of the corner of his eye, rob sees josie walking alone 
               across the field. he gets an idea.

                                     rob
                         hey, you guys know that girl, josie 
                         geller?

                                     matz
                         you mean "loser"?

                                     rob
                         no, dude, josie. we used to go out 
                         and she dumped me. but we're still 
                         good friends. and she isÂ… amazing, 
                         if you know what i mean.

               the guys are all stunned.
