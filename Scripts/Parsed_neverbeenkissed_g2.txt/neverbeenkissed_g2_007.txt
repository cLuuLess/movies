               int. tiki post -- day

               basically a mailbox etc. store, but dressed in a tahitian 
               theme. cardboard hula dancers hold fedex envelopes.

               rob geller, 23, good-looking, wears a smock with "tiki 
               post" emblazoned across it over a hawaiian shirt. he stands 
               watch at the cash register.

               monty maylik, 50, proud owner, rearranges a display. the 
               place is empty.

                                     rob
                         hey monty--you think we'll get any 
                         business today?

                                     monty
                              (of course)
                         i'm handing out a free lei to every 
                         customer! what do you think?

                                     rob
                         i think maybe people are scared 
                         off by the tiki torches.

                                     monty
                         change is scary. robbie, let me 
                         tell you a little something about 
                         the mail business. i've been in it 
                         over thirty years. and in those 
                         thirty years, the only thing that's 
                         changed is the elvis stamp and 
                         some gun laws. people are bored! 
                         they wanna shake things up!

                                     rob
                         i thought people just wanted their 
                         mail delivered on time.

               josie walks into the store, triggering hawaiian music. 
               monty puts a lei over her head.

                                     monty
                         aloha! welcome!

                                     rob
                         relax, monty. it's just my sister.

               monty takes the lei off her neck. josie hands rob an 
               envelope. rob rifles through the cash inside.

                                     rob
                         thanks, jos. i'll pay you back. 
                         bambi thanks you, too.

               rob indicates a beat-up wreck of a yellow car parked 
               outside.

                                     josie
                         that is so--weird that you name 
                         your car.

                                     rob
                         no it's not. guys name their 
                         penises.

                                     josie
                         okaaaay....
                              (then)
                         that car's going to bankrupt you.

                                     rob
                         she just needs a new windshield 
                         wiper.

                                     josie
                         because i bought the windshield 
                         last week. i'm a hubcap away from 
                         owning more of bambi than you do.

               rob hands the money back.

                                     rob
                         y'know what? take it. i don't want 
                         it.

               josie hands it back.

                                     josie
                         rob, take the money, okay? it's no 
                         big deal.

                                     rob
                         no, it is. it's just one more thing 
                         to add to your "things that make 
                         you a better person than me" list.

                                     josie
                         better person than i.

                                     rob
                         see!

                                     josie
                         i know this woman. she works in 
                         admissions at lakeshore community? 
                         she might be able to get you in 
                         for the fall semester. maybe she 
                         could get you the baseball 
                         scholarship, and i could help and--

                                     rob
                         i'm not going to college, jos. and 
                         i'm not playing anymore baseball. 
                         this is my life.

                                     josie
                              (whispering)
                         this--this is a luau that sells 
                         packing material!

                                     rob
                         someday this luau is going to be 
                         all mine!

                                     josie
                         how can you just give up like that? 
                         you had a real shot at playing 
                         college ball and you let one case 
                         of mono stop everything. don't you 
                         want more? to move out of mom and 
                         dad's? pay your own bills?

                                     rob
                         oh yay! and then i could be as 
                         happy as you!

                                     josie
                         for your information, i am very 
                         happy. deliriously happy. i lead a 
                         very happy life!

               she exits. the music starts up again.

                                     monty
                         come again!
