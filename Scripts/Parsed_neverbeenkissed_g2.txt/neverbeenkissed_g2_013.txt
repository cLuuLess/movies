               josie follows rob into the store. he turns.

                                     rob
                         wow. this must be big.

                                     josie
                         i got an assignment from the paper. 
                         i'm going undercover. back to high 
                         school.

               rob starts laughing uncontrollably.

                                     josie
                         what!?

                                     rob
                         do you remember high school?

                                     josie
                         it was a long time ago -

                                     rob
                         don't you remember what they called 
                         you?

               slowly josie's face falls. she looks very far away.

                                     rob
                         josie -
