               int. high school hallway - morning

               josie walks up to room 204. opening the door, she's met by 
               a sea of faces.

               ms. knox, mid-forties, distracted but bubbly, sits in the 
               front of the class.

                                     ms. knox
                         hi - hello. wilkommen. entre.

               josie walks in. kids whisper and snicker.

                                     josie
                         sorry i'm late.

                                     ms. knox
                         yes, well, i'm sorry i forgot to 
                         take my hot flash medication this 
                         morning. josie, right? please sit. 
                         mi casa es su casa.

               josie makes her way to the desk, trailing maribou. the 
               class titters. she sits in front of two girls, kirsten and 
               kristen, beautiful and intimidating.

                                     kirsten
                         that is so sad --

                                     kristen
                         i know, like five chickens had to 
                         die just so she could look that 
                         stupid.

                                     ms. knox
                         josie, in my classroom, tardiness 
                         is unacceptable --

                                     josie
                         i'm really sorry --

               ms. knox pulls a ridiculously huge sombrero out from under 
               her desk. the class laughs in recognition.

                                     ms. knox
                         not as sorry as i am.

               ms. knox puts the sombrero on a less-than-thrilled josie.

                                     ms. knox
                         ole! ten minutes in this hat, you'll 
                         never be late again. so, let's 
                         hear something about you. stand 
                         up. stand up.

               josie does. the sombrero drops over her eyes. she adjusts 
               it so she can read her notecards.

               close up on the notecard --it's filled with precise script 
               under a heading: my past. 

               she scans it, then flips the cards face-down on the desk. 
               confidently she begins --

                                     josie
                         my name is josie. i'm a high school 
                         student. i came from --

               just then the classroom door opens. we see from josie's 
               perspective a blinding light, josie squints. from the light 
               emerges a shadowy vision of billy prince.

                                     josie
                         billy?

               josie blinks, reveal not billy, but a beautiful guy, guy. 
               he stands very close to her.

                                     josie
                              (catching herself)

                                     bali.
                              (another beat)
                         i'm from billy-bali. it's a suburb 
                         of bali proper.

               guy pushes past her, tosses a wooden hall pass to ms. knox, 
               and moves to his seat.

                                     ms. knox
                         bali. fascinating! what did your 
                         family do there?

               josie looks around in panic, sees a student in a south 
               glen south windbreaker with huge ram on the back.

                                     josie
                         we were--sheep--farmers. we raised 
                         sheep. in billy-bali.

               josie realizes the trouble she's gotten herself into.

                                     josie
                         oh my god.
                              (caught)
                         oh my god--do i miss billy-bali.
                              (beat)
                         it had--a really great...aquarium.

               she sits. defeated.
