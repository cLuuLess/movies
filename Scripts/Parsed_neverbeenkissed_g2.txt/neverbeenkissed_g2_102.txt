               josie sees rob waving her over to "the table" where kristen, 
               gibby and the gang sit.

                                     josie

               and josie walks over to guy's table, leaving aldys staring 
               after her. josie sits down at the table. everyone stares 
               at her.

                                     gibby

                         voodoo daddy.

               josie shoots a look at rob.

                                     rob
                         hey, i told you--josie doesn't 
                         like to talk about that.

                                     kirsten
                         yeah, tommy, that's totally gochay.

                                     gibby
                         i think it's pronounced gauche.

                                     josie
                         yeah it's french. there's no accent 
                         aigue, so the e is soft.

               a silent beat. josie thinks she may have blown it.

                                     gibby
                         duh, of course you would know that. 
                         from being on your yacht in the 
                         south of france.

               they all smile at her. josie soaks in her newfound 
               popularity.
