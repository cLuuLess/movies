               anita and cynthia read the article, in the staff lunch 
               room, over a shared bag of microwave popcorn. they are 
               astounded-

                         yes, it is embarrassing to share 
                         this with the world. but it would 
                         be hard to explain what i learned, 
                         and how i learned it, without 
                         sharing this humiliating history.
