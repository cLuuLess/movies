               int. bullpen - continous

               josie spills out the elevator and races through the bullpen 
               with rhoda in pursuit.

                                     rhoda
                         splendiferous--

               josie stops, turns back to her.

                                     josie
                         totally.

               josie keeps going. a confused rhoda stares after her. she 
               passes merkin's desk. he is still on the phone.

                                     merkin
                              (into phone)
                         no way ... yeah? ... no way.

               josie reaches over, grabs the phone out of his hand and 
               hangs up without missing a beat. she continues on as merkin 
               stares after her. josie reaches the conference room door. 
               an older woman runs out crying.
