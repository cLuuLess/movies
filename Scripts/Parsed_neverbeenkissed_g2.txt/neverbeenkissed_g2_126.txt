               int. gym - continuous

               the place is a flurry of activity, a staging area for prom. 
               various committees are set up at tables throughout the 
               room.

               josie and rob enter.

                                     josie
                         --i spent my whole life wanting to 
                         fit in, and now--

               gibby and kirsten run up to josie.

                                     gibby
                         hey josie- who did archie date 
                         betty or veronica?

                                     josie
                         betty.

               gibby turns to kirsten.

                                     gibby
                         told you.

               and they move off. rob spots tracy and moves off to her.

                                     sam (o.s.)
                         i always liked betty better.

               josie turns, sees sam.

                                     josie
                         you did?

               and they begin to walk through the prom prop area, and it 
               begins to appear like a romantic date--they pass flowers, 
               he picks one out, they pass a bistro table, a backdrop of 
               a sunset follows them for awhile, etc.

                                     sam
                         oh yeah. betty was so spunky and 
                         fun. veronica may have had great 
                         legs, but she was too moody. very 
                         high maintenance.

               josie laughs.

               angle on: a table where kristen and tommy are selling prom 
               tickets. aldys is standing in front of them.

                                     aldys
                         you can't not sell me a ticket to 
                         prom.

                                     tommy
                         listen, alpo--we can do whatever 
                         we want.

                                     aldys
                         oh, i get it. it's that pesky making 
                         change part that's confusing you 
                         guys. here. i'll make it easy.
                              (holding up money)
                         money-
                              (drops money, takes 
                              ticket)
                         ticket.

               aldys takes her ticket, walks off. tommy and kristen turn 
               to each other and start whispering conspiratorially.

               angle back on: josie and sam

               sera runs up to josie.

                                     sera
                         josie, were tweedle dee and tweedle 
                         dum a couple?

               josie and sam share a look.

                                     josie
                         well, in a strict sense, probably 
                         not. but for prom--sure.

                                     sera
                         thanks!

               sera turns off.

                                     sam
                         you're really doing a great job 
                         here, josie. i like your "can do" 
                         attitude.

                                     josie
                              (shyly)
                         thanks.
                              (beat)
                         they weren't related to humpty 
                         dumpty, were they? tweedle dum and 
                         tweedle dee?

                                     sam
                         maybe distant cousins. they did 
                         have that egg shape in common.

                                     josie
                         but humpty dumpty was alone.

                                     sam
                         that's sad, isn't it? he had to 
                         sit on that wall all by himself. 
                         he deserved to have somebody.

                                     josie
                         that's really what we all need, 
                         right? someone to sit up on the 
                         wall with us--

                                     sam
                         yeah. to watch the world go by.--

                                     josie
                         to put us back together again when 
                         we fall.

               they share a meaningful glance and a smile.

                                     sam
                         our penguin, right?

                                     josie
                         do you think you'll find her?

                                     sam
                         yeah, actually i do.

               they are lost in each other. they lean closer, as if they 
               may kiss, then sam breaks the moment.

                                     sam
                         oh my god! i almost forgot--i got 
                         you a meeting with the admissions 
                         guy from dartmouth!

                                     josie
                         what! but--i wasn't even going to 
                         go to college--

                                     sam
                         no, i know, but i pulled some 
                         strings, got him to look at your 
                         writing, and he agreed to meet 
                         you.

                                     josie
                         oh--yikes!

                                     sam
                         told him
                              (teasing)
                         --if i'm wrong about this girl, 
                         you can take away my teaching 
                         certificate!

                                     josie
                         wow. you believe in me that much--

                                     sam
                         of course i do. josie, you owe it 
                         to yourself--to your writing, to 
                         go to college. you're a great 
                         writer. you just have to find your 
                         story.

               as they share a meaningful look, we freeze frame.
