               ext. baseball stands - day

               josie sits with her new friends, emulating them by sunning 
               in a bikini top and shorts while they watch the game.

                         josie, you have totally 
                         transitioned.

                                     josie
                         transitioned?

                                     gibby
                         you crossed over.

                         it's really hard to do. some kids 
                         try for all of-high school and 
                         never make it.

                         wannabes. kirsten transitioned 
                         last year.

                         her dad sold a car to leonardo di 
                         caprio's uncle and before he picked 
                         it up, her dad let us all sit in 
                         it and take pictures.

                                     gibby:
                              (to josie)
                         wait. do you know any gay guys?

                                     josie
                         why?

                                     kirsten
                         we'd love to transition a gay guy 
                         into the group.

                                     kristen
                         we're very evolved.

               on the field

               a ball sails fast and hard. it looks like it's going to be 
               a base hit, into left field, but the shortstop leaps up 
               and grabs it. that shortstop is rob. the team cheers. coach 
               romano heads out of the dugout towards rob.

               in the stands

               josie and the gang leap up and cheer. josie almost loses 
               her top, but catches it, just as guy comes around the side 
               of the stands and notices josie.
