               ext. high school parking lot - next morning

               josie approaches the school. she's clearly made a new 
               attempt at style- she's teetering on too-high platform 
               shoes and showing a blending white midriff. no one pays 
               much attention to her.

               george, thirty-something african-american, the epitome of 
               cool, waves josie over to an open van side door. josie 
               looks confused and scurries to the van.

                                     josie
                              (sotto)
                         george! what are you doing here?

                                     george
                         just get in the van, josie.
