               int. george's van continuos

               george watches the monitor, hands splash water. a hand 
               grabs a paper towel. george can now see josie reflected in 
               the bathroom mirror. he sees the "loser" stamp on her 
               forehead.

                                     george
                         oh man. look up, girl. c'mon, look 
                         up--
