               int. country club - dance floor - continuous

               sam looks deep into josie's eyes.

                                     sam
                         there's something i have to tell 
                         you, too--

               josie's eyes shift from sam to over his shoulder. she spots 
               aldys, who smiles at her. josie's eyes travel up to the 
               can of dog food.

               flash: teenage josie

               on the porch, facing billy and his date.

               flash: teenage josie

               with egg dripping all over her.

               back to present.

                                     josie
                         nooooooo!

               slow motion as josie lunges for aldys and pulls her to 
               floor as tommy, off-balance, dumps the dog food all down 
               guy's front. the crowd stops dead, staring. the can, now 
               empty, rolls slowly off the dance floor, the metal rolling 
               noise echoing in the silence.

                                     guy
                              (to josie)
                         what is your problem?!

                                     gibby
                         i knew it. you are a loser.

                                     kristen
                         you ruined the whole thing!

                                     kirsten
                         you so do not deserve to be prom 
                         queen.

               everyone is still staring. it's dead quiet.

                                     josie
                         let me tell you something.

               it is still silent. josie takes a deep breath, and looks 
               around the room.

                                     josie
                         i don't care about being the prom 
                         queen. i am twenty five years old.

               looks of confusion and teenage disgust. rob is pissed. sam 
               looks shocked.

                                     josie
                         i'm here as an undercover reporter 
                         for the sun times for god's sake 
                         and i've been beating my brains 
                         out trying to impress you.

               she tears off her crown, and chucks it. she's on a roll.

                                     josie
                         i want to tell you something. you 
                         people- guy, gibby, the rest of 
                         you who have been keeping the geeks 
                         down through the ages. you will 
                         spend your lives trying to figure 
                         out ways to keep others down, 
                         because it makes you feel more 
                         important. and you will miss out 
                         on so much.
                              (indicating aldys)
                         why her, huh?  what did she ever 
                         do to you? let me tell you something 
                         about this girl. she is 
                         unbelievable. i was new here, and 
                         she befriended me- no questions 
                         asked. but you people, you were my 
                         friends only after my brother, 
                         rob...

               she points out rob in the crowd. he's mortified.

                                     josie
                         posed as a student and told you to 
                         like me. but y'know--l have to 
                         thank you. i got to go to an amazing 
                         prom. i got to be prom queen. i 
                         got to be cool. it felt good.
                              (beat)
                         but not as good as being myself.
                              (turns to crowd)
                         and to all of you-- there's a big 
                         world out there. bigger than prom. 
                         bigger than high school. when you 
                         get there, it won't matter if you 
                         were prom queen or the quarterback 
                         or the biggest nerd in school. 
                         what matters is that you don't 
                         regret who you were, who you are-
                         what if steven spielberg had quit 
                         the audio/visual club because it 
                         wasn't "cool"? what if rosie 
                         o'donnell had stopped cracking 
                         jokes because someone told her 
                         they were stupid?  what if michael 
                         jordan never went back to basketball 
                         after he got cut from his high 
                         school team?.
                              (a beat)
                         in this room right now, there could 
                         be a future nobel prize winner, a 
                         supreme court justice, an amazing 
                         mom. find out who you are and don't 
                         be afraid of it.
                              (a beat)
                         and if you'll all excuse me, i 
                         have some business to take care 
                         of.

               reaction shots' all around. kids start clapping, hollering, 
               whooping. the music starts up again. they all go back to 
               dancing the denominators lead their own conga line.

               angle on: josie

               she looks around for sam but he is gone. she runs out, 
               brushing past the judges.

               angle on: judges

               judge #2 dabs his eyes.

                                     judge #1
                         this prom had it all. laughter, 
                         tears, an amazing climax.

               judge #2, still overcome, just raises his "two thumbs up."
