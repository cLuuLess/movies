               int. club/delloser hall - later

               josie is high beyond belief, wearing a big rasta hat and 
               loudly laughing her ass off as the rastas just stare. she 
               can hardly keep herself in her chair.

                                     josie
                         get it?! get it?! he was a 
                         firecracker!

               she lifts up rasta 1's dreadlocks to get his ear.

                                     josie
                              (yelling)

                                     a firecracker!
                         and she cracks up again.

                                     rasta #1
                              (to rasta #2)
                         i don't love her.

               rastas share looks ill around. then josie hears the first 
               strains of "the harder they come"--

                                     josie
                         oh my god! this music rules!

               and josie proceeds to get up and take over the place--she's 
               dancing on the table, getting up with the band and playing 
               the bongos, all with absolutely no rhythm or style. but 
               with a lot of whooping. the club is agog.

               angle on: lara and sam. they both look aghast.

                                     lara
                         she's a student of yours?

                                     sam
                              (in explanation)
                         she's from bali.

               and as josie continues to dance on stage, making a total 
               fool of herself, jimmy cliff turns to camera.

                                     jimmy
                         freak.
