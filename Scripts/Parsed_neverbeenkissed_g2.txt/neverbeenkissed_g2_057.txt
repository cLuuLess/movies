               int. anita's cubicle - continuous

               josie runs through the bullpen, past anita's cubicle. roger 
               from op/ed enters. he and anita smile flirtatiously.

                                     anita
                         hi roger from op/ed--

                                     roger
                         hi anita from classifieds. we still 
                         on for tonight?

                                     anita
                         of course--

               and he leans in and kisses her. she pulls away, confused. 
               a beat. anita kisses him again. nothing.

                                     anita (contÂ’d)
                              (can't believe she's 
                              saying it--)
                         y'know what? no, i don't think we 
                         are on. i think i have to stay 
                         home.
                              (liking how it sounds)
                         yeah. i'm staying home! i don't 
                         know what i'll do there, but i'm 
                         gonna do it. alone!

               roger walks off.

                                     roger
                              (under)
                         freak.
