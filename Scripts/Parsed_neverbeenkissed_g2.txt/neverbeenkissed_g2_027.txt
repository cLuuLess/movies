               int. high school hallway - morning

               josie stares at her class card and eyes the classrooms, 
               totally lost. she approaches a boy in a flannel shirt and 
               loose jeans.

                                     josie
                         hi--um, i'm looking for room 204, 
                         ms. knox?

               as soon as the boy starts to talk, we notice something in 
               his mouth - a tongue pierce. josie does too. we zoom in on 
               that shiny little metal ball. josie is fixated. so fixated 
               that we stop hearing the boy's voice. all we see is the 
               mouth - and that ball - moving. the mouth closes. he's 
               done. josie's face is contorted in imagined pain.

                                     josie
                         ow.
                              (catching herself)
                         i mean, wow. wow. great directions. 
                         clear. concise.

               and josie takes off, totally embarrassed.

                                     boy
                              (under his breath)
                         freak.
