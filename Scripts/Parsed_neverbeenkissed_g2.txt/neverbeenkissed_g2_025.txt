               int. school lobby - same

               josie merges with the throngs of kids and is literally 
               pushed into the lobby. she stares around, overwhelmed. "go 
               rams!" banners share space with signs that read: "63 days 
               til prom!" she inches her way along the wall until she is 
               stopped by a guard who grabs her arm.

                                     guard
                         hey--where are you going?

                                     josie
                         oh, i'm a student. most definitely 
                         a student. in high school. here. i 
                         am going to class. with my fellow 
                         students.
                              (greeting random 
                              kids)
                         hi. hi there.

               the guard stares at her a beat and then motions behind 
               them, to three huge metal detectors that the kids are 
               filtering through. josie smiles, "whoops," walks back.

                                     guard
                              (under his breath)
                         freak.
