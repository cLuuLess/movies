               int. a conference room - same

               it's packed with the newspaper staff. hyram rigfort, 65, 
               white-haired, dignified owner of the paper presides. anita 
               and josie sit next to each other. next to anita sits roger 
               from op/ed, a good-looking guy in his 30's.

                                     rigfort
                         let me start out by saying that i 
                         was very impressed by the 
                         investigative piece dutton did on 
                         pesticides in our supermarkets.

               an older man, dutton, smiles proudly.

                                     rigfort
                         but since the trib did a better 
                         piece on the same subject, you're 
                         fired.

               dutton's face falls. everyone looks horrified.

                                     rigfort
                         you heard me. out. out.

               dutton shuffles out. josie takes a big bite of donut.

                                     rigfort
                         so. happy march everybody!

                                     all
                              (by rote)
                         happy march mr. rigfort.

                                     rigfort
                         to celebrate, i've decided it's 
                         time for another undercover feature!

               everyone looks underwhelmed.

                                     rigfort
                         you all know that some of my best 
                         inspiration comes from personal 
                         experience. who knew that my botched 
                         foray into hair plugs would lead 
                         to last month's award-winning expose -- 
                         "hair today, gone tomorrow"? hat's 
                         off to you, bruns.

               we pan over to bruns, a reporter whose hair is missing in 
               odd-looking clumps. he nods sadly.

                                     rigfort
                         or should i say "hat's on"! and 
                         what about when my wife had that 
                         affair with gil, her ski instructor 
                         and howard went undercover as an 
                         expert slalom skier.

               howard smiled wanly. both his arms are in casts. camera 
               pans the room as rigfort continues, picking out different 
               reporters.

                                     rigfort
                         so last night i'm sitting around 
                         the dinner table with my family. 
                         the wife, the two nannies, the 
                         boys, and we're eating chicken 
                         with this peanut sauce.

               camera stops at a chef boyardee look-alike.

                                     gus
                         undercover chef. i like it.

                                     rigfort
                         hang on, gus. so, we're eating 
                         this peanut sauce and suddenly the 
                         younger kid starts choking.

               camera stops at a nurse ratchet look-alike.

                                     anita
                              (sotto to josie)
                         i'm smelling undercover er nurse.

                                     rigfort
                         turns out he's allergic to peanuts. 
                         and i think -- holy shit. i don't 
                         even know my own kids. i mean, who 
                         knows if they're even mine? and it 
                         got me thinking. how much do we 
                         know about kids today? what are 
                         they thinking? how many of them 
                         are allergic to peanuts? boom. it 
                         hit me -- "my semester in high 
                         school."

               camera stops at a bald guy, the jerks over one seat to 
               josie.

                                     rigfort
                              (to josie)
                         you. what's your name?

                                     josie
                         josie. josie geller.

                                     rigfort
                         you enroll on friday.

               general crowd hubub. josie's in shock.

                                     josie
                         oh. but--i'm not a reporter yet...

                                     rigfort
                         and none of these geezers could 
                         pass for a day under 40. have fun.

               and rigfort exits.
