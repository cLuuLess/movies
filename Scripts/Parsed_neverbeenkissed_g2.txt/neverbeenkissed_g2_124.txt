               int. josie's old bedroom - continuous

               they go in. josie sees her spelling bee trophies- with her 
               name. she turns them around, trying to appear nonchalant. 
               as guy enters, he eyes the trophies, the stuffed animals, 
               the many sets of encyclopedias.

                                     guy
                         wow, rob's sister must be such a 
                         loser.

               josie manages a weak smile. guy sits on the bed.

                                     guy
                         come here, sit down.

               she sits on the bed, and then sees a picture of her and 
               her family on the bedside table. she dives across the bed 
               to overturn it.

                                     guy
                         i'm sure you've probably heard 
                         that i want to ask you, but i'd 
                         like to know if you'd go to prom 
                         with me. i know we didn't hit it 
                         off right at the beginning but-

                                     josie
                         yes. i'll go. yes.

               guy leans in as if to kiss her and whispers...

                                     guy
                         rufus.
                              (then pulling away)
                         but i don't even know where you 
                         live.

                                     josie
                         you know what?  why don't you just 
                         pick me up here? we could all share 
                         a limo.

                                     guy
                         cool. i'll catch you later.

               guy leaves. josie is ecstatic and flops back on her bed. 
               stuffed animals fall all around her.
