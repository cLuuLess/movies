                         great playing, rob. you might be 
                         just what southglen south needs to 
                         get to nationals.

                                     rob
                         i'm playing in the championship 
                         game?

                                     coach romano
                         playing? you're starting shortstop. 
                         and i don't mean to put more 
                         pressure on you but there are going 
                         to be some pro scouts there.

                                     rob
                         oh man!

               rob grabs coach romano in a bear hug. the coach is 
               uncomfortable. rob moves towards the dugout and the coach 
               happily slaps him on the ass.
