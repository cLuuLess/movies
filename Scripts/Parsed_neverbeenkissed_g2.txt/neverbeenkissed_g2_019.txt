               int. the mall - teen clothing store - day

               anita and josie cruise through a teen clothing store, 
               carrying large bags from a stationery store. josie picks 
               up a platform sneaker and just stares at it.

                                     anita
                         so, you were a geek. big deal.

                                     josie
                         anita, remember espadrilles?

                                     anita
                         please. that doesn't make you a 
                         nerd. everyone wore those shoes.

                                     josie
                         the girls threw them at me in the 
                         locker room.

                                     anita
                         okay. that's bad.

                                     josie
                         at the end of the yeat the person 
                         who got the most direct his to my 
                         head got to toss me into the pool.

                                     anita
                         mama mia.
                              (then)
                         just because you were a nerd once 
                         doesn't mean it's going to happen 
                         again. that's why you have me for 
                         fashion consultation.

               anita pulls a slip skirt off a rack and holds it up.

                                     anita
                         now this is cute.

                                     josie
                         that is lingerie.

                                     anita
                         so i was thinking about what you 
                         were saying - y'know, about really 
                         being kissed? i think roger could 
                         be the one.

                                     josie
                         what'd you feel when you kissed 
                         him?

                                     anita
                         bridgework?

                                     josie
                         very romantic.

               josie pulls out a plain button-down cardigan.

                                     josie
                         how about this?

                                     anita
                         i am not letting you out of the 
                         house in that, young lady.

               anita grabs an awful white maribou jacket and matching 
               earrings and holds them up.

                                     anita
                         cuuuute!

                                     josie
                         'nita, this is about reporting, 
                         not accessorizing.

                                     anita
                         and we're going to have to do 
                         something about your hair.

                                     josie
                         anita!

                                     anita
                         jos, please try and have some fun 
                         here, okay? how many of us get to 
                         go back to high school? you're 
                         gonna have a blast!

                                                           smash cut to:

               close up - an alarm clock

               on a bedside table. surrounded by make-up, boxes of hair 
               color, a stack of index cards, ripped magazine pages of 
               teen looks, issues of teen beat and ym. the clock slips to 
               7:00. npr starts playing. a hand reaches over, hits the 
               radio off.

               sound effects: a school bell. as the bell continues to 
               ring, we widen to:
