                         someone once told me that to write 
                         well you have to write what you 
                         know. this is what i know. i am 
                         twenty five years old. i have never 
                         really kissed a guy. a geek to the 
                         core, most of my childhood years 
                         were spent doing extra homework i 
                         requested from the teacher.
