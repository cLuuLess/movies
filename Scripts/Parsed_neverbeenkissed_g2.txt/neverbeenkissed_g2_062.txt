               ext. school - minutes later

               a crush of kids flood up the stairs to the front door of 
               the school. we see kirsten, kristen and gibby walking three 
               abreast ahead of josie up the stairs. the crowd parts around 
               them. josie heads towards them.

                                     josie
                         hey! kirsten, kristen, gibby-- 
                         what's up girlfriends?

               the three girls pause and turn just as josie, caught up in 
               the moment, doesn't see a stray backpack on the stairs in 
               front of her. josie trips and--

               josie-cam pov:

               the camera face-plants into the pavement.
