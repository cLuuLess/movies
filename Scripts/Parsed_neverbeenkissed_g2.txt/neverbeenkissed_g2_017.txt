               int. high school corridor - day (flashback)

               we close up on brown leather oxfords and widen to reveal 
               teenage josie

               braces, heavy glasses, in all her nerdom, slowly walking 
               down the corridor with a huge backpack on her back.

               a boy sneaks up behind her, holds open the top of her 
               backpack while another boy pours a half drunk sprite into 
               her backback.

               she spots, billy prince, ultmate high school heartthrob, 
               and approaches him nervously.

               midway through josie's speech, we hear the odd sound of 
               liquid hitting linoleum. josie follow billy's gaze down to 
               between her feet where a pool of sprite has gathered. billy 
               starts to laugh. kids around him join in. as the laughter 
               echoes around her we

                                                       dissolve back to:
