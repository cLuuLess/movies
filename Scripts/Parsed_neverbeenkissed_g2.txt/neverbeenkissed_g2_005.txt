               int. josie's office -- continuous

               josie enters, reads the messsage still gingerly held in 
               two fingers, and drops it into the trash can. she hangs 
               her coat squarely on the back of her door, takes five 
               pencils from her pencil pot, one by one sharpens them in 
               her pencil sharpener, and then lays them out neatly in a 
               row. she smiles, satisfied, ready for another day.

               anita brandt, late 20's, pretty in a semi-unprofessional 
               way, bursts in, smiling.

                                     anita
                         guess who i did it with last 
                         night...

                                     josie
                              (duh)
                         roger in op/ed.

                                     anita
                         who told!

                                     josie
                         you did. yesterday you said, and i 
                         quote, "i have a date with roger 
                         from op/ed tonight and i'm going 
                         to do it with him."

                                     anita
                         well, that doesn't mean it was 
                         going to happen for sure.

               josie just stares at her.

                                     anita
                         once it didn't happen for sure.

               gus strauss, late 30's, would probably clean up well, 
               enters. he tosses some copy onto josie's desk.

                                     gus
                         computer's down. septuplets story. 
                         i need it back by five. hopefully 
                         the copy's not a mess.

                                     josie
                              (emphasizing)
                         it is hoped that it's not a mess. 
                         "hopefully" is an adverb. it means 
                         "with hope". you have it defining 
                         the copy, and i'm pretty sure the 
                         copy doesn't have feelings.

               gus and anita just stare at josie.

                                     josie
                         well, excuse me for caring about 
                         words.

                                     gus
                              (to anita)
                         so. you and roger in op/ed.

                                     anita
                         oh, man! who told?

                                     gus
                         roger in op/ed. don't make me send 
                         you another memo about my policy 
                         on inter-office dating.

                                     josie
                         intra office. and they're not 
                         dating. they're having sex.

                                     anita
                         and what is your policy? that if 
                         you're not getting any, no one 
                         can?

               anita flounces off.

                                     gus
                         how many times have i fired her?

                                     josie
                         five-- six--

                                     gus
                              (shrugging, giving 
                              up)
                         eh.

               gus turns to exit.

                                     josie
                         hey gus--did you see the story 
                         idea i left on your desk?

                                     gus
                         yeah--the blind foster home mother. 
                         it was good. i got cahoon on it.

                                     josie
                              (disappointed)
                         oh. cahoon. yeah, he's--good.

                                     gus
                         geller, we've been over this. you're 
                         a great copy editor. maybe my best 
                         copy editor. you're not a reporter.

                                     josie
                         you've done five of my ideas.

                                     gus
                         you know what separates us office 
                         flunkies from the reporters?

                                     josie
                         they don't have to be in the office 
                         christmas show?

                                     gus
                         a flack jacket.

                                     josie
                              (not getting it)
                         a--flack jacket.

                                     gus
                         every tom, dick, and harry thinks 
                         he can write. but a journalist 
                         gets in there, right where the 
                         bombs are. he's aggressive. grabs 
                         the bull by the balls.

                                     josie
                         you don't think i can grab bulls' 
                         balls?

                                     gus
                         geller, you don't want a reporter's 
                         life. they're very--messy. you're 
                         all about order. control. and 
                         getting me my copy by five.

                                     josie
                         hey--i can be out of control.

               gus smiles. on his way out he re-adjusts josie's nameplate 
               so it hangs at an angle. tormented, josie waits a beat. 
               she can't take it, and runs to the door and straightens 
               it.

                                     gus
                              (over his shoulder)
                         copy by five.
