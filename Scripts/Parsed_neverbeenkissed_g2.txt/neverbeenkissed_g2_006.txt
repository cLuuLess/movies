               int. sun times lunchroom -- day

               actually, a pretty depressing kitchenette area. anita and 
               josie eat lunch--anita eats chinese out of a container, 
               josie has three baggies of perfectly cut food in front of 
               her.

                                     josie
                         be honest. do you think i'm 
                         aggressive?

               anita ponders a moment.

                                     anita
                         okay. remember when they took your 
                         office chair in for repairs and 
                         forgot to return it?

                                     josie
                         yeah.

                                     anita
                         you stood for like a month.

               cynthia, an affable african-american woman in her 40's, 
               enters and puts three microwave meals in the microwave.

                                     josie
                         just because i'm not out of control 
                         doesn't mean i can't write.

                                     cynthia
                         josie, you listen to me. if you 
                         feel you're a writer--
                              (touching her chest)
                         here, deep inside, don't let anyone 
                         tell you you're not. look at me. 
                         every day i come to this paper and 
                         i pour my heart and soul into what 
                         i do. i feel it, passionately, to 
                         the core of my being.

                                     josie
                         you write obituaries.

                                     cynthia
                         hey, if you can make a busted aorta 
                         sound good--honey, that's art.

               the microwave dings off. cynthia fishes the three lean 
               cuisines out. anita and josie share a look.

                                     anita
                         cynthia, aren't they only diatetic 
                         if you eat them one at a time?

                                     cynthia
                         i eat 'em one at a time.

                                     anita
                              (to josie)
                         y'know, maybe gus has a point. it 
                         wouldn't kill you to relax and 
                         have some fun. roger's got a friend, 
                         marshall in editing? the one with 
                         the lazy eye? maybe we could double 
                         date.

                                     josie
                         forget it.

                                     anita
                         i swear to god, jos. when is the 
                         last time you went on a real live 
                         date?

                                     josie
                         i'm concentrating on my career 
                         right now.

                                     anita
                         do you own any colored underwear? 
                         stripes? anything?!

                                     josie
                              (embarrassed)
                         anita!

                                     anita
                         look. you're way under 30, you're 
                         cute, some guys find white carter's 
                         underwear sexyÂ—
                              (beat)
                         if you talk to his nose, you don't 
                         even notice the eye.

               josie laughs in spite of herself.

                                     josie
                         the right guy is out there. i'm 
                         just not going to kiss a whole 
                         bunch of losers to get to him.

                                     anita
                         yeah, but sometimes kissing the 
                         losers can be a fun diversion.

                                     josie
                         when i finally get kissed, i'll 
                         know.

               anita and cynthia trade looks.

                                     anita
                         okay. if you've never kissed a 
                         guy, we got bigger problems than 
                         the underwear.

                                     josie
                         i've kissed guys. i've just never 
                         kissed a guy. felt that thing--

                                     cynthia
                         "that thing"? is that what you 
                         kids are calling it these days?

                                     josie
                         that thing. that moment. you kiss 
                         someone and it's like the world 
                         around you gets all hazy and the 
                         only thing in focus is you and 
                         this other person and you know 
                         that one person is the person you're 
                         meant to be kissing for the rest 
                         of your life. and for that one 
                         moment you've been given this 
                         amazing gift and you want to laugh 
                         and cry at the same time because 
                         you're so lucky you found it, and 
                         so scared that it will all go away.

               anita and cynthia take this in.

                                     cynthia
                         damn, girl. you are a writer.
