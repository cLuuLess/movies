               int. high school hallway - (present) - day

               homeroom has just gotten out, and the halls are packed 
               with kids. josie is running full speed, trying to negotiate 
               around lots of kids, in her frantic-race for the door. 
               kids still point and stare.

               she bangs into some freshmen, gets whacked by a book bag, 
               slides some banners that kids are painting - but she won't 
               slow down.

               just as she's almost at the doors to the school, the big 
               wooden door to the front office opens. josie can't stop. a 
               figure emerges, but before josie can even see who it is, 
               she slams into it and goes down. she bangs her head on the 
               hard linoleum floor.

                                                            dissolve to:

               we see two kids looking down into the camera.

                                     jason
                         hey--you okay?

               camera nods "yes" slowly. tommy and jason come into frame.

                                     tommy
                         wow. you took a pretty big fall.

                                     jason
                         yeah. like every loser should. and 
                         they move out of frame, laughing.

                                     josie
                         as every loser should.

                                     voice
                         are you o.k.? josie, are you o.k.?

               rob comes into frame.
