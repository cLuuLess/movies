               int. country club - buffet - minutes later

               josie stands by the buffet in her tiara, turns and comes 
               face to face with sam. they're both taken aback by the 
               other's beauty.

                                     sam
                         josie--you make a really beautiful 
                         prom queen.

                                     josie
                         thanks. so do you.

               they both laugh, embarrassed, at josie's flub.

                                     sam
                         i always feel like such a goofball 
                         in these penguin suits. like i'm 
                         at my own wedding or something.

               an awkward beat.

                                     sam
                         you wanna--

               he gestures towards the dance floor. josie smiles.

                                     josie
                         yeah, okay--

               and they walk off onto the dance floor.

               angle on: the side of the dance floor.

               guy approaches aldys.

                                     guy
                         hey, listen--it's prom. how about 
                         we let all the old shit go. would 
                         you like to dance?

               aldys can't help it. she smiles, a little flattered.

                                     guy
                         if it's okay with the rest of the 
                         double helix.

               aldys smiles and unhooks herself from the group. and starts 
               to dance with guy.

               angle on: josie and sam as they continue to dance.

                                     sam
                         proms always make me sad. they're 
                         so final. graduation. everyone's 
                         scattering, moving on.

                                     josie
                         well, are you here with anybody?

                                     sam
                         no, i'm alone.

                                     josie
                         it's weird because "prom" is 
                         actually from the word "promenade". 
                         and you can't really promenade 
                         alone, can you?

               sam smiles at this.

                                     sam
                         you're amazing, josie geller.

               angle on: guy and aldys as they dance, we see the cool 
               girls and jason standing to the side of the dance floor 
               laughing gibby reaches into her purse and pulls out a can 
               of alpo. she hands it to jason who pulls a can opener out 
               of his pocket, opens the lid. he hands it to kirsten who 
               take the lid off. she hands the can to kristen, who hands 
               the can to tommy.

                                     sam
                         so--have you thought anymore about 
                         dartmouth?

                                     josie
                         yeah, i have.

               close up on josie's hand as she subtlety removes her hidden 
               camera pin and drops it to the ground.

                                     josie
                         there's something i have to tell 
                         you--

               her foot comes down on top of it.
