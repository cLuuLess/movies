               int. cafeteria - later

               josie emerges from the cafeteria line with her tray. a 
               loud chant comes from one of the tables.

                                     crowd
                         rob, rob, rob

               she turns to see rob in the middle of a hot dog eating 
               contest with a huge wrestler. rob downs his last one, raises 
               his hands in victory. the crowd goes wild. rob sits down 
               at guy's table.

                                     josie
                         oh my god.

               angle on guy's table

                                     guy
                         dude, you rock!

               he high-fives rob. a pretty girl, tracy approached rob.

                                     tracy
                         hi. i'm tracy and i'm sixteen and 
                         i'm a gymnast and i don't have a 
                         boyfriend...

                                     rob
                              (looks skyward, 
                              mouths)
                         thank you.
                              (then , to tracy)

                                     tracy
                         duh.

               angle back on josie

               aldys approaches.

                                     aldys
                         hey Â– where were you last night? i 
                         was worried.

               josie can't take her eyes off rob sitting at guy's table. 
               aldys notices josie's distraction.

                                     josie
                         what?

                                     aldys
                         last night. 7:30. big cup. i kept 
                         calling you, but i only got your 
                         machine. i don't even know your 
                         parents line and i was really 
                         worried.

                                     josie
                         oh. i forgot.

               aldys is really hurt.

                                     aldys
                         well, maybe you should forget about 
                         sitting with us too.

               josie just stands there all alone.
