               int. high school hallway - day

               guy, his buddies, kirsten, kristen and gibby, sign 
               yearbooks, hang out by the lockers-

                                     josie (v.o.)
                         all of these things made me 
                         miserable at seventeen. but at 
                         twenty five i finally see that 
                         this - all of this- is just the 
                         way it should be. it is all part 
                         of this thing- high school. a time 
                         in our lives that we can never 
                         truly repeat.  a time that shapes 
                         us. a time that makes us who we 
                         are, for years to come.
