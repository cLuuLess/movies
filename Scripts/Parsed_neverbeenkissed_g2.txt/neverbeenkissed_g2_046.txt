               int. classroom - day

               sam is perched on the desk. the usual players in their 
               usual seats. aldys is standing and reading from her book.

                                     aldys:
                              (reading)
                         "all the world's a stage and all 
                         the men and women merely players."

                                     sam
                         anyone have any idea what 
                         shakespeare meant by that?

               no one answers.

                                     sam
                         anyone? sera ... megan ... exchange 
                         student who doesn't speak english?

               we cu on the students, ending on an asian boy who smiles 
               wildly at sam and waves. sam smiles, and waves back.

                                     sam
                         it's about disguise, playing a 
                         part. it's the theme of "as you 
                         like it." can anyone tell me where 
                         we see that?

                                     aldys
                         well, rosalind disguises herself 
                         as a man and escapes into the 
                         forest.

                                     sam
                         right. and it's when she's in 
                         costume that she can finally express 
                         her love for orlando. see, 
                         shakespeare's making the point 
                         here that when we're disguised, we 
                         feel freer. we can do things we 
                         wouldn't do in ordinary life.

               cu on josie's face. she's clearly uncomfortable. sam walks 
               up to a huge football player, brett.

                                     sam
                         brett when you go out on the 
                         football field in your uniform, 
                         what happens?

                                     brett
                         we win?

                                     sam
                         you hit people. you yell. you touch 
                         other guys' butts.

               the class giggles. brett looks horrified.

                                     sam
                         but it's okay, because you're in 
                         uniform. disguise changes the rules
                              (beat)
                         i had these spiderman pyjamas. i 
                         thought when i wore them, that i 
                         had super powers. one night i tried 
                         to walk up the side of the garage.

                                     sera
                         did you make it?

                                     sam
                         to the emergency room. yeah.

               josie smiles at this, a little smitten.

                                     sam
                         josie, why don't you read from act 
                         5, scene 2, rosalind's speech--

               josie stands up, starts reading--

                                     josie
                         "no sooner had they met but they 
                         looked; no sooner looked but they 
                         loved; no sooner loved but they 
                         sighed..."

               josie's voice begins to fade away-
