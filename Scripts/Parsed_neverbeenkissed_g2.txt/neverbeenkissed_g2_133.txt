               josie sits with the cool group at a table. kristen is making 
               odd faces.

                                     josie
                         kristen, what are you doing?

                                     kristen
                         i'm practicing my surprised face 
                         for when we get named to prom court.

               joseph and a very pregnant mary approach their table and 
               try to sit down.

                         sorry. there's no room at this
