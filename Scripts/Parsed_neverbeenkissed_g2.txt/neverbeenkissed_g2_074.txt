               int. josie's apartment - next morning

               josie is asleep where we left her, her head on her hand, 
               empty pie plate nearby.

               she wakes, picks her head up. looks down at her hand, the 
               delloser stamp is faint. close up on her forehead. there 
               in block letters backwards is "loser".

               she looks up at the clock, which reads: 8:30. she's late. 
               very late. she grabs her book bag and her keys, and races 
               out.
