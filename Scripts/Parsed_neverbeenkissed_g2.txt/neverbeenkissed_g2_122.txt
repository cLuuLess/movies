               int. kitchen - same

               rob is mixing margaritas, wearing a big sombrero. tracy 
               sits on the counter, gazing lovingly at rob's every move.

                                     josie
                         hey rob, what's going on?

                                     tracy
                         i'm rob's prom date.

               josie glares at rob.

                                     josie
                         really?
                              (pulling rob aside)
                         rob-, that girl is sixteen.

                                     rob
                         and a gymnast!

                                     josie
                         she's sixteen years old, rob. that's 
                         totally and completely illegal.

               josie feels an arm around her shoulder. it's guy.

                                     guy
                         hey there.

                                     josie
                         hey. there.

               guy takes josie's hand.

                                     guy
                         come here. i want to ask you 
                         something.

               rob watches them leaving the kitchen.

                                     rob
                              (to josie, calling 
                              after)
                         see you around the cellblock, mrs. 
                         robinson.

               josie turns around and gives him a death look. tracy turns 
               to rob.

                                     tracy
                         rob, what do you want to be when 
                         you grow up?

                                     rob
                         well, a ball player.

                                     tracy
                         no, i know. but, what if you don't 
                         make it? 'i mean, you don t want 
                         to be working at a mail place the 
                         rest of your life. it's okay for 
                         an after school job, but, come on, 
                         "hi, i'm rob and i run the tiki 
                         post"?! totally lame.

               tracy starts to giggle. rob does not.
