               int. gus's office - day

               gus slaps a newspaper down on his desk.

               close on - the front page of the paper, and not just any 
               newspaper - the chicago tribune - the sun times' rival.

               there is a photo of josie from prom with the headline that 
               reads: "reporter revealed at local high school".

               josie picks it up, and starts reading.

                                     gus
                         your story was rigfort's baby. we 
                         were scooped! we've got nothing. 
                         zippo. you totally and completely 
                         screwed both of us.

                                     josie
                         maybe i could talk to rigfort, you 
                         know, tell him the whole story.

                                     gus
                         i'll tell you a story. it's about 
                         this shy copy editor who makes a 
                         mockery of herself and her boss 
                         when she completely botches her 
                         first assignment as a reporter.

               josie stands. slams down the paper.

                                     josie
                         we are not screwed. yes, i made a 
                         mistake. but we will have a story.
                              (beat)
                         you will have an amazing story.

               josie exits.
