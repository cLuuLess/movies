                         woman coming through! cover up 
                         what you don't want seen!

               and with that josie comes walking into the locker room, 
               completely unruffled, and storms over to coach romano's 
               office, just as he is leaving it.

                                     josie
                         hi, coach romano, my name is josie 
                         geller, from the chicago sun times 
                         listen, you know the local sports 
                         guy for the sun times, jim lakin?

                                     coach
                         sure, every coach in the area tries 
                         to get jim to cover his team.

               josie puts her arm around the coach, and leads him back 
               into his own office.

                                     josie
                         well, what would you say if i told 
                         you that i could guarantee that 
                         jim and every other reporter in 
                         the area would be at the game?

                                     coach
                         i'd say you can have whatever the 
                         hell you want.

               josie smiles, together they enter his office and close the 
               door.
