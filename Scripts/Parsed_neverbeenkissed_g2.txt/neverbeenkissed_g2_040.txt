               int. gus's office - same

               gus speaks into his phone, knitting frantically.

                                     gus
                         geller, i got your message. what 
                         the hell kind of story are you 
                         pitching?!

               josie smiles awkwardly at aldys, covering the phone.

                                     josie
                         it's my dad. he worries.
                              (into phone)
                         hi, dad. i miss you too.

                                     gus
                         you're a sick puppy, geller.

               josie indicates to aldys she'll be right back and walks to 
               the back of the restaurant by the pay phones.

                                     josie
                              (into the phone)
                         it's an expose on cafeteria food.

                                     gus
                         and you're leading with the terrible 
                         truth about cole slaw?!

                                     josie
                         well, the bulk of it will be about 
                         the pimento loaf--

                                     gus
                         geller...you wanna be a reporter? 
                         take a look at what sells! sex 
                         scandals. bribery. people jumping 
                         off buildings. so unless a kid 
                         just killed himself because he was 
                         being paid to have sex with the 
                         school mascot in a big vat of this 
                         cole slaw, you got nothing!

               gus slams down his phone.

                                     josie
                              (into a dead phone)
                         you didn't taste the pimento loaf.

               she looks back to the table where aldys is dividing the 
               check.
