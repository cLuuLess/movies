               int. chicago sun times bullpen -- day

               packed with office workers. bustling with activity. the 
               camera searches the crowd.

                                     josie (v.o.)
                         told you. i'm over there.

               the camera swings to josie entering. rhoda, a young copy 
               assistant, tails her, pen and paper in hand.

                                     rhoda
                         theater--

                                     josie
                         standard american calls for "er". 
                         standard british is "re". so go 
                         for "er", unless you're a pompous 
                         american, then go for british.

               josie keeps negotiating the maze, leaving rhoda in her 
               wake.

                                     rhoda
                         no. theater. last night. we were 
                         supposed to go, remember?

               josie stops at a desk where merkin burns, officious office 
               assistant, is talking on the phone. he picks his nose with 
               abandon as he talks, ignoring josie.

                                     merkin
                              (into phone)
                         no way. no way. no way. ech, hold 
                         on.
                              (to josie)
                         what.

                                     josie
                         messages?

               merkin removes his finger from his nose and uses it to 
               pick up a pink message. he holds it out to josie. disgusted, 
               she takes it by one corner.

                                     merkin
                              (into phone)
                         seriously? no way. no way--

               josie's still standing there.

                                     merkin
                         what?

                                     josie
                         merkin, do you think we could get 
                         some more yellow highlighters? i 
                         checked the box and we're--

               merkin swivels his chair 180 degrees so his back is to 
               josie and continues with his phone call.

                                     merkin
                              (back into phone)
                         okay, i'm back, so--

               josie sighs, walks to her door. it's marked with a lopsided 
               nameplate: josie geller, copy editor. she adjusts the plate 
               so it's perfectly straight.
