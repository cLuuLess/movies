               a banner above reads "presidential fitness testing this 
               week." fifteen senior girls, including josie, in matching 
               green and yellow polyester gym clothes do sprints up and-
               down the basketball court. josie looks like she's about to 
               die. ms. brown yells as she passes.

                                     ms. brown
                         move it geller! move it! move it!

               josie stops, grabs the woman by the shoulders.

                         sprints, cause if you don't you 
                         fail. and if you fail gym, you're 
                         never getting into college!
