               int. aldys' car - night

               aldys drives, josie has shotgun and tyke, aldys' nine-year-
               old sister, is in back. they all hold double-scooped cones 
               and they all sing free to be you and me at full voice.

                                     tyke
                         see, aren't you guys glad you took 
                         a break from that denominator stuff. 
                         i mean, you shouldn't be spending 
                         your saturday night studying the 
                         whole time.

                                     aldys
                         we should be spending it thinking 
                         of how we can better serve your 
                         baby-sitting needs?

                                     tyke
                         they pull up at a red light, next 
                         to an abandoned drive-in. josie 
                         peers in, and sees a big group of 
                         kids, standing around a bonfire 
                         drinking beers, talking, a few 
                         making out. she opens her window, 
                         sticks her head out, and tries to 
                         get a better look.

                                     josie
                         what's that?

                                     aldys
                         that's the old drive-in. they call 
                         it "the court". now it's just a 
                         continuous party for guy's group.

               angle on: gibby and kristen talking by a car.

                                     aldys
                         sometimes i wonder what they talk 
                         about.

                                     josie
                         yeah, i know.

                                     aldys
                         i mean, what if they just stupid 
                         to hide the fact that they're 
                         actually brainiacs with super powers 
                         and they're plotting to take over 
                         the world and make my life hell 
                         until i die?

               angle on: the cool girls.

                                     gibby
                         no. it's lather, rinse, repeat.

               angle back on: aldys and josie

               suddenly, guy pokes his head in, startling everyone.

                                     guy
                         wow, if it isn't alpo. coming out 
                         to sniff some hydrants?

               josie is frozen, but not aldys.

                                     aldys
                         oh, guy, you on a little break 
                         from having an original thought? 
                         ooops, i forgot, that's all the 
                         time.

               tyke gets it, and laughs. guy doesn't get it at all.

                                     guy
                         you guys aren't seriously trying 
                         to hang out at the court?

                                     aldys
                         oooh, cheap wine coolers and a 
                         fire in a trashcan. where do i 
                         sign up?

                                     guy
                         and stay away from prom.

                                     aldys
                         last i checked--this was still a 
                         free country.

                                     tyke
                              (singing)
                         there's a land that i see, where 
                         the children are free-

               guy's right in aldys' face, leaning over josie. aldys starts 
               to drive away. guy keeps his head in the window while he 
               runs alongside the car.

                                     guy
                         look, geek, why don't you just go 
                         home and play with your calculator. 
                         figure out how many lifetimes it 
                         will take you to get cool.

               guy stops running, and the car continues down the street.
