               int. josie's apartment -- night

               we pan around the neatest and quietest walk-up you've ever 
               seen. lots of books on shelves.

               we find josie sitting at her small table putting the 
               finishing touches on a needlepoint pillow. she turns it 
               over and we see it says: "love". she holds up the final 
               product to a terrarium, lookup up at her two turtles.

                                     josie
                         there. what d'you think, guys? 
                         where should it go?

               josie looks around the living room.

                                     josie
                         hmm.
                              (she pretends to 
                              listen to the 
                              turtles.)
                         what's that? bedroom? great idea!

               she walks into the bedroom with the pillow.
