               int. den - night

               rob, in boxers, a dress shirt, and socks is filling flasks 
               with vodka. josie comes in the door wearing a lovely 
               elizabethan gown. she looks absolutely beautiful.

                                     rob
                         wow, josie- you look really-

                                     josie
                              (hopeful)
                         rufus?

                                     rob
                         yes. exactly. major rufus.

                                     josie
                         thanks. and what are -

                                     rob
                         duh. tom cruise. "risky business".

               he puts on his black wayfarer sunglasses, and does the 
               famous slide into the living room. josie laughs.

                                     josie
                         rob--thanks. for everything. this 
                         is really happening. i never thought--

                                     rob
                         i know.

               rob smiles and exits.

               josie nervously checks her reflection in the t.v. - just 
               like she did eight years ago. she takes a deep breath, and 
               goes out.
