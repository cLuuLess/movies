               int. josie's apartment building - hallway - later

               josie, still in the prom dress, rounds the corner of her 
               apartment hallway and sees rob, still in his risky business 
               get-up, slumped in front of the door.

                                     rob
                         josie, finally. i just wanted to 
                         come over and make sure you're 
                         okay.

                                     josie
                         really?

               he gets up. he's not happy.

                                     rob
                         no- not really, josie. not really. 
                         how could you do that to me?  i 
                         helped you. i got you everything 
                         you wanted. and how do you repay 
                         me- you blow everything two days 
                         before pro scouts come to see me 
                         play. once they had seen me really 
                         play- they wouldn't have given a 
                         shit about my age.

                                     josie
                         wasn't even thinking about-

                                     rob
                         no, you weren't. don't you realize 
                         the only time i was really happy 
                         in the last five years was when i 
                         was playing ball with those guys?

                                     josie
                         i-

                                     rob
                         no, shut up, josie. just shut up.

               he storms off.
