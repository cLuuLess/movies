               int. science classroom - day

               on the walls are safe sex posters. on the front desk, 
               pamphlets on sexually transmitted diseases share space 
               with plastic biology cross-section models of male and female 
               reproductive organs.

               sam stands in front of his english class, impatiently 
               looking at his watch. josie looks up from her desk, sees 
               anita waving wildly from the other side of the glass door. 
               josie's eyes widen, she starts to make "get out of here" 
               movements. sam notices josie and follows her gaze to anita. 
               he opens the door, speaks sotto to anita.

                                     sam
                         hi. you're here for the sex talk?

                                     anita
                              (happily taken aback)
                         well. i like a man who gets to the 
                         point.

                                     sam
                         you're pam?

                                     anita
                              (frisky)
                         if you say so.

               sam turns to the class.

                                     sam
                         welcome juniors and seniors, this 
                         is pam kitterman. she's our district 
                         health counselor. she's here to 
                         lead our sex discussion.

               he ushers a surprised anita to the front of the room. josie 
               reacts.

                                     anita
                         i am? oh, i am. hi. okay. sex. 
                         yes, well, sex. what's to say 
                         really, y'know? you like a guy, 
                         you do it. sometimes he calls. 
                         sometimes he doesn't.

               anita leans into josie, talks sotto.

                                     anita
                              (whispering)
                         hi!

                                     josie
                              (also whispering)

               what are you doing here?!

                                     anita
                         i had a lunch break so i thought 
                         i'd come by and see you. your 
                         teacher is a fox!
                              (then normal voice 
                              to josie)
                         why don't we discuss that after 
                         class. but the burning is totally 
                         normal.
                              (looking at watch)
                         oh look. class is over already.

                                     sam
                         i thought this was a 45-minute 
                         seminar.

                                     anita
                         right. right.

               anita walks back to the front of the classroom.

                                     anita
                         okay, sex. let's see. sex is really 
                         fun.
                              (off josie's look)
                         when you're old enough. which none 
                         of you are, trust me i should know 
                         cuz when you lose it to some guy 
                         named junior with really bad breath 
                         in the back of a van at a guns and 
                         roses concert you're gonna wish 
                         you listened to your mom when she 
                         said, y'know, no one's gonna want 
                         to buy the whole friggin ice cream 
                         truck when you're handing out the 
                         popsicles for free.

               there's a deafening silence. the kids are amazed.

                                     anita
                         okay. any questions?
