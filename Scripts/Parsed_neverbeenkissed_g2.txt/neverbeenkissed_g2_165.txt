                         high school- going through it the 
                         first time- helped make me who i 
                         am. but going there a second time 
                         made me see that who i am is o.k. 
                         i always wanted to be "in", but 
                         seven years later, when they finally 
                         opened the door, i somehow gained 
                         the confidence to stay outside, 
                         firmly, happily.
