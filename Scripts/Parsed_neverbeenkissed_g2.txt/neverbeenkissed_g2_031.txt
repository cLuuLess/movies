               int. high school hallway - later

               josie approaches her locker. she can't get to it because a 
               couple is busy making out against it.

               a girl's voice comes over the loudspeaker. she's completely 
               ignored.

                                     girl's voice
                         hi. this is sydney, student body 
                         president!  okay, first. bad news-
                         the' district didn't allocate enough 
                         funds, so as of this afternoon, 
                         there will be no music department. 
                         now, about prom--

               the entire hallway freezes. the couple breaks their clinch 
               and looks up. silence. josie is amazed.

                                     sydneys voice
                         voting on prom theme has been 
                         completed. and the theme is--

               cu on expectant faces.

                                     sydneys voice
                         the millennium!

               pandemonium. kids cheer, gasp. one girl faints.

               the crowd surges again. josie, caught in the flow, doesn't 
               notice a locker door flinging open. she smashes her face 
               right into it. everyone, including guy, turns and laughs. 
               even some denominators.

                                                                 cut to:

               cu: a cafeteria tray

               moves down the food line. it's piled with unidentifiable 
               foods and three glasses of fluorescent red punch. hands 
               pull the tray out of the frame. into frame comes another 
               tray, this one bearing a perfectly arranged place setting 
               with three celery sticks on a plate. widen to reveal:
