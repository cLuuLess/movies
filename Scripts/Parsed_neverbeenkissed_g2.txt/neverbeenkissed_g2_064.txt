               josie is standing, reading from her paper. sam is rapt.

                         and so it is rosalind, in disguise, 
                         who is best able to see through 
                         the disguises of others. to say to 
                         phebe, "mistress, know thy self," 
                         to look at love from every angle, 
                         and to realize, finally, that she 
                         is in love with orlando--

               the bell rings. class is over. josie puts her stuff away 
               and starts to follow the cool girls out.

                                     josie
                         hey guys, wait up--

               the girls keep moving. sam stops josie.

                                     sam
                         hey, josie, hold on.
                              (then)
                         you've been hiding something from 
                         me.

                                     josie
                         oh i don't think so.

                                     sam
                         your writing. it's amazing, josie. 
                         you're really talented. and far 
                         less depressing than dorothy parker.

                                     josie
                         thank you.

                                     sam
                         so what are you thinking for 
                         college?

                                     josie
                         college. haven't really thought 
                         about it.

                                     sam
                         that's crazy. i'll get you some 
                         applications.

                                     josie
                         oh no no no no no. see, my family, 
                         we don't go to college.
                              (beat)
                         we just go right into sheep herding.

                                     sam
                         josie you owe it to yourself to 
                         go. for your writing. you're a 
                         natural.

                                     josie
                         thanks. wow. that's--really nice 
                         to hear.

                                     sam
                         josie, you're different. when you 
                         speak in class, i can tell--you 
                         actually feel the words--
                              (touching heart)
                         in here. they're alive. like-eurdora 
                         welty talked about the word it 
                         moon"? how for her it was like a 
                         concord grape. "that grandpa took 
                         off his vine and gave to me to 
                         suck out of its skin--"

                                     sam/josie
                         it --and swallow whole."

               they both take a breath in. look away from each other.
