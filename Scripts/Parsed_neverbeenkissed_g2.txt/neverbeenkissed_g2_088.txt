               int. high school hallway - (present) - day

               homeroom has just gotten out, and the halls are packed 
               with kids. josie is running full speed, trying to negotiate 
               around lots of kids, in her frantic-race for the door. 
               kids still point and stare.

               she bangs into some freshmen, gets whacked by a book bag, 
               slides some banners that kids are painting - but she won't 
               slow down.

               just as she's almost at the doors to the school, the big 
               wooden door to the front office opens. josie can't stop. a 
               figure emerges, but before josie can even see who it is, 
               she slams into it and goes down. she bangs her head on the 
               hard linoleum floor.
