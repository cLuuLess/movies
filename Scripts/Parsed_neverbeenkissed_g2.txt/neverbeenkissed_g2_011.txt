               int. josie's office - minutes later

               josie is so excited she can hardly speak to anita.

                                     josie
                         it's finally happening, anita! i'm 
                         going to write!

               anita looks concerned.

                                     josie
                         my own undercover feature - "written 
                         by josie geller".

                                     anita
                         jos - maybe you should turn it 
                         down.

               a beat. josie's face falls.

                                     josie
                         you don't think i can do it.

                                     anita
                         no - it's just a lot of pressure 
                         for your first piece, that's all. 
                         i mean, it's not a half-page 
                         article, it's a major undercover 
                         piece, jos. look what rigfort did 
                         to dutton - and that guy's his 
                         cousin!

               gus enters.

                                     gus
                         don't worry, i'll straighten all 
                         this out.

                                     josie
                         but i don't want it straightened 
                         out.

                                     gus
                         geller, this is way out of your 
                         league.

               josie takes in anita and gus.

                                     josie
                         okay, just so i'm clear here -- 
                         neither of you think i can do this.

                                     anita
                         jos, that's not what we're --

                                     josie
                         anita, when you wanted to seduce 
                         the guy in the mailroom and you 
                         didn't think you could learn spanish 
                         fast enough, who quizzed you on 
                         your verbs?

               anita looks down, chastened.

                                     anita
                         senorita josie.

                                     josie
                         and gus - when you picked up 
                         knitting, who showed you how to 
                         hold the needles?

                                     gus
                              (sotto)
                         you did.

                                     anita
                              (to gus)
                         you knit?

                                     josie
                         so, this is my chance.

               a beat.

                                     gus
                         i'm not holding your job for you, 
                         geller.

               josie jumps up and down and hugs gus, who is clearly 
               uncomfortable.

                                     gus
                         don't make me send you the memo on 
                         hugging in the workplace.

               josie smiles. gus exits.

                                     anita
                         i do believe in you, jos. anything 
                         you need, i'll help you out.

               josie sits, motions to the brown paper bag.

                                     josie
                         you can start by handing me that 
                         bag.

               anita does. josie sticks it over her face, flips her head 
               between her knees and starts hyperventilating again.

               close up on rob, wearing his tiki post outfit. he shakes 
               his head.

                                     rob
                         no. uh, uh.

               pull out to reveal him standing with josie on the sidewalk 
               in front of -
