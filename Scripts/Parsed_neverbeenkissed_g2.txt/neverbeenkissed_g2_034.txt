               int. cafeteria - same (present day)

               josie shakes off the vision and stares out at the crowded 
               cafeteria. she sees kirsten, kristen and gibby, steels 
               herself, and decides to approach.

               kirsten is eating a bran muffin.

                                     kristen
                         kirsten, that bran muffin has like 
                         75 fat grams.

                                     kirsten
                         nah uh.

                                     gibby
                         yeah, i read this thing that one 
                         bran muffin can be like two bran 
                         muffins sometimes.

               kirsten pushes the muffin away.

                                     kirsten
                         god. food is so confusing.

                                     josie
                              (to kirsten)
                         hi kristen.

                                     kirsten
                         it's kirsten.

               josie plops herself down with these girls, and takes a 
               spiral pad out of her big knapsack. in the process, she 
               manages to spill her chocolate milk all over her white 
               jeans.

                                     josie
                         that'll teach me to wear white 
                         after labor day.

                                     gibby
                         umm- i don't think you're supposed 
                         to wear white jeans after 1983.

               they all laugh. josie fakes a laugh, too.

                                     josie
                         right, right.

               josie picks up her notepad and her pen.

                                     josie
                         so - tell me about yourselves.

               they all just stare at josie in disgust. guy approaches 
               their table.

                                     guy
                         i'm guy.

               guy looks at josie. he's beautiful. she's flustered.

                                     josie
                         yes you are. a guy. guy. quite a 
                         guy. oh my. look at that--i rhymed.
                              (beat)
                         yikes.
                              (beat)
                         bikes!

                                     guy
                              (very serious)
                         are you in special ed?

               josie stands up, grabs her bag and her chocolate milk -

                                     josie
                         bye. guy. others.

               she leaves the cafeteria, passing a-couple of denominators.

                                     josie
                              (to herself)
                         aaaah! how old am i?

                                     denominator #1
                         approximately six thousand three 
                         hundred and fifty days old-subject 
                         to adjustment for month of birth.

               this is very funny denominator humor- to the denominators. 
               josie leaves the cafeteria.
