               int. club/delloser hall - night

               josie enters the small, smoky club. she wears what she 
               considers to be her "hip concert outfit," an outfit that 
               completely clashes with the rasta wear of the other concert 
               goers. -she reaches the bouncer.

                                     bouncer
                         you drinking?

               josie notices the two stoners from school standing behind 
               her in line.

                                     josie
                         i am not 21. i am only seventeen 
                         and i still attend high school.

               the bouncer stamps her hand. she looks down at her hand.

               we cu on her hand, reading delloser.

               she enters as the two stoners approach the bouncer.

                                     bouncer
                         two of you?

               a beat as the stoners look at each other, realizing...

                                     stoner 1
                              (to stoner 2)
                         oh, dude--

               and they run out of the club.
