               int. cafeteria - day

               josie, pulling the perfect tray down the cafeteria line. 
               she reaches some awful-looking cole slaw in a big vat. a 
               cafeteria guy in a plastic cap hovers above it.

                                     josie
                              (to cafeteria guy)
                         excuse me. what's in the cole slaw?

               the cafeteria guy hauls an industrial-size plastic tub 
               onto the, counter and turns it-so josie can read the label: 
               "kole slaw food."  josie wrinkles her nose. she moves on 
               to the cash register.

                                     cashier
                         that'll be twelve ninety-five.

                                     josie
                              (stunned)

               oh my gosh. wow. that's... pricey.

                                     cashier
                         that's real meat in the ham 
                         sandwich.

               josie turns to a girl in line behind her.

                                     josie
                         boy--that's a lot of bread for 
                         that bread!

               the girl rolls her eyes, reaches past josie to grab a 
               mustard bottle. josie turns with her tray toward the room.

                                                                 cut to:
