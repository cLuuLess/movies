               ext. a house - morning

               the sun times lies on the front mat. the door opens; we 
               see a pair of bare feet. a hand reaches down to grab the 
               paper. we pan up to reveal sam in all his depressed glory--
               sweats, unshaven, bleary eyed.

                                     josie (v.o.)
                         i received an assignment, my first 
                         as a reporter, to enroll in high 
                         school as a student, to gain some 
                         insight into kids today. 
                         understandably, returning to high 
                         school was my worst nightmare.

               sam shuts the door.
