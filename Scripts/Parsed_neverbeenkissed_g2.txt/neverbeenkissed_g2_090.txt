               rob is bent over josie. she rubs her eyes.

                                     josie
                         i've been in a horrible accident. 
                         this is a coma-induced nightmare.

                                     rob
                         no. josie, this is real.

               she looks up.

                                     josie
                         oh my god! that's worse!

               rob leans in and whispers to josie.

                                     rob
                         i just registered.

               rob whips out his fake id and shows it to her.

                                     rob
                              (proudly)
                         manufactured at the tiki post.

               rob helps josie up.

                                     josie
                         are you crazy?! you can't do this.

                                     rob
