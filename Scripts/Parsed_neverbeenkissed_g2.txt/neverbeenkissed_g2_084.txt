               int. gus's office - day

               a group is watching gus's tv, including burns (the hair 
               plug man) and howard (arm casts). they are slack-jawed in 
               shock. we hear o.s. the sounds of josie vomiting. gus shakes 
               his head sadly.

                                     gus
                         it's like the all-humiliation 
                         network.

               they all nod in agreement.
