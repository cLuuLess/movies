               int. high school hallway - same

               josie walks down the hall, purposefully - she is on a 
               mission. groups of kids stop and stare at her, but this 
               time, josie doesn't even notice.

               as josie rounds a corner, she comes face to face with guy, 
               who is at his locker. he looks at her. she smiles. and now 
               it is guy that is nervous. he drops a pile of papers, tries 
               awkwardly to gather them. josie looks at him - and for the 
               first time we see it register on her face - this guy is 
               just a seventeen- year-old kid.

                                     guy
                         uh, hey, umm--ms. geller. this is 
                         totally embarrassing but my mom, 
                         she's all worried about me getting 
                         a job after graduation. she wanted 
                         me to ask you about like, an 
                         internship for me, at the sun times?

               josie smiles big.

                                     josie
                         i'll do what i can. and tell your 
                         mom not to worry - you'll do o.k.

               josie continues down the hall.
