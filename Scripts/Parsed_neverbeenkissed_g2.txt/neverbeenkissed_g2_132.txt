               int. country club Â– continous

               we follow josie and the group into the prom. the place 
               looks amazing. lights, ice sculptures, champagne fountains. 
               we pan down the buffet.

               a boy dressed as a jar of peanut butter and his date, jelly, 
               are getting food. peanut butter turns away from the buffet 
               and bumps into a girl dressed as a chocolate bar.

                                     peanut butter
                         oh, sorry.

               there's a magical beat as they smile at each other.

                                     chocolate bar
                         that's okay--

               jelly looks on, chagrined.

               we reach two older gentlemen in tuxes who carry clipboards 
               and wear big buttons that read: national prom judge. they 
               contemplate the ice sculpture.

                         it's deft and unique without being 
                         derivative.

                                     judge #2
                              (looking off)
                         hey! pigs in blankets!

               and he runs off.
