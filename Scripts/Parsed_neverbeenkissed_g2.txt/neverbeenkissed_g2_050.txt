               int. high school hallway - same

               aldys and josie head out of class and down the hallway 
               towards their lockers. josie stops in front of hers where 
               the makeout couple continues their clinch, blocking her 
               locker. josie pauses frustrated as sydney's voice comes 
               over the loudspeaker.

                                     sydney (o.s.)
                         hey guys! bad news--chem wing is 
                         closed. the hazardous materials 
                         crew is on the way. now, about 
                         prom.

               the entire hallway stops to listen. the makeout couple 
               stop making out.

                                     sydney (o.s.)
                         please join a committee--because 
                         we are going to kick northglen's 
                         butt and make millennium the best 
                         prom ever!

               the hallway erupts in cheers. josie makes a move to go for 
               her locker. the makeout couple are faster. they're back in 
               their clinch, blocking josie again.

                         southglen south competes every 
                         year for best prom, and usually 
                         they win. we denominators don't 
                         even go to prom. -but to everyone 
                         else it's huge.

                                     josie
                         aldys, don't miss your prom--it 
                         only happens once.

                                     aldys
                         this one has been so hyped. we're 
                         tied for most wins with northglen 
                         north. this year's winner will 
                         determine the winner of the century.  
                         the theme is everything. so whatever 
                         southglen picks has to be totally 
                         unique--
