               int. gus's office - afternoon

               anita sits on gus's desk, watches the last scene on gus's 
               tv, engrossed. gus walks in and stops the tape.

                                     gus
                         showtime's over! move-it! back to 
                         work!

               anita climbs off his desk.

                                     anita
                         gus, have you ever been in love?

                                     gus
                         leave.

                                     anita
                         oh give it up, gus. i'm just making 
                         conversation.

                                     gus
                         love. who knows what that is? now 
                         circulation, deadlines, those i 
                         understand.

                                     anita
                         you should go out every now and 
                         then, gus; with some new ties the 
                         girls would be all over you.

               gus stares down at his tie. but he's smiling--a little.

                                     gus
                         go away. i have enough work here 
                         to last me all night.

                                     anita
                         listen, i don't have any plans--
                         you want some help?

                                     gus
                         no roger from op/ed?

                                     anita
                         nope.

               they share a smile.
