               josie and the girls are leaving. guy catches up to them 
               and taps josie on the shoulder.

                                     guy
                         so--you going to the party at rob's?

               josie's taken aback. the girls notice guy's interest.

                         rob's?

                         yeah, you gonna be there?

               josie stumbles on a step guy immediately reaches out to 
               steady her. she melts. she can't even speak, so she just 
               nods.

                                     guy
