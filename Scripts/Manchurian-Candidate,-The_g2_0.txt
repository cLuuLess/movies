                      the manchurian candidate

                                by
                          dean georgaris









    based on the novel by richard condon

               before desert storm, we were on a routine
               recon inside iraqi-controlled terrain,
               assessing troop strength for what saddam
               hussein promised to be the mother of all
               wars ... but turned out to be just a
               little warm up for the whomping he got a
               few years later.
