ext.  chase hotel - night

a black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the
police cruisers.

agent smith and agent brown get out of the car.

they wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night.  they
are also always hardwired; small secret service earphones
in one ear, the cord coiling back into their shirt
collars.

                         agent smith
          lieutenant?

                         lieutenant
          oh shit.

                         agent smith
          lieutenant, you were given specific
          orders --

                         lieutenant
          i'm just doing my job.  you gimme
          that juris-my-dick-tion and you can
          cram it up your ass.

                         agent smith
          the orders were for your
          protection.

the lieutenant laughs.

                         lieutenant
          i think we can handle one little
          girl.

agent smith nods to agent brown as they start toward the
hotel.

                         lieutenant
          i sent two units.  they're bringing
          her down now.

                         agent smith
          no, lieutenant, your men are already
          dead.
