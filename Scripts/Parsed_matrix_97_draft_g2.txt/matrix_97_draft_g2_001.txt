fade in:

on computer screen

so close it has no boundaries.

a blinking cursor pulses in the electronic darkness like a
heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath the
derma of black-neon glass.

a phone begins to ring, we hear it as though we were
making the call.  the cursor continues to throb,
relentlessly patient, until --

                         man (v.o.)
          yeah?

data now slashes across the screen, information flashing
faster than we can read:  "call trans opt:  received.
2-19-96 13:24:18  rec:log>."

                         woman (v.o.)
          is everything in place?

the man is silent.  on screen:  "trace program:  running."

we listen to the phone conversation as though we were on a
third line.  the man's name is cypher.  the woman,
trinity.

                         trinity (woman) (v.o.)
          i said, is everything in place?

the entire screen fills with racing columns of numbers.
shimmering like green-electric rivers, they rush at a 10-
digit phone number in the top corner.

                         cypher (man) (v.o.)
          you weren't supposed to relieve me.

                         trinity (v.o.)
          i know but i felt like taking a
          shift.

the area code is identified.  the first three numbers
suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.

                         cypher (v.o.)
          you like him, don't you?  you like
          watching him?

we begin moving toward the screen, closing in as each
digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like the
wheels of a slot machine.

                         trinity (v.o.)
          don't be ridiculous.

                         cypher (v.o.)
          we're going to kill him.  do you
          understand that?  he's going to die
          just like the others.

                         trinity (v.o.)
          morpheus believes he is the one.

only two thin digits left.

                         cypher (v.o.)
          do you?

                         trinity (v.o.)
          i... it doesn't matter what i
          believe.

                         cypher (v.o.)
          you don't, do you?

                         trinity (v.o.)
          if you have something to say, i
          suggest you say it to morpheus.

                         cypher (v.o.)
          i intend to, believe me.  someone
          has to.

the final number pops into place --

                         trinity (v.o.)
          did you hear that?

                         cypher (v.o.)
          hear what?

on screen:  "trace complete. call origin:  #312-555-0690."

                         trinity (v.o.)
          are you sure this line is clean?

                         cypher (v.o.)
          yeah, 'course i'm sure.

we move, still closing, the electric hum of the green
numbers growing into an ominous roar.

                         trinity (v.o.)
          i better go.

she hangs up as we pass through the numbers, entering the
nether world of the computer screen.

suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find
ourselves in --
