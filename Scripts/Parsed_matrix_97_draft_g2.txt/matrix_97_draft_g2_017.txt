int.  interrogation room

close on a camera monitor; wide angle view of a white room
where neo is sitting at a table alone.

we move into the monitor, entering the room as if the
monitor was a window.

at the same moment, the door opens and the agents enter.
agent smith sits down across from neo.  a thick manila
envelope slaps down on the table between them.

neo glances at the name on the file: "anderson, thomas a."

                         agent smith
          as you can see, we've had our eye on
          you for some time now, mr. anderson.

he opens the file.  paper rattle marks the silence as he
flips several pages.  neo cannot tell if he is looking at
the file or at him.

                         agent smith
          it seems that you have been living
          two lives.  in one life, you are
          thomas a. anderson, program writer
          for a respectable software company.
          you have a social security number,
          you pay your taxes and you help your
          landlady carry out her garbage.

the pages continue to turn.

                         agent smith
          the other life is lived in computers
          where you go by the hacker alias
          neo, and are guilty of virtually
          every computer crime we have a law
          for.

neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.

                         agent smith
          one of these lives has a future.
          one of them does not.

he closes the file.

                         agent smith
          i'm going to be as forthcoming as i
          can be, mr. anderson.  you are here
          because we need your help.

he removes his sunglasses, his eyes are unnatural ice-
blue.

                         agent smith
          we know that you have been contacted
          by a certain individual.  a man who
          calls himself morpheus.  whatever
          you think you know about this man is
          irrelevant to the fact that he is
          wanted for acts of terrorism in more
          countries than any other man in the
          world.  he is considered by many
          authorities to be the most dangerous
          man alive.

he leans closer.

                         agent smith
          my colleagues believe that i am
          wasting my time with you but i
          believe you want to do the right
          thing.  it is obvious that you are
          an intelligent man, mr. anderson,
          and that you are interested in the
          future.  that is why i believe you
          are ready to put your past mistakes
          behind you and get on with your
          life.

neo stares to match his stare.

                         agent smith
          we are willing to wipe the slate
          clean, to give you a fresh start and
          all we are asking in return is your
          cooperation in bringing a known
          terrorist to justice.

neo nods to himself.

                         neo
          yeah.  wow.  that sounds like a real
          good deal.  but i think i have a
          better one.  how about i give you
          the finger --

he does.

                         neo
          and you can cram that file up your
          secret service sphincter.

agent smith puts his glasses back on.

                         agent smith
          you disappoint me, mr. anderson.

                         neo
          you can't scare me with gestapo
          crap.  i know my rights.  i want my
          phone call!

agent smith smiles.

                         agent smith
          and tell me, mr. anderson, what good
          is a phone call if you are unable to
          speak?

the question unnerves neo and strangely he begins to feel
the muscles in his jaw tighten.

the standing agents snicker, watching neo's confusion grow
into panic.

neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly
seal shut, melding into each other until all traces of his
mouth are gone.

wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents
restrain him, holding him in the chair.

                         agent smith
          you are going to help us, mr.
          anderson, whether you want to or
          not.

smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.

from a case taken out of his suit coat, smith removes a
long, fiber-optic wire tap.

neo struggles helplessly as smith dangles the wire over
his exposed abdomen.  horrified, he watches as the
electronic device animates, becoming an organic creature
that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.

thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into neo's
navel.  he bucks wildly as smith drops the creature which
looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --

-- before it begins to borrow, its tall thrashing as it
worms its way inside.
