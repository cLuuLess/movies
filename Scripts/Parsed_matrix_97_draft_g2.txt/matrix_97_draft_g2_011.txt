int.  apartment

an older apartment; a series of halls connects a chain of
small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy casements.

smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there
are.

dressed predominantly in black, people are everywhere,
gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like jungle
cats around a tree.

neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle of
beer, feeling completely out of place, he is about to
leave when he notices a woman staring at him.

the woman is trinity.  she walk straight up to him.

in the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against
each other to the pneumatic beat of industrial music.

                         trinity
          hello, neo.

                         neo
          how do you know that name?

                         trinity
          i know a lot about you.  i've been
          wanting to meet you for some time.

                         neo
          who are you?

                         trinity
          my name is trinity.

                         neo
          trinity?  the trinity?  the trinity
          that cracked the i.r.s. kansas city
          d-base?

                         trinity
          that was a long time ago.

                         neo
          gee-zus.

                         trinity
          what?

                         neo
          i just thought... you were a guy.

                         trinity
          most guys do.

neo is a little embarrassed.

                         neo
          do you want to go somewhere and
          talk?

                         trinity
          no.  it's safe here and i don't have
          much time.

the music is so loud they must stand very close, talking
directly into each other's ear.

                         neo
          that was you on my computer?

she nods.

                         neo
          how did you do that?

                         trinity
          right now, all i can tell you, is
          that you are in danger.  i brought
          you here to warn you.

                         neo
          of what?

                         trinity
          they're watching you, neo.

                         neo
          who is?

                         trinity
          please.  just listen.  i know why
          you're here, neo.  i know why you
          left your family and your friends,
          why you left your home to come to
          this city.  you're looking for him.

her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.

                         trinity
          i know because i came looking for
          the same thing, but when he found me
          he told me i wasn't really looking
          for him.  i was looking for an
          answer.

there is a hypnotic quality to her voice and neo feels the
words, like a drug, seeping into him.

                         trinity
          it's the question that brought you
          here.  you know the question just as
          i did.  it is a hacker's question.

                         neo
          what is the matrix?

                         trinity
          when i asked him, he said that no
          one could ever be told the answer to
          that question.  they have to see it
          to believe it.

she leans close, her lips almost touching his ear.

                         trinity
          the answer is out there, neo.  it's
          looking for you and it will find
          you, if you want it to.

she turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall
of bodies.

a sound rises steadily, growing out of the music, pressing
in on neo until it is all he can hear as we --

                                            cut to:
