neo grudgingly strips off his t-shirt.

                         trinity
          lie back.

trinity sets the device over neo's stomach its three
corners resting on the points of his pelvis and sternum.
she then guides a mounted cylindrical probe into his navel
and squeezes a hand pump a few times to form a tight seal.

                         neo
          what is this thing?

                         trinity
          we think you're bugged.  try to
          relax.

she turns a dial and the machine bears down on neo's
midsection, the cylinder sucking hard at his stomach.

neo screams, squinting in pain as trinity watches the
needle on a pressure gauge climb steadily.

                         trinity
          come on, come on...

the machine quivers as the pressure builds higher and
higher until something finally rockets wetly out of neo's
stomach through the machine's coils.

                         trinity
          got it.

trinity shuts off the compressor, neo cradling his
stomach.

                         neo
          got what?  my spleen?

trinity lifts a glass cage at the end of the tubing.
inside the small fluke-like bug flips and squirms, its
tendrils flapping against the clear walls.

she unrolls the window and dumps it out.
