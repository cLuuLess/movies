int.  cortechs office

the main offices are along each wall, the windows
overlooking downtown.  rhineheart, the ultimate company
man, lectures neo without looking at him, typing at his
computer continuously.

neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding
outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down the surface
of the glass.

                         rhineheart
          you have a problem with authority,
          mr. anderson.  you believe that you
          are special, that somehow the rules
          do not apply to you.

he stops, glancing over his glasses at neo who turns in
time.

                         rhineheart
          obviously, you are mistaken.

his long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.

                         rhineheart
          this company is one of the top
          software companies in the world
          because every single employee
          understands that they are part of a
          whole.  thus, if an employee has a
          problem, the company has a problem.

he turns again.

                         rhineheart
          the time has come to make a choice,
          mr. anderson.  either you choose to
          be at your desk on time from this
          day forth, or you choose to find
          yourself another job.  do i make
          myself clear?

                         neo
          yes, mr. rhineheart.  perfectly
          clear.
