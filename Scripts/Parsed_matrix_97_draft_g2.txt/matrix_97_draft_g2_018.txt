int.  neo's apartment

screaming, neo bolts upright in bed.

he realizes that he is home.  was it a dream?  his mouth
is normal.  his stomach looks fine.  he starts to take a
deep, everything-is-okay breath when --

the phone rings.

it almost stops his heart.  it continues ringing, building
pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed, sucking
him in with an almost gravitational force.

he answers it, saying nothing.

                         morpheus (v.o.)
          this line is tapped so i must be
          brief.

                         neo
          the agents --

                         morpheus (v.o.)
          they got to you first, but they've
          underestimated how important you
          are.  if they knew what i know, you
          would probably be dead.

                         neo
          what do you know?

                         morpheus (v.o.)
          you're the one, neo.  you see, you
          may have spent the last few years
          looking for me, but i've spent most
          of my life looking for you.

neo feels sick.

                         morpheus (v.o.)
          do you still want to meet?

                         neo
          ... yes.

                         morpheus (v.o.)
          go the the adams street bridge.

click.  he closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done.
