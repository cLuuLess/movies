                              written by
                       andy and larry wachowski

                                                         april 8, 1999

fade in on:

dark clouds below the inky remnants of the scorched sky. we hear  wind
as we sail, like a glider, over the black atmosphere.

we dive down into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the   darker
world of  the dead  surface of  earth, the  desert of  the real.   the
rotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere. we  approach
a fissure in the earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the   increasing
buzz of multiple hovercraft  engines. blue flashes grow  in  intensity
from the fissure. radio voices,  indistinct at first, grow louder   as
we approach the fissure.

                             woman (v.o.)

           "six o'clock, 300 meters. we can't outrun 'em."

                              man (v.o.)

    "i know. can't tow this crate fast enough! we gotta ditch it!"

we hear the voices as though we're listening to cops through a  police
scanner. the woman is niobe, the captain of the lead ship, sephora.

                             niobe (v.o.)

     "can't, the core is still good. and they've got 'the one.'"

                              man (v.o.)

             "oooh, our savior. heÂ’d better be worth it."

                             niobe (v.o.)

                "shut up and make the exit. hold on!"

the azure glow  from the  fissure  is suddenly overwhelming.  a  tight
convoy  of  three  hovercraft  explode  from  the  fissure,  traveling
nearly straight up, like a   trio of massive locomotives flying   into
the sky in tight formation,  linked together by tow cables.  the  blue
glow has  been emanating  from  the  overworked flare  drives of   the
first and third hovercrafts.  between them, suspended by  tow  cables,
is the dark, scorched,  and sliced nebachanezzer. they  rocket upward,
slowing as they reach the top of the arc.

                             niobe (v.o.)

                             "woo-hoooh!"

the rush to the ground, pulling up at the last second. the neb  flails
wildly between them.

                              man (v.o.)

                        "they're still on us!"

more vehicles fly from the fissure. a massive army of squiddies  pours
up onto the surface.
