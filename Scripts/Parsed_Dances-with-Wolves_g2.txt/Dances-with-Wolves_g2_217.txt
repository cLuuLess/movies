               int. dances with wolves' lodge - day

               dances with wolves' hair is shiny. his breastplate gleams, 
               the officer's pants have been dusted and his old boots have 
               something resembling a shine. the groom is ready.

                                     wind in his hair
                         turn around...

               dances with wolves does a three-sixty.

                                     wind in his hair
                         pretty good...

               a brief silence as wind in his hair contemplates something 
               he wants to say.

                                     wind in his hair
                         you know, the man she mourned for 
                         was my best friend.

                         i didn't know that.

                                     wind in his hair
                         he was a good man. it's been hard 
                         for me. i am not the thinker kicking 
                         bird is. but i think he went away 
                         from her because you were coming. 
                         that is how i see it now.

               the sound of music and people outside distracts both men.
