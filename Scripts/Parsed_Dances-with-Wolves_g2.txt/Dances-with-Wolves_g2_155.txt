               ext. prairie - day

               there is nothing for miles.

               cisco and dunbar are walking toward us. his boots are pretty 
               worn and his striped trousers have faded to almost nothing. 
               the breastplate shines in the sun. his rifle lies in the 
               crook of his arm, indian style.

               dunbar twists around on cisco and looks back across the 
               prairie. he calls out.

                                     dunbar
                         go home.

               dunbar watches a moment to see if he's done any good, then 
               turns forward with a sour look.

                                     dunbar
                         damn him.

               dunbar makes his way through a small, grassy valley borders 
               by rolling slopes. he looks across the prairie. two socks is 
               about fifty yards out, trotting parallel to cisco and dunbar.

               exasperated dunbar pulls cisco up and slides off. two socks 
               sits, waiting and watching.
