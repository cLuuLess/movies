               ext. canyon trail - day

               dances with wolves and stands with a fist have reached the 
               head of the trail leading out of the winter camp. they have 
               just begun to ascend when a voice, calling from afar, brings 
               them to a halt. the sound echoes through the canyons, through 
               the village.

                                     wind in his hair (o.s.)
                              (calling)
                         dances with wolves...
