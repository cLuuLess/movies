               fingers are playing with a button. it appears to be the same 
               one that came off captain cargill's coat. dunbar stands atop 
               the hill, sighting across the prairie.

                         no sign of captain cargill's command. 
                         i don't know what to do. communication 
                         can only take place if i leave and i 
                         don't want to abandon my post.

               he sticks a hand in his overcoat, pulls out a piece of dried 
               meat and bites off a hunk.

               dunbar starts down the hill toward the fort. he watches the 
               horizon as he goes.
