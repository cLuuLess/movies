               ext. prairie - dusk

               the rescue party is cantering across the prairie.

                                     dances with wolves
                              (to wind in his hair)
                         we go south?

                                     wind in his hair
                         we will ride south for two days... 
                         then turn east. no one must follow.

               this doesn't seem to bother wind in his hair. but it sets 
               dances with wolves to thinking.
