               ext. river - day

               in the midst of the smoke and confusion of the battle, bauer 
               has made his way to the cover of the weeds along the river 
               bank.

               crashing through the thicket, he comes to a clearing and 
               there in the shallows, comes face to face with smiles a lot. 
               the boy is standing in the shallows holding the extra horses.

               the boy is so frightened at the sudden sight of this white 
               soldier that he doesn't move. bauer sticks his revolver into 
               smiles a lot's face and pulls the trigger. but the hammer 
               only clicks. the gun is empty.

               bauer pistol-whips the boy, knocking him to the ground and 
               grabs for the closest of the horses. but the ponies are all 
               stirred up now and starting to run down the river.

               bauer succeeds in grabbing a hunk of mane, but the horse 
               he's gotten hold of is moving too fast for him to get on. 
               but now bauer hears a bone-chilling whoop. wind in his hair 
               is coming.

               his pony plows through the water at full speed. a skullcracker 
               dangles from one hand. the warrior begins to whirl it around.

               terrified, bauer turns to run. before he can take a step, a 
               hatchet buries itself to the hilt. smiles a lot is at the 
               other end. but bauer is not through.

               his hands are around the boy's neck, choking him with his 
               last seconds of life. a larger than life wind in his hair 
               draws even and swings his club. bauer's head explodes, 
               covering smiles a lot in blood -- the sergeant's hands cannot 
               be seen.
