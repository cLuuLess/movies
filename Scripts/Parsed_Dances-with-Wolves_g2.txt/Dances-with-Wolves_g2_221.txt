               ext. prairie - day

               dances with wolves and kicking bird gallop their horses to 
               the crest of a steep hill and rein to a halt.

               down below, miles distant, is the curving line of a river. 
               but there is a section of river, directly before them, that 
               cannot be seen. it is screened by a mammoth stand of trees, 
               some of them towering a hundred feet or more.

               he glances at dances with wolves but his companion doesn't 
               see. he's staring in wonder at the great forest before him.

                                     kicking bird
                         it is said that all the animals were 
                         born here... that from here they 
                         spread over the prairies to feed all 
                         the people. even our enemies say 
                         this is a sacred place.

               they start toward the river at a walk.
