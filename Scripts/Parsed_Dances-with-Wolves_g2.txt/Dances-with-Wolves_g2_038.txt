               ext. bluff - day

               as dunbar comes over the hill, he sees the wagon has ground 
               to a stop.

               the wagon has paused at the edge of a bluff. dunbar and 
               timmons are peering into the little valley below

                                     timmons
                         not what you'd call a going concern.

               the wagon lurches over the edge of the bluff and down. we 
               see the pathetic remains of fort sedgewick.
