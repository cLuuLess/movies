               ext. prairie - dawn

               the sky is still full of thunder and lightning but in the 
               breaking dawn the storm can be seen to be lifting.

               the village is just ahead down a long slope as the gun finders 
               come into view.

               a great bolt of lightning hits just as dances with wolves 
               starts down the slope. he sees something.

                                     dances with wolves
                         wait.

               smiles a lot stops. dances with wolves squints into the feeble 
               light. he can see the outline of the village below, but 
               upriver the light is still too murky to make anything out.

               another bolt of lightning flashes. there they are. a long 
               line of horsemen crossing river a mile or so upstream from 
               the village. the pawnee.
