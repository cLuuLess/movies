               ext. village - day

               otter, worm and smiles a lot are riding in, drawn by the 
               ruckus in the village. they see the white soldier oh his 
               horse leaving the camp. they see the tumult in the village 
               and realize they are in trouble, again.

               some of the young, mounted warriors are shouting taunts at 
               the departing soldier, calling for him to come back and fight. 
               they seem set to take out after him when kicking bird suddenly 
               appears in front of their ponies.

                                     kicking bird
                         the soldier did not come to fight -- 
                         he is going away and we will let 
                         him.

               no one is going to argue with one of the band's leading men. 
               the young warriors shout a few more taunts and turn away.

               the medicine man glances after the boys who just came in. 
               each boy, confronted now by an angry father or uncle, is 
               being jerked off his pony. there's going to be discipline.

               kicking bird looks back at the lieutenant.

               dunbar's head is down and his shoulders are slumped. it is a 
               sight that makes the wheels in kicking bird's head turn.
