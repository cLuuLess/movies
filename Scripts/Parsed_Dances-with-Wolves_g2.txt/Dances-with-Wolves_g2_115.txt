               int. quarters - night

               lieutenant dunbar is asleep in the moonlight. the rumbling 
               is getting louder. it wakes him. he gropes about, lights the 
               lantern and listens to the strange, powerful sound.

               something's in the air. he holds the lantern toward the 
               ceiling. particles of dirt and dust are being shaken from 
               the roof. it's the earth that's trembling.
