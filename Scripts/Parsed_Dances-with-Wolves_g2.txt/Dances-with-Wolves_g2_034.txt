               ext. sedgewick bluff - dusk

               a solitary wolf trots along the top of a bluff overlooking 
               the river. he has two white socks running up his front legs. 
               an old jagged scar cuts across his muzzle. he's watching the 
               ruins of fort sedgewick.

               the little band of troops, all on foot, with their two lame 
               horses trailing behind are fading in the distance.
