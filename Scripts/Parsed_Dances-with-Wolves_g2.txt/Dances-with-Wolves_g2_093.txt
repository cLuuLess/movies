               ext. pony herd - day

               dunbar is skirting the edge of the herd. leaving the horses 
               behind him, the lieutenant makes his way up a gentle slope.

               a powerful vision is upon him.

               ten bears' village is rising slowly, like a curtain going 
               up. the smoke from many fires, the willow poles fanning 
               against the sky, the conical houses covered with well-used 
               hides, the horses along the river, the children, the women, 
               the men. an ancient tableau, fully alive before his eyes.
