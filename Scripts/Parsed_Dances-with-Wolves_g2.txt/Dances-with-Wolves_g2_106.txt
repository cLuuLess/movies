               several children are playing close-by as stands with a fist 
               works over a staked-out hide, scraping away the excess flesh. 
               though her arms are lined with scabs her work is methodical 
               and unforced. she seems recovered.

                         stands with a fist.

               she looks up to see the medicine man looming over her.
