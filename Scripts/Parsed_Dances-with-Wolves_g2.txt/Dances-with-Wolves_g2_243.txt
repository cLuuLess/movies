               ext. wagon - day

               dances with wolves is dozing as the wagon jolts across the 
               ground. suddenly a shot rings out. dances with wolves opens 
               his eyes.

               the wagon driver is aiming his rifle out at something on the 
               prairie. he fires again.

               dances with wolves looks over the wagon bed and sees two 
               socks. he's standing still, fifty yards away. staring in his 
               old inquisitive way at the wagon.

                                     spivey
                         lookit the stupid bastard... he ain't 
                         even runnin'.

               two shots ring out in rapid succession.

                                     bauer
                         don't shoot, i seen 'em first... 
                         it's my shot.

               sergeant bauer fires his own round. everyone has missed. 
               bauer is jamming another cartridge into the chamber.

                                     driver
                         it's my shot goddamit.

               now spivey decides to get into the act. he rises up with his 
               rifle aiming.

                                     spivey
                         you dumb sons a bitches.

               before he can fire, there's a rattling of chains. and the 
               next moment, spivey's feet are being pulled out from under 
               him by dances with wolves. his rifle fires harmlessly into 
               space.

               bauer turns from the wagon seat and slams the back of the 
               prisoner's head with the gunstock. dances with wolves falls 
               back, letting go of the shaken spivey.

               bauer smiles at spivey contemptuously.

                                     bauer
                         he mighta killed you.

               in the next instant, spivey gives dances with wolves a 
               resounding crack in the sternum with the butt of his rifle 
               and he goes down on his back.

               more shots are fired. dazedly, dances with wolves looks out 
               and sees two socks still running parallel to the wagon.

               there's another shot and then shouting.

                                     soldier 1
                         i got him...

                                     soldier 2
                         the hell you did...

                                     soldier 1
                         i got him... dead shot boys.

               spivey is still poking dances with wolves.

                                     spivey
                         you want more?... get up... get up.

                                     elgin
                         spivey!

               elgin has ridden alongside the wagon.

                                     elgin
                         i see you bash the prisoner once 
                         more and i'll put those shackles on 
                         you...

               elgin's men are headed up towards two socks when shots ring 
               out.

                                     elgin
                         you men! get back to your places.

               the camera continues over the hill to two socks' body, but 
               it is no where in sight. instead the indian war party of six 
               is waiting silently in ambush. frustrated, they will try 
               again.
