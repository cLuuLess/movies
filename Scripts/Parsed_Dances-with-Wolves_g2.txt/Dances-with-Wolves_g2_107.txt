               int. kicking bird's lodge - day

               except for kicking bird and stands with a fist, the tipi is 
               empty. they are just seating themselves at the firepit in 
               the center of the lodge. a brief silence, during which kicking 
               bird studies the girl with the bowed head.

                                     kicking bird
                         your wounds are healing well?

                                     stands with a fist
                         yes.

                                     kicking bird
                         you are happy here, with my family?

                                     stands with a fist
                         i am glad to be here. i am missing 
                         my husband.

                                     kicking bird
                         perhaps you will marry again when 
                         the time is right.

                                     stands with a fist
                         perhaps.

               kicking bird is leading up to something and stands with a 
               fist fears it. she keeps her head bowed.

                                     kicking bird
                         we have word from many places that 
                         the whites are...

               kicking bird stops himself, he knows this must be hard. she 
               brings her green eyes to bear on the medicine man, waiting 
               to hear more.

                                     kicking bird
                         they are coming into everyone's 
                         country. they will soon be in ours i 
                         think. this white man who lives at 
                         the old soldier fort, the one who 
                         calls himself loo ten tant... i have 
                         visited him and i believe his heart 
                         is a good one. he knows things about 
                         the whites which we do not.

               he pauses letting this sink in.

                                     stands with a fist
                         i am afraid of the man at the fort.

                                     kicking bird
                         he is only one man.

                                     stands with a fist
                         i am afraid that he will tell some 
                         whites that i am here. i am afraid 
                         that they will try to take me away.

                                     kicking bird
                         every warrior in camp would fight 
                         them if they tried.

               she is not much reassured by this. in the way of a defeatist 
               she lowers her eyes once more.

                                     kicking bird
                         i cannot make the white man talk. 
                         loo ten tant does not know sioux.

               kicking bird waits. still she does not raise her head.

                                     kicking bird
                         you have a certain medicine which no 
                         other sioux -- man or woman -- has.

                                     stands with a fist
                         it has been a long time since i made 
                         the talk.

                                     kicking bird
                         i do not ask this for myself... i 
                         ask this for all our people.

                                     stands with a fist
                         it's dead in me.

                                     kicking bird
                         i want you to try and remember the 
                         the word.

                                     stands with a fist
                         i don't know how.

                                     kicking bird
                         you don't want to know.

               this outburst shocks stands with a fist, she runs out of the 
               lodge.
