               ext. winter camp - dawn

               carrying the pipe he made, dances with wolves walks through 
               the village. suddenly he stops. kicking bird is standing in 
               the middle of the empty avenue.

               like gunfighters, the two men approach each other at a slow 
               and deliberate walk.

               gradually they realize that each has selected the same parting 
               gift. it's heartbreaking. kicking bird tries to cover with a 
               casual question, but it's all fake.

                                     kicking bird
                         you've finished your pipe? how does 
                         it smoke?

                                     dances with wolves
                         i'm told it smokes well.

               dances with wolves moves to make the exchange. kicking bird 
               does the same. from one hand to the other. men couldn't be 
               closer.

                                     kicking bird
                         it doesn't seem possible that we 
                         could come this far.

                                     dances with wolves
                         you were the first man i ever wanted 
                         to be like. i will not forget you.

               neither can speak. there is only goodbye.
