               ext. canyon rim - dusk

               the rest of the troops have moved to the edge. they too are 
               quiet. down below, the pawnee scouts are milling about looking 
               for sign.

               the soldiers from the canyon floor are silently arriving on 
               the scene. the pawnee look to the lead scout on the canyon 
               rim. they have no answer, and the lead scout has none to 
               give the general at his side. ten bears' village is gone.
