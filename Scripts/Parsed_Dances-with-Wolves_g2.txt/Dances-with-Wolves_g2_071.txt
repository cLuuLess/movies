               int. kicking bird's lodge - day

               kicking bird sits next to the fire playing with his son but 
               he is preoccupied with something.

               there is a rustle of movement at the tent flap, and ten bears 
               peers in.

                                     ten bears
                         may i come in?

               the little boy races over to the old chief, kicking bird 
               makes a move to pull him back, but ten bears indicates the 
               boy should stay.

                                     ten bears
                         no, no let him sit with me.

               there is silence as the two men settle themselves by the 
               fire, the little boy content in ten bears' lap.

                                     ten bears
                         our country seems good this summer, 
                         but i have not been out to see it.

                                     kicking bird
                         yes... it is good. the grass is rich. 
                         the game is plenty and not running 
                         away.

                                     ten bears
                         i am glad to hear it. but the buffalo 
                         are late. i always worry about the 
                         bellies of our children.

               a brief silence.

                                     kicking bird
                         i was thinking of a dance.

                                     ten bears
                         yes, a dance is always a good idea. 
                         it would be good to have a strong 
                         sign.

               kicking bird seems suddenly uncomfortable. the little boy 
               leaves.

                                     kicking bird
                         yes.

                                     ten bears
                         there's a funny thing about signs. 
                         they are always flying in our faces. 
                         we know when they are bad or good 
                         but sometimes they are strange and 
                         there is no way to understand them. 
                         sometimes they make people crazy but 
                         a smart man will take such a sign 
                         into himself and let it run around 
                         for two or three days. if he is still 
                         confused he will tell somebody. he 
                         might come to you or to me and tell 
                         it. a smart man always does that.

               ten bears picks up the pipe and puffs away, seemingly without 
               care.

                                     kicking bird
                         i have seen such a sign.

                                     ten bears
                         oh?

                                     kicking bird
                         i saw a man, a white man.

               ten bears' eyes get big for a moment. then he thinks.

                                     ten bears
                         just one?

                                     kicking bird
                         just one. he was naked.

               ten bears thinks some more.

                                     ten bears
                         are you sure it was a man?

                                     kicking bird
                         i saw his sex.

                                     ten bears
                         did you speak to him?

                                     kicking bird
                         no.

               ten bears rubs at his old eyes with both hands.

                                     ten bears
                         we will council on this.
