               in a natural valley below is a peaceful field.  and on either 
               side of the field, seperated by a hundred yards of green, 
               are low rock walls.

               several dairy cows are lying dead in the field.

               a group of mounted union officers, ride onto the crest of 
               the hill and look down at the field. the distinguished man 
               with a long grey beard is general tide.
