               it's raining. high on a hill, the indian escort waits 
               stoically, horses heads bowed in the drizzle. on the haunches 
               of one of the ponies is a single deer.

               down below, wind in his hair and kicking bird are still 
               mounted and converse with dunbar using sign talk.

                                     dunbar
                         no, i haven't seen any buffalo. are 
                         you hungry? i have food... are you 
                         hungry?

               dunbar suggests they take some of his supplies but kicking 
               bird will not stand for this. he waves dunbar off. the three 
               men say their goodbyes, and dunbar as usual throws a wave to 
               the six men on the hill.

               unexpectedly, one of them returns it and the other five react 
               with surprise.

                                     escort 1
                         he waved.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         nothing i have been told about these 
                         people is correct. they are not 
                         beggars and thieves. they are not 
                         the bogeymen they have been made out 
                         to be.

               kicking bird and wind in his hair disappear over the hill, 
               followed by their escort.

               lightning bursts far out on the prairie.
