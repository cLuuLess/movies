               ext. prairie - day

               we're dropping down through the smoke, right down to the 
               supper fire of timmons the teamster. he's cooking slab bacon 
               in a pan. risking the heat, he dips a finger into the pan 
               and sucks off the grease.

               there's a sudden swish of sound behind him and a split-second 
               later, an arrow goes deep into the wagon driver's ass knocking 
               him clear across the fire.

               timmons screams like a half-butchered hog and starts into an 
               odd crippled run. he clears the gully where he's been camped 
               and struggles up the incline.

               another swish and another scream, as another arrow catches 
               him high on the shoulder.

               terrified with pain and fear, timmons looks back as he 
               scrambles up the slope.

               here comes the toughest at a lazy gallop. he's riding only 
               with his legs. his hands are busy with bow and arrows. casual 
               but blink quick, the toughest snatches another arrow from 
               the quiver at his waist, strings it and fires. this arrow 
               catches timmons in the gut. he falls squirming against the 
               slope.

               the toughest is still coming, his face like granite as he 
               fires arrow after arrow.

               the three warriors who came with the toughest have reached 
               the wagon. two of them are slicing away harness on the team 
               of nice army horses. the third is rifling through timmons' 
               gear. this man unwittingly picks up timmons' blanket. when 
               he gets a whiff of its stink, the warrior flings it far out 
               on the grass. then he drops to one knee, scoops up some dirt 
               and rubs it between his soiled hands.
