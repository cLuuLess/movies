               ext. prairie - day

               a strike far up on the horned formation. their ponies leap 
               forward. the mad dash is on.

               dunbar's hat flies off at first spurt and now the lieutenant 
               and his horse are hurling over the prairie. the little 
               buckskin seems to know what is expected of him and has put 
               every ounce of his muscle to speed. they're burning up the 
               ground.

               when dunbar looks back over his shoulder, he's shocked to 
               find that the best buffalo ponies the sioux's have are far 
               behind. he and cisco are on their own.

               the herd is in full flight and the sound of their stampede 
               is overwhelming. the buffalo are very fast but cisco is 
               gaining with every stride. they've formed a great running 
               wall in front of him and now dunbar can see their rumps and 
               tails and flying hooves.

               dunbar takes a solid grip on his rifle and shuts his eyes as 
               if in prayer. the sound of thousands of hooves is deafening.

               dunbar and cisco have caught the buffalo. a few more strides 
               and they'll be in.

               dunbar and cisco are running with the buffalo. a shaggy head 
               moves in and swipes at cisco, but the little horse is too 
               quick and too smart. he dodges away, nearly dumping the 
               lieutenant in the process.

               dunbar rights himself and fires. it's a wild shot, only 
               grazing the buffalo's shoulder. the report of the gun 
               instantly scatters the herd and dunbar pulls up, dust swirling 
               all around him.
