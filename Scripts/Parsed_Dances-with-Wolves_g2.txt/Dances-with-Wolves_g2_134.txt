               it's the first time we've seen the buffalo up close. they're 
               fantastic creatures, powerful, brutish, untameable animals 
               from another age. a great bull turns away from the others 
               and lifts his purple, horned head to sniff the breeze. he 
               can detect no sign of trouble and eventually returns to his 
               browsing.
