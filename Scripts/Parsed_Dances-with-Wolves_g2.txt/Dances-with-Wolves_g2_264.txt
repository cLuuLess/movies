               the column is moving at a leisurely walk when the horses 
               start to bunch up. they're stopping.

               everyone waits while far up ahead, a group of ten or twelve 
               men examine the ground. white officers sits atop their horses, 
               while their scouts scour the ground. they've found a 
               significant trail.

               the scouts are indian, and by their distinctive dress, we 
               recognize them. they are pawnee.

               the pawnee scouts come racing up. their horses are wet and 
               have come a good distance. the scouts are very excited.

               the men have dismounted. they prepare for battle, removing 
               any equipment that might rattle -- tin cups, plates, etc., 
               tossing the discards into a growing pile.
