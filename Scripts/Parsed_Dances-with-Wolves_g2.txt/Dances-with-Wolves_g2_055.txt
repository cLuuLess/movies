               ext. sedgewick bluff - day

               we're close on dunbar, his face is grimy with sweat and dirt. 
               he's working hard at something.

               we pull back and see that dunbar is half-way up the bluff, 
               he's been filling up the pockmarks, the holes where cargill's 
               men once lived.

               exhausted, he stabs the shovel into the fresh earth and pauses 
               to look over his work, all of the holes have been filled.

               his eyes sweep over the prairie across the river. he sees 
               something moving, it's the wolf. dunbar instinctively goes 
               for his rifle.

               before he can bring it up to aim, he has second thoughts. he 
               lowers the gun and watches the wolf a moment longer, then 
               walks up the hill and disappears into the sky.
