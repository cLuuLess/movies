               int. quarters - night

               dunbar is snoring. the lantern is turned down low. a horse 
               whinnies loudly and dunbar arises.

               in the next instant there is a pounding of hooves and the 
               yelping of indian boys.

               reeling with sleep, dunbar is up and moving. he grabs a rifle 
               and lurches for the door.

               as he runs through the door he forgets to duck under the 
               wooden cross beam. his skull cracks resoundingly against 
               the. overhang and dunbar slumps onto his back... out cold.
