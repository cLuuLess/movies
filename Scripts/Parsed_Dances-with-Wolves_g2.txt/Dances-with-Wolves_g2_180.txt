               ext. riverside - day

               stands with a fist is wading through the water, her mind is 
               far away.

               in a moment there is a shift in the wind. the rustling of 
               the trees alerts her to a presence she had not thought to 
               feel before.

               gradually, she raises her eyes to see the figure of a man 
               moving through the trees... dances with wolves.

               stands with a fist walks slowly out of the water. he opens 
               his arms and she melts into them, letting her head rest 
               against his chest.

                                     stands with a fist
                         i am in mourning.

                                     dances with wolves
                         i know... stone calf told me.

               she presses her body full against his, feeling all of him.

                                     stands with a fist
                         no one can know... we must be careful.

                                     dances with wolves
                         yes.

                                     stands with a fist
                         we must be careful.

               she climbs higher into his arms for a moment. then, supporting 
               each other, the lovers move into the cover of the willow 
               breaks along the river.
