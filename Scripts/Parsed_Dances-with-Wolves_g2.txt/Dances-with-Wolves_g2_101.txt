               dunbar is watching kicking bird and wind in his hair walk 
               their horses up the ridge to meet the waiting escort. each 
               horse has a gift of coffee and sugar slung over its withers. 
               occasionally, wind in his hair dips a hand into one of the 
               bags and carefully licks each finger.

               dunbar waves up at them but there is no response.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         the sugar didn't figure to last at 
                         that rate any way. i don't believe 
                         i'd go too far in saying that a 
                         foundation for good relations is 
                         being laid.
