               ext. battlefield - dawn

               in ragged formation, the sioux pour from behind the lodges 
               and thirty rifles fire into the vanguard of the pawnee charge.

               the smoke of many rifles mixes with the ground fog as the 
               sioux run screaming down on the pawnee. dances with wolves 
               screams too as he runs flat out down the slope.

               a pawnee warrior suddenly looms out of the smoke and they 
               crash together violently.

               the two fighters tumble over the ground, each grappling for 
               an advantage. the hand to hand fighting all around them is 
               furious and, shrouded in smoke and fog, it has a surreal 
               quality.

               dances with wolves works the navy revolver from its holster 
               and shoots the pawnee in the face.
