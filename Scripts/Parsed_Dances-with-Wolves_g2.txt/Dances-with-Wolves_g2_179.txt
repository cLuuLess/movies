               ext. quarters - day

               lying in the sun a few feet away is two socks. he looks up 
               hopefully at dances with wolves. the two partners stare at 
               each other for a moment.

               then dances with wolves reaches into a little day pouch at 
               his side and pulls out a strip of jerky. he squats close to 
               the ground and offers the meat to the wolf.

               two socks is up now. he takes several tentative steps. his 
               nose sniffs at the meat and he opens his mouth. teeth and 
               fingers touch as the wolf takes the meat delicately.

               now, in his customary style, he moves away, heading out onto 
               the prairie with his prize.

               dances with wolves watches a moment longer. then he vaults 
               onto cisco's back and they canter off in the direction of 
               the village.
