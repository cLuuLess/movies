               ext. prairie - day

               dunbar is walking through a little valley of tall, rich grass. 
               the wagon is nowhere in sight.

               he looks back at cisco who is also wandering by himself 
               searching for prime shoots.

               timmons' wagon comes into view now.

                                     dunbar
                         how come we haven't seen any buffalo?

                                     timmons
                         can't figger the stinkin' buffalo. 
                         sometimes you don't see 'em for days, 
                         sometimes they're thick as curls on 
                         a whore.

                                     dunbar
                         what about indians?

                                     timmons
                         goddamn indians you'd jus' as soon 
                         not see, lessen the bastards're dead. 
                         nothing but thieves and beggars.

               timmons, as usual, laughs at his own imagined wit.

               the wagon disappears over a ridge and again, dunbar is alone.

               in gentle awe, he runs his palm over the top of the grass 
               swirling about his waist.

               a meadow lark's mournful call startles him. dunbar brings 
               his head up at the sound and so does cisco.

               now there's a sudden lifting of the breeze. it sweeps through 
               the valley, making the grass roll with a life of its own.

               the lark's sad call and the sudden violent movement of the 
               wind sends a shudder through lieutenant dunbar. he scans the 
               horizon in all directions, aware all at once of his aloneness.

               he flips the reins over cisco's neck and sticks a foot in 
               the stirrup.

               dunbar heads for the ridge.
