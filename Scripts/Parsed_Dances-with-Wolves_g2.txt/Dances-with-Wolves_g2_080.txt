               ext. river - day

               dunbar is sitting naked in the shallow river below the fort. 
               he has worked up a good lather on his face and is shaving. 
               the big navy revolver and his gunbelt are slung over his 
               shoulder. dunbar glances at the far bluff.

               two socks is sitting quietly, watching the shaving ritual 
               below.

               the lieutenant is finishing shaving his moustache. he stares 
               onto the surface of the water trying to get it just right. 
               once again he glances up at two socks.

               two socks' attention has been diverted. he's on guard, staring 
               intently across the river.

               dunbar looks quickly at the bluff nearest the fort. everything 
               is still. he looks back at two socks.

               the wolf is gone.

               the lieutenant hears something now. hoofbeats. hoofbeats 
               coming in a rush.

               he bursts from the water and scrambles up the incline.
