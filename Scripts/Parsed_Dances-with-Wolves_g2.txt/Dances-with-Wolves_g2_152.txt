               ext. quarters - night

               dunbar is gnawing happily at the last of the bird, still on 
               its skewer. after a couple of bites, he slips the carcass 
               off the stick and chucks it out to two socks. he licks his 
               fingers and gazes out into the night.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         though only two days it seems like a 
                         week. i am missing the company of my 
                         new friends. i can see all of their 
                         faces, but somehow it is not enough. 
                         tomorrow, i will make an unannounced 
                         visit. after all, they are my 
                         neighbors, what can it hurt?
