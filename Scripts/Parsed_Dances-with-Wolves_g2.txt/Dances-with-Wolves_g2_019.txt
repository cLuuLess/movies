               ext. battlefield - day

               suddenly the field is quiet. there is rifle fire in the 
               distance but otherwise everything is still. the field is 
               almost empty. the three dead dairy cows are still there. and 
               at one end of the field is a solitary buckskin horse. his 
               rider lies on the ground, a foot hooked in one stirrup.

               the sound of men's voices is coming near. suddenly, general 
               tide is peering down at him. dunbar stares back, glassy eyed.

                                     dunbar
                         don't take off my foot.

               general tide stares down into dunbar's blank face. he kneels 
               next to the lieutenant and bends to whisper in his ear.

                                     general tide
                         you rest easy son... you'll keep 
                         you're foot. as god is my judge, 
                         you'll keep it.

               the general looks up at one of his aides.

                                     general tide
                         bring up my ambulance...

                                     aide
                         sir?

                                     general tide
                         bring up my ambulance. and bring my 
                         surgeon with it. we've got an officer 
                         who's worth something lying here.

               the aide dashes off to do what he's told, as general tide 
               gently removes dunbar's foot from the stirrup and lays it 
               carefully on the ground. the image fades out.
