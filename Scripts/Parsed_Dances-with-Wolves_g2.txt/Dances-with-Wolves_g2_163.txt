               ext. kicking bird's lodge - dawn

               black shawl is hurrying out of the lodge with her husband's 
               bow and arrows.

               a war party of twenty warriors is mounted and everyone except 
               sleeping children is out to say goodbye.

               stands with a fist is helping to load kicking bird's horse 
               with last minute preparations. out of the tipi comes kicking 
               bird's eldest child. he is sleepy but almost on the verge of 
               tears as he knows what is happening.

               kicking bird picks up the boy. what is said is between father 
               and son. and it is just a look.

               he hands the child to stands with a fist, and pauses to speak 
               with his wife. she comes close to tears but there will be no 
               crying. none from kicking bird either. he steps back to his 
               horse.

                                     kicking bird
                              (to stands with a 
                              fist)
                         keep on with the white man talk if 
                         it pleases you.

                         i like to make the white man talk.

               dances with wolves is standing alone in front of his lodge. 
               wind in his hair is riding past. he reaches down and shakes 
               dances with wolves' hand. the big warrior smiles.

               dances with wolves watches the warriors go by, but his eyes 
               begin to wander. he's looking for someone among the faces of 
               the women. who ever it is, he can't find her.
