               int. kicking bird's lodge - night

               the fire is still burning in the center of the lodge. dunbar 
               is sleeping soundly.

               it's not a moment later that we hear the soft sounds of 
               mumbling somewhere in the lodge. then it's quiet. there's 
               that mumbling again. and now a woman's giggle.

               dunbar stirs, waking and curious, sits up a little and looks 
               across the fire. there is movement on kicking bird's platform. 
               the medicine man's head and that of his wife come into view 
               for a second or two before they sink back down into shadow. 
               the movements and sound that follow become more forceful. 
               they're having sex.

               embarrassed, the lieutenant averts his eyes, they happen 
               over the forms of kicking bird's deeply sleeping children, 
               the low-burning fire, and settle on stands with a fist's 
               back.

               lieutenant dunbar, the sounds of lovemaking floating over 
               him, peers again in that direction only to meet the smiling 
               eyes of kicking bird and his wife.

               embarrassed again, he stares open-eyed at the ceiling. he 
               looks like a man who knows something is happening but doesn't 
               know what it is.

               stands with a fist's eyes are open too. she doesn't move.
