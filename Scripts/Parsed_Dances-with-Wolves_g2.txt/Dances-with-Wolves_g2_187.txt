               ext. prairie - night

               rain is pouring now. thunder is still booming. a great fork 
               of lightning illuminates the ruins of the old fort. and 
               nearby, it reveals two riders out in the grass.

               dances with wolves and smiles a lot have brought a couple 
               extra horses with travois, but is is dark and in the rain 
               they've been reduced to looking for a needle in a haystack.

               dances with wolves' face is grim with frustration as it covers 
               the ground at cisco's feet.

               smiles a lot and his pony are walking the soggy ground. over 
               the tumult of the storm there is the faint but distinct sound 
               of a "snap".

               he's staring curiously at the ground beneath his pony's feet. 
               smiles a lot jumps off and, going on all fours, he paws over 
               the ground.

               his hand grasps something and he holds it up to his face. 
               it's a sliver of bone shattered at one end. quickly he gropes 
               some more and finds the other half. together they are a 
               buffalo rib.

                                     smiles a lot
                              (shouting over the 
                              storm)
                         dances with wolves... dances with 
                         wolves.
