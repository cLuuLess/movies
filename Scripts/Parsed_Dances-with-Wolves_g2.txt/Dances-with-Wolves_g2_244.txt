               the wagon is making its way steadily down, toward the river. 
               dances with wolves watches the line of growth along the river 
               get closer, his eyes and ears and nose full alert.

               if they come this will be the place to do it. dances with 
               wolves will make the most of this hope.

               the wagon moves down a narrow pathway, not much more than a 
               game trail. the lieutenant raises his hand and the wagon 
               halts at the river's edge.

               a soldier rides back and forth in the water on the other 
               side of the river. he's checking for any signs of ambush. 
               the soldier starts back to them.

                                     soldier
                         all clear lieutenant...

               elgin starts into the water, followed by the wagon. the "all 
               clear" sign means nothing to dances with wolves. he's all 
               keyed up.
