               ext. canyon rim - dusk

               wind in his hair and several other warriors are just drawing 
               back from unseen vantage points on the canyon rim. wind in 
               his hair glances back and hesitates, as though waiting for 
               someone. a great, yellow full moon has just appeared above 
               the opposite rim of the canyon. the yellow is brilliant, a 
               great spotlight of golden color.

               a wolf steps into the light on the opposite rim. he's walking 
               in the backdrop of the moon. the wolf suddenly arches his 
               back, sticks his muzzle in the air and produces a spine-
               tingling howl. the sound bounces all over the canyon.

               dances with wolves is at the canyon's rim. he listens a long 
               time, fully entranced by the wolf's howl. he is still 
               listening when it is gone. a whisper floats out of the night 
               behind him.

                                     wind in his hair (o.s.)
                         dances with wolves...

               dances with wolves shrinks back from the canyon's rim, turns 
               and trots off into the darkness, following his friends.
