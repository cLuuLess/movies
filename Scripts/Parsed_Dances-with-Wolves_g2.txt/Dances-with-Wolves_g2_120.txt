               ext. prairie - day

               a wide stretch of prairie, falling away to nothing.

               the buffalo have left a trail in the form of a tremendous 
               swath of torn-up ground, several hundred yards from side to 
               side.

               indians on horseback move into the picture.

               most of ten bears' camp is moving out in a long, noisy column. 
               spirits are high. first come the lead scouts, followed by 
               ten bears and his advisors, kicking bird and wind in his 
               hair among them. a large body of warriors come next. behind 
               these men are the women, children and elderly. dunbar is 
               riding at the head of the last group.

               the attitudes of the people have changed significantly. people 
               who catch his eye are openly smiling at the lieutenant.

               an old woman comes alongside and offers him a piece of dried 
               meat, patting his hand as he takes it.

               here comes smiles a lot, worm and otter, all on ponies, 
               galloping up beside him. they want to play.

                                     smiles a lot
                         loo ten tant...

               he motions for dunbar to break ranks and while the lieutenant 
               is puzzling this out, a chorus of cries comes from the 
               column's front.

               three far-ranging scouts are coming in at a run.
