               ext. ten bears' lodge - night

               amid the pandemonium of the village, dances with wolves and 
               ten bears are talking. stone calf stands at ten bears' side, 
               listening.

                                     ten bears
                         no, the ride is long... the weather 
                         is bad. we can spare no men.

                                     dances with wolves
                         guns would make one warrior like 
                         two.

               the idea intrigues ten bears. as he thinks, he looks to stone 
               calf. but the elder warrior says nothing.

                                     ten bears
                         take one man and go quickly.

               dances with wolves turns away now, hoping to make a quick 
               choice. but in their excitement all the warriors are busy 
               running to and fro. only one person is standing resolutely. 
               he is staring straight at dances with wolves. it is smiles a 
               lot, and from the look on his face it's easy to see that he 
               wants to be chosen.

               dances with wolves returns the boy's stare, trying to make 
               up his mind. he turns to ten bears.

                                     dances with wolves
                         i will take smiles a lot.

               ten bears looks briefly at smiles a lot. he too can see 
               resolve in the boy's face. now he looks once again at dances 
               with wolves. he nods.
