               ext. battlefield - day

               dunbar can see the confederate riflemen now. they're rising 
               up behind the wall to aim and fire.

               fifty yards from the enemy line he's still unhit. he wheels 
               the buckskin into a sharp left turn and they streak parallel 
               to the confederate flank. the buckskin is charging hard, his 
               heels throwing out clumps of dirt.

               the firing is tremendous. the lieutenant's hat is torn away. 
               a slug lifts off one of the officer's epaulettes, but still 
               no bullet finds him.
