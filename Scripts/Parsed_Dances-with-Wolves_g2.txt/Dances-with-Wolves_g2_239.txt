               ext. temporary camp - day

               there's a tremendous upheaval. ten bears' band has halted 
               its march. six painted warriors all heavily armed are jumping 
               onto their ponies and being handed the lines to spare mounts. 
               wind in his hair is their leader.

               the whole village is up to see them off.

               smiles a lot, painted and carrying a bow and quiver rides 
               into the midst of the group. wind in his hair studies the 
               resolute boy.

                                     wind in his hair
                         you will hold our horses... nothing 
                         more.

               smiles a lot nods.

               with a great whooping from the villagers, the rescue party 
               roars out of camp.
