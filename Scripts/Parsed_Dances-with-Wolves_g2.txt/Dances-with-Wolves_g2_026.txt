               ext. wagon - day

               at the sound of a single shot behind him, dunbar twists around 
               on the wagon seat. seeing nothing, he turns back to face the 
               front and takes stock of the driver, timmons. he doesn't 
               like what he sees... or smells.

               timmons, is not what would be called a credit to his race. 
               if all teamsters were greaseballs he would be their absolute 
               ruler. his stink must be incredible. he leans over the side 
               of the wagon and hocks out a disgusting stream of spittle.

               afternoon shadows are slanting across the rolling ocean of 
               prairie. the wagon passes camera, headed towards an endless 
               expanse of prairie.
