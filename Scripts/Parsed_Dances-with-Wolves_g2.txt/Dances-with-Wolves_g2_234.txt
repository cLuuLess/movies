               water drips from dances with wolves' head and he comes to 
               again. as he moves he hears a jangling and discovers that 
               his hands and feet are in chains. everyone has assembled.

                                     elgin
                         why are you out of uniform?

                                     dances with wolves
                         what is the army doing out here?

               sergeant bauer shoves dances with wolves with his gun.

                                     bauer
                         lieutenant's askin' the questions 
                         here.

               elgin quickly steps in.

                                     elgin
                         we are charged with apprehending 
                         hostiles, recovering stolen property 
                         and retrieving white captives taken 
                         in hostile raidings.

                                     dances with wolves
                         there are no hostiles.

                                     major
                         we will ascertain that for ourselves. 
                         now if you guide us to these camps 
                         and serve as an interpreter, your 
                         conduct will be reevaluated.

                                     dances with wolves
                         what conduct?

                                     major
                         your status as a traitor might improve 
                         should you choose to cooperate with 
                         the united states army.

                                     dances with wolves
                              (quietly)
                         there is nothing for you to do out 
                         here.

               elgin can see that the major's attitude and inexperience has 
               killed any chance of communication. he makes one last try on 
               his own.

                                     elgin
                         are you willing to cooperate or not?

                                     major
                         well, speak up...

                                     dances with wolves
                              (lowly in sioux)
                         i am dances with wolves...

                                     major
                         what's that?

                                     dances with wolves
                              (loudly in sioux)
                         i am dances with wolves... i have 
                         nothing to say to you. you are not 
                         worth talking to.

               the major is surprised. elgin is not. the major turns on his 
               heel and walks out. lieutenant elgin stares at dances with 
               wolves.

                                     elgin
                         sergeant... have a detail take him 
                         down to the river... let him clean 
                         up his face.
