               ext. prairie - night

               the buffalo scouts, dunbar included, are galloping back to 
               the temporary camp. it looms ahead of them, the hide-covered 
               lodges glowing like candles in the last light of day. a big 
               fire is blazing in the center of camp.

               dunbar hangs back as the other riders go into the noisy camp. 
               a special event of some kind is taking place. as he looks 
               this scene over, dunbar sees something remarkable.

               back in the shadows, behind the fire, is a wagon.

               dunbar and cisco pace back and forth on the fringes of the 
               camp. the lieutenant searches for any sign of the white people 
               who came in the wagon, but finding none, he focuses on the 
               dancers moving in a circle around the big fire.

               one of the men waving his lance is wind in his hair. dunbar's 
               eyes track up the lance and there he finds the white people. 
               hanging from wind in his hair's lance tip is a fresh scalp, 
               blonde and wavy. several of the other men have scalps too. 
               none of the hair is indian.

               dunbar can see into the wagonbed now. a couple of dozen fresh 
               buffalo hides are stacked in the wagonbed. it's all come 
               clear. the white men who killed the buffalo for hides and 
               tongues have themselves been killed.

               dunbar slowly retreats into the shadows.
