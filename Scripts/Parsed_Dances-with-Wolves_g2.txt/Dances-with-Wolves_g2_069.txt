               int. quarters - day

               dunbar's journal lies open on his bunk. we hear a digging 
               sound in the background. the lieutenant is facing the wall 
               of his quarters. using a bayonet as a cutting tool, he has 
               carved a window out of the sod. he's nearly finished and is 
               just tidying up.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         have made all the preparations i can 
                         think of. i cannot mount an adequate 
                         defense but will try to make a big 
                         impression when they come. waiting.

               finished, he retreats to his bunk and sits staring across at 
               his new window. he glances at the journal by his side and 
               has a thought. he picks it up and starts to write.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         the man i encountered was a 
                         magnificent looking fellow.
