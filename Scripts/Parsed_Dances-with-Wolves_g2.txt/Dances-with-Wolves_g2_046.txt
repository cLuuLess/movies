               int. quarters - dawn

               dunbar is sleeping quietly. he opens his eyes and rears his 
               head to get his bearings. then he flops back down and shuts 
               his eyes, hoping for more sleep.

               he hears two heavy footfalls in rapid succession.

               dunbar holds his breath staring at the doorway. quietly, he 
               pulls his gun aiming it directly at the doorway.

               silence. suddenly, a shadow starts across the threshold, 
               followed quickly by cisco's big buckskin head. the horse 
               watches dunbar a moment, then looks curiously around the 
               room.
