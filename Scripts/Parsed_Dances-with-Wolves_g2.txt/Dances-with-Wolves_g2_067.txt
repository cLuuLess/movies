               ext. prairie - day

               the three boxes are stacked on the open prairie. suddenly a 
               shovelful of dirt flies out of an unseen spot next to the 
               crates. another flying shovelful. and another.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         have made first contact with a wild 
                         indian. one came to the fort and 
                         tried to steal my horse. do not know 
                         how many more are in the vicinity 
                         but i am taking steps for another 
                         visitation. am burying excess 
                         ordnance, lest it fall into enemy 
                         hands.

               the last square of sod is placed carefully on the surface of 
               the earth. dunbar drives a bleached rib bone into the ground 
               at an angle just in front of his cache.

               dunbar steps back from his work. the replaced sod is 
               invisible. the guns will not be found.
