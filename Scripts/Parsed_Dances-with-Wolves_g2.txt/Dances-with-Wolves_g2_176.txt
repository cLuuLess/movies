               int. kicking bird's lodge - day

               stands with a fist kneels before black shawl, the older woman 
               is combing out the tangles in her hair. black shawl senses a 
               tension in the girl and gently tries to pry it out of her.

                                     black shawl
                         people are talking about you...

               stands with a fist stiffens a bit.

                                     stands with a fist
                         what are they saying?

                                     black shawl
                         they are proud of the medicine you 
                         are making with dances with wolves.

               stands with a fist is quiet.

                                     stands with a fist
                         i have hurt him and i must go talk 
                         to him.

                                     black shawl
                         you can't, he is gone.

               stands with a fist bolts up, racing to the lodge flap -- she 
               pulls it aside and is stunned by the sight of dances with 
               wolves' abandoned lodge -- cisco is nowhere to be seen.

               she turns away, tears coming to her eyes. black shawl is 
               beside her watching -- the girl's emotions have betrayed 
               her.

               black shawl takes the crying girl into her arms. a child 
               runs into the lodge but black shawl indicates "not now."

               the message is clearly understood, and the child digs in his 
               heels and heads the other way.
