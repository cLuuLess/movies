               ext. column - day

               the day has grown hot as the column continues its march 
               through changing terrain.

               dunbar is suffering some. the heat and dust are monstrous. 
               at the moment however, he's most concerned with stands with 
               a fist. she's riding closeby and he watches her with interest.

               it's easier to see now that she was once white.

               suddenly she looks in his direction. the lieutenant quickly 
               tips his hat, but she turns her shy eyes away before he has 
               finished the motion.

               kicking bird is riding down the line. the medicine man 
               gestures dunbar forward and the lieutenant guides cisco out 
               of line.

               through her tangled hair, stands with a fist watches the 
               soldier and the medicine man ride up the line.
