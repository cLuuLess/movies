               ext. hillside - day

               dunbar is leading cisco to the top of a low hill. he glances 
               over his shoulder and sees that he is being followed.

               the wolf with two socks stops when dunbar looks back at him.

               dunbar watches him curiously for a moment and continues 
               leading cisco up the hill. but now he's glancing regularly 
               over his shoulder and discovers that as he moves, so does 
               the wolf.

               reaching the top of the hill, dunbar pauses. he pulls out 
               the pocket telescope and sweeps the prairie. there is nothing.

               now dunbar swings onto cisco's bare back and with a last 
               glance back at the wolf starts down the rise and on to the 
               open prairie at an easy canter. we follow for a little 
               distance. dunbar glances once more over his shoulder.

               the wolf is sitting on top of the hill watching. he has 
               decided to come no further.
