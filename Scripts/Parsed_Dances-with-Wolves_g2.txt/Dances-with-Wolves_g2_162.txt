               int. dunbar's lodge - night

               his surroundings are completely indian, dunbar is cleaning 
               the big navy revolver.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         a war party is going against the 
                         pawnee soon and i have asked to go. 
                         i sensed that i have made a mistake 
                         in doing so but i could not bring 
                         myself to take it back. they are my 
                         friends and from what little i gather 
                         the pawnee have been very hard on 
                         these people. i hope i have not 
                         overstepped my bounds.

               the lodge flap rustles and in comes stands with a fist and 
               kicking bird. dunbar stands to greet them.

                                     dunbar
                         i'm glad to see you... please sit.

               kicking bird speaks and stands with a fist translates.

                                     stands with a fist
                              (translating)
                         kicking bird wants to know why you 
                         want to make war on the pawnee. they 
                         have done nothing to you.

                                     dunbar
                         they are sioux enemies.

                                     stands with a fist
                              (translating)
                         only sioux warriors will go.

                                     dunbar
                         i asked that he would think about my 
                         going.

                                     stands with a fist
                         he has.

                                     dunbar
                         then tell him this. i have been a 
                         warrior for longer than many of the 
                         young men that will go on this war 
                         party. tell him.

                                     stands with a fist
                              (translating)
                         he says that the sioux way of being 
                         a warrior is not the white way. you 
                         are not ready.

                                     dunbar
                         i know, i understand. but i cannot 
                         learn these ways in camp.

               she translates this to kicking bird. the medicine man 
               hesitates then speaks once more.

                                     stands with a fist
                         he asks that you watch over his family 
                         while he is gone.

               dunbar looks to kicking bird then to stands with a fist unable 
               to mask his disappointment.

                                     stands with a fist
                              (on her own)
                         this thing he asks you... it is a 
                         great honor for you.

               dunbar thinks a moment longer and speaks directly to kicking 
               bird.

                                     dunbar
                         i will be happy to watch over your 
                         family.

                                     stands with a fist
                              (translating)
                         he thanks dances with wolves for 
                         coming.

                                     dunbar
                         who is dances with wolves?

                                     stands with a fist
                         it is the name which everyone is 
                         calling you now.

               he thinks and remembers the night with two socks.

                                     dunbar
                         dances with wolves... that's right.
                              (to stands with a 
                              fist)
                         how do you say it?

                                     stands with a fist
                              (in sioux)
                         dances with wolves.

                                     dunbar
                              (in sioux to kicking 
                              bird)
                         dances with wolves.

               the medicine man smiles.
