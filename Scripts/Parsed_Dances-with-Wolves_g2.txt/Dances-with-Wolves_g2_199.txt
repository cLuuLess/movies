               ext. battlefield - dawn

               dances with wolves is bumped from behind and is knocked to 
               his knees. it's a frantic pawnee war horse, loose on the 
               battlefield. dances with wolves grabs a hunk of mane and 
               swings onto his back.

               he has a real view now. the pawnee are taking a terrible 
               licking. already they are being beaten back to the river.

               a turbaned enemy is falling back to the river, firing arrows 
               as he goes. dances with wolves goes after him.
