               ext. battlefield - dawn

               coming off the pony like a rodeo bulldogger, dances with 
               wolves crashes through the river taking the pawnee in a 
               headlock.

               somehow they both keep their feet and hurtle down the hill 
               at a weird run. a small cottonwood stops their momentum, the 
               pawnee taking most of the blow.

               dances with wolves grabs either side of the man's head and 
               starts banging his skull against the tree trunk. shortly, he 
               notices that the man's eyes are dead.

               the pawnee was impaled on impact by the stub of a broken 
               branch low on the trunk.

               dances with wolves shrinks back from this gruesome sight and 
               staggers toward the village.
