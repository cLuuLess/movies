               ext. sedgewick - night

               dressed in only pants and boots, dunbar walks along the bluff 
               above the river, his lantern held out in front of him. the 
               sound is tremendous now. dunbar stops as a great wall of 
               dust rises before him.

               at the same time, he realizes something is alive behind the 
               wall of dust, he recognizes the sound... the sound of 
               thousands of hoofbeats.

               he sees one veer out. and now another. and another, darting 
               briefly from the great cloud of dust. the most powerful force 
               on the prairie now seems like the most powerful force on 
               earth as it thunders by.

               the buffalo.
