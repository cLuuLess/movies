               ext. fort hays - day

               lieutenant dunbar skips down the steps, picks up cisco's 
               reins and starts leading the buckskin along the front of the 
               building. he looks briefly at his orders, stops and turns 
               back towards fambrough's office.

               and there is fambrough with a full glass of booze in hand, 
               toasting the young lieutenant from the window. a wide grin 
               on his face.
