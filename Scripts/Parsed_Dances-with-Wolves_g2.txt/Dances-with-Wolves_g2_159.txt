               ext. kicking bird's lodge - day

               the escorts dismount and so does the lieutenant. smiles a 
               lot suddenly comes forward and grasps cisco's reins. there's 
               a brief tug of war. but before it gets out of hand, kicking 
               bird is reassuring dunbar with calm words and a smile, with 
               the lieutenant watching, the boy takes cisco's muzzle between 
               his hands and blows breath into each nostril. he too gives 
               dunbar a reassuring smile.

               in the next moment, the lieutenant finds himself being gently 
               pushed into kicking bird's lodge.

               as kicking bird is about to duck in behind him, a hand on 
               his arm stops him. it is wind in his hair and his tone is 
               strong with friendly advice.

                                     wind in his hair
                         not everyone thinks it is a good 
                         idea that he is here.
