               ext. river bank - day

               dunbar is squatting naked at the edge of the stream, pounding 
               the dirt out of his trousers on a little rock ledge. he rises, 
               wringing out the pants, and wades across the river.

               on the opposite bank he spreads the pants on a low bush. 
               then he looks along the river. for some distance every bush 
               and shrub is draped with the lieutenant's laundry, all of it 
               drying in the sun.
