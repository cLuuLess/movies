               ext. village - dawn

               stone calf, his bow and arrow at the ready, is looking for 
               more enemies to kill.

               suddenly from the corner of his eye the old man senses an 
               attack. but he is too late. a pawnee war club crushes his 
               skull and the old man collapses.

               now we can see his attacker. it is the fierce pawnee warrior 
               who killed timmons the wagon driver. he glowers down at the 
               body of stone calf and swings his club toward the old man's 
               head once again.
