               int. ten bears' lodge - night

               another council is in progress. as before, the leading men 
               are seated around ten bears' fire while the other warriors 
               stand packed in the shadows. wind in his hair is seated close 
               to the elders.

                                     ten bears
                         i am in agreement with kicking bird. 
                         we will go down and talk to the white 
                         man and find out what kind of white 
                         man he is.

               wind in his hair jumps into the conversation.

                                     wind in his hair
                         if this council decides to talk with 
                         the man at the soldier fort then it 
                         will be so. but in my mind it is not 
                         right that a sioux chief, a chief as 
                         great as ten bears, goes to ask the 
                         business of a puny, trespassing white 
                         man... a white soldier who has only 
                         a smart horse and a few white man 
                         clothes.

               there are many yeses in response to this. as is his custom, 
               ten bears lets the outburst subside, seeming unruffled all 
               the while. casually, he pops a piece of meat into his mouth 
               and begins to chew.

                                     ten bears
                         i will not go... you will go... you 
                         and kicking bird. that is all i have 
                         to say.
