               ext. bushes - day

               trooper spivey is crapping in the bushes. another soldier, 
               crapper, is crapping not far away. spivey can see dances 
               with wolves in the distance, still splashing water on his 
               face.

               now he slips something out of his tunic. it's the journal. 
               he opens it and starts to tear out a page, trying hard not 
               to make noise.

                                     crapper (o.s.)
                         you got paper over there spivey?

                                     spivey
                         what's it to you?

                                     crapper
                         well gimme some shitbird.

               spivey thinks.

                                     spivey
                         can you read?

                                     crapper
                         naw, i can't read. what the hell do 
                         you care... you can't either.

               spivey looks down at the stolen journal, thinking.

                                     spivey
                         alright... hold your horses.
