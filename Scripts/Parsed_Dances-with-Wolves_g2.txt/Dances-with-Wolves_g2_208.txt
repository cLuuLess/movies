               int. kicking bird's lodge - night

               black shawl and stands with a fist are clearing things away. 
               the medicine man has hosted a dinner party which is now 
               winding down.

               wind in his hair is there, dances with wolves and several 
               other prominent warriors. it's purely social and all the men 
               are enjoying themselves.

               dances with wolves sneaks a look of affection at stands with 
               a fist, and she returns it.

               then, with more theatricality than is really necessary, he 
               stretches his arms and yawns. wind in his hair looks at his 
               friend with surprise.

               dances with wolves gets to his feet.

                                     wind in his hair
                         there is gambling tonight... at horse 
                         back's lodge. horse back's games are 
                         always good.

                                     dances with wolves
                         i am tired... and horse back already 
                         has a good rifle of mine.

                              (to all)

               he slips out. in a few seconds, the men have pick up another 
               topic to jawbone.

               they pay no attention to stands with a fist's momentary exit, 
               but black shawl does, it doesn't bother her, but she notices.
