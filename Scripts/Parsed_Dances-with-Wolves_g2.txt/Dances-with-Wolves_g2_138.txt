               ext. prairie - day

               the buffalo has been split open and wind in his hair, kneeling 
               at the bull's side, is feeling around in the cavity. he finds 
               what he's looking for and gives it a jerk.

               it's the liver, still warm and steaming. he offers it to 
               dunbar but the lieutenant, not having the faintest idea, 
               only looks at it blankly.

               a sizable crowd has gathered to watch this ritual.

               wind in his hair sticks the fresh liver in his mouth and 
               happily bites off a chunk, letting the juices run from the 
               edges of his mouth. now he figures the lieutenant knows what 
               to do, and hands the liver back to him.

               dunbar doesn't want to do this, but with the pressure of so 
               many eyes and so much good will, he has little choice. 
               tentatively, he bites off a small piece and chews it 
               thoughtfully. it's good.

               encouraged by this good taste, dunbar takes a man-sized bite. 
               shrill sioux voices rise all around him as they cheer the 
               lieutenant. dunbar holds the liver triumphantly over his 
               head.
