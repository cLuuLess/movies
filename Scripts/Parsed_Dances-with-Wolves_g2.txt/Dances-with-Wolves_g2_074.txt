               ext. ten bears' lodge - night

               inside the meeting is breaking up. but smiles a lot is no 
               longer watching. he's lost in thought, as if he has got 
               something on his mind.

               now he comes out of it. with a last look into the lodge, he 
               sneaks off into the night.
