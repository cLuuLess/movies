               ext. ten bears' lodge - night

               a teenaged boy, smiles a lot and his two buddies otter and 
               worm lie prone outside ten bears' home. they are peeking 
               under the tipi's rolled-up sides. their eyes are wide, for 
               inside there's plenty to see and hear. the village's most 
               influential warriors have squeezed into the lodge for this 
               big and important meeting
