               ext. civil war hill - day

               like the others, general tide is absorbed with the spectacle 
               of a single horseman riding into the teeth of the enemy. he 
               holds out his hand and an aide slips a pocket telescope into 
               his palm. the general sights through his telescope.

                                     aide
                         what is it sir?

               tide lowers the telescope, glances at the aide and peers 
               back down at the field.

                                     tide
                         looks like a suicide.
