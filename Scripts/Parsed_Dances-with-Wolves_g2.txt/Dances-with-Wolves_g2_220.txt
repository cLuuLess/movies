               ext. prairie - day

               kicking bird and dances with wolves are cantering side by 
               side across the open prairie.

               they pull their horses to a walk and kicking bird glances 
               dances with wolves' direction.

               dances with wolves' glances back and smiles.

                                     dances with wolves
                         it's good to be out.

                                     kicking bird
                         yes it must be.

                         we are trying for a baby.

                                     kicking bird
                         no waiting?

                         no waiting.

               the medicine man keeps looking at his protege. there is 
               virtually no semblance of lieutenant dunbar left.

                         i was just thinking that of all the 
                         trails in this life, there is one 
                         that matters more than all the others. 
                         it is the trail of a true human being. 
                         i think you are on this trail and it 
                         is good to see.

               dances with wolves doesn't reply, but he is blushing a little.
