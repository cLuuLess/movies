               ext. sedgewick - day

               old fort sedgewick is just beyond the next rise. dances with 
               wolves eases cisco into a full run.

               they fly so quickly over the rise that dances with wolves 
               has no time to react.

               there must be forty or fifty of them; talking, walking, 
               working and playing. old fort sedgewick is crawling with 
               them. blue-coated soldiers.

               just in front of him is a deep-bedded wagon carrying a cargo 
               of soldiers. they've been out cutting wood. but now the men 
               in the wagon are scrambling for their rifles and screaming 
               out the alarm... "indians!"

               dances with wolves puts everything he has into pulling cisco 
               up.

               the soldiers in the wagon, a collection of pimply-faced teen-
               agers and middle-aged rabble, are aiming their rifles. cisco 
               rears high in the air as the volley is fired from the wagon.

               dances with wolves is pitched off to one side, landing hard 
               on the ground. when he gets his senses back the first thing 
               he sees is cisco. the buckskin is lying very still.

               oblivious to the shouts of the soldiers racing toward him, 
               dances with wolves runs crab-like to his horse's side.

               cisco's been shot several times, one bullet taking him in 
               the heart. he's dead.

               dances with wolves whirls to face the soldiers.

                                     dances with wolves
                         you killed him...

               that's the last thing he says. a rifle stock slams into the 
               side of his face and as soldiers swarm over him, everything 
               goes black.
