               ext. bluff - night

               two socks has taken his dinner and retreated to the shadows. 
               he munches contentedly until a strange sound jolts him to 
               attention.

               at the fort is an odd sight. dunbar is dancing around the 
               fire, occasionally singing out an energetic whoop.

               two socks is caught up in the scene and lets out a howl of 
               his own. it could be the stone age.
