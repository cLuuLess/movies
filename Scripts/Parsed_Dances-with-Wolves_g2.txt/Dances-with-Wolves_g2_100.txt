               ext. sedgewick - day

               wind in his hair and kicking bird are sitting comfortably 
               under the awning, each holding steaming army-issue cups. 
               they are staring straight ahead with a curious expression.

               dunbar is turning a handle on a machine. it is a coffee 
               grinder.

               the last of the beans goes down and dunbar pauses for dramatic 
               effect. then he pulls out the drawer containing the fresh 
               grounds and passes it to the medicine man. kicking bird and 
               wind in his hair both sniff the contents.

               dunbar gestures at their still full mugs -- neither one of 
               them has taken a drink.

                                     dunbar
                         is the coffee not good? too strong 
                         maybe? here...

               dunbar reaches for a sack by the fire. holding it in front 
               of him, dunbar suggests that wind in his hair put some of 
               its contents into his mug.

               wind in his hair finally does, but his blank expression 
               indicates that he doesn't know what difference this could 
               make.

               dunbar takes a lick at his fingers, suggesting that wind in 
               his hair should do the same. a smile creeps over his face as 
               the universal appeal of sugar is taking hold. wind in his 
               hair has licked every bit off each finger.

                                     dunbar
                              (to kicking bird)
                         do you want some?

               wind in his hair doesn't wait for kicking bird's answer. he 
               reaches over and dumps a good amount in kicking bird's cup, 
               adding some more to his own for good measure.

                                     dunbar
                         so what are you guys doing? looking 
                         for buffalo?

               there is no response. wind in his hair's attention is now on 
               cisco.

                                     dunbar
                         he's a good one... good horse. my 
                         horse.

               wind in his hair's interest borders on rude. prompted by a 
               light tap on his leg from kicking bird, wind in his hair 
               turns his attention back to dunbar.

                                     dunbar
                         good horse.

               no argument from wind in his hair.

                                     dunbar
                         my horse. you see any buffalo?

               kicking bird and wind in his hair are baffled.

               the lieutenant is trying to jam a wadded blanket under the 
               back of his tunic.

                                     dunbar
                         wait just a bit.

                                     wind in his hair
                              (to kicking bird)
                         his mind is gone.

               kicking bird doesn't respond. he's still intent on the 
               lieutenant. in wedging the blanket under his tunic, dunbar 
               has become a hunchback. he bends over in a weird attitude, 
               and with a finger peeking over each side of his head, he 
               begins a bizarre display of dancing, punctuated with snorts 
               and bellows.

                                     kicking bird
                         buffalo.

                                     dunbar
                              (incorrectly in sioux)
                         buffalo?

                                     kicking bird
                              (slowly)
                         buffalo.

                                     dunbar
                              (getting it right)
                         buffalo.

               kicking bird nods his assent and dunbar flashes a pleased 
               smile.

                                     dunbar
                         buffalo.
