               ext. pony herd - day

               smiles a lot, worm and otter (who now sports a crude splint 
               on his arm) are occupying an open space in the midst of a 
               huge pony herd.

               they should be on guard against enemies but the three boys 
               are sitting on the ground, absorbed in a gambling game.
