               wind in his hair and his friends, two of them riding double, 
               are going slowly home when they see a courier coming in their 
               direction. they rein in waiting for the young man cantering 
               toward them.

               he speaks directly to wind in his hair.

                                     courier
                         the party that went against the pawnee 
                         is coming in...

               wind in his hair says nothing.

                                     courier
                         there are many hearts on the ground.
