               ext. prairie - day

               just as dunbar did on his trip out with timmons, someone is 
               running a palm over the tips of the tall prairie grass. this 
               hand, however, is red.

               a lone indian is standing in the grass, his pony at his side. 
               he is a real indian; tough, wild and free. he is a person of 
               special maturity. he radiates wisdom and is a man of 
               responsibility in his community. he is a sioux medicine man. 
               he is kicking bird.
