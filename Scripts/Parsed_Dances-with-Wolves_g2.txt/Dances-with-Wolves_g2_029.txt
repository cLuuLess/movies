               dunbar is off the seat riding atop the mountain of supplies. 
               he is writing in his journal.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         we have been gone four days now and 
                         still we have seen no signs of life. 
                         only earth and sky.

               dunbar stops his writing.

                                     dunbar
                         how far do you make the fort?

                         far.

                                     dunbar
                         how far?

                                     timmons
                         forty or fifty miles, maybe... what's 
                         the big hurry on sedgewick?

                                     dunbar
                         it's going to be my post... my home.

                                     timmons
                         you ain't hard to please, i'll say 
                         that.

               timmons slows the wagon and stops.  he has seen something.

                                     timmons
                         look yonder.
