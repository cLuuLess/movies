               ext. prairie - day

               the hunters are advancing across the prairie, spreading out 
               in a formation that will encircle part of the herd.

               the lightning bolts on wind in his hair's pony are in motion. 
               cisco's bolts are moving too.

               there's a lump in dunbar's throat. he knows nothing of what 
               is expected of him but he's doing it anyway. he glances to -- 
               his right at wind in his hair and to his left at kicking 
               bird. they're both concentrated on what lies ahead.

               from the corner of his eye, he sees kicking bird look back. 
               the lieutenant looks too.

               it's a minor flap. three or four youngsters, eager to 
               distinguish themselves have trailed too close to the hunters 
               and are being turned back. dunbar recognizes one of them as 
               the boy who took charge of cisco at the village... smiles a 
               lot.

               like kicking bird, dunbar swings his face back to the front. 
               they're close enough now to hear the low bellowing of the 
               herd.
