               ext. sedgewick bluff - dawn

               a hatless soldier in a tattered overcoat, captain cargill, 
               is on the bluff staring morosely through his telescope. one 
               hand rubs a sore spot on his jaw. he sticks the telescope in 
               his overcoat pocket. he wedges a hand into his mouth and 
               wiggles a loose tooth. he gives it a tug but it is not ready 
               to come out.

               the breeze is coming up and captain cargill pulls his overcoat 
               closed. as he slips his last button through the hole, it 
               breaks off, bounces off of his foot and rolls a few feet 
               down the bluff.

               captain cargill watches the button forlornly, making no move 
               to go after it. he raises his head once more and looks to 
               the east. nothing is out there.
