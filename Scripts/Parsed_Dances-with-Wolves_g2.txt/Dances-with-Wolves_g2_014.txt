                         alright by me.

               dunbar gazes down along his leg. blood is pumping from his 
               wound.

                                     dunbar
                         forgive me father.

               again he digs his heels into the buckskin's flanks and they 
               fly down the line. the confederates are trying to reload. a 
               few are able to get off a hasty shot, but they're all too 
               late.
