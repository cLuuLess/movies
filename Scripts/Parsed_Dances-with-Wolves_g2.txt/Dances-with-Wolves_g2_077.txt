               ext. prairie - night

               the three boys are shrieking as they race across the prairie 
               with their prize. otter has cisco by a lead line. smiles a 
               lot gallops alongside.

                                     smiles a lot
                         let me take him otter.

                                     otter
                         i have him.

               to smiles a lot's amazement, otter is suddenly gone. he's 
               zooming backward in midair.

               otter comes to ground a few yards back, throwing up a puff 
               of dust. cisco has screeched to a halt. now he rears up, 
               twisting until the rope is free of otter. then he sticks his 
               tail in the air and makes tracks in the direction of the 
               fort. worm chases after cisco as smiles a lot sees to otter
