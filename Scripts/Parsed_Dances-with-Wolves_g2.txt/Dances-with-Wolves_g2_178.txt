               part of the old bed has collapsed but some of it is still 
               strong enough for support and here dances with wolves is 
               sitting as he leafs through his beloved journal.

               he reads a little entry here and there, sometimes smiling at 
               the memory.

               a few blank pages remain at the back of the book. reaching 
               these he closes the journal and holds it on his lap, letting 
               his mind run for a moment.

               now he notices the old pen and ink. he picks them up and 
               opens the journal for one last entry.

               he writes: "i love stands with a fist" and signs himself 
               "dances with wolves."

               something is moving outside and dunbar stops, drawing his 
               gun out. he drops the book on the bed and carefully moves 
               outside.
