               dunbar is sitting cross-legged in the grass. his mouth is 
               occupied with chewing. in one hand is a knife, in the other 
               is a chunk of slab bacon. he saws off a slice and extends 
               it, waiting patiently.

               the wolf is sitting only a few feet away. he wants the offered 
               meat but cannot bring himself to eat from a human hand. 
               finally, dunbar flips the bacon into the grass and two socks 
               pounces on it. he takes his prize toward the river and out 
               of view.

               dunbar starts for his quarters. he stops. the hair on the 
               back of his neck is standing straight up.
