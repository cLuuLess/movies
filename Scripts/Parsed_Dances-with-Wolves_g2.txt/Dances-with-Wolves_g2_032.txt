               ext. sedgewick cut bank - dawn

               cargill is walking along the base of the cut bank. he stops, 
               staring up at a series of holes dug into the bluff. their 
               entrance covered with "found" draperies of all description. 
               he works up the courage to call out.

                                     cargill
                         corporal guest... corporal guest... 
                         corporal guest. corporal guest, you 
                         don't have to talk to me... just 
                         please come out.

               at last there's some real movement behind one of the holes 
               and corporal guest crawls through one of the curtains. he 
               neither salutes nor speaks. he blinks down at cargill, looking 
               more like a hobo than a soldier.

                                     cargill
                         it's the end... assemble the men in 
                         front of my quarters.
