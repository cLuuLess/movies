               laughing all the way.

                                     dances with wolves
                         a bone... right?

               stands with a fist doesn't really hear. she's rocking back 
               and forth on the floor of the arbor, laughing so hard that 
               her eyes are tearing.

               her laughter subsides to an occasional chuckle but dances 
               with wolves is quiet. he gazes at her face.

                         what is the word for beautiful?

               stands with a fist hesitates in her answer, meeting his gaze. 
               a little boy pokes his head in.

                                     little boy
                         what are you doing here?

               respond.

                                     stands with a fist
                         it is hot. we are sitting in the 
                         shade.

               this makes so much sense to the little boy that he trots in 
               and flings himself on stands with a fist's lap. then a squirm 
               or two.

                                     little boy
                         i'm hungry.

                                     stands with a fist
                         alright.

               stands with a fist leads the little boy off to a lodge. dances 
               with wolves watches her walk away. from out of nowhere, smiles 
               a lot appears. he's been milling about the arbor 
               eavesdropping, and looks over to dunbar with a teasing smile.

                                     smiles a lot
                         ...a bone.
