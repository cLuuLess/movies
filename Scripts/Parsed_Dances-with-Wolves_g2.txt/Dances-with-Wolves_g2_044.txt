               int. quarters - night

               a lamp turns up, casting a glow over dunbar's incredibly 
               cramped quarters.

               he adjusts the lamp and sits back on the bunk, his journal 
               on his lap. he begins an entry.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         have arrived to find fort sedgewick 
                         deserted. am now waiting for the 
                         garrison's return or word from 
                         headquarters. post is in exceedingly 
                         poor condition. have decided to assign 
                         myself clean-up duty beginning 
                         tomorrow. supplies abundant. the 
                         country is everything i dreamed it 
                         would be. there can be no place like 
                         this on earth.

               dunbar signs the entry, yawns contentedly and reaches to 
               turn down the lamp.

               a wolf howls somewhere outside. it's low at first but it 
               keeps on building. at its height, the howl sounds as though 
               it is coming from, something gigantic.

               dunbar is still listening after it's gone. he hears wood 
               snap in the direction of the river then all is quiet again. 
               without hesitating, he slips the big revolver out of its 
               holster and cradling it like a teddy bear, slips it under 
               his blanket.

               the light is left blazing.
