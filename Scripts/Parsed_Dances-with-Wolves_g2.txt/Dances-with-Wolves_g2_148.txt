               ext. kicking bird's lodge - dawn

               the camera pans off the tipi to the eastern horizon.

               it's the pony herd. and dunbar is walking in that direction. 
               his feet leave a trail in the wet grass.

               first one, then two, then whole groups of ponies lift their 
               heads and prick their ears at dunbar's approach.

               dunbar walks to the edge of this great sea of horses, he 
               stops and gives a long whistle.

               a figure, previously unseen, sits up on the back of a pony. 
               it's smiles a lot. he and dunbar glance blankly at each other. 
               but in a moment, both are distracted by movement in the herd.

               horses are being gently eased out of the way by cisco who is 
               answering dunbar's call. a moment later and they are reunited 
               at the edge of the herd.

               grasping a hunk of cisco's mane, dunbar starts to lead him 
               back to the village. the temporary camp is starting to come 
               to life. and with cisco at his side, dunbar pauses to take 
               in the scene.
