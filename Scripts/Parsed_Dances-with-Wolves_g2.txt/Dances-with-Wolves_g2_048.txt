               ext. river - day

               an antelope skeleton is being pulled from the muck.

               dunbar is stripped to the waist as he drags the body through 
               deep water. covering his face against the stink is a bandana. 
               his pants are soaked and he's sweating hard.

               at the stream's edge he heaves the antelope onto a pile 
               holding several others. under the bodies is a huge bed of 
               trash which he has already collected.

               the body he tosses up slips and he has to right it. now he 
               wades back into the river and searches the water with his 
               hands for more.
