               ext. hole - night (flashback)

               the moon is up. christine is feebly clawing at the ground, 
               trying to pry herself out of a tiny hole. she gives up. then, 
               from the burrow's dark entrance comes the thin, cracking 
               voice of a little girl.

                                     christine
                         now i lay me down to sleep. i pray 
                         the lord my soul to keep. if i die 
                         before i wake, i pray the lord my 
                         soul to take.
