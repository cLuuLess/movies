               an escort of six warriors is galloping up the bluff to join 
               the rest of the column as they make their way back to camp. 
               dunbar looks on, a travois of meat next to him and gives a 
               last wave.

                         to stay any longer would've been 
                         useless. we had all the meat we could 
                         possibly carry. we had hunted for 
                         three days, losing half a dozen ponies 
                         and only three men injured. many 
                         times i have felt alone but until 
                         this afternoon, i have never felt 
                         completely lonely.
