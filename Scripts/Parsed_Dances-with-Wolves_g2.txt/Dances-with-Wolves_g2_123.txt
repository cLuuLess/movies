               ext. prairie - day

               dunbar and kicking bird are riding together at the flank of 
               ten bears' entourage.

               far in the distance, the lieutenant sees something strange 
               on the prairie... pink bumps are dotting the landscape up 
               ahead. and black specks are moving about on the bumps.
