               ext. temporary camp - night

               wind in his hair finishes sucking on the rib bone and tosses 
               it to a dog that's been trailing him. kicking bird is walking 
               toward him. he notices the new tunic and gives wind in his 
               hair a dubious look.

                                     kicking bird
                         where is loo ten tant?

                                     wind in his hair
                         i ate him.

               kicking bird reaches out and feels the strange material on 
               either side of wind in his hair's chest.

                                     wind in his hair
                         i traded for it.

                                     kicking bird
                         does it scratch the skin?

                                     wind in his hair
                         a little. but do you see how good it 
                         looks. everyone says it looks good. 
                         everyone.
