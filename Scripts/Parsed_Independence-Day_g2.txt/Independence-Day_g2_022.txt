	ext. space - the orbit - same

	rolling over us, the immense under-belly of this enormous
	craft obliterates our view.  a loud screech.  suddenly the
	bottom begins to segment.

	dozens of large sections begins to disengage, extracting
	themselves, twisting away from the larger bilge.

	the separated segments themselves are enormous.  slowly they
	twist downwards on a collision course to the blue planet
	below... earth.
