	moishe inspects a photo of constance with the president,
	impressed he nods with approval.

			(to himself)
		very nice.

	constance is looking at david's laptop displaying the
	breakdown of the alien signal.

				constance
		and when is the countdown supposed
		to expire?

				david
			(checking)
		fifty six minutes, forty five
		seconds.

	constance runs her fingers through her hair, exasperated.
	moishe turns, listens.

				constance
		what do you want me to do?

				david
		i want you to leave with us.
		right now.

				constance
		i can't leave.  we have to tell
		this to the president.

				david
		he's not going to listen to me.

	surprised at his son, moishe steps forward.

				moishe
		sure he'll listen.  why wouldn't
		he?

				david
		because last time i saw him i
		punched him in the face.

				moishe
		you punched the president in the
		face?

				david
		he wasn't the president then.

				constance
		david thought i was having an
		affair, which i wasn't.

				moishe
		punched the president?  oh my god.
