	int. moishe's olds - night

	moishe looks to the other side of the freeway, jam packed.  on
	his side, they are the only car for miles.

				moishe
		the whole world is trying to get
		out of washington and we're the
		only schmucks trying to get in.

	as moishe drives, david distracts him as he unpacks his
	backpack unloading his laptop.  he grabs a cd.

				moishe (cont'd)
		what the hell is that?

				david
		this, pops, is every phone book in
		america.

				moishe
		you think an important person like
		constance is going to be listed?

				david
		she always keeps her portable
		phone listed, for emergencies.
		sometimes it's just her first
		initial, sometime her nickname...

	david starts to look it up.  suddenly...

	dozens of cars heading straight for them

	in the attempt to get out, hundreds of cars have been re-
	directed by the military to use the opposite side of the
	highway.

				moishe
		oh my god!

	moishe swerves violently to avoid collision, barely missing
	the oncoming traffic.  dodging right to left, moishe hangs on
	for dear life.

	a military office, assisting in diverting the cars turns just
	in time to see the olds whiz by.

	david and moishe are bounded around the inside of the car as
	moishe tries to veer through traffic.

	suddenly a truck  blocks off their only escape route.

	moishe turns hard and drives up onto the right shoulder.

	overhead angle - olds and traffic

	the olds is the only car in headed that direction.  using the
	shoulder, swerving to miss barricades, they drives off an exit
	ramp.

				david
		nice driving, pops!

	dangerously close to a heart attack, moishe is, for once, at a
	loss for words.  over their adrenaline pumped faces...

				male voice (v.o.)
		...put your hands together for
		sabrina!
