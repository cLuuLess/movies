	ext. top of canyon - continuous

	rolling end over end, the attacker is banged up badly as it
	finally comes to a stop.

	not far away, steve has a quick, hard, landing.  rolling over,
	steve quickly pops the buckles on the chute and frees himself.

	he stands and looks around.  spotting the beat up and
	incapacitated alien attacker, steve gets an angry resolved
	look.  he marches over to the fallen alien attacker.  he scans
	it quickly, spots a type of door that has been knocked ajar.

	with all his might, steve yanks the door open.

	an alien

	for the first time we get a quick glance at these aliens, an
	odd hybrid creature with fluctuating skeletal structure.

	the reason we only get a quick glance is because the moment it
	turns woozily towards us, steve rears back and slugs him in
	the face, knocking the alien totally unconscious.

	his anger finally subsiding, exhaustion taking over, steve
	stands over the craft, slowly withdrawing the prized victory
	dance cigar.  he lights it and takes a long angry puff.

				steve
		now that's a close encounter.
