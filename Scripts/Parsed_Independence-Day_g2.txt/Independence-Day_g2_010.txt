	int. whitmore's bedroom - fre-dawn

	laying in bed thomas j. whitmore reads a stack of papers.  the
	phone rings.

				woman's voice
			(filtering through phone)
		hi. it's me.

	the warm look on whitmore's face tells us everything about how
	he feels about the woman on the other end.

				whitmore
		hi honey.  what time is it there?
