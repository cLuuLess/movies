	steve looks down over the side of his fighter.

	steve's pov - the grand canyon - same

	steve hits the brakes.  surprised, the attacker sails past.

	taking the moment, steve dives down into the grand canyon.

				steve
			(to himself)
		okay, jerk-off.  let's have some
		fun.

	the attacker recovers, dives after steve who flies dangerously
	close to the canyon walls.  the attacker has trouble keeping
	up with him but does.

	steve puts on a clinic in advanced aerobatics, banking,
	diving, swerving.

	the attacker seems to be improving, following closer and
	closer.

	steve ducks into smaller canyons, twisting sideways.  still
	the attacker follows close.

	fuel gauge - running low

	near empty.  frustrated, steve gets pissed.

				steve
		damn it!

	steve turns down a dead and side canyon.  the attacker is
	right on his tail.

				steve
		let's see if you're fully
		equipped.

	the fighter is on a collision course with the end of the
	canyon wall.  suddenly steve yanks his aces ii - ejection
	seat.

	stave sails upwards into the air.

	the fighter crashes into the canyon wall.

	the attacker can't turn in time.  he tries to pull up, over
	it, just misses the top of the canyon wall.

	as the nose of the attacker hits the tip of the canyon wall
	the attacker is flipped over, rolling end over end over the
	top of the canyon.

	the parachute on steve's ejection seat pops open.
