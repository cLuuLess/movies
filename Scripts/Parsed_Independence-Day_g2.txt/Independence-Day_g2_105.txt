		...the helicopters are making
		their final approach...

	on the middle monitor, through the night vision camera on the
	lead helicopter we see the side of the craft as the
	helicopters near. everyone in the room watches, tense.

	constance enters and kneels down next to the president,
	whispering in his ear.  the president gets up and follows
	constance.  chief of staff nimziki objects.

				nimziki

	the president silences him with a look.  as they exit.

				constance
		i don't know how you put up with
		him.

				president
		he used to run the nasa.  he knows
		where all the bones are buried.
		comes in handy.

				constance
		i'll bet.
