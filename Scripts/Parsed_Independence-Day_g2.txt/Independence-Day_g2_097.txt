	the plane lands, skids into a turn.  russell jumps out, walks
	over to the trailer.  we can tell he's drunk again.

				miguel
		they let you out?

				russell
		just what the hell do you think
		you're doing?

	miguel moves to meet russell away from the trailer, not
	wanting the others to hear.

				miguel
		we're leaving, don't try and stop
		us.

				russell
		you're not going anywhere.  you
		hear me?  i'm still your father.

	miguel explodes, this has been building up for some time.

				miguel
		no, you're not!  you're just the man
		who married my mother.  you're
		nothing to me!

	russell is momentarily silent, stunned.  recovering...

				russell
		troy's still my son no matter how
		you feel about me.

				miguel
		for once in your life think about
		what's best for troy.  who has to
		beg for money to buy him medicine
		when you screw up?  who?

	suddenly we hear glass crashing.  both men spin to find troy
	standing behind them.

				troy
		stop it!  i'm not a baby!  i don't
		need your stupid medicine.  i
		don't need anyone to take care of
		me!

	miguel leans down to see the broken medicine bottle on the
	floor.  miguel rushes over to him, furious.

				miguel
		you know what this stuff costs?
		do you want to get sick again!?
		do you!?

	frustrated, miguel shoves troy aside and heads back into the
	trailer.  wobbly from the drinking, russell stands there
	pathetically, watching.
