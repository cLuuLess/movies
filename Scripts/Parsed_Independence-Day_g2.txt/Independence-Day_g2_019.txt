				miguel

				troy
		it's all fuzzy.

				miguel
		you're gonna break it.  just leave
		it alone.  here, take your
		medicine.

	miguel sits a small bottle of medicine and a spoon down in
	front of troy.  troy pushes the bottle away.

				troy
		i don't need it.

				miguel
			(pushing it back)
		just take it, dick head.
			(turning to his sister)
		alicia!  make sure he takes his
		medicine.

	his sister, alicia, fourteen, hormones kicking in, testing
	boundaries, listens to her walkman while putting on too much
	makeup.  miguel throws a dish towel to get her as troy hits
	the television again.
