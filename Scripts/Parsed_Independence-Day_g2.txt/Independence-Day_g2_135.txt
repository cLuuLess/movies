		you will be the first wave in our
		counter attack.  though
		surveillance satellite
		reconnaissance has been impaired,
		we have a fix on our primary
		target.

	steve and jimmy sit next to each other near the back of the
	room

				steve
			(whispered)
		you won't exactly need radar to
		find it.

	jimmy chuckles.  watson is annoyed.

				watson

		briefing, lt. hill?

	steve smiles confidently.

				steve
