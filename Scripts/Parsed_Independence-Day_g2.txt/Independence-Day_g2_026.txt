	ext. california farmlands, imperial valley - day

	racing over back roads behind a long open field, miguel rides
	his beat-up motor bike, searching.  looking up he sees
	something in the air.

	miguel's pov - an old bi-wing airplane

	converted into a crop-duster, buzzes overhead.  spraying
	insecticide wildly, the plane zigzags over the field.

			(yelling)
		russell!  god damn it, russell!

	looking down from the cockpit, russell brennon waves stupidly.
	shaggy blonde hair and two days' growth, russell is the image
	of a fifty-one-year-old little boy.

	miguel follows him below, screaming at him.  russell, flying
	recklessly, looks down at miguel not understanding.  by the
	time he looks back he sees...

	a line of trees

	at the edge of the field, nearly on top of him.  in a trick
	move, russell turns the plane on its side, and slices through
	the narrow gap between the trees.

	miguel screams with delight at his prowess.  miguel looks
	pissed.

	angle - other side of trees - moments later

	miguel races over, skidding to a halt next to the landed bi-
	with plane.

				miguel
		just what the hell do you think
		you're doing?

				russell
			(climbing down)
		i'm bringing home the bacon.
		earning my keep.  and doing a fine
		job if i do say so myself.

				miguel
		it's the wrong field, you idiot!
		lucas' farm is on the other side
		of town.

				russell
		you sure?

				miguel
		damn it, he was doing you a favor.
		you know how hard it is to find
		someone who doesn't think you're
		completely crazy?
			(more)
		what are we supposed to do now?
		huh?  where are we supposed to go
		now?

	pissed, miguel peels away, kicking gravel back at russell.
	pathetically, he reaches into his jacket and pulls out a
	bottle of jack daniels.  he takes a healthy swig.
