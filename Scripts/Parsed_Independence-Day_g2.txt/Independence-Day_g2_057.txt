	ext. black top basket ball court, new york - same

	kids playing basket ball.  a young boy stops playing, staring
	skyward.  one by one, they all look upwards, stunned as a long
	dark shadow creeps over them.

	with a loud crash, several new york cabs slam into one another
	in the street.  two more cars crash into them.  a pile up
	ensues.
