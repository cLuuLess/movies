	steve's squadron banks hard, skirting the edge of the ship's
	protective shield.

	as the fighters approach, the alien ship's enormous attack bay
	doors open.  suddenly dozens of alien attackers dart out
	towards our fighters.

		evasive maneuvers!  check six!

	just moving away in time, our fighters barely dodge the
	oncoming enemy attackers as they fire a hailstorm of firepower
	(tracker bullet-like lasers) showering the sky.

	as steve's plane dives, an attacker follows.  jimmy's plane
	pulls up behind the attacker.

	jimmy's hud has the alien attacker in his sights.

		got you covered, stevie.

	jimmy fires, another aim-9 sidewinder takes off.

	the sidewinder overtakes the attacker as steve rolls away out
	of position.  five yards before the sidewinder can get to the
	attacker, it explodes.

				jimmy
			shit!  they've got shield too.

	steve's fighter

	banks back around to get a shot.  just as he turns, three
	american fighters are blown to ribbons from attacker tracer
	fire.

	the attackers are in hot pursuit of jimmy's fighter.  the
	fighter flying next to jimmy is demolished.

				steve
		jimmy, roll right.  i'll cover.

	jimmy's fighter narrowly rolls away from the tracer fire as
	steve fires another sidewinder, momentarily distracting the
	attacker.

	jimmy falls in line with steve as the attackers turn on them.
	both fighters jerk downwards at a ninety degree angle at mach
	one.  narrowly missing the ground, they bank away.  the
	attackers can't follow.
