	as constance watches the president, she unconsciously mouths
	the words of his speech, after all, she did write them.  a
	press aide tugs on her sleeve.  she tries to wave her off.

				press aide
		he says he's your husband.

	her expression drops.  she takes the phone from her.

				constance
