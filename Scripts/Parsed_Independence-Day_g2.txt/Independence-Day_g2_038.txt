				general grey
			(to president)

		immediately.

	... the president hesitates, he turns to constance.

				president
		can we expect the same kid of
		panic here as in russia?

				constance
		more than likely.

				nimziki
		mr. president, you can discuss
		this on the way.

	torn, the president grapples with a decision.  finally...

				president
                i'm not leaving.

				nimziki
		we must maintain a working
		government in a time of crisis...

				president
		i want the vice president,
		secretary of defense, the whole
		cabinet and the joint chiefs taken
		to a secured location.
		i'm staying here.  i am not going
		to add to a public hysteria that
		could cost lives.

				nimziki
		but, mr. president...

				president
		so far these things have not
		become hostile.  for the moment
		let's assume they won't.
			(to constance)
		connie, let's issue statements
		advising people not to panic, to
		stay home and take cover.

	constance issues commands to her staff as they quickly
	exit along with most people in the room.  general grey goes
	over to the president.

				general grey
		with your permission, mr.
		president, i'd like to remain my
		your side.

				president
		i had a feeling you would.

				general grey
		sir, what happens if they do
		become hostile?

				president
		then god help us.
