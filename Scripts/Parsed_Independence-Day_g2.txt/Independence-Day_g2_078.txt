	david bangs on the door.  it flies open.  moishe is holding a
	hunting rifle, pointing it at david.

				david
		pops!

				moishe
		the television said they've
		started with the looting already
		vultures.

				david
		you still got the olds?

				moishe
		you want to borrow the car?  you
		don't have a license.

				david
