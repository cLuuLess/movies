	ext. trailer park - night

	a long crowded highway of people trying to escape from los
	angeles can be seen in the distance.  the huge space craft
	hovering behind them.

	miguel is on the roof of the trailer, adjusting the t.v.
	antenna trying to get a picture.  suddenly the image clears
	and we see a group of people in a crowded hallway.

		...a local crop duster was
		arrested today attempting to land
		at edwards air force base...

	on the t.v. we see russell being escorted to a police car.
	mortified, miguel can't believe what he's seeing.

				russell
		they've got to do something.
		i was abducted by space aliens ten
		years ago.  they did all kinds of
		experiments on me.  they've been
		studying us for years, learning
		our weakness.  we've go to do
		something before they kill us all!

				troy (o.s.)

	just as troy starts to climb up, miguel changes the channel to
	mrs. whitmore.  troy sits down next to miguel.

				mrs. whitmore

		...we need to remain calm.  as
		more people decide to leave the
		cities, safety is key...

				miguel
		troy, you remember uncle hector,
		from tucson?

				troy
		he's got that sega saturn cd, 64
		bit, right?

				miguel
		yeah.  what would you think if we
		went there to live for a while?

				troy
		that'd be cool!

	miguel thinks for a second, makes a decision.

				miguel
		pack up, we're going.

	miguel jumps down from the roof.  troy climbs down the ladder.

				troy
			(yelling after him)
		what about dad?

	alicia and older boy

	kissing.  it's getting hot.  alicia laughs, pushes him away.

				older boy
		this could be our last night on
		earth.  you don't want to die a
		virgin, do you?

				alicia
		what makes you think i'm a virgin?

	the older boy is taken off guard.  before he can answer the
	tarp they were hiding under is ripped away.  miguel stands
	there.

				miguel
		come on, we're going.

				alicia
		i'm not going anywhere...

	miguel grabs her by the wrist and pulls her away.
