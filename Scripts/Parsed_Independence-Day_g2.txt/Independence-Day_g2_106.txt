	int. oval office - same

	the door flies open and constance and the president enter.
	the moment president whitmore sees david, he freezes.

				president
		what the hell's he doing here?

	moishe, bursting, steps forward.

				moishe
		moishe martinsburg, mr. president.

				constance
		my ex-husband works in satellite
		communications.

				president
		i don't have time for this...

	with a bang, david suddenly knocks everything off the
	president's desk and starts to draw on the ink blotter.

				david
		it's about &quot;line o sight,&quot; mr.
		president...

	david draws a circle representing earth and a smaller circle
	just away from it.  the president reluctantly nears.

				david
		...if you wanted t coordinate
		with ships all over the world, you
		couldn't send one signal to every
		place at the same time.  that's
		called line of sight...

	drawing a line from the ship of either side of the earth, we
	see that you could not send a signal to the other side.

				david (cont'd)
		...you'd need to relay your signal
		using satellites...

	david draws small satellites surrounding earth.

				david (cont'd)
		...to reach each ship.  i have
		found a signal hidden inside our
		own satellite network.

	suddenly an aide, alex, appears in the doorway.

				alex
		excuse me, mr. president.  they're
		starting.

	the president turns to the monitor in his office.  we see the
	helicopters turning on the light boards affixed to the front
	of their cockpits.  he turns back to david.

				david
		mr. president, they are using our
		own satellites against us and the
		clock is ticking.
