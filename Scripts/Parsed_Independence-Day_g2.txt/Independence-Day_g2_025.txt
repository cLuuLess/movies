	int. david's cubicle - compact cable - day

	david retrieves his home-make cup-a-soup.  we see this cubicle
	clearly has the david touch; ecology posters, plants, tons of
	computers and electronic gizmos.

				marty
		please, tell me you're getting
		something.

	marty enters, looking over david's shoulder as he eats.

				david
		there's good news and bad news.

				marty
		what's the bad news?

				david
		you're in meal penalty for
		disturbing my lunch.

				marty
		and the good news is you won't
		charge me.

				david
		no.  the good news is i found the
		problem and it's not our
		equipment.  there's some weird
		signal embedded within the
		satellite feed.

				marty
		that's the good news?

	david slides over to another computer and turns on an
	intricate computation program.

				david
		yes, because the analog signal has
		a definite sequential digital
		patterns embedded within it.  when
		i find the exact binary sequence
		and i apply a phase reversed
		signal to that calculated spectra
		analyzer i built you last
		christmas, we should be able to
		block out the overlay completely...

				marty
		...and we'll be the only guys in
		town with a clear picture?  that's
		my man.
