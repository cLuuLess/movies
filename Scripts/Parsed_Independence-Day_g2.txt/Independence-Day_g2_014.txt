	int. breakfast table - continuous

	two servants are preparing breakfast as whitmore and constance
	enter.  whitmore sits down, grabs a coffee.

				whitmore
		you're up early this morning,
		connie.

	she tosses him one of the many newspapers in her hands.

				constance
		they're not attacking your
		policies, they're attacking your
		age.

		&quot;...addressing congress, whitmore
		seems less like the president and
		more like the orphan child oliver
		asking, 'please sir, i'd like some

				whitmore
		clever.

				constance
		age was never an issue when you
		stuck to your gun.  you were
		thought of as young and

		gotten lost.  there's too much
		compromise, too much politics.

				whitmore
			(pointedly)
		isn't it amazing how fast everyone
		can turn against you.

	realizing she may be pushing him too far, she hands him
	another paper.

				constance
		well, the orange county register

		sexiest men of the year.

				whitmore
		you see, substance at last.

	an aide appears at the doorway.

				constance
		excuse me, mr. president.  it's
		the secretary of defense.

	whitmore goes to the phone, picks it up.

				whitmore
		yes?  say that again?

	an old russian satellite

	drifting away from us the old russian satellite becomes
	smaller and smaller.  we pan with it as we see it's on a
	collision course with something huge.

	suddenly the satellite explodes on impact with the much larger
	object that dwarfs the puny piece of hardware.  as huge as it
	is, we get the feeling we've only seen a portion of the total.
