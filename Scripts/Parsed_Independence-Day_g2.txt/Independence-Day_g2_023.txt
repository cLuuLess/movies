	int. white house - basement corridors - day

	under a barrage of questions from her own staff, constance
	hurries down the corridor.

				aide #1
		cnn is running a story that we're
		covering up some kind of nuclear
		testing experiments...

				constance
		tell them to run with it if they
		want to embarrass themselves.

				aide #2
		nasa has been up my butt all
		morning.  they want to know our
		position.

				constance
		our official position is we don't
		have an official position.

				aide #3
		connie, what the hell is going on?

	constance escapes into the elevator, turns around.

				constance
			(smiles confidently)
		come on, people.  would i keep you
		guys out of the loop?

				aide #1
		in a second!

				aide #2
		absolutely.

	before she can retort, the elevator doors close.
