	int. compact cable office - continuous

	dashing off the stairs, david stops seeing that the room is
	now completely empty.  the wall of monitors play for no one.
	david walks up to one, adjusting the volume.

	t.v. - cnn broadcast - (distorted broadcast signal)

	a space ship logo spins next to the words visitors: contact or
	crisis.  wolf blitzer comes on screen live from the pentagon.

				wolf blitzer
		pentagon officials are reporting
		more ships have just arrived over
		the capitals of india, england and
		germany.

	as he speaks we get quick glimpses of the other ships.

				marty (o.s.)
		i know, babycakes.  calm down.

	david spins around at the sound of the voice but the room is
	still empty.  david leans down and looks under a desk where he
	finds marty still on the phone with his wife.

				david
		tell her to get the kids and leave
		town.

				marty
		what happened?

				david
			(yells)
		just do it!

	marty realizes david is dead serious.

				marty
		babycakes, pack the kids up and
		take them to your mother's.  don't
		ask.  go.

	mary hangs up, crawls out from under the table.

				marty (cont'd)
		okay, why did i just send my
		family to atlanta?

				david
		remember i told you that the
		signal hidden within our satellite
		signal is slowly recycling down to
		extinction.

				marty
		not really...

				david
		that signal.  it's a countdown.

				marty
			(confused)
		a countdown to what?

				david
		think.  it's like in chess.  first
		you strategically position your
		pieces.  then, when the timing's
		right.  you strike.

	david motions to the television.

				blitzer
		...there are additional
		unconfirmed sightings over japan,
		the mediterranean, and china...

				david
		they are positioning themselves
		all over the world and using this
		one signal to synchronize their
		efforts.  in approximately six
		hours the signal will disappear
		and the countdown will be over.

				marty
		then what?

				david
		checkmate.

	marty takes a beat to digest.  then, grabbing the phone....

				marty
		i gotta call my brother, my
		bookie, my lawyer... fuck my
		lawyer...

	david also grabs a phone.  suddenly the bank of monitors
	synchronize into one enormous image across the entire video
	wall; the president addressing the nation.
