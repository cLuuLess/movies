	his bike hoisted on his shoulder, david squeezes through the
	revolving doors. marty gilbert, short, nervous and harried,
	comes rushing over.

				marty
		what the hell is the point of
		having a beeper if you don't turn
		it on?

				david
		it was turned on.  i was ignoring
		you.  what's the big emergency?

				marty
		started this morning.  every
		channel is making like it's
		nineteen fifty.  snow, static, all
		kinds of distortions.  no one
		knows what the hell is going on.

	david deposits his bike in the kitchenette as marty tosses his
	coke bottle in the trash.  david retrieves it.

				david
		damn it, marty.  there's a reason
		we have bins labeled &quot;recycle.&quot;

	finding more bottles in the trash, david turns to marty
	accusingly.

				david
		what the hell is this?

				marty
		so sue me.

	before david can say anything, marty ushers him out of the
	room.
