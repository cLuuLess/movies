     int. the wigand's house, living room - day/twilight

     and he sees another man is in the living room...

                         wigand
               who the hell are you?!  what are you
               doing in my house?!

     and he sees lowell enter from the dining room...

                         lowell
               it's okay, jeff.

                         security guard
               mr. wigand, you need to speak to...

                         lowell
                   (wry)
               it's okay.  you got your own security
               now...

     wigand catches his breath.

                         wigand
               lowell, i can't afford --

                         lowell
               ...they "volunteered."  a friend owns a
               large security company.

                         talifaro
               how are you doing, mr. wigand?  i'm jon
               talifaro.  there'll be three of us on
               detail.

                         liane
                   (crossing through)
               i'm going to the store.  please explain
               our new "houseguests" to your children.

     and wigand looks at lowell...  barbara comes into the living
     room and holds onto her father's leg.

                         wigand
               i called richard scruggs in
               mississippi...

                         lowell
               i heard.

                         wigand
               i'm going to be a witness for them in
               their litigation.  so i'm going to fly to
               pascagoula to give a deposition...

                         lowell
               i know.  i'm going to go there tonight...

                         wigand
               did you have a good day?

                         deborah
               yes, i did.  i had a great day.

                         wigand
               coffee, lowell?

                         lowell
               yeah.
                   (to kids)
               want to play that game we were playing
               before?  you know, i think you got it up
               to five.  i was ahead of you.

     she goes over and holds his hand.  and as he holds her hand,
     seeing what his life has become, he looks up and his glance
     connects with lowell...
