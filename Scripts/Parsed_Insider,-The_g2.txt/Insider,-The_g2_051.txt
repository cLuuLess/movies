     int. the wigands' house, louisville - day

     the house is nearly empty.  liane, arms folded across her
     chest, is quietly standing in the empty living room.  jeffrey
     comes down the stairs...

                         wigand
               that's it...

     and it's quiet.  and liane holds herself, overcome...

                         liane
                   (beat)
               that's where our babies were born...
               debbie took her first steps, right
               there...in the grass.

     and they're quiet.

                         liane (cont'd)
               i didn't plan on this...

     liane looks at him, afraid.  and as he moves to hold her.

                         wigand
               hey, hey, hey, c'mon.  c'mon.  we can
               make this work for us.  okay?  it's
               just...it's a smaller scale.
               simpler...easier...more time.  more time
               together.  more time with the kids.  more
               time for us, okay?  it's just...  can you
               imagine me coming home from some job
               feeling good at the end of the day?  this
               is gonna be better.  this is gonna be
               better.

     and instead of this downturn turning them against each other,
     it brings them closer together.  and as they stand in the
     empty house...
