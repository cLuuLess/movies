     int. wigand's house, louisville - night

     and two older, local fbi agents #1 and #2 are sitting with
     jeffrey in his living room...

                         fbi agent #2
               did you handle the round, mr. wigand?

                         wigand
               yes, i'm afraid i did.

                         fbi agent #1
               we won't be able to lift usable prints.

                         fbi agent #2
               do you own a gun, mr. wigand?

                         wigand
               a gun?  yes.

                         fbi agent #2
               what caliber is your gun?

                         wigand
               what caliber is my gun?

                         fbi agent #2
               yes, sir.  what caliber is your gun?

                         wigand
                   (a dawning realization)
               what does that have to do with the price
               of tea in china?

     now one of the kids is crying, liane trying to calm her,
     takes her out of the room.

                         wigand (cont'd)
                   (a beat, realizing)
               you think i put that bullet in the
               mailbox myself...?

                         fbi agent #2
               if we could take a look, mr. wigand...

     and he gets up...  they follow him into the bedroom.  he
     unlocks the side drawer on his night stand, taking out a gun,
     giving it to one of the agents.

                         fbi agent #1
               why do you keep this gun?

                         wigand
               i don't think it's unconstitutional yet
               to own a gun.  i'm a target shooter.

                         fbi agent #2
               that bullet was for a .38 caliber.  do
               you own a .38?

                         wigand
               yes, i do.  a .38 target master.  in my
               gun safe downstairs.  a .45 gold cup.  a
               .22 target pistol.  so what?

                         fbi agent #2
                   (after a beat)
               do you have a history of emotional
               problems, mr. wigand?

                         wigand
               yes.  yes, i do.
                   (beat)
               yes, i get extremely emotional when
               assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!

     and we hear liane's voice from downstairs...

                         liane's voice (over)
                   (upset)
               i didn't tell you that so you could just
               pick it up and take it away.  jeffrey!

     and we see liane following fbi agent #3, coming up the stairs
     from the basement, and the agent is carrying jeffrey's
     computer...

                         wigand
               what's going on?

                         liane
               i told him that you had an e-mail death
               threat that said if you didn't shut the
               "f" up, they were going to kill you...

     agent #3 starts out of the house with the computer followed
     by #2.  jeffrey runs out after them.
