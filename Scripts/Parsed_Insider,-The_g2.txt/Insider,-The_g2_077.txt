                         lowell's voice (over)
               what are you talking about?

                         wigand

                         lowell's voice (over)
                   (frustrated)
               i heard you.  but i got to arrange a
               legal defense first.  i got to get you to
               testify in court, get it on public
               record.

                         wigand
                   (cuts in)
               then hold it off the air until you got
               that.  but i want to go to new york.
               and i want to go on the record.  right
               now!

                         lowell
               good.  but jeff...
