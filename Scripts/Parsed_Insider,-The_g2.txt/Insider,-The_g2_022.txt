     and we see jeffrey wigand, sitting at his desk in his office,
     working on his computer, hearing lowell...

                         lowell's voice (over)
                   (on the machine)
               this is lowell bergman with "60
               minutes"...  i'm doing a story on fire
               safety and cigarettes...  i have
