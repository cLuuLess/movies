     int. cbs, corridor outside editing room - day

     ...the group has spilled out the doorway, watching lowell's
     story come together.  beyond them, approaching, is mike
     wallace, coming to work...

                         bill felling
                   (leaving)
               ...helluva show, mike.  explosive
               material.

     people separate as mike pushes in.  lowell sees mike.  while
     tony baldo is making the edits on the avid...

                         lowell
                   (to mike)
               it went great in mississippi, mike.

                         mike wallace
               good.

     don hewitt enters from the corridor without jacket.

                         don hewitt
               i heard wigand's deposition got sealed.

                         lowell
               yeah, they argued he was going to reveal
               the secret formula of "kools" to the
               world.
                   (seriously)
               "sealed" doesn't hurt scruggs'
               litigation, and since we're the only ones
               with the story, i believe we're sitting
               on an exclusive.

                         mike wallace
               i like that...

                         don hewitt
               corporate has some questions.  we've got
               a meeting at black rock first thing in
               the morning.

                         lowell
               when's the air date?

                         debbie deluca
                   (to lowell)
               excuse me, lowell.  sharon's on line 3.

                         lowell
               tell her i'll call her back in ten.

                         baldo
               here we go.

     baldo now runs lowell's edit of the above sequence.  and we
     see the immediate impact.

     sandefur in close-up states "i believe that nicotine is not
     addictive."  wigand in matching close-up states "i believe he
     perjured himself."  then all seven ceos of big tobacco stand
     up and raise their hands and take an oath in front of
     congress to tell the truth while wallace says "...the whole
     line of people, the whole line of ceo's up there, all
     swearing that."  and wigand says off-screen with great
     emphasis "part of the reason i'm here is i felt"...and it
     cuts to wigand for a pause that makes the word "felt" resound
     and, then, he goes on to say on-camera "that their
     representation clearly misstated what they commonly knew.
     we're a nicotine delivery business."  we see the combination
     of art and truth woven into impact that has an audacity
     that's stirring and beautiful...
