     int. a kitchen area, cbs offices, new york - day

     we've entered mid-scene...  a monitor on a cart plays a 1/2-
     inch vcr of a c-span broadcast.  seven ceos of big tobacco...
     in front of a bas relief of the american eagle.  each in turn
     swears nicotine is not addictive or he doesn't know anything
     about health risks, they're not sure, maybe, maybe not,
     etc....

                         lowell (over)
               he referred to this...the seven dwarfs...

                         mike wallace (over)
               what "seven dwarfs?"

                         lowell (over)
               the seven ceos of big tobacco... referred
               to this...  said they should be afraid of
               him...  i assume, afraid of what he could
               reveal.
                   (to staff lawyers)
               now, you tell me.  what does this guy
               have to say that threatens these people?

     and, now, we see lowell, mike wallace and debbie deluca with
     two staff lawyers, mark stern and john harris, sitting around
     a workstation used as an improvised eating area.

     beyond them are the "60 minutes" offices, workstations, piles
     of material, television monitors hanging from the ceiling,
     all tuned to cbs programming...

                         mike wallace
               well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for
               you"...

                         lowell
               hardly new news.

                         mike wallace
               no shit.

                         lowell
               what's this?

                         mark stern
                   (re:  video)
               what that is is tobacco's standard
               defense.  it's the "we don't know"
               litany:  "addiction?  we believe not.
               disease?  we don't know.  we take a bunch
               of leaves, roll 'em together.  you smoke
               'em.  after that?  you're on your own.
               we don't know."
                   (beat)
               so...tells me nothing.
                   (beat)
               besides, you'll never get what he's got.

                         lowell
               why not?

                         john harris
               because of this guy's confidentiality
               agreement, he is never gonna be able to
               talk to you.

                         lowell
               that's not good enough.  this guy is the
               top scientist in the number three tobacco
               company in america.  he's a corporate
               officer.  you never get whistle-blowers
               from fortune 500 companies.  this guy is
               the ultimate insider.  he's got something
               to say; he wants to say it; i want it on
               "60 minutes."

                         john harris
               doesn't matter what he wants.

                         mike wallace
               am i missing something here?

                         john harris
               what do you mean, mike?

                         mike wallace
               he's got a corporate secrecy agreement?
               give me a break.  this is a public-health
               issue, like an unsafe airframe on a
               passenger jet or...some company dumping
               cyanide into the east river.  issues like
               that?  he can talk, we can air it.
               they've got no right to hide behind a
               corporate agreement.
                   (re:  his coffee)
               pass the milk...

                         john harris
                   (does)
               they don't need the right.  they've got
               the money.

                         mark stern
               the unlimited checkbook.  that's how big
               tobacco wins every time.  on everything.
               they spend you to death.  $600 million a
               year in outside legal.  chadbourne-parke.
               ken starr's firm, kirkland and ellis.
               listen.  gm and ford, they get nailed
               after 11 or 12 pick-ups blow up.  right?
               these clowns have never...i mean ever...

                         john harris
               not even once...

                         mark stern
               ...not even with hundreds of thousands
               dying each year from an illness related
               to their product...have ever lost a
               personal-injury lawsuit.  on this case,
               they'll issue gag orders, sue for breach,
               anticipatory breach, enjoin him, you, us,
               his pet dog, the dog's veterinarian...
               tie him up in litigation for ten of
               fifteen years.  i'm telling you, they bat
               a thousand.  every time.  he knows that.
               that's why he's not gonna talk to you...

     lowell's been quiet, thinking about something else...  now...

                         lowell
               okay, let's look through the looking
               glass the other way...

                         mike wallace
               what do you mean?

                         lowell
               we got a guy...who wants to talk but he's
               constrained.
                   (beat)
               what if he were "compelled"?

                         mike wallace
                   (eating)
               oh, torture?  great ratings.

                         mark stern
               what do you mean compelled?

                         lowell
                   (seriously)
               i mean compelled by a justice department,
               state courts, be a witness.  that would
               cut through any confidentiality
               agreement, wouldn't it?

                         mark stern
               yeah...

                         debbie deluca
               what does that do?

                         lowell
               what do you mean, what's it do?

                         debbie deluca
               what i mean is, like, how does it cut
               through the confidentiality agreement?

                         lowell
               because he has to reveal it in a court of
               law.  it's on record, it's out.  it's no
               secret anymore.  so how can they restrain
               his speech or retaliate?  it's out in the
               world...

                         mark stern
                   (nods)
               if you could engineer it into the court
               record, you might have something.  they
               would have a helluva time trying to
               restrain his speech then, wouldn't they?

     pause.

                         john harris
                   (still skeptical)
               yeah, but what venue?  and where does he
               get - does he have killer attorneys?

                         lowell
               i don't think he's got any attorneys.

                         mark stern
               he's gonna need attorneys who aren't
               afraid of risking years of litigation.
               and millions of dollars of their own
               dough in legal costs...

                         lowell
               what do you say, mike?  what do you
               think?

                         mike wallace
                   (pause)
               even if he gets the defense team, will he
               go for it?
