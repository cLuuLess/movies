     ext. wigands' house #2, backyard - late night

     meanwhile, jeffrey has crossed towards the darker back
     corners.  sudden rustling.  he spins, gun ready.  and the
     yellow eyes of a raccoon stare at him.

                         wigand
                   (to himself)
               you almost got your damn head blown
               off...

     the raccoon defiantly bares its teeth.

     jeffrey starts to go...but he sees something and stops...

     meanwhile, barbara has come to the sliding glass door...

     jeffrey sees one of the tomato trellises is crushed, stepped
     on...and in the vegetable garden's earth, are distinct,
     fresh, deep footprints...

                         barbara's voice (over)
               daddy...

     wigand steps between her and the garden, hiding it...
     extremely close on jeffrey, as he covers, trying to keep from
     his daughter the invasion, trying to control his emotions...

                         wigand
                   (reassuring her)
               it's just a raccoon, baby...nothing.

     he crosses to her, putting his arm, around her, walking her
     back inside...

                         wigand (cont'd)
               they're nocturnal.  you know what that
               means?  that means that they only come
               out at nighttime.

     he locks the sliding glass door, takes a last look outside.
