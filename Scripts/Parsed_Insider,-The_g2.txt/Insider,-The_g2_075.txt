     ext. the wigands' house, louisville - evening

     jeffrey, having arrived home from work, pulls the mail out of
     the mailbox, now stands, frozen, staring at something...  and
     he sees, standing upright in the back of the mail box, like a
     monument of threat, a single hollow point .38 caliber bullet.
     he freezes...  and simultaneously...

     liane and the girls are running toward him...like in a bad
     fucking dream.  he's looking at them.  liane is saying
     something about e-mail, but his slow-motion attention is
     still arrested by the statuesque bullet.  as they close on
     him...
