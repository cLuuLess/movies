     int. wigands' house #2, bedroom - late night

     jeffrey's asleep on his side next to liane, her back to him.
     his arm is draped over her, protectively.  there's a sound.
     he turns.  and he sees barbara in her nightgown, standing in
     the doorway...

                         wigand
               hey, baby.  what's wrong?

                         barbara
                   (terrified, whispers)
               what's that outside, daddy?

                         wigand
               did you see somebody or did you hear
               them?

                         barbara
               i heard them.

                         wigand
               where?

                         barbara
               in the backyard.

     fast, soundlessly, he's out of bed into old moccasins and
     trousers...
