     int. the phone booth, louisville high school - day

                         wigand
               she did not sue me.  we had a dispute
               over money...  i settled it, she dropped
               the complaint...
                   (angry)
               any other questions?

     and we'll go back and forth...

                         lowell
               yes.  did you lie about being on the
               american judo team in the olympics?

                         wigand
               what?

                         lowell
               some public relations guy got a hold of a
               tape of an interview...where you're
               saying you were on the american judo team
               in the olympics...?

                         wigand
                   (explosive)
               what kind of shit is this?  i was not on
               the team, i sparred with the olympic
               team...okay?

     and we see, unbeknownst to wigand, the p.i. in the raincoat,
     who interviewed his ex-wife, coming out of an administration
     office, walking towards us along the hallways...

                         lowell
               alright...the abc telemarketing company?

                         wigand
               abc...?

                         lowell
               abc telemarketing company.

                         wigand
                   (the absurdity)
               a can opener!  a $39.95 can opener.  i
               cancelled payment...  it was junk.
                   (sarcastic)
               you ever bounce a check, lowell?  you
               ever look at another woman's tits?  you
               ever cheat a little on your taxes?
                   (a beat, angry)
               whose life, if you look at it under a
               microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?

     the p.i. in the raincoat passes jeffrey, now, and doesn't
     even glance at him...

                         lowell
               that's the whole point, jeffrey.  that's
               the whole point.  anyone's.  everyone's.
               they are gonna look under every rock, dig
               up every flaw, every mistake you've ever
               made.  they are going to distort and
               exaggerate everything you've ever done,
               man.  don't you understand?

                         wigand
                   (shouts)
               what does this have to do with my
               testimony?

                         lowell
               that's not the point.

                         wigand
               what does this have to do with my
               testimony?!  i told the truth!  it's
               valid and true and provable!

                         lowell
               that's not the fucking point, whether you
               told the truth or not!  hello...?

                         wigand
               i told the truth...  i told the truth.

     and wigand's quiet, a deep, dark depression.  the school bell
     ring snaps him out of it...

                         wigand
                   (after a beat)
               i've got to teach class.  i've got to go.
               i've got to teach class.

                         lowell
                   (undaunted)
               and i've got to refute every fucking
               accusation made in this report before the
               wall street journal runs.
                   (a beat)
               i am trying to protect you, man!

     wigand's quiet.

                         wigand
                   (after a beat, the killer)
               well, i hope you improve your batting
               average.

     and he slams the phone down.  and as he stands in the phone
     booth, like a man in a glass booth, all alone...
