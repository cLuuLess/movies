     int. the federal drug administration agency, cafeteria,
     washington - day

     we see a man in his forties, eating a late lunch, getting
     paged in a crowded cafeteria.  an old 1930's wpa mural on the
     wall...  his pager goes off...

     doug oliver walks across the cafeteria to a bank of pay
     phones and dials.
