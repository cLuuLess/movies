     int. the studio, cbs - day

     and we enter mid-scene on jeffrey in a more formal demeanor,
     sitting in a chair, mike wallace sitting across from him,
     under the lights, taping an interview.  lowell, off camera.

                         mike wallace
               you heard mr. sandefur say before
               congress that he believed nicotine was
               not addictive...?

                         wigand
                   (nods)
               ...i believe mr. sandefur perjured
               himself because i watched those
               testimonies very carefully.

     lowell's reaction.  jeffrey's statements are stunning and
     powerful revelations...and dangerous ones to make.

                         mike wallace
               all of us did.  there was this whole line
               of people...whole line of ceos up there
               all swearing.

                         wigand
               part of the reason i'm here is i felt
               that their representation clearly
               misstated, at least within brown &
               williamson's representation, clearly
               misstated...what is common language
               within the company...we are in the
               nicotine delivery business.

                         mike wallace
               and that's what cigarettes are for...?

                         wigand
               a delivery device for nicotine.

                         mike wallace
               a delivery device for nicotine.  put it
               in your mouth, light it up, and you're
               gonna get your fix...

                         wigand
               you're gonna get your fix...

                         mike wallace
               you're saying that brown & williamson
               manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix,
               not by artificially adding nicotine, but
               by enhancing the effect of nicotine
               through the use of chemical elements such
               as ammonia...

                         wigand
                   (nods)
               the process is known as "impact
               boosting..."  while not spiking nicotine,
               they clearly manipulate it.  there's
               extensive use of this technology, know
               as "ammonia chemistry."  it allows for
               the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed
               in the lung and therefore affect the
               brain and central nervous system.
