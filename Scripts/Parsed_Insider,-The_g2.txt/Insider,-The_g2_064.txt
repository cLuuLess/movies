     int. wigands' new house, louisville - late at night

                         wigand
               good.
                   (beat)
               you have kids?

                         lowell's voice (over)
               we have a couple.  one's hers, one's
               mine.  everybody uses a different name.
                   (wry)
               modern marriage.
                   (beat)
               how's liane?

                         wigand
               she's okay.

     he looks at liane for beat.  we see his pov in medium shot.
     then he moves and sits on the floor in the living room.

                         wigand (cont'd)
               hold on a minute, lowell...
                   (after a beat)
               ...somebody...may be following me.  i
               don't know.  they came on the property...

                         lowell's voice (over)
               what do you mean followed you?  did you
               call the police?

                         wigand
               i don't want to be paranoid...  i mean,
               maybe it's a game.  some kind of mind
               game.

                         lowell's voice (over)
               well, what do you really think, though?

                         wigand
               i don't know what the fuck i really
               think!  are they doing it?  is some crank
               doing it?  are they doing it to make me
               feel paranoid?  are they doing it for
               real and don't give a shit what i think?
               i don't know!  i don't fucking know.

     and it's quiet again.
