     int. cbs, "60 minutes," corridor, lowell's office - morning

     lowell, in his office, his door open for anyone to see him,
     an immovable force, sitting behind his desk.  hewitt appears
     in his doorway...

                         don hewitt
                   (after a beat, cold)
               so, what are you going to do?

                         lowell
               well, what do you think i'm going to do?
               quit in protest?  i'm not going to do
               that.

                         don hewitt
                   (surprised)
               you're taking "no" for an answer?

                         lowell
               no.  i'm not going to take "no" for an
               answer.  no.

                         don hewitt
               then what are you going to do?

     hewitt looks at him...

                         lowell
               i'm staying right here.  doing my job.
               fighting to get my show on the air.  you
               don't like it?  hey, i'll tell you
               what...fire my ass...

                         don hewitt
               end up in a high-profile lawsuit with
               lowell, the first amendment martyr?  i
               don't think so.
                   (laughs)
               take a look at this...  this is a summary
               of a dossier that's being prepared.

     and he gives him a copy of it.

                         don hewitt (cont'd)
               he would lie about his whole life...?
               who's going to believe him about anything
               he says...?
                   (a beat, and the coup de grace)
               the wall street journal's doing a major
               story and i think the post.  you backed
               the wrong horse...

     he turns and starts off along the hall.  as he goes...

                         don hewitt (cont'd)
                   (his parting shot)
               the version without his interview is
               going to air the week after next.

     lowell watches him walk away.  debbie enters.

                         debbie deluca
               what was that about?

                         lowell
               get me wigand.

                         debbie deluca
               sure.

                         lowell
               ...fuck is this?  fuck!
