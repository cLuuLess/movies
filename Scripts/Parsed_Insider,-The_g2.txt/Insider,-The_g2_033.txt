     int. the brown & williamson building, main lobby,
     louisville - day

     meanwhile, it's static.  still, frozen.  jeffrey sits in the
     reception area of the brown & williamson tobacco company
     headquarters.  complimentary cigarettes are arranged on
     tables.  a dark quiet.  the hush of big business.  standing
     in the background by a wall next to the banks of elevators,
     is an ever-present man, another one, with an earphone and
     lapel microphone...

                         uniformed security
                   (to wigand)
               mr. wigand, you can go up now...

     he gets up, crossing to an elevator.
