                         wigand's voice (over)
                   (after a beat, lowering his
                    voice, but contentious)
               you're not even on this anymore...  what
               do you care?

                         lowell
               jeff!  wake the fuck up!  everybody is on
               the line here.  if they can catch you in
               a lie, they can paint everything with
               that brush.  do you understand?
               everything you say!

                         wigand
               i told the truth!

                         lowell
               everything...you...say!  and i can't
               defend you, man, with one hand tied
               behind my back!  because you keep from
               me...what they can discover.  and they
               will discover everything!  believe me.
