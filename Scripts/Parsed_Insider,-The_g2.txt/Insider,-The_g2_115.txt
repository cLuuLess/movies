     int. the conference room, cbs - day

     we're at a table.  mike and lowell laugh at some joke while
     helen caperelli, cbs general counsel, enters with the
     president of cbs news, eric kluster.

                         helen caperelli
               shall i send for coffee?  sorry i'm late.

                         mike wallace
               no, no, we're fine...

                         helen caperelli
               are you sure?

     also there is don hewitt.  caperelli is too well put
     together, too practiced, too polished.

     they nod.  they don't need coffee.

                         helen caperelli (cont'd)
               alright, i thought we'd get together
               because there's a legal concept that has
               been getting some new attention recently,
               "tortious interference."
                   (beat)
               if two people have an agreement, like a
               confidentiality agreement, and one of
               them breaks it because they are induced
               to do so by a 3rd party, the 3rd party
               can be sued for damages for
               interfering...hence, "tortious
               interference."

                         don hewitt
               interfering?  that's what we do.

                         lowell
               i think what we're trying to tell you is
               that it happens all the time.  this is a
               news organization.  people are always
               telling us things they shouldn't.  we
               have to verify if it's true and in the
               public interest...  and if it is, we air
               it.

                         mike wallace
               after we corroborate it.  that's why
               we've never lost a lawsuit and run a
               classy show.
                   (impatient, now)
               anything else?

                         helen caperelli
               and "60 minutes'" verification is exact.
               and precise.  and i don't think it would
               hurt to make sure you're right...on this
               one.

                         don hewitt
               why?  you think we have liability?
               what's the cbs news' position, eric?

                         eric kluster
               there's a possibility, it's rather
               remote...

                         helen caperelli
               but one we have to check on, mike.  i've
               retained outside counsel to do exactly
               that.  on a segment, i might add, that's
               already rife with problems...

                         lowell
               what does that mean?  "rife with -- ?"

                         helen caperelli
               i'm told unusual promises were made to
               wigand.

                         lowell
               no, only that we would hold the story
               until it was safe for him...

                         helen caperelli
                   (cuts in)
               and, i'm told there are questions as to
               our "star witness'" veracity.

                         lowell
                   (trying to control his anger)
               his "veracity" was good enough for the
               state of mississippi.

                         helen caperelli
                   (historic)
               our standards have to be higher than
               anyone else's, because we are the
               standard...for everyone else...

     whatever that means...

                         lowell
                   (wry)
               well, as a "standard"...i'll hang with
               "is the guy telling the truth?"

                         helen caperelli
               well, with tortious interference, i'm
               afraid...the greater the truth, the
               greater the damage.

                         lowell
               come again?

                         helen caperelli
               they own the information he's disclosing.
               the truer it is, the greater the damage
               to them.  if he lied, he didn't disclose
               their information.  and the damages are
               smaller.

                         lowell
               is this "alice in wonderland"?

                         mike wallace
               you said "on this one."  what about "this
               one"?

     and lowell hears a changed note in wallace's voice.  after a
     beat.

                         helen caperelli
                   (familiar, seductive)
               if this holds up, and it very well may
               not, mike...but, if it did.  and we aired
               this segment?  and cbs was sued by brown
               & williamson?  i think we could be at
               grave risk.

                         mike wallace
                   (a beat)
               how grace?

                         helen caperelli
                   (and she's been waiting for
                    this)
               well, at the end of the day...because of
               your segment...the brown & williamson
               tobacco company...could own cbs.

     as if on cue, the alarm on helen caperelli's watch beeps.
     she glances at it.

                         helen caperelli (cont'd)
               you know, i am sorry.  but i'm due
               upstairs.

     she gets up, gathering her things.

                         lowell
               is cbs corporate telling cbs news do not
               go to air with this story?

                         helen caperelli
               you're getting ahead of yourself.  we're
               all in this together.  we're all cbs.
               we'll find out soon.  thank you,
               gentlemen.

     and taking up her briefcase, she leaves.  don and mike rise.

                         lowell
               "tortious interference"?  sounds like a
               disease caught by a radio.

                         don hewitt
                   (to mike)
               lunch?

                         mike wallace
               sure.
                   (to lowell)
               don't worry, we call the shots around
               here.

     lowell finds himself angry and alone.  he crosses to the
     window and pulls out his cell phone and goes to work.

                         debbie deluca's voice (over)
               hello?

                         lowell
                   (into phone)
               debbie, it's me.  i want you to check
               some filings and give me john wilson's
               number at bear-stern.
