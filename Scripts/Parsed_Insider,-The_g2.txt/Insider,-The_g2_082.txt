     int. dining room, the four seasons hotel, new york - night

     and we slide by some elegant diners to fall onto lowell and
     mike wallace with jeffrey and liane in the hotel's dining
     room, having ordered dinner.

                         lowell
               so, is everything okay?

                         mike wallace
               how are the rooms?  comfortable?

                         liane
                   (to mike)
               yes, very.  you know, i enjoy your work
               so much...when you're talking to
               somebody, i always feel like i'm right
               there.

     and she laughs...

                         mike wallace
               thank you got saying that...

                         lowell
               do you think we could talk about the
               taping?  tomorrow's taping, just so we
               can get it out of the way and order...

                         mike wallace
               yeah, well, questions will go toward what
               work you did there, why you were fired.
               and others will deal...

                         liane
                   (not sure she quite heard)
               ...taping?
                   (beat)
               what are you taping?

                         wigand
               i'm doing an interview.

                         liane
                   (whispers)
               an interview!  do you know what they will
               do to us...!  i thought...  sorry.

     but she suddenly gets up and leaves, hurrying out of the
     dining room.  and jeffrey oddly doesn't move.

                         lowell
                   (trying to intervene)
               liane, this is a preliminary...
                   (after a beat)
               you didn't tell her we were taping?
               what did she think she was coming to new
               york for?

                         wigand
               ...to talk about it.  to think about it.
               i had a plan to ease her into it.  but, i
               really - i didn't know how to do that...

     jeffrey abruptly crosses to the nearby bar.

                         lowell
               oh, man.

                         mike wallace
               who are these people?

                         lowell
                   (frustrated)
               ordinary people!  under extraordinary
               pressure, mike.  what the hell do you
               expect?  grace and consistency?

     and lowell leaves the table.  and as mike wallace sits at the
     table, looking around, wondering what the fuck he's doing
     there.
