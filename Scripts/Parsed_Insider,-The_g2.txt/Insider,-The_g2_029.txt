               "president assad of syria said that
               difficult obstacles remain but that his
               country, quote, 'looks forward to a
               great, long peace with israel.'"

     tail leader.  then black.  suddenly lights come on.
     executive producer don hewitt is suddenly on his feet.  a
     veritable dervish, in constant motion...

                         don hewitt
                   (kissing mike)
               it's a peabody, mike.  when you're dead
               and buried, hezbollah is the one they're
               gonna remember you for...

     mike, used to him, ignores him, getting up, turning to leave,
     hewitt on his tail...while...

                         lowell
                   (to his editor)
               ...come in earlier on mike's marine
               barracks line when he's talking to sheikh
               mussawi...

                         mike wallace
               you eating with us?

                         lowell
               yeah.

                         mike wallace
               bring a tie so they'll let us in the
               front door...

     and lowell gestures for an olive-skinned woman in her late
     thirties, lowell's assistant, debbie deluca, to join them.
     the eye contact on the way out says there's something
     important he needs to tell her...
