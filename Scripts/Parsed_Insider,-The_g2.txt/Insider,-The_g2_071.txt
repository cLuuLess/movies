     int. a lounge, private aviation terminal - day

     through the window, we see scruggs' plane being refueled
     while scruggs and motley in a run-down lounge are talking on
     a speaker phone with lowell.  they've taken over the
     secretary's office for privacy.

                         lowell
                   (re:  footage)
               what do we do with that?

     the phone rings.

                         debbie deluca
               i don't know.

                         richard scruggs' voice (over)
               richard scruggs...

                         lowell
               ...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on
               behalf of the state of mississippi, did
               you not?

                         richard scruggs
                   (nods)
               that's right...

                         lowell
                   (after a beat)
               well, i'm working with someone, now, who
               was the former head of research at brown
               & williamson, a former corporate officer
               there.

                         richard scruggs
               what's your interest in this, mr.
               bergman?

                         lowell
               well, he may tape an interview with us.
               and, we believe if his testimony showed
               up in a court record first, it would free
               him up from his confidentiality agreement
               and give him some protection.

                         motley
               it could work.  if it's public record,
               it's public record.

                         lowell
               yeah, and he's going to need legal
               representation.

                         motley
               he sure as hell will.

                         richard scruggs
                   (a beat)
               has he decided to go public?  because
               let me tell you, we've been doing this
               for three years now, and we've worked
               with a lot of corporate cases involving
               whistle-blowers, so we know...  big
               tobacco will do everything in their power
               to stop him.  so, is your man truly
               committed?

                         lowell
               well, actually, no.  well, he's on the
               fence.  that's the point.

     scruggs and motley exchange a look...  motley shrugs...

                         richard scruggs
               well, we'd certainly be interested in
               making his acquaintance, but without
               knowing what he's going to do...

                         lowell
               well, would you want him to call you?
               or, you want to call him?  how do you
               want to do it?

                         richard scruggs
                   (no nonsense)
               it would be better if he called us.

                         lowell
               yeah.

                         richard scruggs
               alright?

                         lowell
               okay.  thank you.

     at this moment, these two attorneys are unsold on the
     prospect of jeffrey wigand.  scruggs disconnects.

                         lowell (cont'd)
               shit...
