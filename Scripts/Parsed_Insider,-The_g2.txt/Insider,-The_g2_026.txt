     wigand working on his computer...  lowell's voice on his
     answering machine...

                         lowell's voice (over)
                   (on machine)
               ...i'm gonna be in the lobby of the
               seelbach hotel in louisville, reading the
               new york times, tomorrow, at five
               o'clock...

     lowell clicks off.  and as wigand sits at his computer,
     giving no indication what he might do...
