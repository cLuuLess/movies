     int. a laboratory, brown & williamson, louisville, kentucky
     - day

     we're in a science laboratory...  out of focus lab
     technicians, in white lab coats, celebrating a heavyset black
     woman's birthday...  half her presents are opened.  balloons,
     incongruous, floating above the lab...  and there's a sense
     that somebody is watching...  and from the waist up, a
     disembodied figure comes into focus behind a glass partition,
     as if quarantined, isolated, an expressionless man in his
     late forties, watching them...
