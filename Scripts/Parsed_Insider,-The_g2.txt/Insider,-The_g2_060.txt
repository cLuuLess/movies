     int. wigands' new house, hallway - late at night

     it's dark, save a light from the living room.  liane, in bed,
     seemingly sleeping.  and we see jeffrey, just outside their
     door in the foyer, sitting on the floor against a curved
     wall, a drink at his side on the telephone...  a man with no
     one to talk to...

                         wigand
                   (after a beat)
               lowell...  jeffrey wigand...
