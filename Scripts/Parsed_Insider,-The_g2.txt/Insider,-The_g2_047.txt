     int. wigand's car, louisville - rear two shot - morning

     the girls are gone.  we enter mid-scene.  lowell's still in
     the back seat...

                         wigand (cont'd)
               and, i'm unemployed.  so i have to
               protect my medical coverage.
                   (the bottom line; turning to
                    look at lowell in the rear
                    seat)
               ...so i left them a message this morning.
               their expanded confidentiality agreement?
               i will sign it.

                         lowell
               they're afraid of you, aren't they?

                         wigand
               they should be.

     the sound of the rain...

                         lowell
                   (after a beat, trying to make
                    it easier for him)
               talk to me outside the zone of your
               agreement?

                         wigand
                   (guarded)
               like what?

                         lowell
               like where'd you work before brown &
               williamson?

                         wigand
                   (a beat)

                         lowell
               i don't know...you think the knicks are
               gonna make it through the semi-finals?

     wigand smiles...as their eyes meet in the rear view mirror.
     a subtle connection...  it passes...

                                                       dissolve to:
