     int. lowell's office, berkeley - day

     lowell's restless, waiting...  and not getting a call back,
     he tries another tact.  he writes a fax, "please call me
     at..."  he writes his number down.  he sends the fax.  he's
     still.  it's quiet.  and not getting an answer he gets up,
     starting to leave the room.  and suddenly the fax machine
     rings...  he turns.  he reads a message emerging from the
     machine..."i can't talk to you..."  he's quiet.  he writes on
     a piece of paper..."can't talk to me?"  "won't talk to me?"
     "don't want to talk to me...?"  as he faxes it back...
