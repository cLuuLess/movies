                         lowell's voice (over)
                   (on the phone, upset)
               you never told me you were married
               before...that you had a daughter...

     and wigand is in the phone booth at the high
     school...students walking by...

                         wigand
                   (outraged)
               well, how is that any of your business?!
               that is not something that you people
               need to know!
