     int. wigand's car, lousiville - day

     light mottled through trees reflects off the car window...
     jeffrey's face goes in and out of the tunnel of light and
     shadow...down this tasteful, suburban louisville street of
     neat houses and manicured lawns...  he pulls into driveway
     behind a 3 series bmw.  it's a grey french provincial
     replica...
