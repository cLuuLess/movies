     ext. the parking lot, driving range, louisville - night

     golf club in hand at the driver side window...

                         wigand
                   (motioning with the club,
                    threatening)
               stay away from me!  you stay away from
               me!

     the man starts his car, and drives off nonplussed.  it's
     still.  and as jeffrey with the golf club stands in the empty
     parking lot, not knowing what's threatening him, something
     real, something imaginary...
