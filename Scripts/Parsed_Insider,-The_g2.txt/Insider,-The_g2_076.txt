     ext. new orleans, the french quarter - night

     and we see lowell lit by flashing police lights.  we're at a
     crime scene.  uniformed cops on horseback.  just arrived, the
     cameraman's unloading his gear, preparing to shoot b-roll.

                         lowell
               what happened?

                         cop
               dispatch received a call of shots fired
               in the area.  uniforms arrived on the
               scene and found this white male subject
               shot to death.

                         lowell
               was it gang related?

                         cop
               there's no indication as far as a tag or
               an advertisement...

     police moving around as lowell's cell phone rings...

                         lowell
