     int. a hotel room, louisville - early evening

                         lowell (over)
               have you always lived in louisville?

     brilliant late afternoon sunlight.  we pull back to see
     jeffrey, standing by a window, silently looking outside to
     the left...  lowell, cool, waiting, hands in his pockets, in
     the middle of the large room...

                         wigand
               mr. bergman?  what did you want me to
               consult about?

     a sudden knock on the door...

                         wigand (cont'd)
                   (turns, suspicious)
               who's that?

                         lowell
                   (wry)
               that's room service.  they usually knock
               first.
                   (calls)
               come on in...  over here, please.

     room service brings in a tray with coffee.  as lowell signs
     the bill, the room service waiter waiting, looks at wigand...
     their eyes meet...  the waiter looks away.

                         lowell (cont'd)
               thank you.

     and the waiter leaves...

                         lowell (cont'd)
                    (pouring)
               how do you like your coffee?  black?

                         wigand
               black, black...

     lowell gives him his cup of coffee.

                         wigand (cont'd)
               look, i really don't have that much
               time...

                         lowell
                   (nods)
               is there anything you want to know about
               me, mr. wigand...?

                         wigand
               like what?  your sign?

     lowell smiles.

                         wigand (cont'd)
               i know what i have to know.

                         lowell
               just so i know you know, when i talk to
               people in confidence, it stays that way.

                         wigand
                   (abruptly)
               how did a radical journalist from
               ramparts magazine end up at cbs?

     lowell looks at him, he does his homework...

                         lowell
               i still do the tough stories.  "60
               minutes" reaches a lot of people.

     wigand's quiet, measuring him.

                         wigand
                   (after a beat)
               let me see the documents...

     lowell gives him the box of papers...  wigand sits down, the
     box on his lap, quietly looking through them...flips to a
     different heading, consults a chart...

                         wigand (cont'd)
               ...this is a fire-safety product study
               for philip morris.  burn rates...ignition
               propensity...things of this nature.
                   (after a beat)
               i could very easily explain this to you
               in layman's terms, because it's from
               another company...

     he puts the papers down...

                         wigand (cont'd)
               ...but that's as far as i go...

                         lowell
               far as you go where?

                         wigand
                   (a beat)
               this issue is a drop in the bucket.  i
               can talk to you about what's in here.
               but i can't talk to you about anything
               else.

     and lowell knows something else is going on here...

                         wigand (cont'd)
                   (meaning philip morris
                    documents)
               i signed a confidentiality agreement.  i
               honor agreements...

     a lot more is going on here...  lowell nods, a good
     reporter...

                         wigand (cont'd)
               doesn't cbs have confidentiality
               agreements, mr. bergman?

                         lowell
               between journalists and management, yes,
               i believe they do...but i don't take that
               seriously.
                   (after a beat)
               where do you work?

                         wigand
               did work.

                         lowell
                   (fast)
               did work.

                         wigand
                   (the bottom line)
               how much would i get paid?

                         lowell
               that, you have to discuss with cbs
               business affairs.  but, for something
               like this, i would say anywhere between
               10, 12 thousand.

     wigand nods "okay."

                         wigand
               should i just take the documents now?

                         lowell
               if you want to do it.

     he turns to leave...  lowell gets the door for him...  wigand
     momentarily slows...

                         wigand
               i worked as the head of research and
               development for brown & williamson
               tobacco company.  i was a corporate vice
               president.  mr. bergman...

     and he goes out the door...  lowell's still.  wigand's job
     title resonates.  lowell turns to the window, casually
     looking into the early evening...and he comes face to face
     with what wigand was staring at, the brown & williamson
     tobacco company headquarters building, lit up right across
     the street...
