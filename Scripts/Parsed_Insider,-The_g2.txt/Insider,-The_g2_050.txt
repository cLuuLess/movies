     int. a high school cafeteria, louisville - day

                         mrs. watson
               ...you're awfully overqualified, dr.
               wigand.

     the aftermath of a high school lunch.  tables, covered with
     litter, as far as the eye can see.  and we see jeffrey
     sitting with a formidable black woman in her mid-fifties, the
     high school principal, cynthia watson, drinking cups of
     coffee...

                         wigand
                   (after a beat, awkward)
               i'm trying to...start a new career...  i
               believe i could be a good teacher...

     she's quiet.  she senses this applicant has a lot on his
     mind.

                         mrs. watson
               let me give it some thought...

                         wigand
                   (selling)
               ...and not a lot of companies in the
               health-care field hire ex-tobacco
               scientists.

     she nods, studying him.  they get up.
