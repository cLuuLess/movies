     int. the studio, cbs - later

                         wigand
               the straw that broke the camel's back for
               me and really put me in trouble with
               sandefur was a compound called
               "coumarin."  when i came on board at b&w,
               they had tried to transition from
               coumarin to a similar flavor that would
               give the same taste, and had been
               unsuccessful.  i wanted it out
               immediately.
               i was told that it would affect sales, so
               i should mind my own business.  i
               constructed a memo to mr. sandefur
               indicating i could not in conscience
               continue with coumarin in a product that
               we now knew, we had documentation, was
               similar to coumadin, a lung-specific
               carcinogen...

                         mike wallace
               and you sent the document forward to
               sandefur?

                         wigand
               i sent the document forward to sandefur.
               i was told that we would continue to work
               on a substitute, we weren't going to
               remove it as it would impact sales, and
               that that was his decision.

                         mike wallace
               in other words, you were charging
               sandefur and brown & williamson with
               ignoring health considerations
               consciously...

                         wigand
               most certainly.

                         mike wallace
               and on march 24, thomas sandefur, ceo of
               brown & williamson had you fired.  and
               the reason he gave you?

                         wigand
               poor communication skills.

                         mike wallace
               and, do you wish you hadn't come forward?
               you wish you hadn't blown the whistle?

                         wigand
               yeah, there are times i wish i hadn't
               done it.  there are times i feel
               compelled to do it.  if you asked me
               would i do it again?  do i think it's
               worth it?  yeah, i think it's worth it.
