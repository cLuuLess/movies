     int. the courtroom, pascagoula, mississippi - day

     the tobacco lawyers become dead quiet.  cell phones are hung
     up.  newspapers are put away.  jackets are donned.  this is
     now very serious business.  motley meets jeffrey, all eyes on
     him.

                         motley
               okay, jeff, i'm going to sit you down at
               that table over there.  i'm going to
               start as fast as possible.  i don't want
               to give them a chance to get another
               restraining order, okay?  let's go.

                         michael moore
               good luck, doc.

     motley calmly motions wigand to take a chair.  he settles in.

                         stenographer
               please stand.  raise your right hand...
               do you swear to tell the truth, the whole
               truth and nothing but the truth, so help
               you god?

                         wigand
               i do.

                         stenographer
               you may be seated.

                         motley
               you understand, dr. wigand, you are under
               oath.  this is a sworn deposition.
               there's no judge.  it's not a trial.
                   (understatement of the century)
               will you state your name for the record.

                         wigand
                   (after a beat)
               jeffrey s. wigand.

     he spells it for them...
