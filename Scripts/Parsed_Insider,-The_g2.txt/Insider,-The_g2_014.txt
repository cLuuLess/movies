     int. lowell's house, bedroom, berkeley - late morning

     lowell, in sweat pants and an old tee shirt now, is on the
     telephone, still in bed...  newspapers, the new york times,
     the wall street journal, san francisco chronicle, are spread
     all over...home as refuge.  a tray with large cups of coffee
     is on a side table.

                         lowell
               ...everyone thinks canadian mounties
               ride horses and rescue ladies from
               rapids, mike.  they backed locals in oka
               in a fight with mohawks over building a
               golf course on their burial site.  they
               beat up protesters at kanasake...
                   (pause)
               where'd you hear that?

     the other phone on a nightstand rings...  a woman in her
     forties, sharon tiller, enters, in a bathrobe, brushing her
     teeth.  she answers it...

                         lowell (cont'd)
                   (droll)
               oh, someone took a poll?  "are all things
               canadian boring...?"

                         sharon
                   (to lowell)
               it's stuart...he's in mexico city...

                         lowell
               let me call you back...

     he takes up the line...listening...

                         lowell (cont'd)
               yeah, stuart...  what new york bank?

     a young man in his early twenties wanders in...

                         jake
               hey dad...sharon...

     lowell waves at jake, his son.

                         sharon
                   (to jake)
               no classes this morning?

                         lowell
               will he go on-camera and talk about the
               mexico city branch?

                         jake
               i don't have to be there until ten-
               thirty.

     lowell's son sits on the bed looking at part of a newspaper.
     and another young man, in his early twenties, with long hair
     comes strolling in, sharon's son, josiah.

                         josiah
               hi mom, lowell...

     lowell, still on the phone, waves to him.

                         sharon
               hi, sweetheart...

     josiah sits on the bed too, reading the back of the sports
     section jake is reading...  another line rings, sharon
     getting it.  the boys, used to them, get up, and leave...

                         lowell
                   (into phone)
               will independent sources corroborate
               that?

                         sharon
               hello?  yeah...
