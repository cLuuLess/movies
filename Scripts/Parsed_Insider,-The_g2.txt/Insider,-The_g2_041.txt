     ext. a golf driving range, louisville - night

     we see a brightly lit, golf driving range, empty, the wet
     grass under the lights vibrant, emerald green...  a caged
     cart, with one big yellow headlight, like some kind of
     strange insect, drives across the range, picking up golf
     balls.  and we see jeffrey hitting golf balls, driving one
     after another, after another...  his swing is powerful,
     angry, a lone golfer, trying to chill out.  he pauses, spent.
     settling down, he exhales.  then, he looks down the way...
     and he slows...  he sees in the far distance, spot-lit, one
     other lone golfer, a stocky man, incongruously in a suit and
     tie, watching him...  and the man in the suit right then,
     with great power and a tremendous follow through drives a
     golf ball...  the ball slamming into the steel net.  and the
     lights suddenly go out.  the range closing for the night.
     the "insect" comes to a stop.  and it's quiet, dark.  jeffrey
     gathers up his clubs.  he crosses, his golf shoes, the metal
     cleats, clicking on the pavement, toward the parking lot.
     and there's the sound of the clicking of golf shoes behind
     him.  he turns.  and the stocky man in the suit, carrying a
     golf bag walking some distance behind him, staring at him.
     jeffrey comes to the parking lot.  it's empty.  just
     jeffrey's car, and despite all the empty spaces, another car,
     purposely or otherwise, parked right next to his.  he crosses
     to his car, getting in...
