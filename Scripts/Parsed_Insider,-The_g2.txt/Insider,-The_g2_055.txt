     int. the wigands' house, basement - late night

     jeffrey goes into a corner of the basement, around the corner
     from the furnace, where his "office" is now.  unpacked boxes
     are on the floor.  he fumbles with the combination lock on a
     small gun safe, lifts the lid, taking out a hand gun.
     barbara followed him.

               sit at daddy's desk, okay?  why don't you
               just sit up at the desk.  get out some
               paper and draw me a picture, okay?  what
               are you gonna draw me, baby?  an animal,
               something like that?  you stay down here
               until daddy gets back...alright, barbara?
               you stay down here.

     he keeps it hidden from barbara.  he goes up the stairs.
