     int. wigands' new house, basement office - night

     liane down the stairs, approaching jeffrey's computer.  and
     she sees an incoming e-mail icon - a large letter with wings -
     flying repetitively across the screen.

     the bell ringing is louder.  she calls-up the e-mail...  on
     the screen in large red letters:

               we will kill you.  we will kill all of
               you.  shut the fuck up.

     and now liane is shouting and running up the stairs and...

                         liane
               debbie, barbara...  debbie!
