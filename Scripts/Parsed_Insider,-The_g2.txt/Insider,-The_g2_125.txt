     int. john scanlon's public relations firm, a media room,
     new york - day

     and on a television screen, susan wigand, the woman in the
     electric cart, giving a taped interview to the p.i....

                         susan wigand
               ...seven months after we were married we
               found out that i had multiple
               sclerosis...

     we pull back to see john scanlon and his staff watching the
     tape...  his firm's logo, public relations campaigns for some
     of his high-profile clients are on the walls.  scanlon's on
     the phone talking with somebody as the tape runs...

                         p.i.'s voice (over)
                   (on television)
               and, you had a daughter, diane, with him,
               is that correct?

                         susan wigand
                   (on television)
               yes, in 1973.

                         john scanlon
                   (on the phone, whispering)
               ...come on, tommy sandefur told me
               himself, he's not gonna allow brown &
               williamson to be demonized to the
               american public, so i told peter jennings
               and i...hold on...

     he stops, listening to the videotape...

                         p.i.'s voice (over)
                   (on television)
               would it be fair to say when he divorced
               you he left you in a precarious
               situation?  you had multiple sclerosis;
               you had a small child to raise.

                         john scanlon
                   (ignoring that part; to staff)
               mention that part in the executive
               summary and in the chapters "first wife"
               and "estrangement of daughter."
                   (beat; into phone)
               so, i was telling pete, i said, "you've
               been taken in by this guy...

                         susan wigand
                   (on television)
               yes...
                   (beat)
               but you have to understand, the divorce
               was something that we both wanted...

                         john scanlon
               he's a total bullshit artist.  he's a
               shoplifter.  he's a convicted shoplifter.

     and as we end in a sea of documents, affidavits, court
     records, all from louisville, all about jeffrey.  we
     understand the war has only been begun...
