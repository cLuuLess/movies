               lowell.  i decided to preface sunday's
               show.  i did three minutes on the
               "evening news."  you'll want to see it.

                   (goes up)
               do me a favor, will you?  spare me, for
               god's sake.  get in the real world.  what
               do you think?  i'm going to resign in
