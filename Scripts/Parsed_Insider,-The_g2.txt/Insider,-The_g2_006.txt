     int. lobby, brown & williamson building - day

     briefcase in hand, jeffrey appears from the elevator from
     above, from wide and in front, his eyes, frozen pools...  and
     like a bad dream, a broad-shouldered man, leaning against the
     wall near the reception island in a suit he's not comfortable
     in, wearing an earphone, saying something into a lapel
     microphone after jeffrey's passed.
