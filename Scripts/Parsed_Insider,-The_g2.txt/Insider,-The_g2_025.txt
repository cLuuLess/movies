     int. lowell's office, berkeley - day

     lowell, waiting...  the fax machine rings again...  he reads
     jeffrey's answer.  "can't."  "won't."  "don't want to..."
     he's quiet, more than just interested, now.  there's
     something beyond intriguing here.  he turns.  he looks
     through a stack of phone books for something...a nationwide
     800 directory.  he looks through it and dials wigand's phone
     number again...

                         lowell
               if you're curious to meet me...
