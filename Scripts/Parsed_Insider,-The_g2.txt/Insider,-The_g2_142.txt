               cbs is under criticism, because the cbs
               news program "60 minutes" will not be
               presenting an interview...

     lowell's destroying his own work product, taking apart his
     creation that we saw earlier to be so impactful.  tony gets a
     call as hewitt enters.

                         don hewitt
               what the hell are you doing?

                         lowell
               what does it look like i'm doing?  i'm
               editing.

                         don hewitt
               no, not that.  i'm talking about the
               associated press.  they got this story
               that we pulled this interview and they
               talked to mike and i.  did you tell them
               that we were lying?

                         lowell
               no.  i should have.  i told them i
               disagreed with you, mike and kluster that
               this segment is as good as the original.
               i'm not lying for you.  i'm not gonna
               shut up for you.  not on any of it.

                         don hewitt
               hey!  i'm not going to fire you, okay?
               take a vacation.  now!
