     int. the basement, the wigands' house - late night

     and we see jeffrey, unable to sleep, sitting at his desk,
     alone in the basement, listening to classical music.  he
     instinctively turns.  and he sees liane, in her bathrobe, has
     come down to sit on the basement stairs.  he looks over at
     her.  and he thinks she's come down to make up.  and all she
     really wants him to do is say, "i need you..."  but he
     can't...  and like ships that pass in the night, nothing's
     said.  it's quiet.  she puts her hands protectively in her
     robe pockets.  and she starts to cry...

                         liane
               i don't think i can do this...  i want to
               stand by my husband...  i really do,
               jeffrey.  but i don't think i can do this
               anymore.  i am so sorry...

                         wigand
               can we talk about this when i get back?

                         liane
               yes...jeffrey.

     she goes back up the stairs.  and as jeffrey sits in the
     basement, and the music plays.
