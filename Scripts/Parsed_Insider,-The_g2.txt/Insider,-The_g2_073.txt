     int. the wigands' new house, kitchen - twilight

     liane cooking dinner, making pasta.  ingredients, diced
     tomato, basil, are neatly ordered.  she's waiting for water
     to boil.  the kids are doing homework on the round table in
     the kitchenette.  it's an idle moment.  she's dazed-out
     watching them.

                         deborah
               what are you cooking?

                         liane
               i'm cooking pasta primavera.

                         deborah
               oh, i love that stuff.

     and now she hears from the basement the bell ring on
     jeffrey's computer.  it's a tiny bell, incessant...  she
     crosses to the basement stairs.

                         liane
               i'm going to have to go downstairs.
