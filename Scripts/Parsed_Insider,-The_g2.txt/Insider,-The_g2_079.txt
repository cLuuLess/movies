     ext. the wigands' house - night

                         wigand
                   (outraged)
               you can't take that...  it's personal
               property...!

                         fbi agent #2 (or #3)
               we have a search warrant, mr. wigand.
               there's been a death threat.

                         wigand
                   (after him)
               ...my files!  personal correspondence...

     agent #3 ignores him, putting the computer in the trunk of
     their car.  and fbi agent #1, the .38 bullet in a baggie,
     comes out of the house.

                         wigand (cont'd)
               ...letters to my brother...my will.

     his shoes slip on the grass and he falls.  and the fbi are
     getting into their car.  and neighbors have come out,
     watching them.  liane and the girls, standing halfway down
     the front lawn, the neighbors looking at them.  she and
     jeffrey look at each other.  will she go to him or not?  she
     goes to him as he rises...

                         wigand (cont'd)
               that computer has everything...

                         fbi agent #2
               you alright, mr. wigand?

                         fbi agent #1
               we need to take a look at your gun safe,
               mr. wigand.
