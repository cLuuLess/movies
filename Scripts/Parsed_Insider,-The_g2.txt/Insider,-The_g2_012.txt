     int. another house in baalbek - day

     the sheikh, wearing a fresh white robe and skull cap, comes
     into the room...

                         the sheikh
               i am very pleased to receive you as my
               guest, mr. wallace.

                         mike wallace
               thank you for having us...

     reverse:  norman's camera crew is setting up.  mike wallace
     is there.  a dangerous combination of intelligence,
     arrogance, and celebrity, there's a kinetic quality about
     him.

     wallace sits across from the sheikh on a dais of patterned
     linoleum in incongruous armchairs against a wallpaper mural
     of a french formal garden.  a sound technician wires the
     sheikh and mike with microphones.  norman says something to
     lowell and then goes out.

                         norman
               i think i've got a problem with the
               gennie.  i have to go outside.

                         lowell
                   (going outside)
               norman...?

     mike turns his chair to face and slides it closer to the
     sheikh's chair.  the head bodyguard barks something in
     arabic.  the interpreter says something back in arabic.  the
     sheikh, absorbed in his notes for the upcoming interview,
     ignores all of this.

                         interpreter
               he says you must not sit so close.

                         mike wallace
               what?
                   (re:  bodyguard)
               i can't conduct an interview from back
               there.

     the bodyguard, bristling at wallace's tone, barks more
     confrontational arabic.

                         interpreter
               you must move back your chair.

                         mike wallace
               will you tell him that when i conduct an
               interview, i sit anywhere i damn please!

                         interpreter
               there is no interview.

     as mike leaps forward, moving inches from the bodyguard's
     face with such sudden ferocity, even the bodyguard flinches.

                         mike wallace
               you!  i'm talking to you!

     more armed men start to enter.

                         mike wallace (cont'd)
               what the hell do you think i am?  a 78-
               year-old assassin?  you think i'm gonna
               karate him to death with this notepad?
                   (to interpreter)
               are you interpreting what i'm saying?

                         interpreter
               yes.

                         lowell
               we're there.

                         mike wallace
               good, well ask him if arabic is his
               second language.

                         lowell
                   (to interpreter)
               don't interpret that!
                   (to both)
               hold it.  hold it.  hold it!  slow,
               slow!!
                   (to the sheikh)
               sheikh, do you mind...if you would just
               turn your chair a little bit to face mr.
               wallace?

     the sheikh looks up from his notes, nods, fixes his chair,
     goes back to his notes...

                         lowell (cont'd)
               is that okay?

                         interpreter
               okay.

                         lowell
                   (bodyguard assents; to mike)
               are you ready?  or you want to keep
               fucking around and warm up some more...?

                         mike wallace
               no.
                   (wry)
               ...that's got my heart started.

     they know each other well.  lowell smiles.  wallace sits
     down.

                         lowell
               alright, todd, give me the three-button
               on mike, please.  okay.  we are rolling.
               okay, mike.

     they roll camera...  "60 minutes"...  "hezbollah"...

                         mike wallace
                   (charming)
               sheikh fadlallah, thank you so much for
               seeing us.
                   (changes)
               are you a terrorist?

     the sheikh didn't expect the mike wallace opening shot
     between the eyes.  he recovers...

                         the sheikh
               mr. wallace, i...am a servant of god.

     that expression of incredulity...

                         mike wallace
               a servant of god?  really...

     mike, tipping his glasses down while the hostile gunmen,
     cradling weapons, watch him through the doorway...

                         mike wallace (cont'd)
               americans believe that you, as an islamic
               fundamentalist, that you are a leader who
               contributed to the bombing of the u.s.
               embassy.

     the ballsiness of wallace, asking these questions in this
     place, is impressive...
