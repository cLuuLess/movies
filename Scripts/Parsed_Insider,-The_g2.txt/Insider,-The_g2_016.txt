                   (into phone)
               i can't...  i've got to fly to boston
               tomorrow.

     lowell comes with the box back to bed.  he's already
     unwrapped it.  inside are stacks of papers...  he looks at
     the box cover.  no return address.  an anonymous sender; not
     unusual for him.  he casually looks through the papers.

                         sharon (cont'd)
               two p.m.  great.  bye-bye.
                   (hangs up)

                         lowell
                   (reading)
               ..."ignition propensity?"
                   (to sharon)
               ...you understand any of this...?

     he gives her some papers.  we see formulas...scientific data
     in tables...

                         sharon
               ...no...this looks like a table of
               temperatures...  who's this from?

                         lowell
                   (shrugs)
               ...it's anonymous.  references to "p.m."
                   (motions)
               it's got to be philip morris, huh?

                         sharon
               i have to take a shower.

     as he looks at the papers, sharon goes into the bathroom...
