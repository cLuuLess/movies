     ext. the berkeley house - morning

     the boys coming out of the house together...  and seeing the
     box by the door...

                         lowell's son
                   (shouts back inside)
               dad, you got a box out here...

     and they go out the gate, talking, walking off along the
     berkeley street.  the box left waiting by the door.

                         lowell
                   (looking at her itinerary)
               let me see this...  no, 'cause i gotta
               know where you're going at all times.
