     ext. a berkeley cafe - close:  pay phone

     there's the sound of a phone ringing.  pull back to reveal
     lowell outside a cafe with dry cleaning he collected over one
     shoulder.  a little girl's voice over (deborah's) answers.
     "hello."

                         lowell
               mr. wigand, please.

     there's a whisper..."someone's calling for daddy, mom."

     behind lowell is a humming berkeley street.  he gestures
     familiarly to a server, who brings out his two take-out
     cappuccinos.  lowell nods his thanks, pays...

                         lowell (cont'd)
               thank you, bob.
