     int. a phone booth, new york - night

     a busy new york street.  light mist.  and we see lowell is on
     the phone in a phone booth...

                         lowell
               yeah, i got it.  500 pages of it.  they
               looked in every corner of this guy's
               life...from a spousal abuse charge, to
               shoplifting, to a traffic ticket he got
               once for running a red light.  it's terry
               lenzner's outfit, igi.  jack, listen to
               me.  their strategy:  discredit this guy,
               ruin his reputation in the wall street
               journal, and then nobody will ever listen
               to what he's got to say about tobacco.
               he's dead.  unless i can get this thing
               knocked down.
