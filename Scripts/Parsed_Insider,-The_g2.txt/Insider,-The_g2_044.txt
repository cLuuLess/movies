     ext. the wigand house, louisville - wide shot: wigands'
     house - early morning

     a violent rain's falling.  and we see jeffrey coming out of
     the house holding an umbrella over his little girls.  they
     start towards the car.  there's the sound of a car door
     shutting.  liane, carrying lunch boxes, comes after them...

                         liane
               jeffrey, you forgot their lunches --

     she slows, seeing someone.  jeffrey turns:  it's lowell.
     he's surprised.

                         lowell
               mrs. wigand, how do you do?

                         wigand
                   (to the girls, protectively)
               jump in, quick, c'mon...

                         lowell
               i'm lowell bergman.  we spoke on the
               phone, remember?

     the girls climb in the car.  lowell crosses behind the audi
     around the far side.

                         lowell (cont'd)
               c'mere.  i want to talk to you.

                         wigand
               good.  i want to talk to you.

     jeff closes the door on his daughters and joins lowell around
     the far side of the car.

                         wigand (cont'd)
                   (confronting him)
               what do...

                         lowell
                   (running over)
               i did not burn you.  i did not give you
               up to anyone!

                         wigand
                   (continuing)
               this is my house...  in front of my wife,
               my kids?!  what business do we have?

                         lowell
               to straighten something out with you.
               right here.  right now.

                         wigand
               so, you didn't mention my name?  you
               haven't talked to anybody about me?

                         lowell
               why am i gonna mention your name?

                         wigand
               how did brown & williamson know i spoke
               to you...?

                         lowell
               how the hell do i know about brown &
               williamson?

                         wigand
               it happened after i talked to you.  i do
               not like coincidences!

                         lowell
               and i don't like paranoid accusations!
               i'm a journalist.  think.  use your head.
               how do i operate as a journalist by
               screwing the people who could provide me
               with information before they provided me
               with it?

                         wigand
                   (skeptical)
               you came all the way down here to tell me
               that?

                         lowell
               no.  i did not.  big tobacco is a big
               story.  and you got something important
               to say.  i can tell.
                   (a beat, personal)
               but, yes.  i did.
               i came all the way down here to tell you:
               story, no story, fuck your story, i don't
               burn people.

     it starts to rain harder.  they look at each other.  jeffrey,
     without saying a word, gets in the car.  he backs out.
     lowell, left standing in the driveway with liane in the rain.
     liane goes back into the house.  and lowell starts back
     across the street to his car.  there's a sound.  he turns.
     jeffrey's car, having gone around the corner, has come back
     and stopped in the street.

                         wigand
                   (after a beat)
               ride with me while i take the girls to
               school...

     lowell hesitates, then gets into the car in the back seat.
