int. presidential suite - a few minutes later
harry is sitting beside lloyd and mary on the bed. nicholas
andre keeps his gun trained on them while he speaks on the
phone:

                      andre
          ..i want a one-way ticket to rio de
          janerio departing as soon as
          possible...

on the bed - harry and lloyd can't look each other in the
eye.

                      mary
          you mean you two know each other?

                                                  112.

                      lloyd
              (cutting)
          yeah, we used to be best friends.

                      harry
          until he turned into a backstabber.

                      lloyd
          me a backstabber? you got a lot of
          nerve. i saw her first.

                      harry
          hey, i couldn't help it if she found
          me irresistable.

mary rolls her eyes at this.

                      lloyd
          but you knew how crazy i was about
          her.

                      harry
          yeah, and you knew how crazy i was
          about fraida felcher, but that didn't
          stop you, did it?

                      lloyd
              (waning righteousness)
          what are you talking about?

                      harry
          don't deny it, lloyd. fraida told me
          the whole sordid story.

lloyd can't muster a defense.
                      lloyd
          look... i was gonna tell you about
          that. it was gonna be mentioned at
          the reading of my will. i swear, you
          can ask my lawyer.

harry glares at him.

                      harry
          well i guess we both learned a little
          something about each other, didn't
          we?

                      lloyd
          you said it, pal. maybe we're not as
          good friends as we thought we were.

                                                       113.

                         harry
          guess not.

                      lloyd
          i mean, if one beautiful girl   could
          rip us apart like this, then   it seems
          our friendship isn't worth a   damn.
              (beat)
          maybe we should call it quits   right
          here.

                      harry
          just tell me where to sign, bud.

suddenly they hear the metallic click-clack of a gun being
cocked.

                      andre
          okay, which one of you losers wants
          to die first?

the guys exchange a look and swallow hard.

                      harry
          i wouldn't pull that trigger if i
          were you.

                      andre
          why not? it'll look like just another
          aspen love triangle. you caught the
          two of them in bed, handcuffed them
          to the post, murdered them, and killed
          yourself.

                      harry
              (smug)
          except you're forgetting one minor
          etail.

                         andre
          what's that?

lloyd and mary look at harry, hopeful.

                      harry
          if you kill us, you'd be killing
          yourself.

                         andre
                 (puzzled)
          huh?

                                                   114.

                       harry
           you see, philosophers believe that
           we're all really just tiny pieces of
           one huge universal being. in other
           words, i am you and you are me, so
           if you were to kill us you'd be
           committing suicide, you unenlightened

idiot --

                        andre
           --shut up!

mary sees that they're in deep shit now.

                       mary
           what about my husband? did you kill
           him, too?

                       harry
           husband? what husband?

                       lloyd
           mary's married, harry.

                       andre
           no need to worry about melvin.
               (beat)
           now this is the last time i'll ask:
           who wants to die first?

harry gestures with his head at mary.

                       harry
           kill her. the bitch should've told
           him she was married back at the
           airport. it would've saved us a lot
           of trouble.

andre points the gun at mary.

                       lloyd
           no, i'll go first, harry. i was the
           one who got you into this mess.

andre points the gun at lloyd.

                       harry
           no, wait, do me first. i'm the one
           who stole your girl, lloyd. i eserve
           it.

                                                          115.

andre sighs and points the gun at harry. then, as mary and
lloyd look on in horror, he fires twice. harry grabs his
stomach and falls off the bed to the floor.

                      lloyd
          jesus christ! you killed my best
          friend, you bastard!

andre smiles.

                      andre
          if it's any consolation, you're about
          to be reunited.

he aims the gun at lloyd, cocks the trigger. suddenly, a
shot rings out and the gun is blown out of andre's hand.

on the floor - harry is very much alive and pointing a pistol
at the stunned nicholas andre.

                      lloyd
          harry! you're alive!

just them, the door bursts open and several police officers
storm in with their weapons drawn.

                      cop #1
          get your hands up, asshole!

lloyd and harry throw their hands into the air. a stunned
andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head. he
reluctantly raises his hands. mary and lloyd are flabbergasted
by the turn of events.

there's a sudden commotion in the room. pushing her way
through the mass of cops comes the athletic beauty. she
flashes an id.

                      athletic beauty
          special officer kathryn frick. federal
          bureau of investigation.

                      lloyd
              (dumbstruck)
          you gotta be kidding.

                      athletic beauty
          good work, harry.

lloyd looks to his friend, confused. harry opens his shirt,
revealing a bullet-proof vest.

                                                       116.

                      harry
          she grabbed me down in the lobby and
          explained what was up. they slapped
          this on me and gave me a gun.

                      lloyd
              (to athletic beauty)
          but how did you...?

                      athletic   beauty
          we've been following   you two all the
          way from providence.   mr. and mrs.
          swanson had a homing   device plated
          in the briefcase.

the guys glance guiltily at one another.

                      harry
          yeah, about that dough...

                      athletic beauty
          every bill was counterfeit and marked.

harry and lloyd exhale a sigh of relief.

                                                     cut to:
