ext. apartment building - afternoon

we see the mutt cuts van pull up and park at the curb. a
dejected harry climbs out. at the same time, a taxi pulls up
and drops off lloyd. (he's clutching mary swanson's
briefcase.) both he and harry climb the steps of the building.
they disappear inside without acknowledging each other.

                                                            9.

on the other side of the street - a black cadillac pulls up
and parks. inside are the armani suit and the sportcoat.
they are j.p. shay and joseph mentalino (aka joe

mental).

                        mental
           who the hell do you figure this guy's
           working for?

                       shay
           i don't know, but we'd better find
           out...

mental takes some pills and starts chomping them.

                         shay (cont'd)
           your ulcer?

                       mental
           it ain't gonna kill me.
