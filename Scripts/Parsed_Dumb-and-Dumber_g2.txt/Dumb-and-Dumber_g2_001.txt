ext. providence, rhode island - winter morning

a pretty young woman is standing on the street corner waiting
for a bus. she's carrying books and looking very collegiate.

a black stretch limousine with darkened windows drives past,
slams on its brakes, and backs up. the young woman stares at
her reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all
about.

finally, the rear passenger window zips down, revealing lloyd
christmas, age 30. he's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a
little shaggy. he's wearing a dark suit.

                       lloyd
           excuse me, can you tell me how to
           get to the medical school? i'm
           supposed to be giving a lecture in
           twenty minutes and my driver's a bit
           lost.

                       young woman
               (heavy european accent)
           go straight aheads and makes a left
           over za bridge.

lloyd checks out her body.

                       lloyd
           i couldn't help noticing the accent.

                       young woman
               (unimpressed)
           austria.

                       lloyd
           austria? you're kidding.
               (mock-australian accent)
           well, g'day, mate. what do you say
           we get together later and throw a
           few shrimp on the barbie.

the young woman turns her back to him and walks away.

                       lloyd (cont'd)
               (to self)
           guess i won't be going down under
           tonight...

he sighs and zips the window back up.

                                                            2.
