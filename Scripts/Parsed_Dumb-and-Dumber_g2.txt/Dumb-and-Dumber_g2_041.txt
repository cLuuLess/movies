ext. second honeymoon motel - night

we see that the black cadillac is   parked a few cars over
from the mutt cutts van with j.p.   shay in the passenger seat.
pan over to a payphone. inside is   joe mental. outside the
booth, an anxious man impatiently   paces back and forth as he
waits for the phone.

                      mental
              (into phone)
          the boys are holed-up in a little
          love nest for the night. i think
          they're a couple of fucking weirdos.
