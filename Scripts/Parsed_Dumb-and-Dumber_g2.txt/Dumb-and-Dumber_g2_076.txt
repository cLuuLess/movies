ext. mutt cutts van - night

the athletic beauty is back in her jeep now and harry has
sidled up to the driver's side. he leans against her side-
view mirror.

                                                           57.

                      harry
              (re: suitcases in
               back seat)
          that's a lot of luggage for a little
          vacation.

                      athletic beauty
          actually, i'm moving to aspen. i've
          got to get away from my boyfriend.

he's such a klutz. my astrologer told me i should avoid
accident-prone guys.

just then, the side-view mirror harry has been leaning on
snaps off the car. he cracks

his head against the windshield, falls to the ground, then
quickly leaps to his feet as if nothing happened.

                      harry
              (holding out mirror)
          here, this is a little loose.

she throws the mirror into the back seat and takes out a
cigarette.

                        harry (cont'd)
          allow me...

he pulls out a match and lights it with a debonair flourish.
the athletic beauty nods her thanks. harry tosses the match
to the ground, and we hear an o.s. whoosh! wisps of smokes
rise around him and we hear the low crackle of something
burning. (neither of them notice this.)

                      harry (cont'd)
          look, um, maybe when i get to aspen
          we can meet up... you know, for hot
          chocolate or something.

she looks him over and smiles.

                      athletic beauty
          why not? you seem pretty harmless.
          i'll give you my number. just let me
          find a pen.

as she starts to rummage through her purse, harry smells the
smoke. he looks down and sees that his right shoe is ablaze!
he shakes it, then tries to put it out with the other shoe,
but to no avail. meanwhile, the athletic beauty is still
searching for a pen.

                                                        58.

                      athletic beauty (cont'd)
          i know i have one here somewhere...

harry starts doing a soft-shoe dance to extinguish the flames.
this only helps to fan them.

                      harry
              (urgently)
          look, why don't you just tell it to
          me, i've got a good memory.

                      athletic beauty
          are you sure you won't forget?

                      harry
              (desperate)
          positive please hurry.

he begins hopping around violently.

                      athletic beauty
          is something wrong?

harry shakes his head no as he bites his lip to keep from
screaming.

                      athletic beauty (cont'd)
          okay, my number is 652-2553.
              (beat)
          oh, wait a second, that's my old
          number. it's so funny how your mind
          god sakes, give me the damn number!

she's taken aback by this outburst.

                      athletic beauty (cont'd)
          look, man, if you're gonna get pushy
          you can just forget it!

she throws the car into drive and peels away.
