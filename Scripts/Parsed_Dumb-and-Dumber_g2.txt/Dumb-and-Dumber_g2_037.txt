int. mutt cutt van - night

lloyd is driving now while harry sleeps in the passenger
seat. the song, "cut flowers" by the smithereens, starts to
play as lloyd fantasizes about his future in aspen.

                                                dissolve to:

lloyd's fantasy:

lloyd is walking up the steps of a luxurious, snow-covered
chalet, carrying mary's briefcase. the sky is absurdly blue
and children are making a snowman on the lawn. it's all out
of a dream world. he knocks on the door, tentatively. mary
opens it. she looks at him, then at the briefcase, and breaks
into the biggest, sweetest smile he's ever seen. then she
slowly backs into the house, gesturing for him to follow...

lloyd follows mary down a hallway. as he trails after her,
she pulls off her shirt, revealing her bare back, and glances
over her shoulder at him.

camera moves around a corner and now we're in a steamy
bathroom. the shower is running and we see the silhouette of
two people behind the curtain.

                             lloyd
                    (v.o.)

ooh... ooh... mary...

                          mary
                  (v.o.)
              how does that feel, lloyd?

                             lloyd
                    (v.o.)

mmmm... tingly...
