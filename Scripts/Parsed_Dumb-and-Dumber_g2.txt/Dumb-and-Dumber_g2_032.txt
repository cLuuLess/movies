int. mutt cutts van - afternoon

a jubilant harry's driving and chewing on a mouthful of beef
jerky.

                      lloyd
          i just wish we could've seen sea
          bass's face when he got the bill.

                      harry
          i hope we never have to.

                      lloyd
          don't worry. that fish-head is
          probably half-way to providence by
          now.

                                                        29.

                       harry
          i hope so.

harry checks his rear-view mirror nervously.

                      lloyd
          hey, stop the car. i gotta take a
          whiz.

                      harry
          are you crazy? i'm not stopping now.
          what if they figure out we went the
          other way. they'll be on us in no
          time.

                      lloyd
          but i gotta go. what am i supposed
          to do?

                       harry
          hold it.

                      lloyd
          i can't hold it. i'm about to explode.

                        harry
          well... just take a whiz in an empty
          beer bottle. there's a couple on the
          floor in the back seat.

                      lloyd
          are you serious?

                      harry
          yes, i'm serious. i'm not stopping
          now. we could get killed.
lloyd sighs. he takes an empty beer bottle from the back
seat and unzips his fly. suddenly we hear a peeing sound.
then:

                       lloyd
          uh-oh...

                      harry
          what's the matter?

                       lloyd
          the bottle's almost full and i'm
          still going.

                      harry
          well stop going.

                                                           30.

                      lloyd
          i can't stop once i already started,
          you know that. quick, get me another
          bottle.

harry can barely hold the steering wheel as he reaches way
in the back seat for an empty.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          jesus, be careful! you almost went
          off the road.

                      harry
          i'm sorry, lloyd. i'm doing the best
          i can.

he hands lloyd another empty and lloyd quickly makes the
switch.

                      lloyd
          here, hold this.

before harry knows it he's holding the full bottle of urine.
