int. mutt cutts van - sunny morning

it's bright daylight now. harry is sleeping peacefully in
the passenger seat while lloyd sips a coffee. the van hits a
bump which causes harry's eyes to flutter open.

                      lloyd
          hey, mr. sleepy head, welcome back.

                       harry
              (groggy)
          how long have i been out?

                      lloyd
          i'd say a good five hours, anyway.

harry yawns and stretches.

                      harry
          great. we must be getting real close,
          huh?

                      lloyd
          should be. i've been averaging about
          ninety miles an hour all night.

                       harry
          good man.

                      lloyd
          boy, i'll tell you, this is one
          angerous highway. you wouldn't believe
          all the road pizza two dead ogs, a
          couple of rabbits, a snake and some
          big thing i couldn't even recognize.

                      harry
          that's awful. did you see them get
          hit or were they already lying there?

                       lloyd
          i hit 'em.

harry rubs his eyes and looks at the passing flatlands.

                                                           62.

                      harry
          funny. i expected the rocky mountains
          to be a little rockier than this.

                      lloyd
          i was thinking the same thing. that
          john denver's some full of shit,
          huh?

they both stare out the window.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          i must say, des moines sure is a
          pretty little town.

                      harry
          yeah, it really is.
              (beat)
          wait a minute when did you visit
          des moines?

                      lloyd
          last night. we drove through it.

                      harry
          what are you talking about? you were
          snoring like a baby when we went
          through des moines.

lloyd shakes his head in amusement, then snaps his fingers
in harry's face.

                       lloyd
              (sing-song)
          hello? hello? anybody home? rise and
          shine.
              (laughs)
          you were the one who was asleep,

numbskull. here, take a sip of coffee. you're delirious.

a confused harry sips the coffee and checks out the passing
terrain. then something starts to awn on him. slowly.

                      harry
          uh, lloyd, refresh my memory: doesn't
          the sun rise in the east and set in
          the west?

                      lloyd
          in our country it does, yes.

                                                        63.

                      harry
          then perchance you can explain to me
          why the sun is in our face at 7:30
          in the morning when we're heading
          west.

lloyd thinks about this and then looks sickened.

                                                     cut to:
