ext. corner grocery store - night

lloyd comes out of the store with his arms full of groceries.
he stops at a newspaper machine, pulls out his wallet and
removes a quarter.

he drops the quarter in the machine, opens it, and realizes
that he doesn't have a free hand to pick up the newspaper.
he puts his wallet inside the machine, picks up the newspaper,
and as he does so the machine slams shut with his wallet
still inside.

lloyd sighs, puts his grocery bags on the machine, and checks
his pockets. no more change. just then, an elderly woman
struggles by using a walker.

                      lloyd
          excuse me, little old lady, do you
          have change for a dollar?

                      elderly woman
          change? no, i'm sorry, i don't...

                      lloyd
          well could you do me a favor and
          guard this while i go break a dollar?
          my wallet's locked in this machine.

                                                           15.

                      elderly lady
          of course, young man...

lloyd runs back into the store. we hold on the store door as
lloyd exits a few seconds later with a handful of quarters.
suddenly he stops in his tracks. the elderly lady, her walker,
and his groceries are gone. as he takes a closer look, he
sees that

she has taken his wallet also.

                                                     cut to:
