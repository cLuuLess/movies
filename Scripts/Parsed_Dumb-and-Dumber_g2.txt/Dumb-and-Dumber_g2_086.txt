int. hearse - day

lloyd is driving and harry has his feet out the window.

                      lloyd
          tell me something, harry. would you
          really have kept going home if i
hadn't come back to get you?

                      harry
          well let me put it this way, lloyd:
          do you remember when we were cub
          scouts and we got lost in the woods
          uring that blizzard? we huddled
          together all night, and we made an
          oath that if we ever got out of there
          alive we'd never ever leave each
          other's side again. do you remember
          that?

lloyd thinks hard about this.

                      lloyd
          we were never cub scouts.

                                                        67.

                      harry
          exactly.

just then several cop cars whiz by them in the opposite
direction with sirens blaring and lights flashing. when harry
glances back at the cop cars, he notices that there's a coffin
in the rear of the vehicle.

                      harry (cont'd)
          what the hell is this? there's a
          coffin in the back!

                      lloyd
          relax, it's empty.

                      harry
          i don't give a shit. i'm not driving
          anywhere with a casket. you know i'm
          superstitious calm down. we'll dump
          it off first chance we get.
