ext. mutt cuts dog salon - day
this building is white with black spots on it, like a
dalmation. over the front door is an awning shaped like a
dog's snout, whiskers included. a van pulls up outside.

the vehicle is decorated like a giant poodle, with four legs
hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout
on the front grill. mutt cuts is written on the side of it.

harry dunne climbs out. he's in his early 30s and dressed in
a ridiculous beagle costume, including a cap with floppy
ears. he goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm
of dogs pile out.

                        harry
            okay, gang, single file. you know
            the rules: no pushing, no humping,
            and no sniffing heinies...

                                                           3.

the door to the shop opens and harry's annoyed boss, mr.
palmer, sticks his head out.

                      palmer
          hey, why aren't those mutts on
          leashes?

                      harry
          the same reason you're not on a leash,
          sir because it's demeaning and it
          chafes like hell.

                      palmer
          just get them in here now! they all
          have to be bathed and clipped in an
          hour.

palmer disappears back inside. harry calls to the dogs but
they pay no attention. he struggles to keep them from
wandering off. he grabs a couple of small pooches and sits
them on a wall.

                      harry
          you kids stay right here...

as he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall
isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. the truck drives away,
taking the two dogs with it.

                      harry (cont'd)
              (at truck)
          hey, wait a minute!

harry chases after the vehicle.

                                                     cut to:
