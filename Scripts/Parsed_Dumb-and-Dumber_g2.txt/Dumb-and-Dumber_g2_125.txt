int. bathroom

harry's got the eintire toilet completely disassembled now.
various pieces of the commode litter the floor, including
the big plastic float ball. he's on his knees tinkering with
some pipes coming out of the wall.

                      harry
          uh... just cleaning my teeth. give
          me a minute, mary, i'll be right
          with you.

                      mary
              (o.s.)
          sorry, but something important's
          come up and i have to run out. it's
          sort of an emergency. i'll explain
          later.

                        harry
          but mary --

                      mary
              (o.s.)
          --i'm really sorry, harry. i promise
          we'll do this another time.

harry hears her footsteps echo down the hallway and then the
front door closing. harry slumps against the sink, defeated.
                        harry
          great...
