int. elegant hotel suite - night

a tuxedoed bell captain, barnard, is showing the guys around
an enormous and luxurious suite. the place is big enough to
throw a touchdown bomb in.

                        barnard
          ...this is the hotel danbury's
          presidential suite, gentlemen. it's
          normally reserved for royalty,
          visiting dignitaries, and illustrious
          stars of stage and take it.

the bell captain is a bit taken aback, but pleased.

                      barnard (cont'd)
          very good, sir. are there any bags
          you'd like sent up?

                      lloyd
          thanks, barnard, but we'll find our
          own chicks.

                      barnard
              (peevish)
          i wasn't talking about ladies.

                                                          75.

                        harry
            oh. then go ahead and send thim up.
            what are their names?

barnard sighs.

                        barnard
            sir, i meant your luggage.

harry forces a. embarrassed half-smile.

                        lloyd
            tell you what you can send up, my
            friend how about some chow?

the bell captain nods.

                        barnard
            i'll bring you a menu.

                        lloyd
            don't bother. just order us one of
            everything.

at this, harry serves lloyd a reproachful look.

                        harry
            one of everything? lloyd...

lloyd looks guilty.

                        lloyd
            oh, sorry.
                (beat)
            make that two of everything.
harry smiles at this as lloyd pulls a wad of hundred dollar
bills out of his pocket. he rips one off and tucks it in
barnard's top pocket.

                        lloyd (cont'd)
            and here you go, barney. you keep us
            happy, we'll keep you happy.

the bell captain, barnard, is energized by this tip.

                         barnard
            yes, sir!

he bows and leaves the room. then lloyd cracks open the
briefcase and inserts a small piece

of paper.

                                                           76.

                         lloyd
                 (proudly)
             our first iou. signed and dated.
