int. dante's inferno - day
back at the table, the boys are soaked and huffing as if
they just finished the boston marathon. the burgers have
been served, but lloyd and harry are still too traumatized
to touch them.

                      harry
          that really wasn't very polite of
          him, was it? maybe we should loosen
          the screws of his chair.

                      lloyd
          harry dunne, i'm surprised at you.
          perhaps it's about time you brushed

up on a little tome that we god-

fearing adults call the bible. it's crammed with all kinds
of pithy rules to live your life by.

                                                        48.

                      harry
              (humbled)
          you mean like 'turn the other cheek?'

                      lloyd
          no, i mean like 'an eye for an eye.'
          hand me those peppers the atomic
          ones.

harry passes the jar and the two of them load joe mental's
burger with chili

peppers, expertly camouflaging them with lettuce.

                      harry
              (whispering)
          here he comes.

lloyd and harry bite into their food as joe mental sits back
down at the table.

                      mental
          feeling any better, boys?

as he pours ketchup on his burger, the guys glance at each
other and titter. then he picks it up and brings it to his
mouth. just before biting into it, though, he pauses.

                      mental (cont'd)
          so tell me, why you fellas headed to
          aspen? vacation?

                      lloyd
          more like re-location.

mental starts toward the burger but stops again.
                      mental
          doesn't look like you packed much.
          all i saw was a couple bags... and
          that briefcase.

                      harry
          the briefcase isn't even ours. some
          lady just left it at the airport.
          we're bringing it back to her.

this is news to mental.

                      mental
          you mean you don't even know her?

                      lloyd
          not really. i was just her limo river.

                                                               49.

mental looks at the two of them and realizes that they're
serious. then he breaks out

laughing.

                        mental
            talk about being in the wrong place
            at the wrong time...

lloyd and harry share a     confused look. mental shakes his
head and bites into his     burger, chewing heartily. almost
immediately, his happy     demeanor is replaced by a look of
horror. his face turns     red, he grabs his stomach and falls
to the

ground, gasping.

the boys look at each other guiltily, then bend down to help
him.

                        harry
            hey, you okay, man? it was just a
            goof.

                          mental
                (strained whisper)
            my ulcer... quick... pills... in my coat...

harry checks mental's coat pocket        for his antacid pills but
unwittingly brings out the black        of cyanide pills. he shakes
some pills out and hands them to        mental, who tosses them in
his mouth and starts to munch on        them.

for a moment, he appears to improve. his breathing slows and
he sits up. then his eyes
light up.

mental's pov - quick zoom in on the black bottle harry is
holding!

                        mental (cont'd)
            you son-of-a-bitch!

mental gurgles and keels over, dead.

                                                            cut to:
