int. lloyd & harry's apartment

the door opens and lloyd enters. harry is sitting on the
couch, looking almost comatose.

                      harry
          where's the booze?

                      lloyd
          it's gone. i got robbed by grandma
          walton. she got my wallet, too.

harry drops his head and lets out a moan.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          come on, man, cheer up. we've been
          own before. i'm sure we'll land on
          our heads somewhere.
                       harry
          it gets worse, lloyd. my parakeet
          petey he's... he's dead.

lloyd looks touched by this.

                      lloyd
          oh man, i'm sorry, harry. what
          happened?

                      harry
          his head fell off.

                      lloyd
          his head fell off?

                                                           16.

                        harry
            yeah, he was pretty old.

lloyd puts his hand on harry's shoulder compassionately.

                        lloyd
                (hopeful)
            i don't suppose he had a warranty...?

                        harry
            nah, i bought him used.

as lloyd thinks about the unfairness of life, he grows upset.

                        lloyd
            that's it! i've had it with this
            ump! we don't have food, we don't
            have jobs, our pets' heads are falling
            off, we're surrounded by roving gangs
            of larcenous old

ladies...

                        harry
            okay, calm down.

                        lloyd
            no i won't calm down.

lloyd flops down in a chair.

                        lloyd (cont'd)
            what the hell are we doing here
            anyway, harry? we've got to get out
            of this town.
                        harry
            yeah, and go where?

                        lloyd
            i'll tell you where: someplace warm,
            a place where the beer flows like
            wine, where beautiful women
            instinctively flock like the salmon
            of capistrano.
                (dramatic pause)
            i'm talking about aspen.

                        harry
            aspen?

                        lloyd
            that's right, aspen.

                                                        17.

                      harry
          i don't know, lloyd, the french are
          assholes.

                      lloyd
          let me ask you something: do you
          want to end up like petey dead in
          some flea-ridden apartment, face-
          down on a dear abby column, with a
          soggy sunflower seed pressed against
          your beak? or do you want to enjoy
          your life?
              (beat)
          come on, harry, don't let petey's
          eath be in vain. don't you see what
          he was saying? spread your wings,
          man. he was saying? spread your wings,
          man. fly.

                      harry
              (confused)
          what are you talking about, lloyd?
          his head fell off.
              (dawning realization)
          wait a second, i know what you're up
          to. you just wanna go to aspen so
          you can find that girl who lost her
          briefcase and you need me to drive
          you there.

                      lloyd
          that's bullshit. i'll drive.
              (beat)
          and what's so wrong about going
          someplace where we know someone who
          can plug us into the social pipeline?
                      harry
              (torn)
          i don't know, lloyd. i think we should
          stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep
          saving money for the worm store. i'm
          getting a little sick and tired of
          always running from creditors.

lloyd moves to the window and looks out at the gray, wintry
cityscape.

                      lloyd
          you know what i'm sick and tired of,
          harry? i'm sick and tired of having
          to eek my way through life. i'm sick
          and tired of being a nobody.
                      (more)

                                                           18.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
              (beat)
          but most of all, i'm sick and tired
          of having nobody.

there's a deadly silence as they both think about this. then
harry tries to lighten the mood. he opens his arms wide.

                      harry
          come on, lloyd. give us a kiss.

                      lloyd
          on the other hand, maybe you're right,
          harry. maybe we should stay here and
          try our luck in bankruptcy court.
          with all those lawsuits against us,
          i'm sure we'll win at least one. it
          could be a boost to our egos.

harry sees that lloyd has a point. he stands and approaches
petey's cage. his eyes fill with tears.

                         harry
                 (emotional)
          petey, i made a promise to you once,
          man...
                 (thinking hard)
          ...and i'll be damned if i can remember
          what it was.
