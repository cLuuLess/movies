nicholas andre is greeting people at the door. however, when
harry and lloyd try to enter, he stops them and gives them
the once over.

                      andre
          excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a
          five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner.

harry and lloyd look at each other and shrug. then lloyd
takes out a wad of bills and peels

off ten hundreds, much to the amazement of andre.

                      lloyd
          this should cover a couple plates.

                      harry
          i'm kind of hungry, lloyd. what if
          we want seconds?

lloyd thinks about this. then he peels off another thou.
                      lloyd
          put us down for four plates, my good
          man.

they enter the party. as andre watches them go, his associate
j.p. shay comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face.

                      j.p. shay
              (whispering)
          jesus christ, boss... it's them.

back on harry and lloyd - the guys make their way through
the affluent crowd.

                      lloyd
          i'm getting nervous, harry.

                                                        83.

                      harry
          relax, lloyd. these people are just
          like you and me.

                      lloyd
          what are you talking about? they're
          educated, well-bred, charming, and
          sophisticated.

                      harry
          so what? we can be sophistica holy
          shit, would you look at the fun bags
          on that hose hound.

he points out a busty blonde bombshell entering the party.
lloyd rolls his eyes.

                      lloyd
          don't do this to me, harry. i'm
          already a wreck. what if mary oesn't
          like me?

                      harry
          look, let's just go saddle up to the
          bar and down a couple bowls of
          loudmouth soup. a little booze'll
          bring back that old lloyd christmas
          over-confidence.

the guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they
make their way to the bar.

                      lloyd
              (to bartender)
          two martinis, straight up.
as harry and lloyd silently take in the party, a beautiful
red head reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then
walks away.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          shut up, harry.

                      harry
          i didn't say anything.

                      lloyd
          yeah, well i know what you were gonna
          say and i'm telling you to shut up
          in advance.

                      harry
          how do you know what i was gonna
          say?

                                                        84.

                      lloyd
          i read you like a book.

                      harry
          okay, if you read me like a book
          then what was i gonna say?

                      lloyd
          you were gonna say:
              (in harry's looped
               voice)
          'that's one fiery bush i wouldn't
          mind roasting my weenie in.'

harry raises his eyebrows, impressed.

                       lloyd (cont'd)
          and i would say 'shut up', because
          this is our chance to get in with
          the rich and powerful and you don't
          ingratiate yourself to the kind of
          people by acting like ron jeremy on
          spanish fly.

the bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s.
clinking of a glass. the guys turns to

see nicholas andre standing at a podium. next to him is a
large, covered display. on his other side are karl and
elizabeth swanson.

                      andre
          if i could have your attention,
          please...

the crowd quiets.
                      andre (cont'd)
          i'd like to thank you all for coming
          to this very special event. as you

know, the aspen preservation society -

founded and chiefly funded by our great benefactors, karl
and helen swanson - is the world's foremost efender of
endangered species. our

sprawling grounds are home to twenty-

three separate varieties of animals that are currently listed
on the united nation's charter of protected species. tonight,
we are deeply honored to have mr. karl swanson welcome our
twenty-fourth.

                                                        85.

the crowd claps as mr. swanson takes andre's place at the
podium.

                      mr. swanson
          ladies and gentlemen, i give you the
          icelandic snow owl.

he pulls the cover off, revealing two majestic, fluffy white
owls in a cage. everyone oohs and ahhs.

                      mr. swanson (cont'd)
          these magnificent specimens were

rescued recently, culminating a five-

year, two-million-dollar effort on our part. together, they
constitute one-seventh of the snow owl population left on
the planet.

on andre - he's nervously eyeing harry and lloyd. he looks
pale.

                      mr. swanson
          here these lovely birds will be
          allowed to breed in a natural but
          protected habitat. and, god willing,
          with your help and that of the
          society's, we will see these wonderful
          creatures flourish once more.

more applause.

                      mr. swanson (cont'd)
          again, thank you, and enjoy your
          evening. oh, and feel free to take a
          closer look at our new friends here.
          enjoy.

the crowd applauds and begins to mingle again. lloyd turns
back to the bartender and holds up his empty glass.

                      lloyd
          two more, please.

harry stares at lloyd with concern.

                      harry
          lloyd, i've never seen you this
          uptight. you've gotta chill out.

                      lloyd
          i can't help it. this is a very
          important night for me.
                      (more)

                                                        86.

                       lloyd (cont'd)
              (beat)
          harry, have you ever wondered why
          you and i never have long-term
          girlfriends?

                      harry
          what are you talking about? i went
          out with fraida felcher for two and
          a half weeks.

                      lloyd
          that was a fluke.
              (beat)
          the reason we never have long-term
          girlfriends is because of one thing:
          we're afraid of the c word.

                      harry
          that's crazy. we live for the c word.

                      lloyd
          i'm talking bout commitment.

                         harry
                (beat)
          oh.

                      lloyd
          well i'm ready for commitment, harry.
          the first time i laid eyes on mary
          swanson, i knew she was the one.
              (beat)
          some things you feel in your heart,
          other things you feel in your groin.
          this girl makes me feel it all in
          the heart.

suddenly lloyd notices something across the room.

his pov - a beguiling mary swanson is talking with a couple
of guests. she's wearing a

spectacular black cocktail dress.

lloyd quickly turns toward the bar.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          oh shit, there she is.

                                                   87.

                      harry
              (checking her out)
          wow. you weren't kidding, lloyd.
          she's an angel.
              (beat)
          well, what are you waiting for? get
          over there and talk to her.

                      lloyd
          she's gonna think i'm some kind of
          psycho when she realizes how far i
          came just to see her.

                      harry
          you have her briefcase she's gonna
          be thrilled to see you.

                      lloyd
          and then what? she'll take it back
          and that'll be it. i'm a nobody.

harry thinks about this a moment.

                      harry
          look, man, you just drove two thousand
          miles to see this girl. don't quit
          on the last fifty feet.

                       lloyd
               (brightening)
          wait a second, i have an idea. you
          go over and introduce yourself. that
          way you can build me up so when i
          come along i won't have to brag about
          myself. tell her i'm good-looking
          and i'm rich and i have a rapist's
          wit.

                      harry
          i can't tell her you're good looking,
          lloyd she's got eyes.

lloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini.

                      lloyd
          please harry, i'm appealing to you
          as one loser to another. just build
          me up and then give me a signal to
          come over. please.

harry sighs.

                                                           88.

                      harry
          all right. but you're gonna owe me a
          big one for this.

harry straightens his polka-dot bow-tie, then approaches
mary, who is now standing alone, admiring the owls.

                      harry (cont'd)
          nice set of hooters you got there.

mary turns to harry, stunned.

                      mary
          i beg your pardon?

                      harry
          the owls. they're beautiful.

                      mary
          oh. yeah.
              (beat)
          are you a bird lover?

                      harry
          well, i used to have a parakeet, but
          my main area of expertise is canines
          that's dogs to the layperson.

she smiles at this.

                      mary
          thanks. i love dogs, too. so how

are you involved with them?

                      harry
          oh, i've trained them, bathed them,
          clipped them; i've even bred them.

                      mary
          really? any unusual breeding?

                      harry
          nah, mostly just doggie-style. but
          one time we successfully mated a
          bulldog and a shitzu.

                      mary
          really? that's weird.

                      harry
          yeah. we called it a bullshit.
              (breaks out laughing)
          just a little breeder joke.

                                                           89.

she seems strangely charmed by this.

                      harry (cont'd)
          anyway, the real reason i came over
          is because i want to introduce you
          to a friend of mine.

just then, mary's stepmother approaches. she's holding a
martini and looking a little sloshed.

                      helen
          mary, i don't believe i've met your
          friend.

                       mary
          actually, we haven't been introduced
          yet.
               (holds out hand)
          i'm mary swanson, and this is my
          stepmother, helen.

                      harry
          harry dunne. pleasure meeting you
          both.

                      helen
          i saw you come in earlier, mr. dunne.
          i was hoping we'd get a chance to
          meet.

                      harry
              (taken aback)
          you were?

                      helen
          that tuxedo i love a man with a
          sense of humor. so does mary.

mary shoots helen a look, then smiles at harry.

                      harry
          really?

for a moment, he's caught up in mary's eyes, but then manages
to snap out of it.

                      harry (cont'd)
          anyway, about my friend you doing
          anything tomorrow, mr. dunne? because
          i believe mary's looking for somebody
          to hit the slopes with. whuh?

                      mary
          helen, you're embarrassing me.

                                                           90.

                      helen
          well you are, aren't you?
              (to harry)
          poor girl doesn't get out enough. so
          what do you say, harry? are you
          available?

harry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a
hopeful lloyd.

                      harry
          oh, i don't know. you see, my friend
          your friends for one day. you and
          mary will have a ball.

mary's captivating eyes meet his, waiting for an answer.

                          harry (cont'd)
          um... well... i don't know. you see, the
          thing is... sure.

on lloyd - he waits impatiently at the bar as harry returns.

                      lloyd
          how come you didn't call me over?

                      harry
          relax, you're golden. i got you a
          ate with her tomorrow.

lloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest. he's
speechless.

                            lloyd
          wha... you... i... it's...
                (smiles)
          i love you, man. i love you!

lloyd clamps an embarrassed harry in a tight embrace.

                      harry
          okay, get a grip, lloyd. you're making
          a scene.

lloyd steps back elated.

                      lloyd
          this calls for a toast!

he grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to
open it.

                                                           91.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          you're gonna be my best man, har, i
          mean it. it was always between you
          and my future wife's brother, but
          you just earned a seat at the head
          table, pal.

suddenly the cork shoots out of the champagne bottle and
zips across

the room like a bullet   directly toward one of the now even
wider-

eyed owls. in quick succession we hear a bok!, a squawk!,
and a thump!

a hush falls over the entire party as everyone turns their
stunned attention to the cage.

their pov - feathers are floating in the air throughout the
cage, and one of the icelandic snow

owls lies on its back, its species now one bird closer to
extinction.

harry and lloyd look on in horror. harry takes the smoking
champagne bottle from lloyd and places it on the bar.

                      harry
              (under breath)
          i think we've done enough hobnobbing,
          lloyd.

the guys lower their heads and slink out of the room before
anyone can figure out what happened anyone except for
nicholas andre, that is; we pan to show that he's been
standing nearby watching their every move. and he doesn't
look very happy.

                                                      cut to:
