harry is doing his best to steer while now holding five full
bottles and lloyd is still going at it in the passenger seat.

                      harry
          what are you, a goddamn camel?

                      lloyd
          hey, i haven't gone all day.

just then they hear a loudspeaker:

                       state trooper
              (o.s.)
          pull over!

they turn to see the police motorcycle cruising right beside
then. harry rolls down his window and calls out:

                       harry
          huh?

                                                        31.

                       state trooper
          pull over!

harry glances down at his sweater he's wearing, then back at
the trooper.

                      harry
              (calling out)
          no, it's a cardigan! but thanks for
          noticing!

he rolls his window back up and turns to an equally baffled
lloyd.

                      harry (cont'd)
          jesus, what is this, the fashion
          police?

the cop turns on his siren.

                      state trooper
          pull your car to the side of the

road!

                                                     cut to:
