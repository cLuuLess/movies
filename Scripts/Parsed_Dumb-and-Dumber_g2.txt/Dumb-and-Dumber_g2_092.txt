ext. downtown aspen - day

the boys stroll down the sidewalk, looking in the windows,
studying the passersby, taking in the sights and sounds of
the ski town.

                                                        69.

                      lloyd
          isn't this wonderful? what more could
          a couple of single guys like us ask
          for?

                      harry
          how about food and shelter?

                      lloyd
          you're so materialistic.
              (beat)
          why don't we get down to business
          and eliver the briefcase to mary.
          who knows, maybe she'll invite us in
          for tea and a strumpet or two?

                      harry
          jolly good idea, chap. and where oes
          the lovely young lady reside?

                        lloyd
          um... good question.

harry throws lloyd a concerned look, but then notices a phone
booth next to them.

                      harry
          well what's her last name? we'll
          look it up in the phone book.

                        lloyd
          hmmmm... you know, i don't believe i
          caught that either.

harry's concern grows.
                      harry
          what about the briefcase, lloyd?
          there must've been a name on it,
          right?

                      lloyd
              (brightening)
          come to think of it, there is. it's
          engraved right into the leather.

                         harry
          what is it?

                       lloyd
          samsonite   spelled just like it
          sounds.

                                                           70.

harry starts flipping through the phone book. then abruptly
he stops and puts the book down, a defeated look on his face.

                                                     cut to:
