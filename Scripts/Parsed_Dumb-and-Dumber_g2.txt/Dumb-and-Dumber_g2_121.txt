hold on harry's face as he quickly pulls his pants down and
nestles onto the throne. he lets out a sigh of relief as he
does his business, then leans over and slides open the window
to air the room out. he's still glued to the toilet when he
hears a knock on the door.

                      mary
              (o.s.)
          are you in there, harry?
                      harry
              (nervously)
          be right out.

                       mary
              (o.s.)
          i hope you're not using the toilet.
          it's broken.

zoom in tight on harry's face - his eyes go wide and a visible
sweat breaks out on his forehead.

                      harry
          huh?

                                                         103.

                      mary
              (o.s.)
          it doesn't flush.

                      harry
          um, no, i was just... shaving.
