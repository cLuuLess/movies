harry's behind the wheel and lloyd's in the passenger seat.
the animal's "we've got to get out of this place" is blasting
on the radio and the guys are singing along:

                                                        19.

                      lloyd & harry
          "we've got to get out of this place,
          if it's the last thing we ever do,
          we've got to get out of this place,
          girl, there's a better life, for me
          and you..."

lloyd turns down the radio.

                      lloyd
          well, we're finally doing it. do you
          realize that in all the years we've
          known each other, this is the first
          time we've done this together.

                      harry
          been run out of town?

                      lloyd
          taken a trip.

harry reaches over and undoes his seatbelt. lloyd watches,
curious.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          why'd you do that?

                      harry
          what?

                      lloyd
          take your seatbelt off.

                      harry
          because we just cleared the danger
          zone.
                      lloyd
          huh?

                      harry
          don't you know anything, lloyd? ninety
          percent of all accidents happen within
          five miles of home. we've already
          traveled 6.3 miles.

lloyd thinks about this. then:

                      lloyd
          well what about the people who live
          around here? what if we got into an
          accident with one of them?

                                                        20.

harry considers this, then sheepishly puts his seatbelt back
on. lloyd opens a bag of doritos and fiddles with the radio.

                      harry
          where'd you get those?

                      lloyd
          bought 'em when we filled up.

                      harry
          lloyd, i thought we agreed to confer
          on all expenditures. we're on a tight
          budget, remember?

                      lloyd
          this didn't come out of our travel
          fund. i was able to scrape up twenty-
          five bucks before we left. you know,
          so we could live in style.

                      harry
          where'd you get twenty-five extra
          bucks?

                      lloyd
          i sold some stuff to billy in 4-c.

                      harry
          you mean the blind kid?

                      lloyd
          that's right.

lloyd looks out the window guiltily.

                      harry
          what did you sell him, lloyd?

                      lloyd
          just some odds and ends.

                      harry
          specifically?

                      lloyd
          oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of
          marbles, petey, three comic books a
          second, are you telling me you sold
          my dead bird to a blind kid? well
          who else was i gonna sell it to?

                      harry
          but lloyd, petey didn't even have a
          head.

                                                         21.

                      lloyd
          put your mind at ease, friend. i
          took care of it.

                                                     cut to:
