the migrant family is gone now. harry and lloyd are playing
a game while mental stares straight ahead, furious. his eyes
are watering and he looks ill.

                      lloyd
          okay, harry, my turn. let 'er rip.

harry lifts a cheer and lets out a loud fart. lloyd sniffs a
few times, then closes his eyes and wafts it up toward his
nostrils, as if it was the aroma of a fine wine.

                        lloyd (cont'd)
          hmmm... full-bodied, delicate bouquet,
          aged to perfection will rip no fart
          before it's time.

                      harry
          you're the best, man.
              (beat)
          okay, my turn.
                      lloyd
          where are your manners, harry? we
          have a guest.

harry punches mental's shoulder playfully.

                      harry
          come on, mr. mentalino. let one fly.
          it's only a buck.
