int. harry & lloyd's apartment - afternoon

j.p. shay is looking through harry and lloyd's kitchen
cupboards as joe mental comes out of the bedroom.

                      mental
          the briefcase ain't here. he must've
          taken it with him.

                      j.p. shay
          shit.
              (beat)
          well he's gotta come home sometime.

joe mental ominously approaches petey the parakeet's cage.

                      mental
          maybe we should leave him a little
          message to let 'em know we're playing
          hardball.

mental opens the cage door and wraps his meaty fist around
the bird, who screeches in

terror.

                      mental (cont'd)
              (a la tweety bird)
          i taut i taw a puddy cat.

mental smiles, and as we pan to j.p. shay, we hear a bone-
chilling o.s. snap and petey the bird stops squawking.

                                                          14.

                      mental (cont'd)
              (still tweety)
          i did, i did...

                                                  dissolve to:

the mutt cuts van pulls up to the curb. a depressed lloyd
and harry climb out and mope up to their apartment building
entrance.

                       lloyd
          give me what's left of our dough.
          i'll go to the corner and buy a few
          necessities.

harry hands his friend some crumpled bills.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          what's cheaper, thunderbird or night
          train?
