ext. aspen preservation society - night

throngs of guests in black-tie and elegant gowns are entering
the building. suddenly the hearse pulls up with harry and
lloyd bumper surfing behind it. harry's wearing his blue
tuxedo. lloyd's tux isn't any better it's pumpkin orange.
(they've got matching top hats and canes.) when the hearse
stops, the boys hand the driver barnard a couple hundred
dollars.

                      lloyd
          thanks for the lift, barney.
