ext. hearse - night
harry gets out and leans against the car with his arms
crossed. lloyd comes from around the other side.

                      lloyd
          what are you worrying about now?

                      harry
          i'm worried about how you're gonna
          survive the pummeling i'm about to
          give you.

                        lloyd
          huh?

suddenly harry lunges at lloyd, who takes off around the
other side of the car. harry leaps across the hood, but lloyd
manages to evade his grasp.

                                                           72.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          harry, calm down! you're acting like
          a wild animal!

                      harry
          get over here and take your medicine,
          lloyd!

                      lloyd
          sorry, doc, i can't take medicine.
          i'm a christian scientist!

lloyd continues to outrun him around the car. frustrated,
harry opens the car and pulls the

briefcase out.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          what are you doing?

                      harry
          something i should've done a long
          time ago. this stupid thing has been
          the root of our problems all along.

harry starts walking toward the bridge spanning a river.

                      lloyd
          don't do anything foolish, harry.

                      harry
          foolish? this is the most sensible
          thing i've done in years. i'm gonna
          toss this goddamn curse right into
          that river.
lloyd starts to follow after harry.

                      lloyd
          you're making a big mistake, harry!
          i'll never forgive you for this!

harry keeps marching toward the bridge, determined to dispose
of the briefcase.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          harry, hold up! things are gonna get
          better, i promise! in fact, i think

i feel another piece of beef jerky in my left molar! it's
yours, harry, all yours!

harry stops in his tracks, intrigued.

                                                           73.

                      harry
          you're bluffing.

                      lloyd
          no i'm not, man look.

lloyd pulls his cheek back, revealing a molar. harry squints
at it.

                      harry
          that's a filling, you liar!

just then, lloyd makes a dash at harry. harry turns and runs,
but lloyd tackles him as they reach the bridge. the briefcase
goes flying, and the guys wrestle pitifully with one another
in the snow, rolling over and over.

finally, harry manages to get the upper hand. he climbs on
top and clasps his hands

around lloyd's throat.

                      harry (cont'd)
          i used to have a life! a miserable
          one, but a life, nonetheless!

suddenly lloyd's eyes light up as he sees something o.s.
behind his friend.

                       lloyd
              (choked voice)
          harry, look!

harry turns and his eyes light up, too. he lets go of lloyd
as we see
their pov - the briefcase is lying busted open on the ground,
revealing stacks and

stacks of big, beautiful hundred dollar bills!

                                                     cut to:
