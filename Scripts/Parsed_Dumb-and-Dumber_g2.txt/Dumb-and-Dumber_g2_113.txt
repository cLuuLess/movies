ext. base lodge - afternoon

mary gracefully carves her way to the bottom of the hill and
stops with a snow-spraying flourish. she looks around the
outdoor patio for harry. she spots something and does a double-
take.

                                                           97.

mary's pov - harry is sitting at a table, still attached to
the chair lift (which

has been removed from the cable). he's drinking a cup of
coffee and trying to act nonchalant, espite the gawking of
the other skiers. there's a mime performing in the b.g.

back to scene

                      mary
          my god. harry, are you okay?

                      harry
              (lisping)
          i'm fine, i'm fine. it'll come off.

                                                        cut to:

close up of harry's head through a rifle scope. reverse angle
to reveal j.p. shay a few hundred feet up the hill with a
high-powered rifle trained on harry.

                      shay
          you're luck just ran out, pal.

as his trigger finger twitches with anticipation, we go

back to scene

                      mary
          this is silly. let me help you...

mary gets up and stands behind harry. he moans nervously.
she grabs his head in both hands and starts pulling it away
from the bar. we see harry's tongue stretch ridiculously...
five inches... six... then eight. harry groans in pain. suddenly,
his tongue comes undone and harry and mary fall backwards
out of the path of j.p. shay's bullet as it whizzes by. we
hear the mime in the b.g. cry out in pain:

                      mime
          goddamn it! what the fuck?!

the poor mime holds his bleeding hand and retreats nervously
into the lodge as the crowd boos him.

                                                        cut to:
