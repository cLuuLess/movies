int. mutt cutts van - afternoon

lloyd and harry are back on the road, looking solemn.

                        harry
            i can't believe it...

                                                        50.

                      lloyd
          life is a fragile thing, har. one
          minute you're chewing on a burger;
          the next minute you're dead meat.

                      harry
          but he blamed me. you heard him.
          those were his last words.

                      lloyd
          if you don't count that gurgling
          sound.

harry lets out a groan.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          hey, relax, man, i'm just as
          responsible as you are we both
          slipped him the peppers and look at
          me, i on't feel guilty at all.

                      harry
          small comfort coming from a man who
          sells dead birds to blind kids.
              (sighs)
          don't you get it, lloyd. i've got a
          ead guy pissed at me. his restless
          spirit will probably haunt me for
          the next seventy-five years.

                      lloyd
          that's ridiculous. you probably won't
          live to see forty.

harry perks up, cheered by this thought.
                      harry
          oh yeah.
              (beat)
          wow. what a relief.
