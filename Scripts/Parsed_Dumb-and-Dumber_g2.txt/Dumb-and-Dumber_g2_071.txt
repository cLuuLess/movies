ext. truck stop - 2:10 in the morning

the mutt cutts van pulls up to a gas pump. in the background
are several tractor-trailer rigs and a caf√©. harry climbs
out, thoroughly exhausted, walks around and opens the
passenger door.

lloyd tumbles to the asphalt, still asleep. harry nudges him
with his foot.

                      harry
          come on, wake up. you pay, i'll pump.

lloyd comes to and grudgingly pulls himself up to his feet.
