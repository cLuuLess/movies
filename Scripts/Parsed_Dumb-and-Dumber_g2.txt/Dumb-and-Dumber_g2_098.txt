int. mary's bedroom - night

mary is sitting in a chair looking sadly out the french
windows when helen enters.

                         helen
             i brought you some tea. i thought it
             might help you relax.

mary smiles.

                          mary
             thank you.

she takes a mug, sips, and pulls back.

                         mary (cont'd)
             yech! what's in this, whiskey?

                           helen
             uh, sorry... that one's mine.

helen grabs the mug from mary and hands her the other one.

                         helen (cont'd)
             feeling any better, honey?

mary can't take her eyes from the window.

                         mary
             just knowing that melvin's out there,
             being held by god knows who...
                 (fighting back tears)
             it's all my fault. i should've been
             there.

                                                        77.

                       helen
           bullshit. you can't blame yourself
           for this. if you'd been there they
           would've taken you, too.

helen pulls out a joint and torches it up. she takes a hit.

                       mary
           maybe we should just pay them the
           money again and get this thing over

with.

                       helen
           now mary, everything that can be
           done is being done. you've got to
           stop torturing yourself.

                       mary
           what am i supposed to do? go about
           my life as if everything were fine?

                        helen
           that's exactly what you should do.
           get the hell out more, go skiing,
           socialize. don't you see, honey? we
           can't let on that anything is wrong.
           if the press or authorities get wind
           of this, the kidnappers might panic.
               (beat)
           who knows what they'd do to poor
           melvin then?

as mary thinks about this, we

                                                     cut to:
