int. mutt cutts van - afternoon

harry is still driving while lloyd studies a map spread out
before him.

                      harry
          how far have we gone?

                      lloyd
          according to this map, about an inch
          and a half.

                      harry
          shit. we're gonna need a smaller map
          or we'll never get there. we don't
          have enough gas money.
                      lloyd
          relax. we have more than enough.

                      harry
          i believe you're wrong, lloyd.

                      lloyd
          and i believe i'm right, harry.

                      harry
          i still say wrong, lloyd.

                      lloyd
          how much you wanna bet?

                         harry
          i don't bet.

                                                        23.

lloyd looks at his friend, incredulous.

                      lloyd
          what do you mean you don't bet?

                      harry
          i mean i don't gamble, you know that.
          never have and never will.

                      lloyd
          oh, bull. i'll bet you our next meal
          that i can get you gambling before
          the day's out.

                      harry
          there's no way, lloyd. you can't do
          it.

                      lloyd
          i'll give you three-to-one odds.
          that's three feedbags if you win,
          against only one if you lose.

                      harry
          you're wasting your money, lloyd. i
          already told you, i don't gamble.

                      lloyd
          okay, five-to-one i can get you
          gambling before the day's out.

                      harry
          sorry, pal, no way.

                      lloyd
          make it ten-to-one.
harry sticks out his hand.

                      harry
          you got yourself a bet, sucker!

as harry shakes lloyd's hand, lloyd breaks into a big smile.
harry immediately realizes he's been had.

                                                     cut to:
