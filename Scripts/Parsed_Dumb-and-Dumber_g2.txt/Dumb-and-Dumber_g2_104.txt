int. bedroom - presidential suite - the next morning

a jubilant lloyd is fixing his hair in the mirror. in the
b.g., harry is putting on his new ski clothes including a
pair of thermal tights.

                      lloyd
          mrs. christmas... mary christmas... mrs.
          mary christmas. you

know, it has kind of a ring to it, oesn't it, har?

                      harry
          sounds nice, lloyd, but don't you
          think you may be jumping the gun a
          little? i mean, who knows, when you
          get to know her, you may find out
          she's not your type.

                      lloyd
          impossible. i know my type    when i
          see it. now let me get this    straight,
          she wants me to meet her at    the
          avalanche bar and grill on    main
          street?

                      harry
          that's what she said. ten o'clock
          sharp.

this is when lloyd notices harry's get-up.

                                                        93.

                      lloyd
          time out. where are going ressed
          like that.

                      harry
          i, uh, thought while you were making
          your love connection i'd try my luck
          on the slopes.

                      lloyd
          you mean you're gonna go out in public
          dressed in tights?

                      harry
          these aren't tights. they're
          fashionable euro-trash ski trousers.

                      lloyd
          but you can see the outline of your
          who-who.

harry looks down at his crotch.

                        harry
          really?

                      lloyd
          turn sideways.

harry turns his profile against the window.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          actually, it's just a tiny little
          lump. no one will ever notice.

                      harry
          you're right. i can't go out dressed
          like this.

                                                     cut to:
