nicholas andre has his gun pointed at a stunned lloyd and
mary.

                                                        110.

                      andre
          well at least you two got to say
          your goodbyes.

                         lloyd
          who are you?

                      andre
          don't play dumb with me, asshole.
          i'm the rightful ower of that
          briefcase you've been carrying.

                         lloyd
          uh-oh.

mary can't believe what's happening.

                      mary
          nicholas, you... you motherfucker!
          my family trusted you!

                         andre
          shut up!

                      lloyd
          uh, sir, about the briefcase, i want
          you to know, my friend harry and i
          have every intention of reimbursing
          you.

andre looks alarmed. he motions mary to the briefcase with
his gun.

                      andre
          open that damn thing!
mary opens the briefcase and a pile of white, crumpled-up
balls of paper fall out along with a few packets of hundreds.

                      andre (cont'd)
          what the hell's this? where's all
          the money?

                      lloyd
          that's as good as money, sir. those
          are our ious. you can add them up
          yourself. every penny's accounted
          for.

andre looks like his head is about to burst in anger.

                      andre
          you're fucking dead!

                                                       111.

                      lloyd
          now don't do anything hasty, man.

                                                     cut to:
