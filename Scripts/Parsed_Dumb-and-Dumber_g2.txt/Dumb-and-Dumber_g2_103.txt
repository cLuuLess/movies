int. aaspen apartment - night

nicholas andre is pacing the room with a drink in his hand
while j.p. shay looks on nervously.

                      j.p. shay
          maybe it was just a coincidence.

                      andre
          don't be stupid. it's a message,
          plain and simple: we killed their
          bird, now they killed ours.

                                                          92.

                       j.p. shay
          but how could anybody off a bird
          with a cork?

                      andre
          these guys arent' just anybody.
          they're good. look what they did to
          mental. he was the best, and yet he
          fell right into their web.

                      j.p. shay
          but the bastards already got our
          money. what the hell more could they
          want?

andre runs his fingers through his hair.

                      andre
              (at wit's end)
          i don't know, god damn it!
