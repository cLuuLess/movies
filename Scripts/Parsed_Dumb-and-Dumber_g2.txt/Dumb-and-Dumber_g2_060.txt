ext. dante's inferno - day

mental is on the phone outside the front door talking to
nicholas andre.

intercut conversation

                      mental
          it's mental. i'm just sitting down
          to a nice meal with our boys.

                      andre
          good work. what did you find out so
          far?

                      mental
          nothing yet, but i'm gonna shake 'em
          own for information at lunch.
              (beat)
          then i'm gonna kill 'em for dessert.

                      andre
          well eat fast, time's running out.

and whatever you do, don't let them get any closer. i don't
need them here running around aspen.

mental pulls a black vial of pills out of his jacket.

                      mental
          relax, they ain't gonna be running
          around anywhere after i dump a little
          cyanide in their pops.
