int. cadillac (lead car) - day

(this is the car right behind the funeral hearse.) a man and
a woman are arguing.

                      woman
          i married a cheapskate.

                      man
          shut your trap, gerdie.

                      woman
          i'm so embarrassed. i'll never be
          able to show my face again.

                      man
          i knew something good would come out
          of this.

                      woman
          we could have given him a more
          ignified burial.

                      man
          your uncle was a cheap man. remember
          what he got us for our twenty-fifth?
          a friggin' fern. there's no way i'm
          gonna spend a load to get him planted.
