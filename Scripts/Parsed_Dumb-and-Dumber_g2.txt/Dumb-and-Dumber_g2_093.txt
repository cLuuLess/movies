int. hearse - night

the car is parked in a parking lot across the street from a
picturesque bridge. harry and lloyd are shivering in the
front seat as a loud, icy wind whips though the hearse.
they're each spooning something out of a coffee cup and
sipping it.

                      harry
          any soup left?

                      lloyd
          a little. shall we share it?

                      harry
          please.

lloyd opens a tiny ketchup packet and squirts half of it
into harry's cup and the other half into his. they pour a
few drops of water in and mix it with their spoons.

                      lloyd
          mmmm mmmm good...

lloyd smiles bravely at harry. harry notices something and
leans toward him.

                       harry
          hey, you got something stuck in your
          front teeth.
lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it.

                        lloyd
          hmmm... looks like an old piece of
          beef jerky.

harry stares at it. then:

                      harry
          wanna split it?

                      lloyd
          you're pathetic. get your own.

loyd puts the floss-meat back in his mouth and chews it.
another gust of wind swirls around them.

                                                         71.

                      harry
          i'm freezing my ass off, lloyd.

                      lloyd
          roll up your window.

                      harry
          it is rolled up.

                      lloyd
          then i guess the damn anti-cold system
          isn't working. you really should get
          it fixed if we're gonna live here
          all winter.

                      harry
          what anti-cold system?

lloyd points to the dash.

                      lloyd
          right here the a/c button. i put it
          on full blast about an hour ago and,
          if anything, the car's getting colder.

harry stares at lloyd and then throws down his cup, disgusted.
he opens the car door and starts to climb out.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          what are you going out there for?

                        harry
          to warm up.
