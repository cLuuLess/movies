ext. hotel danbury - day

the guys exit the hotel and approach the bell captain,
barnard.

                      harry
          hey, barney...

                      bell captain
          yes, gentlemen?

                      lloyd
          look, we just wanted to say that we
          appreciate all you did for us during
          our stay.

                      harry
          and we're, um, sorry about the money
          we gave you turning out to be phony.
                      bell captain
          don't worry about it, gentlemen. the
          swanson family has promised to
          reimburse everyone.

this seems to please lloyd and harry. the hearse is delivered
to the front door.

                      lloyd
          well, anyway, thanks again for
          everything.

they turn to go, but barnard calls to them:

                      barnard
          where are you two headed?

                                                       118.

                      harry
          i dunno. i'm sure we'll find a trailer
          camp somewhere to call home.

                      barnard
          why not right here?

harry and lloyd look at each other, confused.

                      lloyd
          this joint is a little out of our
          budget, barney.

                      barnard
              (smiling)
          oh, i think we might be able to find
          you a free room somewhere -- after
          all, like you once told me, we're
          all from the same mold.
              (winks)
          you just don't have any dough right
          now.

the guys are stunned by barnard's generous offer.

                      harry
          are you on the level?

                      barnard
          absolutely. we'll just slide you
          into one of the employee rooms...

the guys beam at this.

                      barnard (cont'd)
          ...provided, of course, you don't
          mind working one or two afternoons a
          week.

harry and lloyd lock eyes. then:

                      lloyd
          you know what, barney, i think we'll
          take out chances down the road.

barnard shakes his head as the two fools climb into their
hearse and drive off.
