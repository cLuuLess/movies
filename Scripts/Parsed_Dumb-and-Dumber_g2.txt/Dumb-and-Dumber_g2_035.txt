ext. highway - late day

the state trooper is walking up beside the stopped mutt cutts
van, staring at it with isapproval.

                      state trooper
          license and registration, please.

harry hands him the papers.
                      state trooper (cont'd)
          you know, you fellas were all over
          the road back there.

                      harry
          yes, sir, we had a little... ifficulty
          in the car.

                      state trooper
          uh-huh.
              (beat)
          have you boys been doing a little
          rinking maybe?

                       harry
          no, sir.

                                                        32.

                       state trooper
           then what's that?

he points to the open, full beer bottles hidden in the seat
between them.

                       harry
           oh, that's nothing, sir.

                       state trooper
           do you know it's against the law to
           rive with an open alcohol container
           in this state?

                       lloyd
           but, your honor, he's telling the
           truth. it's not beer.

the officer smirks.

                       state trooper
           is that right?

the trooper reaches in and picks up one of the bottles. he
inspects the beer label, then moves

the bottle to his lips.

                       harry
           sir, i wouldn't trooper --you'd keep
           your mouth shut if you knew what was
           good for you.

                       lloyd
               (under breath)
you would, too...

harry shoots lloyd a look as the trooper begins gulping down
the piss. he pauses uncertainly and a sick look comes over
his face. he takes a deep breath. then:

                        state trooper
               (pained)
           get the hell out of here.

                                                     cut to:

the mutt cutts van is pulling back onto the highway while
the officer remains in the breakdown lane with his hands on
his knees.

                                                     cut to:

                                                        33.
