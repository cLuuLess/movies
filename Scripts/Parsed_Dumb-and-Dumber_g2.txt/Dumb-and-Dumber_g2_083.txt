ext. truckstop - morning

the mutt cutts van is parked next to a couple rigs and harry
is sitting beside it on the pavement, a broken man.

                      lloyd
          i'm only human, harry. anybody can
          make a mistake.

but harry just sits there, practically catatonic.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          come on, man, pull yourself together.

                      harry
          you know, i got half a mind to just
          jump on the bus to europe and say
          goodbye to your ugly mug forever.

                      lloyd
              (rolls his eyes)
          you can't take a bus to europe, dodo.

                      harry
          oh yeah? why not?
                      lloyd
          you don't have a passport.

harry lets out a defeated sigh.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          come on, stop being a baby about
          this. okay, so we back-tracked a
          tad.

                      harry
          a tad? lloyd, you drove almost a
          sixth of the way across the country
          in the wrong direction. now we don't
          have enough money to get to aspen,
          we on't have enough money to get
          home, we don't have enough to eat,
          we don't have enough to sleep!

                                                           64.

                      lloyd
          well it doesn't do any good having
          you sitting there on your butt whining
          about it. if we're gonna get out of
          this hole, we're gonna have to dig
          ourselves out.

harry thinks about this.

                      harry
          you know, you're absolutely right,
          lloyd.

he stands up, brushes off his pants, and starts to walk toward
the highway.

                      lloyd
          where you going?

                      harry
          home. i'm walking home.

                      lloyd
          you can't be serious.

                      harry
              (sarcastic)
          why not? we're probably only five
          miles away.

harry starts resolutely toward the road while lloyd watches.

                      lloyd
              (calling out)
          thanks a lot, mr. perfect. like you
          never screwed up.
harry suddenly stops in his tracks and turns back to his
friend. he seems completely rained.

                        harry
          look, man... i'm sorry.
              (beat)
          i never should have let you talk me
          into this in the first place. you've
          got a good reason to goo a beautiful
          girl's waiting for you. but let's
          face it, lloyd, there's nothing
          waiting for me in aspen.
              (beat)
          there's nothing waiting for me
          anywhere.

                                                         65.

lloyd just stands there, speechless, as harry turns and walks
away. out of frustration, he bangs the snout of the car,
causing it to bark.

                                                      cut to:
