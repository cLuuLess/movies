int. truck stop caf√â
the waitress drops the check on lloyd and harry's table and
stomps away. harry studies the bill and sighs.

                      harry
          perfect. i'm out eight bucks and i
          still haven't eaten.

                      lloyd
          well if you'd stop picking fights
          with the locals...
              (brightening)
          wait a second. i think i just had an
          idea. follow me...

lloyd stands and walks over to sea bass and his pals. a
nervous harry trails after him.

                                                           27.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          excuse me, gentlemen, i'd just like
          to apologize for that unpleasant
          scene a little earlier.

                      sea bass
          huh?

                      lloyd
          what i'm trying to say is, my friend
          and i would like to buy you guys a
          round of beers, just to bury the
          hatchet.

harry stares at lloyd like he's out of his mind, but the
truckers seem to like the idea.

                      sea bass
          make it four boiler-makers.

                      lloyd
          whatever you want, sir. i'll have
          the waitress send them over. oh, and
          fellas hope to see you again down
          the road.

lloyd and harry move away from the table toward the cashier.

                      harry
          lloyd, what are you doing? you know
          we can't afford to buy them drinks.

lloyd hands the cashier their check.

                      lloyd
          um, sea bass and the fellas offered
          to pick up our check. they said just
          add this to their tab.

                      cashier
              (skeptical)
          sea bass said that?

                      lloyd
          well, if that guy at the table over
          there is sea bass...

he points across the room to sea bass and company. sea bass
nods to the cashier and gestures to his table, not wanting
to miss out on his free drink. the cashier is convinced.

                      cashier
          okey-dokey, if that's what he wants...

                                                           28.

harry smiles at this. he grabs a couple beef jerky's, a candy
bar, and a copy of the national enquirer off the counter.

                      harry
          oh, and put these on there, too.

                        cashier
          you got it.

                      lloyd
              (to cashier)
          by the way, how far is it to rhode
          island from here?

                                                      cut to:
