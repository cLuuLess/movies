          refresh my memory on something, lloyd:
          what exactly do we do when we get to
          aspen?

                      lloyd
          well the first thing we do is take a
          good deep breath of that famous
          aspenese air.

                        harry
          fresh, huh?

                      lloyd
          the freshest. they say on any day of
          the week you can smell a moose-fart
          ten miles away.

                        harry
                (sincere)
          wow... talk about paradise.
                (beat)
          and after we're finished breathing,
          what next, lloyd?

                      lloyd
          then we make a splash on the social
          scene.

just then, lloyd notices something up the road.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          harry, look the golden arches. pull
          over, i'm starving.
                                                     cut to:
