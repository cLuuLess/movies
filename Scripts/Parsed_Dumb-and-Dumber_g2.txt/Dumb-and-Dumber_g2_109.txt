ext. chair lift - day

harry and mary are now sitting together on a chair as it
rises higher and higher toward the imposing mountain top.
harry holds onto the chair's frame nervously.

                      mary
          beautiful day, huh, harry?

                                                           95.

                       harry
          glorious.

mary takes a deep breath.

                      mary
          god, it feels so good to get up here.
          i haven't been outdoors much in the
          last couple of weeks.

                       harry
          why not?

                      mary
              (evasive)
          there's been... family problems. i
          on't want to bore you with them.

                       harry
          thanks.

he looks mindlessly off in the distance. then harry notices
a patch of frost on the chair lift bar.

                        harry (cont'd)
          oh, look... frost.

he licks it and his tongue immediately fuses with the frozen
metal. he tugs a few times, but it won't budge.

                      mary
          are you okay?

                      harry
              (lisping)
          sure. i do this all the time...
