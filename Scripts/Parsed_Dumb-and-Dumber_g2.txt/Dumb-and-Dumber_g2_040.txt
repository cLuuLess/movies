int. bathroom - second honeymoon motel

lloyd and harry are sitting in a large, heart-shaped jacuzzi.
lloyd is sipping a beer and harry is absorbed in the enquirer
as the water swirls around them.

                          lloyd
            yep, this sure is the life. cold
            beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink
            sheets... you know, there's only one
            thing that could make this moment
            any better.

                                                        35.

                         harry
          what's that?

                      lloyd
          if you had a nice set of knockers.

                      harry
          that's two things, lloyd.

                      lloyd
          right now i'd settle for one.

lloyd takes a swig of beer. harry puts down the paper and
looks around at the romantic decor.

                      harry
          i don't know, lloyd, these places
          just don't do it for me. brings back
          too many memories.

                      lloyd
          what happened, harry? some little
          filly break your heart?

                      harry
          nah, it was a girl. fraida felcher.
          we stayed at a place like this once
          no-tell motel out on route 31.

                      lloyd
          felcher? you mean the babe who worked
          for the tractor company?

harry nods.

                      harry
          the same. we had this incredibly
          romantic time. boy, i thought we'd
          be together forever.
              (sighs)
          then about a week later, right out
          of the blue, she sends me a john
          deere letter.

                      lloyd
          that's cold, har. give you any reason?

                      harry
          i called her up and she gave me some
          crap about me not listening to her
          enough or something like that. i
          wasn't really paying attention.

                                                          36.

harry reaches for a beer and busts it open. he takes a big
gulp.

                      harry (cont'd)
          thing that really hurts is i think
          she was seeing another guy. never id
          find out who.

on lloyd - he does his best to hide his guilt.

                                                       cut to:
