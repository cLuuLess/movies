ext. airport terminal - day
as lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport
window and sees mary

walking along.

when she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too.
she puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for
her ticket. lloyd's attention is distracted by a honk. he
turns to see a car irectly behind him.

                      lloyd
              (to car's driver)
          drive around me, you pinhead!

when he turns back to watch mary in the terminal he sees
that she's gone, and she's left her briefcase at the foot of
the stairs. lloyd jumps to attention.

                                                           8.

he pulls the car into a handicapped spot and hops out. he
starts to run into the terminal, then notices the police
officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and
dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.
