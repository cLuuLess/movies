ext. highway - day

harry is walking down the highway, his thumb stuck out
unenthusiastically. a few cars whiz by, the cold wind whipping
at his clothes.

a station wagon blows by and throws a bag  of garbage out the
window. it lands at harry's feet. extreme  close-up of harry's
face - a tear slowly rolls down his cheek  (like the indian
in the commercial). pan down to the bag of  garbage. we see
it's a bag of onions that's ripped open.

suddenly a hearse pulls up and stops. it's an ominous-looking
vehicle and harry hesitates. then the passenger window rolls
down, revealing a contrite lloyd at the wheel.

                      lloyd
          got room for one more, if you still
          want to go to aspen.

harry looks the hearse over.

                      harry
          where'd you find this baby?

                      lloyd
          used car dealer. i   traded the van
          for it. plus i got   the guy to throw
          in fifty bucks for   gas money.
              (beat)
          come on, man, what   do you say? we
          still partners?

harry smiles and we

                                                      cut to:
