152   ext. bridge - night                                              152

      fog obscures the east end. a sentry squints at the
      muffled clop of hooves. the mist parts to reveal, seventy
      yards away: three holnist scouts on horseback.
      emissaries from hell.

      as the sentry blows a whistle...


      bridge

      as word spreads, folks move down the bridge for a look.
      eating their bread, the postman, abby and the carriers
      join them.

                                                        (continued)

      east end

      the mayor stands across from the lead scout -- conferring.
      finally, the mayor points him back the way he came. the
      lead scout doesn't budge, spots the postman in the crowd.

      he and the postman seem to stare at each other forever.
      then, with a flick of the reins, he's gone. the other two
      follow. swallowed up by the misty evening gloom. the
      postman's head swims dizzily. it's not over.

      the mayor returns to dozens of nervous questions.

                                 b.c. mayor
                   they're looking for the postman.

                                 b.c. man
                   no such thing anymore.

                                 b.c. mayor
                   man on the horse says there is.
                   says he thinks he's here. says
                   he's coming back with friends.

      a little boy steps forward, sings out.

                                 b.c. boy
                   what's a postman?

      a silent moment. it's been so long, no one's sure how to
      answer. the postman looks down at the ground. the
      carriers exchange deflated looks. then...

                                 abby
                          (stepping forward)
                   you never heard of a postman?

      he shakes his head "no." seems a shame. as the postman
      looks over at abby, she takes a page from his book.

                                 abby
                   there used to be a postman for
                   every street in america. they
                   wore uniforms. and hats. like
                   this one...

      she goes to the postman's gear, returns with his postal
      cap. sets it on the boy's head.

                                 b.c. boy
                   wow...

                                                      (continued)

                                                                123.

                                 abby
                   my postman knew the name of every
                   kid on my street. he knew our
                   birthdays. he'd even find the
                   baseballs you'd hit down the
                   street. i can still see the smile
                   on his face. the tip of his cap
                   -- when he had a letter in his bag
                   with my name on it. mine always
                   came just after school. you could
                   set your watch by him. unless you
                   were waiting on something special
                   -- like a present from somewhere
                   far away or a letter from your
                   sweetheart. then it seemed like
                   he'd never come. i used to think
                   they could make time stand still.

      several other listeners nod -- they're completely with
      her.

                                 abby
                   i don't think we ever really
                   understood what they meant to us
                   until they were gone. getting a
                   letter made you feel like you were
                   part of something bigger than
                   yourself. no place was ever too
                   far away for the postman. so
                   nobody ever had to be alone. the
                   postman was someone you could
                   count on. things just made more
                   sense when they were around.
                          (beat)
                   that's the kind of world we used
                   to have. a world a lot of us took
                   for granted. and now we've got
                   this one. and it makes me
                   wonder -- what kind of world do i
                   want my child to live in? i want
                   my child to live in a world where
                   hopes and dreams aren't just lies
                   you tell yourself to get through
                   another day. i want my child, and
                   i want my friends -- i want all of
                   us to live in a world where you
                   still get your mail.

      it's a   moment before anyone speaks.

                                 b.c. mayor
                          (to the postman)
                   are you the postman?

                                                        (continued)

                                                               124.

152   continued:    (3)                                               152

      the postman takes the cap off the little boy's head,
      touches the emblem, and answers.

                                 the postman
                   yes.

                                 b.c. mayor
                   i've heard of you, man. you're
                   famous.

                                 the postman
                   yeah, i guess i am. and all of a
                   sudden, i'm not wearing the right
                   clothes.

      and as he puts on his cap, he accepts the mantle as well.
