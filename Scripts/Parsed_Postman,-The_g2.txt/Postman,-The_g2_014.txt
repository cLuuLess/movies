14   ext. training grounds - day                                  14

     the conscripts stand at attention under the guard of idaho
     and two other soldiers. to their right is a dead oak
     tree. behind them, three rows of folding chairs.

     two figures approach. bethlehem and getty. getty carries
     a sheathed sword. bethlehem surveys the troops -- taking
     no more notice of the postman than anyone else.

                             bethlehem
               the laws of eight, gentlemen.
               that is the legacy handed down to
               us by nathan holn.

     at the mention of this name, the recruits shout as one.

                             recruits
               god rest his soul!

                             the postman
                      (low)
               may he burn in hell.

     getty looks over at him. he heard him. the postman
     swallows hard. getty stares hard. then he turns away.
     he's not going to bust him on it.

                             bethlehem
               these are the laws that we live
               by. the eight is our symbol.
               each man will bear it with pride.

     bethlehem nods at idaho who pushes up his own sleeve to
     reveal the branded 8.

                             bethlehem
               only then will you be part of the
               clan. sit down, gentlemen.

     the men move to sit in one of the three rows. only then
     does it become apparent that there are 18 men and only 17
     chairs. one slow recruit is left standing. it doesn't
     take him long to realize that he's in trouble.

                             bethlehem
               law one. you will obey orders
               without question.
                      (to slow recruit)
               i told you to sit.

                             slow recruit
                      (scared)
               there weren't enough chairs.

                                                   (continued)

                                                                 24.

14   continued:                                                        14

                                bethlehem
                  i didn't specify chairs. you
                  could've sat down on the ground.

     the slow recruit moves to do so.

                                 bethlehem
                  you disobeyed a direct order.    you
                  broke law one.

     idaho and another soldier step up beside the slow recruit.

                                 bethlehem
                  law two.   punishment shall be
                  swift.

     they hustle the recruit to the tree. idaho unslings a
     coil of rope, throws it over a tree limb. they quickly
     slip a loop over the slow recruit's ankles and haul him
     upside down into the air.

                                bethlehem
                  law three: mercy is for the weak.
                  four: terror will defeat reason.
                  five: your allegiance is to the
                  clan. six: justice can be
                  dictated. law seven. any
                  clansman may challenge for
                  leadership of the clan. does any
                  man here wish to challenge me?

     there are no takers.

                                  bethlehem
                  on your feet!

     the conscripts stand like jackknives snapping open.

     without a word, without a look -- bethlehem reaches out
     and draws a sword from a sheath that getty holds.
     bethlehem steps to the slow recruit -- who slowly twists
     around.

                               bethlehem
                  law eight: there is only one
                  penalty: death.

     bethlehem raises the sword.

                                slow recruit
                  please, i'm begging you.

                                                         (continued)

                                                                 25.

14   continued:    (2)                                                 14

     the postman

     as the sword finds its mark.     bethlehem looks at him, but
     addresses all.

                                bethlehem
                  you will get out of this army what
                  you put into it. work and you'll
                  be fed. fight and you'll be
                  respected. die and you'll be
                  remembered. it's up to you.

     bethlehem turns and walks away.     getty following behind.
     the postman watches as they go.     idaho steps up to him.

                                idaho
                  you thinking of challenging for
                  leadership of the clan?

                                 the postman
                  no, sir.   i'm a follower not a
                  leader.

                                idaho
                  you see colonel getty? always
                  following the general? he's the
                  only man who ever challenged.
                  fight lasted six seconds, but the
                  general didn't kill him. he cut
                  off his tongue and he cut off his
                  balls and old getty's been
                  following him like a dog ever
                  since.

     the postman looks back to see bethlehem and getty
     disappear into the gloom. idaho grins, likes how this
     affects a new man.

     the postman moves on.     idaho stops woody as he passes.

                                idaho
                  the general don't see it, but i
                  say you got some nigger in you.

     woody clenches his jaw, but wisely doesn't answer.
