111   int. old george's trailer - night                               111

      old george sits hunched over a home-made shortwave radio
      with a joint in his mouth. the postman sits beside him,
      listening as static pours from an old car speaker.

                                 the postman
                   who do you talk to?

                                 old george
                   not a soul in seven years of
                   trying. but i will.

      the postman steps to a telescope pointing up through a
      hole in the trailer ceiling.

                                 old george
                   go ahead. take a look.
                          (offering joint)
                   want some?

                                 the postman
                   no. no thanks. hey, don't let
                   the kids see that.

      george nods and goes on playing with the dials --
      searching for a voice in the void.

      the postman focuses on the moon.

                                 old george
                   i was an aerospace engineer. i
                   helped design the galileo space
                   station.
                          (scanning sky)
                   i dream it's orbiting earth
                   forever. with a dozen human
                   skeletons all grinning at each
                   other. laughing at us down here.

      there's an urgent knocking on the trailer door.    ford
      appears.

                                 the postman
                   what is it?

                                                       (continued)

                                                            97.

                                  ford
                   it's red.   he's overdue.

                                 the postman
                   that makes five. all on southern
                   routes.
