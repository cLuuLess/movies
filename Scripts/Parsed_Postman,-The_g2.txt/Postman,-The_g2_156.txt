      the town's gone, but the palisade remains. chubby rides
      along it, exhorting the people who watch from above. but
      it's the postman we hear, all the magic back in his voice.

                                 the postman (v.o.)
                   once more into the breach, dear
                   friends, once more. or close the
                   wall with our dead. in peace
                   nothing so becomes a man as
                   modesty and humility. but when
                   the blast of war blows in our
                   ears, then imitate the action of
                   the tiger.
