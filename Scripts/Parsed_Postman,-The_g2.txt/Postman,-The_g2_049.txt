     bethlehem picks michael out of the crowd.

                                bethlehem
                  you.  you'll be responsible.
                         (to soldiers)
                  get him a torch.

     michael walks out into the square. one of the soldiers
     returns with a burning torch, gives it to michael.

     bethlehem looks at the town, then at michael.

                                bethlehem
                  set that flag on fire.

     on michael

     it's killing him, but michael sets the torch to the flag.
                              bethlehem
               now throw it through the window of
               your 'post office.'

     crash!    the torch goes through the post office window.


     on ford

     struggling to get out, but briscoe blocks his way.


     on bethlehem

     as flames grow, he takes one last look around.

                                bethlehem
                  the united states doesn't exist.
                  that flag is an abomination.

     briscoe steps forward, attempts to diffuse the situation.

                                briscoe
                  general bethlehem.
                         (as bethlehem turns)
                  we're gathering the tribute, sir.
                  can i take your wagons?

     bethlehem decides not to kill anyone, looks to getty.

                                bethlehem
                  make sure that fire doesn't go
                  out.

     the general joins briscoe.

     tears on his cheeks, ford watches the post office burn.
