13   ext. training camp - mess line - close on meat - day           13

     a cook dumps a scoop of gristly, gray meat into each mess
     pail as the conscripts wait in line. they fall to
     ravenously, too hungry to taste how bad it is. idaho
     supervises.

                                                      (continued)

                                                                22.

                                  idaho
                  eat up!    you got meat tonight.

     the line has almost passed. just the postman left and
     bandit #20 bringing up the rear. idaho looks at the
     postman, addresses the cook.

                                idaho
                  why don't you tell shakespeare
                  what kind of meat that is.

                                  cook
                  mule.

     probably bill -- and the postman knows it. he stares in
     revulsion at the putrid meat ladled into his pail.

                                idaho
                  a godawful animal. the sterile
                  offspring of a horse and a donkey.
                  can you imagine that?! there's no
                  room in this new world for a
                  bastard like that.

     bandit #20 holds out his pail.       but the cook won't fill
     it.

                                  idaho
                  uh uh.
                         (loudly; for all)
                  any man last in line ain't hungry
                  enough. you show up last, you
                  don't eat!

     bandit #20 steps away in disbelief. not knowing what else
     to do, he sits down beside the postman, the only man with
     food who isn't eating.

                                bandit #20
                  i'll die before i'm last in line
                  again.

                                the postman
                  that's what they're hoping for.

     he holds his pail out to bandit #20.

                                 bandit #20
                  serious?   this isn't bad.

     lost in despair, the postman stares out at the skewed
     palette.

                                the postman
                  these were supposed to be the best
                  years of my life.

                                                           23.
