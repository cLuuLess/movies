136   int. airstream - night                                           136

      the postman folds a letter, shoves it into an envelope.
      he writes "bethlehem" across the front, starts to write a
      second letter. the door opens and abby enters.

                              abby
                ford thinks you're going to do
                something.

                               the postman
                i am.

      the postman watches as, outside, the mail carriers begin
      to assemble.

                              the postman
                if i don't, those kids are going
                to keep on getting themselves
                killed.

                              abby
                ford doesn't know what it means to
                be a kid. he doesn't have your
                memories. none of them do. all
                they've got is the lousy world we
                gave them. and this is the only
                decent thing in it.

                               the postman
                what? being a postman? it's all
                bullshit, abby. all of it.
                       (beat)
                i took this uniform off a skeleton
                to stay warm. i made up the rest
                to stay fed. there is no restored
                united states.

                              abby
                i knew it was something like that.

      the postman fingers the brim of the cap, softens.

                                                     (continued)

                                                               109.

136   continued:                                                      136

                                 the postman
                   weird thing is, being a postman
                   was almost the best thing that
                   ever happened to me...
                          (re: red ribbon)
                   remember this? you left it behind
                   that night.

                                   abby
                   i remember...

                                 the postman
                   i always liked to think you left
                   it on purpose. but maybe you just
                   forgot it.

      abby doesn't answer.    she leaves instead.
