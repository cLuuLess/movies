93   ext. tent - day                                                 93

     as the postman exits, chubby leads the carriers in a
     salute. the postman actually turns a moment to see if
     someone else is standing behind him.

     he looks back, sees the young, shining faces.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                  87.

93   continued:                                                         93

                                the postman
                  aw, don't do that. hands down.

     their hands go down in one crisp military move. the
     postman looks at abby, to ford as he exits the tent.         the
     kid is craving reassurance.

                                ford
                  you'll stay 'til president starkey
                  sends word, right? right?

                                the postman
                  yeah, till he sends word, right.

     ford smiles, gestures to the carriers.

                                ford
                  could you say a few words?

     the postman looks over at the carriers.    they quiet under
     his gaze, immediately respectful.

     the problem is, he has no idea what to say.       finally:

                                the postman
                  two plus two equals four.

     the cheering is tumultuous. the postman picks abby out of
     the cheering crowd -- the look on her face says it all.
