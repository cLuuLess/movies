167   ext. st. rose - day                                                167

      a beach town. no wall, no sentries, just cottages lining
      a dozen sand-swept streets. a crowd has gathered to hear
      the postman's daughter, hope, mid-thirties, speak. beside
      her, a bearded, 52-year-old ford in his postmaster's
      uniform. they stand before a large, tarp-draped statue.

                                 hope
                   but he never did see st. rose.
                   there was too much to be done.
                   he'd made a promise and in keeping
                   it -- he traded one dream for
                   another. with no regrets. and
                   so, in honor of my father...

      she unveils the statue: we've seen this before. it's the
      postman on his horse, low-slung in the saddle, leaning
      down to pluck the letter from the little boy's hand.

      there's an older man in the audience who seems especially
      moved by the statue. there's a younger man beside him.

                                    older man
                   that was me.

      as st. rose applauds...
