37   ext. pine view - night                                         37

     the postman moves through town. the streets are deserted.
     he's got his pack on, his mailbag. he passes a 7-11
     converted to a blacksmith shop. there's a horse tethered
     to the railing in front of it. he grins; maybe he's going
     to make it out of here after all. as he starts to move
     toward the horse...

                                old man (o.s.)
                  it's right around the corner.

     an old man sits on his porch across the street.

                                the postman
                         (freezes, startled)
                  what is?

                                old man
                  what you're looking for.

     the old man winks knowingly, then heads inside. as the
     postman turns the corner, he finds himself in front of the
     post office. an old brick building. chiseled in the
     granite facing: "united states post office. est. 1884."
