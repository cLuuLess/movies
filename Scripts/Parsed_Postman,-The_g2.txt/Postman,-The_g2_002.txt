2   ext. highway on-ramp (utah) - day                            2

    a bullet-ridden sign reads: "u.s. 84 north." the postman
    leads bill down a barren 4-lane. weeds poke up through
    the asphalt. the rusting hulk of a car rests in the
    median, covered in a tangle of purple wisteria. the
    postman plucks a flower. he sticks it into a buttonhole
    and continues.

    bill brays woefully.    in answer:

                               the postman
                 i don't know. and if you ask me
                 again, i'm going to slug you.

    they near a sign: "thank you for visiting utah." the
    postman waves, shouts to the sign as he passes it.

                               the postman
                 it's been fun, hasn't it, kids?
                        (to the sign)
                 you're welcome!
