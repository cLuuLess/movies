126   ext. rise above pine view - day                                  126

      the postman wheels his horse around. but ford, ponytail,
      chubby and luke are standing in his way.

                                 ford
                   what are you going to do?

                                 the postman
                   i'm going to stop this.

                                 ford
                   you can't.

                                                        (continued)

                                                                 105.

                                 the postman
                   get out of my way, ford. all of
                   you.

                                 ford
                          (shaking his head)
                   they'll kill you.

      the postman starts to ride through them.      luke, chubby and
      ponytail move their horses to block.

      ford maneuvers his horse in close and grabs the postman's
      harness.

                                  the postman
                   goddamnit --

      the postman jumps off his horse. ford tackles him. the
      postman shoves him away, continues on. luke and chubby
      pounce on him. with ford's help, they hold him down.

                                 ford
                   you can't help them!

                                 the postman
                   there's still time, ford!

      the postman struggles.      they're genuinely having trouble
      holding him down.

                                 ponytail
                          (re: the postman)
                   you're hurting him.

      but there's no let-up.

                                 ford
                   no, this is all my doing.    i went
                   against your orders.

      there's a moment of shocked surprise.

                                 ford
                   the holnists we killed. you told
                   me to bury them. but i didn't. i
                   sent bethlehem the bodies.

                                  the postman
                   why?

                                 ford
                   because bethlehem has to know that
                   we're not going to stop.

                                                         (continued)

                                                                106.

                                 the postman
                   god damn you, ford. those people
                   down there are dying because of
                   us. because of what we did.

                                 ford
                   bullshit. they're dying because
                   of bethlehem. they're dying
                   because this is a shitty world.
                   and if we're ever going to change
                   it, then somebody might have to
                   die. if i could make it be me
                   down there i would. but i can't.

      a terrible scream gives them all pause.
