96   ext. rv camp - green lawn - day                              96

     the seven young recruits seen earlier stand in a line.
     they're joined by old george, every day of 75 years old.

     ponytail holds up her hand, swears them in.

                             ponytail/recruits
               neither snow, nor rain, nor heat,
               nor gloom of night...

     as they finish, the postman and ford pass by. the
     recruits salute. shaking his head, the postman's about to
     salute back when he spots old george. george has a faded
     purple "airborne" tattoo on his arm and a twinkle in his
     eye. there's an old crow on his shoulder.

                             the postman
               how old are you?

                             old george
               seventy-five, sir.

     the postman looks over at ford, who shrugs.

                               the postman
               can you ride?

                            old george
               nope. can't walk too good,
               either.

                             the postman
               why are you here?

                               old george
               i know stuff.

     the postman looks at ford again.   then:

                                                   (continued)

                                                               89.

96   continued:                                                      96

                                the postman
                         (re: tattoo)
                  when did you get that?

                                 old george
                  1970. a girl with eyes as big as
                  saucers did me in a little town
                  called saigon.
