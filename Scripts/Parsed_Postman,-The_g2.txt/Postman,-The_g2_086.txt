86   int. hunting shack - night                                    86

     the postman lies in bed, stares through the hole in the
     roof. a full moon is on the rise. abby lies in her own
     makeshift bed, also awake. after a long silence:

                             the postman
               we walked on the moon once, abby.

                               abby
               so?    what good is that now?

                             the postman
               obviously you've forgotten tang
               and microwave ovens.
                      (a beat)
               your face looks pretty.

     abby looks up.

                             the postman
               not so bruised.

                             abby
               look, there's something you'd
               better know. you're going to find
               out soon enough. i'm pregnant.
                      (a long beat)
               it's michael's baby. you're just
               the body father.

                             the postman
               how do you know it's mine and not
               bethlehem's?

                             abby
               he tried with me almost every
               night. he couldn't do it. so he
               beat me. said it was my fault.

                                                   dissolve to:
