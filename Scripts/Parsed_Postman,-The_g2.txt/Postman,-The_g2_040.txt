40   ext. foster's freeze - night                                     40

     camera starts on a man with a string-tied package crossing
     the streets and drifts to the abandoned car where ford
     lives. he's home.


     on ford

     concentrating, ford holds a needle and thread and a piece
     of cloth on which he's drawn an approximation of the post
     office shoulder patch. by moonlight he embroiders it in.
     not exactly work you'd pay money for, but not bad either.
