      bethlehem, flanked by getty and the holnist sergeant,
      watches as the postman makes his approach. he reaches
      into his pocket, withdraws a white kerchief and holds it
      in the air.

                              sergeant
                are they surrendering?

                              bethlehem
                god, i hope not.

      he watches for a moment as the postman crosses the field -
      - moving well within range of holnist fire. then, he
      coaxes his horse forward.
