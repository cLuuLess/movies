97   ext. rv camp - airstream - sunset                               97

     carriers move items out of the trailer. the camp is
     buzzing as usual. the postman looks on -- sees abby
     passing by.

                                the postman
                  abby --

                                abby
                  yes?

     he's got her attention, just doesn't know what to do with
     it.

                                the postman
                  ford wants me to have his trailer.
                  said it's the best one.

                                abby
                  i'm on the other side of town.

                                the postman
                  i got plenty of room here.

     she shakes her head, and then walks away. the postman
     watches her disappear into the bustle of the camp.

                                the postman
                  so much for the uniform theory.
