     carrying their gear, abby and the postman walk across a
     meadow of wild flowers, headed for an old road.

                                the postman
                  have you ever heard of st. rose,
                  abby?

                                abby
                  i've heard people talk. i've
                  heard lots of names. bliss.

                                                             82.

                               the postman
                  he's wrong. st. rose is out
                  there. and i'm going to find it.

                                abby
                  but you're the postman.

                                the postman
                  look, i'm nobody, abby. i'm
                  just...

     before he can come clean -- they see a distant rider
     coming hard. the postman unslings the rifle, slides a
     round into the chamber.

                                the postman
                  this is what i hate. strangers.
                  do you say 'hi' or do you blow
                  their head off? do they want to
                  share what they got or take what
                  you have? and if they want to
                  take, how far are you willing to
                  go to stop them? damn it.
                         (to the rider)
                  all right. that's far enough.

     the rider pulls up short, wearing a blue home-made
     uniform.

                                the postman
                  we don't want any trouble.

                                rider
                  me neither, mister.

     the postman is taken aback. the rider, a girl, pulls off
     her cap, mops it across her brow. maybe 14, we'll always
     know her by her ponytail. abby registers the uniform
     first.

                                  abby
                  what are you?

                                ponytail (rider)
                  carrier 18. u.s. postal service.
                  got any mail?

     lowering the rifle, the postman looks over at abby, back
     to ponytail.

                                the postman
                  that's impossible.

                                                     (continued)

                                                              83.

                                ponytail
                  ain't you heard of the postman?

                                  abby
                  no, tell us.

                                ponytail
                  he's only the greatest man who
                  ever lived. he crossed the
                  wasteland, shook his fist at the
                  enemy and spit in the eye of
                  general bethlehem himself. he's
                  back east with president starkey
                  right now.

                                the postman
                  who told you all this?

                                ponytail
                  postmaster ford lincoln mercury.
                  he's in direct contact with the
                  restored congress.

                                the postman
                  direct contact... i don't believe
                  this.

                                ponytail
                         (growing irritated)
                  do you have mail, or don't you?

                                the postman
                  you said carrier eighteen. that
                  mean there's eighteen of you?

                                  ponytail
                  thirty-two.    as of midnight.
