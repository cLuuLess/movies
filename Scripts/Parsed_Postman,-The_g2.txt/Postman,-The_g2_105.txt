105   ext. farmhouse/country road - day                             105

      seen from the porch, a rider gallops hard on the road
      beyond.

      a little boy comes rushing out, letter in hand. the boy
      pulls up short; realizes the rider is already too far
      gone. the boy's shoulders sag; he's crushed.

                                little boy
                i missed him.

      it's an almost psychic moment as the rider reins up in the
      distance and turns back around. a frozen beat and he
      starts galloping back down the road.

      fearless, the boy holds out the letter. the rider closes;
      it's the postman. the boy stretches out as far as he can.
      without breaking stride, the postman leans out of the
      saddle, snatches the letter as he passes.

      the boy watches after him -- knows what he's going to be
      when he grows up.
