125   ext. rise above pine view - day                                  125

      the postman poised on a rise that affords a view of the
      gruesome spectacle below.


      postman's pov

      pine view in flames. the big john deere gun has blown
      several gaps into the palisade. bethlehem watches as his
      army sacks the town. the people have been rounded up.
      the selection of the ten has begun.
