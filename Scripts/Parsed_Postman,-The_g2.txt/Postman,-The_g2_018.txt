18   ext. camp - day                                                  18

     the conscripts break camp. hot work. glistening with
     sweat, the postman stops to stretch. across the way, he
     sees bandit #20 talking to getty. getty glances at the
     postman who returns to work, watches under his eyebrows as
     idaho joins the group. there's trouble brewing here.

     worried, the postman looks to woody, who watches the
     exchange as well. he is, as usual, inscrutable.
