17   ext. camp - day                                                17

     the postman rejoins the conscripts. bandit #20 slides
     over.

                                                      (continued)

                                                            28.

17   continued:                                                   17

                                   bandit #20
                  what happened?

     troubled, the postman doesn't answer. he heads for a
     corner where woody stands alone. relentless, bandit #20
     follows.

                                bandit #20
                  what did he say?

                                   the postman
                  nothing.

                                bandit #20
                  did he say anything about me?

                                   the postman
                  no.

     they reach the quiet corner; it's just the three of them.

                                the postman
                  we got to get out of here.

                                bandit #20
                  what are you talking about?

                                the postman
                  escaping.
                         (low)
                  you ever hear of st. rose? it's
                  on the coast. they say it's a
                  paradise. they've even got
                  electric lights.

     bandit #20 looks scared, woody unreadable.

                                   bandit #20
                  we can't.

                                the postman
                  between the three of us, we
                  could --

                                bandit #20
                  no, no. i can't. i like it here.
                  i like being a part of something.

     the postman can't believe what bandit #20 just said.
     bandit #20 turns, hurries away.

     the postman looks to woody who doesn't tip his hand either
     way. he moves away as well.

                                                                29.
