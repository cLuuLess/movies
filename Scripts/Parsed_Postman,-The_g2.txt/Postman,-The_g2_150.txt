150   ext. columbia river gorge (bridge city) - day                  150

      a town settled between spans of a steel truss bridge. the
      columbia river rushes far below. a sentry spots abby and
      the postman approaching, blows a whistle.

                              guard
                set the rifle on the ground.

                              the postman
                this old thing? it isn't even
                loaded. where are we?

      the bridge city mayor, a middle-aged retro-hippie, steps
      up.

                              b.c. mayor
                you're in bridge city. where we
                don't allow guns.

      the postman sets down the carbine.    the guard steps over
      to scoop it up.

                              b.c. mayor
                sentry said you were coming.

      the postman stares at the mayor a beat.

                                 the postman
                i know you.     you're famous.

                              b.c. mayor
                i was once. not anymore.
                       (beat)
                are you looking to cross?

                              the postman
                we will be. right now, we'd just
                appreciate some food.
                       (as the mayor
                        nods his assent)
                i got some kids behind me, too.

                                                      (continued)

                                                                120.

                                   b.c. mayor
                   how many?

                                   the postman
                   three.
                          (as the mayor
                           agrees once more)
                   hey, guys, come on in! i know
                   you're out there!

                                 chubby sentry
                   boy, is he smart...

      as they stand, show themselves.
