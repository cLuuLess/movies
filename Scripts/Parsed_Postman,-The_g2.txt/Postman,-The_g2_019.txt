19   ext. clearing - river - day                                      19

     the river is swollen and swift from the spring thaw.
     marching along the east ridge above it, the army is given
     the order to halt.

     the postman looks ahead to where idaho confers with
     bethlehem. something's wrong. they look to where:

     two carbine-toting soldiers stand alertly at guard by a
     thicket across the river. a rotten wood and rope bridge
     spans the space between the ridges.

     idaho rides to the conscripts:

                             idaho
               one of you dogs has earned himself
               a treat. over there.

     idaho points to the thicket as he proceeds down the line.

                             idaho
               those men hunted themselves a lion
               this morning. must've been a zoo
               around here before the war.
               anyhow, they shot him and he
               crawled into that thicket. a
               third man went in after him. we
               don't know if he's dead or alive.
               i need a volunteer. someone's
               gotta go in and get our boy out.

     no volunteers, except the zealot bandit #20.

                               bandit #20
               i'll go.

     idaho ignores him, stops in front of woody.

                             idaho
               i guess size ain't a measure of
               courage, is it? shakespeare!

     the fix is in.    the postman steps out of line.

                                                        (continued)

                                                              30.

     idaho's about to hand the postman a carbine when --

                                bethlehem (o.s.)
                  i don't think so, captain.

     bethlehem nods to getty. getty takes a hunting knife from
     a belt-sheath and tosses it, blade first, into the ground
     between the postman's feet.

                                bethlehem
                  come out alive and you got
                  yourself a lion steak.

     hefting the knife, the postman stares at the west ridge.

                                 idaho
                         (winks)
                  maybe you'll find your st. rose up
                  there.

     the postman looks to bandit #20 who stares back defiantly.

                                idaho
                  what are you waiting for,
                  christmas?

     bandit #20 can't contain his giggling, so idaho backhands
     the sound out of him -- then looks back to the postman.

     grim the postman starts forward, looks from the rotten
     bridge to the water and back again as he moves.

     all eyes on him as he starts across...
