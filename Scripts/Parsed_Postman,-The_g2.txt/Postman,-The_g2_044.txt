44   ext. palisade gates (pine view) - day                        44

     people line the top as the postman and briscoe ride out.
     the strains of "america" still in the background.

                             briscoe
               you got a helluva nerve, whoever
               you are.

     the postman doesn't rise to the bait.

                             the postman
               is abby around?

                             briscoe
               she and michael are working the
               north meadow this morning.

     briscoe reins up -- he's gone as far as his duty commands.

                             briscoe
               well, you're on your own.

     the postman tips his cap and continues riding by "pine
     view - population 132." briscoe watches a moment, then
     calls after him:

                            briscoe
               hey! are you really who you say
               you are?

                             the postman
               if i come back with some mail,
               you'll know!

     the postman continues. caught in an inner turmoil,
     briscoe reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a letter.
     he turns it over in his hands, looks off at the postman.

                              briscoe
               god damn it!

     briscoe urges his horse forward, catches up. he hands the
     postman the letter, then rides back for town. the postman
     watches briscoe. the people lining the wall. and he
     realizes just what effect he's had. there's nothing to
     do, but shrug his shoulders and ride. strains of
     "america" still echo hauntingly over:
