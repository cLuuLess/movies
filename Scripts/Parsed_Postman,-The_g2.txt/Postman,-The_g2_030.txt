30   ext. inside gates - day                                          30

     the crowd parts as everyone turns to look back at irene
     march. mrs. march, in her late 50s, is blind, her eyes
     clouded by cataracts. in disbelief...

                                mrs. march
                  did he say my name?

     the sense of hope is palpable as the gates are swung back.
     two townies hurry mrs. march out to meet the postman.
     they're followed by a throng. as he sees she's blind...

                                 the postman
                  oh, no...

     too late now. they stop mrs. march in front of him.        she
     stares off just to his left, a little afraid.

                                mrs. march
                  i'm irene march.

                                the postman
                         (uncomfortable)
                  i have a letter for you.

     he presses it into her hands, but she won't take it.

                                mrs. march
                  would you read it?

                                the postman
                  i'm sure it's personal.

                                 mrs. march
                  please.   someone has to.

                                                        (continued)

                                                                 40.

30   continued:                                                         30

     the postman has little choice.     as he opens the
     envelope...

                                the postman
                  we're delivering the old stock
                  piles, but i'll accept all new
                  correspondence as well.

                                townie
                  just read it, will ya?

     excited, the people move closer.      someone holds up a torch
     and the postman starts.

                                the postman
                  'dear irene. sorry i haven't
                  written. everything's so crazy.
                  the strange weather. the food
                  shortages. that farmer nathan
                  holn causing all that trouble.
                  it's hard to understand. david's
                  home from the army. the war was
                  over before he even got there.
                  thank god for that. he's still my
                  baby no matter how big he gets.
                  we're going to miss you for
                  christmas, but maybe next year.
                  all our love. donna.'

     mrs. march reaches out a trembling hand to take the
     letter.

                                mrs. march
                  my sister in denver. fifteen
                  years ago. thank you.

     the populace erupts with excitement.        mrs. march takes the
     postman's hand, clasps it tightly.

                                mrs. march
                  you're a godsend. a savior.

     the postman pulls his hand back, rejects the title.

                                 the postman
                  no.   i'm just... a postman.

     an almost awesome silence.     too much for the postman.

                                the postman
                  i've been on the road a while. i
                  could use a little something to
                  eat --

                                                         (continued)

                                                             41.

30   continued:    (2)                                             30

                                 mrs. march
                  oh, yes, absolutely... is there
                  anything else?

     the townspeople welcome him with cheers. the postman
     raises a silencing hand. as they quiet...

                                the postman
                  yes, there is! if there are dogs
                  in this town, you have to leash
                  them while i'm here!

     only the postman laughs. no one else reacts. briscoe
     watches dubiously from the wall as the people surround the
     postman and sweep him through the gates and into town.

     one couple watches the postman closely as he makes his way
     into town. she is abby -- a sweet-faced, pretty woman.
     her husband, michael, is a decent-looking sort, tall and
     strong.
