8   int. 76 ball - dawn                                             8

    full of the postman's earthly possessions. trick is, how
    to save them and his life at the same time. he spies an
    old wrench: remnant of an attempt to remove the rusty
    bolts holding the ball in place. an idea begins to take
    shape.

                               lead bandit (o.s.)
                 just you start tossing those
                 cigarettes down!


    bandits

    there's no answer.     the bandits eye each other nervously.

                               bandit #20
                 maybe he fell asleep.

    76 ball

    the postman grabs the wrench, starts working one of the
    last two rusted bolts. as it starts to give...

                               the postman
                 it's going to take a second.    i
                 got my stuff bolted in.


    bandits

    the lead bandit takes a cautious step back.

                               lead bandit
                 put some buckshot through it,
                 martin. just to hurry him up.

                               hulking bandit
                 i only got three shells left.

                               lead bandit
                 so use his gun.

    the hulking bandit picks up the carbine and aims. click.
    it isn't loaded. the hulking bandit tosses the gun aside,
    pulls a knife from his boot. grimly, he begins to climb.


    76 ball

    cramped, the postman's busy at the base of the ball,
    trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt. it won't
    budge.


    ladder

    the hulking bandit has only a few more rungs to go.


    76 ball

    no good.   time's up.   the postman starts rocking the pole.


    ladder

    the hulking bandit has reached the opening -- feels the
    rocking motion. hangs on.

                                                     (continued)

                                                          10.

    76 ball

    knife in hand, the hulking bandit looks inside. at that
    instant, the postman rocks the pole one more time. the
    rusty bolt is not enough to keep the ball's full weight in
    place. it pops. the ball is frozen for an instant before
    going with the pole's tilt.


    ladder

    the 76 ball drops off the pole, rolling over the hulking
    bandit's back and down the ladder's incline. the other
    bandits dive clear as the 76 ball hurtles past.


    the postman

    whips head over heels as the ball speeds away.


    field

    the 76 ball launches off a dirt berm, but soon comes to a
    stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts
    apart. fighting the vertigo, the postman staggers to his
    feet.

                               the postman
                 bill!

    bill bolts from the station as the lead bandit raises the
    rifle and fires at the postman.

    losing balance, the postman lands on his butt just before
    a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head.
    wobbly, he tries to gather his packs. the bandits charge,
    quickly closing the ground, but bill is there first.

    holding as much as he can, the postman heaves himself over
    bill's back. as the mule gallops away, the lead bandit
    aims the rifle. he's got the postman in his sights.

    he's about to fire when -- bandit #20 stands up into the
    shot. he's got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and
    he's laughing like a hyena!

                               bandit #20
                 we're rich!

                                                            11.
