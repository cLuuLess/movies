53   int. movie theater (benning, oregon) - day                    53

     mail call. the postman stands in front of the torn
     screen. hoping for glory by association, the smiling
     mayor stands beside him. the ragged people of benning
     clamor in front. kids smile up at him as he calls out
     names:

                              the postman
               rachel clark!
                      (as she's there)
               charlie sykes!
                      (as he's there)
               graham druitt!

                             voice
               g.d. died last winter of flu.

     the postman nods, sticks the letter back in his bag.

                             the postman
               that's it for now, folks.
               there'll be more once a real
               system is in place.

                                                     (continued)

                                                               65.

53   continued:                                                      53

     as usual, the postman is assaulted with questions.

                                man
                  tell us about president starkey!

                                woman
                  what about new york city?   did
                  they survive the plague?

                                the postman
                  survive? they got broadway up and
                  running again. there's a kid
                  doing andrew lloyd webber like you
                  wouldn't believe.

     an older woman sheds a happy tear -- this is wonderful
     news.

                                man #3
                  how much is it to mail a letter?

                                the postman
                         (smiles)
                  a buck seventy-five.

                                man #3
                  that sounds awful cheap.

                                the postman
                  the catch is the only currency
                  recognized are silver american
                  coins minted before 1964 and two
                  dollar bills. look for thomas
                  jefferson. of course, food is
                  always acceptable as barter.

     the moment is split by a siren.
