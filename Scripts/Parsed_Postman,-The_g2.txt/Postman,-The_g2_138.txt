      the postman is packing bags onto a horse as abby
      approaches.

                                 the postman
                   i'm going to st. rose, abby. and
                   i'm taking you with me. i know
                   you don't want to hear it, but
                   that's my child inside you. i
                   want to see it born somewhere
                   safe. i have a right to that,
                   abby. whether you like it or not.

      abby walks away. the postman rests his head on his pack
      for a moment. heavy.

                                                        (continued)

                                                                112.

      the click of a gun causes the postman to lift his head and
      see luke standing there.

                                 the postman
                   thought i recognized you.

                                 luke
                   general bethlehem said...
                          (raises the pistol)
                   ... you should be on your knees
                   when i do it.

                                 the postman
                   i don't give a damn what that
                   asshole said.

                                 luke
                   the general is a great man.

                                 the postman
                   the general is a fucking lunatic.

      the postman steps forward. stops when the barrel of the
      pistol is right against his own chest.

                                 the postman
                   you don't own a thought in that
                   goddamn head of yours, do you?
                          (a beat)
                   you want to see a man?

      the postman turns to watch as ford starts out of camp.

                                   the postman
                   that's a man.

      the postman turns, sees luke's face fraught with confusion
      and emotion.

                                 the postman
                   you don't understand, do you? you
                   never will until you can think for
                   yourself and be willing to pay the
                   price for it.

      luke stares back into the postman's eyes.      a frozen beat.

                                   the postman
                   you ready?

                                   abby (o.s.)
                   yes.

                                                        (continued)

                                                               113.

      abby sits on her horse. she's witness to it all. luke is
      confused and ashamed. the postman mounts his horse and
      moves to abby's side.

                                 the postman
                   you're a better man than
                   bethlehem, luke. i've seen it.
