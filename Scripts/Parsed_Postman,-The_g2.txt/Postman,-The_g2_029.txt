29   ext. gates (pine view, oregon) - dusk                           29

     the town is protected by a tall, long palisade.     like ft.
     apache. all is dark as the postman approaches.

                                the postman
                  greetings, pine view, oregon!

     two sentries appears from the gate house.    they aim
     arrows.

                                sentry #1
                  just head back the way you came.
                  pine view ain't buying, ain't
                  listening and don't give charity.

     a moment of truth is here.    finally, with authority:

                                the postman

                  about?

                  authority to open this gate!

     more silhouettes appear on the palisade.     one is sheriff
     briscoe, a big, no-nonsense man.

                                briscoe

                                                               38.

     there's a silent hush.

                                briscoe
                         (to someone on wall)
                  hand me your gun.

                                the postman
                  understand that tampering with or
                  obstructing the mail is a federal
                  offense. furthermore, the bolin
                  act requires you to provide all
                  mail carriers with sanctuary and
                  nourishment.

                  ass outta here.

                                the postman
                  is jerry the contractor here?

     briscoe pumps his shotgun, aims it at the postman.

                                 the postman
                  wait! i'm going to get something
                  out of my bag.

     the postman dumps the pack over, frantically shuffles
     through the letters.

                                 briscoe
                  one!

                                                                39.
