155   ext. high tension tower - postman and abby                         155

      the mayor is in the b.g. helping one of the sentries
      prepare the basket for travel.

                                 abby
                   this is hard for me.
                          (beat)
                   michael was the best man i ever
                   knew. i never thought there'd be
                   another man i could love the way i
                   loved him.
                          (searching for
                           the words)
                   i don't know why i've been so
                   blessed. and i've tried to find a
                   way to be thankful, but i swear,
                   if i lose you...

      her eyes start to tear and he takes her in his arms.

                                 the postman
                   abby, do you think a lie can
                   become the truth?

                                 abby
                   i don't know, but i believe in
                   you. you have a gift, postman.     i
                   saw it back in pine view.
                                 (more)

                                                          (continued)

                                                                126.

                                 abby (cont'd)
                   you made mrs. march feel like she
                   could see again. you made ford
                   feel like he was part of the
                   world. you give out hope like it
                   was candy in your pocket.

      he starts to speak.    she stops him, taking his hand.

                                 abby
                   when you come back, we'll be
                   waiting here for you. so you can
                   take us to st. rose.

      the postman lets go of her hand and starts for the basket.

      the mayor gestures to the line of towers extending into
      the distance.

                                 b.c. mayor
                   there's three good-sized towns up
                   that way. enough folks to be a
                   big help to you. if you can
                   convince them to come.

      as the postman steps into the basket, he makes the mistake
      of looking over the edge. it's a long, long way down.

                                 b.c. mayor
                   a lot higher than it looks, huh?

      the postman looks at the contraption with more than a
      little trepidation. the mayor grins.

                                  b.c. mayor
                   don't tell anybody, but i like to
                   ride the damn thing just for the
                   hell of it. being a city official
                   has its perks.

      he winks and as he reaches for the release pin.     the
      postman's hand meets his there.

                                 b.c. mayor
                   trust me, man. this'll get you
                   there a lot faster.

                                 the postman
                   how do i stop --

      but it's too late.    the mayor releases the pin.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                127.

155   continued:    (2)                                                155

                                 b.c. mayor
                   don't worry about it. good luck
                   and godspeed.


      counterweight

      plummeting into the columbia river gorge.      the mayor lets
      out a rebel yell.


      basket

      the postman is whipped along, past the riders below.     the
      speed exhilarating.
