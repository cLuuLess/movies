123   ext. elvis, oregon - close on bloodied postal carrier -         123
      night

      a crowd of townsfolk are visible in deep b.g.   beyond
      them, the town of elvis burns to the ground.

      the camera circles around the bloodied carrier until we're
      looking over his shoulder at a firing squad led by colonel
      getty and lieutenant gibbs. bethlehem watches.

                              gibbs
                ready!

      the only building not on fire is the post office. a
      soldier rides up, carrying a torch, meaning to burn it.

                              soldier
                the post office, general?

                              bethlehem
                no. let it stand. all by itself.
                so it can remind them what it cost
                them.

                              gibbs
                aim!

      rifles are aimed.

                              gibbs
                fire!

      shock and dismay from the townsfolk as shots ring out.


      close on bloody carrier's face

      as he realizes he's still standing.

      pull back to reveal nine bodies lying on the ground.     only
      the bloodied carrier is still standing.

      bethlehem points at the bloodied carrier, crooks a finger
      for him. he staggers up. bethlehem smiles.

                              bethlehem
                you think you can ride?
                       (as the carrier
                        nods)
                then today's your lucky day.
