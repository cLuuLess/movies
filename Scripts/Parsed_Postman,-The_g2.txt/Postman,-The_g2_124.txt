      abby tends to the bloodied carrier.   he tries to salute as
      the postman enters the trailer.

      ford and chubby watch and wait as the postman goes to the
      boy's side.

      the postman motions it's okay as the carrier struggles.

                   town. then burn it to the ground.

                   but not for long.
