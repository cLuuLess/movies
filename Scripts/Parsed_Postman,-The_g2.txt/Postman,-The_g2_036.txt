36   int. foster's freeze - later                                   36

     a band plays an odd array of instruments. there's
     dancing. the postman sits behind four empty bowls.
     people watch him eat like it was a religious experience.
     he pushes back the fifth bowl.

                                the postman
                  never thought i'd hear myself say
                  this, but i can't eat anymore.

     he's cut off by the sight of a silent, little boy.    the
     kid's looking up, staring intently at something.

                                  the postman
                  what?

     the boy just stares.

                                  the postman
                          (re:   the cap)
                  this?

     the boy nods. the postman shakes his head and smiles to
     himself. he takes off the cap, sets it on the kid's head.

                                  the postman
                  almost fits.

     the boy's eyes go wide with wonder. his stock's gone up
     1000%. before he can rush off to impress his friends,
     ellen -- his mother -- steps over and gently chides him.

                                ellen
                  that's not a toy, honey. that's
                  very important. give it back.

                                                      (continued)

                                                                   46.

36   continued:                                                          36

     the boy carefully removes the cap, hands it back to the
     postman. ellen smiles gratefully and gently guides her
     son away.

     the postman shrugs, turns to find abby, the pretty woman
     we saw at the pine view gates. she smiles at the postman.

                                abby
                  would you like to dance?

                                 the postman
                  i don't know if i can, i think i'm
                  still on duty.

     he laughs.    abby says nothing.

                                the postman
                  it's been a long time.

     abby holds out her hand like a promise.

                                abby
                  all you got to do is hold on.


     dance floor

     abby and the postman dance.          she keeps looking him over.

                                the postman
                  is something wrong?

                                abby
                  how tall are you?

                                the postman
                  about six feet.

                                   abby
                  are you smart?

                                the postman
                  smarter than some i guess.       why?

                                 abby
                  just wondering. did you ever have
                  the bad mumps?

     the postman smiles.    she's odd, but beautiful.

                                the postman
                  never had the bad mumps.

                                                           (continued)

                                                                47.

36   continued:    (2)                                                36

                                abby
                  have you ever had herpes or
                  syphilis or anything like that?

     he shakes his head "no."    they continue to dance.

                                abby
                  so as far as you know, you have
                  good semen?

                                the postman
                  is that a trick question?

                                abby
                  i don't mean to be nosy. i'm only
                  asking because i want you to make
                  me pregnant.

     stunned, the postman stops dancing.      abby takes this
     moment to grab michael.

                                the postman
                         (to himself)
                  it's got to be the uniform.

     abby takes michael's arm, introduces him proudly.

                                abby
                  this is my husband.    michael.

     michael smiles, shakes hands with a grave-digger's grip.
     the postman doesn't know what to think.

                                abby
                  we've been trying to have a baby
                  for three years. we can't on
                  account of michael had the bad
                  mumps when he was twelve. so we
                  need a body father. we could ask
                  a man here, but it could cause
                  trouble. i've seen it happen.
                  things go okay until the woman
                  starts to show. then it can be
                  bad. but you'll only be around
                  once in awhile with the mail.

     the postman just stares at them.      abby looks to michael.

                                abby
                  he hasn't said 'no'.

                                                       (continued)

                                                              48.

36   continued:    (3)                                              36

                                michael
                         (undaunted)
                  what do you say, mister?     you'd be
                  doing us a favor.

                                the postman
                  i'll have to think about it.

     the postman excuses himself with a nod and turns away,
     shaking his head at the strangeness of this new world.

     but no rest for the wicked, as soon as he's free from abby
     and michael, he's running smack into another group of
     well-wishing townies. mrs. march is among them. she's
     holding an envelope.

                                townie #1
                  mrs. march wants to give you
                  something.
                         (to mrs. march)
                  he's right here, irene.

                                mrs. march
                         (re: letter)
                  it's to my daughter annie. she
                  left five years ago. she was only
                  fifteen. the last i heard, she
                  was living up north...

     the postman swallows hard, looks from the envelope to the
     faces around him, to mrs. march. she looks blindly back.
     how can he lie to her?

                                the postman
                  look, mrs. march, you should know
                  that...

                                 mrs. march
                  know what?

                                 the postman
                  know that...

     but she stops him, grabs for his hand.

                                mrs. march
                  i have a feeling about you. i
                  know you'll do what's right.

     her hand leaves his and she disappears into the crowd.
     she's left him with her letter and no choice at all.

                                the postman
                  i got to get out of here.

                                                              49.
