165   ext. meadow - day                                              165

      bethlehem and the postman riding toward each other. they
      meet when the postman is almost three-quarters of the way
      over to the holnists' side.


      bethlehem and postman

      as they come face-to-face.

                              bethlehem
                my little shipping clerk.

                              the postman
                we're both a couple of frauds.
                you know it; i know it.

      bethlehem sneers.

                              bethlehem
                great men are made by other great
                men. patton had rommel. grant
                had lee. but i get you.

                              the   postman
                you're no fucking   general. you're
                a copying machine   salesman.
                you're not even a   good painter.

                              bethlehem
                are you trying to goad me into a
                fight?

                              the postman
                wouldn't it be great if wars could
                be fought just by the assholes who
                started them? we could settle
                this thing right here. you and
                me.

                              bethlehem
                unfortunately, it doesn't work
                that way.

                              the postman
                it does in your army.

      the postman kicks his horse up into a gallop, and rides up
      the holnist line. no one, least of all bethlehem, is sure
      what's going on.

                              the postman
                i invoke law seven of the laws of
                eight! any man may challenge for
                leadership of the clan!

                                                      (continued)

                                                               132.

165   continued:                                                      165

                                 bethlehem
                   what?

      the postman wheels his horse around.

                                 the postman
                   i challenge you.

      bethlehem is caught completely by surprise, but recovers.

                                 bethlehem
                   you're not a holnist. you're not
                   a member of the clan. you don't
                   have the right.

      the postman rolls up his sleeve. he rides the holnist
      lines displaying his brand for all to see. the holnists
      murmur amongst themselves.

                                 the postman
                   i have every right. i invoke law
                   seven!

      bethlehem can't believe his eyes.

                                 the postman
                   i challenge for leadership of the
                   clan!

      the seed of doubt is planted. is bethlehem violating one
      of the laws of eight? the men look at one another. gibbs
      looks to getty. bethlehem looks from the postman's tattoo
      to his face.

                                 bethlehem
                   where do i know you from?

                                the postman
                   'cry havoc! and let slip the dogs
                   of war.' remember that?

                                  bethlehem
                   shakespeare. the one who didn't
                   want to fight.

                                 the postman
                   i should've found a way to kill
                   you then. but you seemed so
                   strong.

                                 bethlehem
                   law seven it is.
                          (to all)
                   this war is settled here!

                                                       (continued)

                                                                 133.

165   continued:    (2)                                                 165

      as the postman nods in agreement.

      they take their positions -- and without a word -- they
      kick their horses into a charge. coming straight for each
      other like medieval jousters.

      bethlehem reaches for his sword.    but before it clears the
      scabbard, the postman lunges.

      the horses collide.    bethlehem and the postman hit the
      ground hard.

      holnists and carriers alike begin to move forward for a
      better look.

      the fight is fierce. bloody. the postman and bethlehem
      are at each other like coiled snakes.

      it's more of a fight than any of the holnists --
      especially getty -- expected. the spectators pull in
      tighter.

      both combatants have taken a beating -- and still, they
      fight on -- trading bloody, raw-knuckled punches.

      one of bethlehem's connects. the postman loses his
      footing, hits the ground -- knocking his head on a rock
      with a resounding crack. dazed, he's slow to rise.

      it's just the moment bethlehem needs, he straddles the
      fallen postman, reaches for his knife with one hand --
      grabs the postman's throat with the other.

                                 bethlehem
                   i study people. i know your
                   problem. do you know why you
                   can't fight?

      the postman can't answer.

                                 bethlehem
                   you have nothing to fight for.
                   you don't care about anything.
                   you don't value anything. you
                   don't believe in anything. that's
                   what makes me better.

      the postman grabs bethlehem's knife-hand -- using all his
      remaining strength to keep him at bay.

                                 the postman
                          (barely audible)
                   i believe in the united states
                   postal service.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                 134.

165   continued:    (3)                                                 165

      the postman lets go of bethlehem's hands, grabs his belt
      and pulls him over. as they roll to their feet, the
      postman club-fists bethlehem on the side of the head.

                                  the postman
                   neither snow...
                          (wham!)
                   nor rain...
                          (wham!)
                   nor heat...
                          (wham!)
                   nor gloom of night...
                          (wham!)
                   will stay this courier from the
                   swift completion of his appointed
                   rounds...

      bethlehem reels, stumbling back. the postman pounces on
      top of him, begins to strangle him. bethlehem tries to
      pry the fingers from his throat, but can't. he's going to
      die.

      the postman is urged on. by both sides. holnists.
      carriers. ford. even holnist luke. he looks up at the
      faces -- and finally lets bethlehem go. the general gasps
      for breath.

      as ponytail and chubby move forward to untie ford, the
      postman looks to both sides.

                                 the postman
                   it doesn't have to be this way.
                   we don't have to kill each other.
                   we can live together. we can --

      ford takes chubby's pistol, sets it against the side of
      bethlehem's head.

                                  ford
                   law three.   mercy is for the weak.

                                    the postman
                   ford, don't...

      bethlehem shakes his head -- doesn't want him to, either.

                                 ford
                   law eight. there is only one
                   penalty and that penalty is death.

      ford's going to shoot.

                                                         (continued)

                                                                135.

165   continued:    (4)                                                165

                                 the postman
                   he isn't worth it. i'm the head
                   of the clan now! there are going
                   to be new laws!
                          (to all)
                   law one! no more killing!
                   there's going to be peace!

      the postman looks at carriers and holnists alike.

                                  the postman
                   who else?   who else has a law?

                                 woman
                   everyone has to learn how to read.

                                 the postman
                   that's law two. who else?!

                                   carrier #1
                   three.    liberty and justice for
                   all!

                                   luke
                   four.    no more tattoos.

                                  carrier #2
                   law five.   give peace a chance!

                                holnist soldier #2
                   law six. mercy is, it's okay
                   sometimes!

                                   carrier #3
                   seven!    bring back vacations!

      the postman nods solemnly, looks to ford.

                                 the postman
                   how about it, ford lincoln
                   mercury? you give us law eight.

      ford grits his teeth.

                                 the postman
                          (close -- for ford)
                   be a leader, ford.

                                   ford
                   law eight...

      ford fires! bethlehem flinches, then sags as he realizes
      ford has fired into the ground.

                                                        (continued)

                                                                136.

165   continued:    (5)                                                165

                                 ford
                   ... live and let live.

      the postman smiles in relief as ford lowers the revolver
      and starts to hand the weapon over.

      forgotten for an instant, bethlehem makes a last, wild
      lunge, grabs ford's gun.

      as bethlehem aims at the postman, a shot rings out. hit
      in the chest, bethlehem blinks in amazement before he
      falls to the ground, dying. getty has shot him.

                                 bethlehem
                   would i had bestowed that time in
                   the tongues that i have in
                   fencing, dancing and bear-baiting.
                   oh, had i but followed the arts...

      he dies.

                                 the postman
                   grow like savages -- as soldiers
                   will -- that nothing do but
                   mediate on blood.

      getty throws his rifle on the ground. other weapons are
      laid down. the war, at long last, is over.

                                 the postman
                   somebody take a letter.

                                 chubby
                   huh?

                                 the postman
                   a letter...

                                                        dissolve to:
