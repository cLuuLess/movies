139   ext. ridge - r.v. camp - day                                    139

      some carriers drop their uniforms into a bonfire.

      the postman and abby ride up on the ridge above the rv
      camp. they pause to look back one last time. across the
      way, on the other side, ford is doing the same thing. as
      though he senses it, ford stops and looks back.

      ford raises his hand, salutes. slowly, the postman brings
      up his own hand. but he doesn't salute. he waves. good-
      bye. as ford turns away, so does the postman.


      on chubby, ponytail and carrier named drew

      watching as the postman and abby disappear from sight.

                                 chubby
                   guess minneapolis is that way.
