117   ext. holnist army camp - night                                  117

      two sentries guard the east. they peer into the gloom at
      the sound of a wagon approaching. it sounds like it's
      coming fast.

                                  sentry
                   halt!   identify yourself!

                                                        (continued)

                                                               99.

117   continued:                                                     117

      wagon

      tearing along. ford at the reins, urging the horses to
      all possible speed.  then he stands, leaps to the ground.


      sentries

      they raise their rifles as the riderless wagon looms out
      of the night. they each get off a shot before being
      forced to dive out of the way. the wagon continues on,
      down to...


      holnist camp

      a soldier finally grabs hold of one of the halters and
      brings the wagon to a stop. half-dressed, bethlehem steps
      up. a tarp covers the back upon which is written...

                                  bethlehem
                          (reading)
                   postage due...

      bethlehem yanks away the tarp to reveal the 10 dead
      holnist soldiers. the men around bethlehem exchange
      looks, can't believe it. bethlehem bellows in rage.
