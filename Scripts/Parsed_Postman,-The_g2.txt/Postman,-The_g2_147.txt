147   ext. high tension towers - day                                    147

      the useless towers cutting across a valley.      rain beats
      down, as the postman and abby trudge along.

      up ahead, a rail-road tunnel promises shelter from the
      storm.

                                 the postman
                          (re: the tunnel)
                   we can rest in there.

      abby is quick to agree.

      out of the corner of his eye, the postman catches a blur
      of movement.

      he turns his head quickly, but he's barely in time to see
      a wooden basket, attached to one of the high wires, swing
      from a distant tower. there's a sentry inside it.

      the basketed sentry whistles away at 40 mph, heading
      straight for an adjacent tower. in a matter of seconds,
      he's lost from view.

      the postman looks back at abby.       she's shivering.

                                 the postman
                   did you see that?

                                 abby
                          (shaking her head)
                   i'm hungry, postman.

      the postman guides her toward the train tunnel.

                                                              119.
