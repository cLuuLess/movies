60   ext. gates (benning, oregon) - day                              60

     they open enough to let the postman ride out, then close
     behind him. he sits nervously on his horse waving a white
     flag. he's met, dismounts and is led to a command post
     where bethlehem is studying a rough map of the town.

                                bethlehem
               make it quick.     i've got an attack
               to coordinate.

                             the postman
               general, um, they've asked me to
               negotiate a peace treaty.

     the last time he and bethlehem were face-to-face, the
     postman had a shaved head, was dressed in rags, and was
     covered with cuts and bruises. bethlehem can't place him,
     but there's something familiar all the same.

                                bethlehem
               do i know you?

                             the postman
               i don't think so, sir. i --

                             bethlehem
                      (scans uniform)
               you're the postman, aren't you?


     abby

     watches from the flap of bethlehem's tent.    the guard sees
     and shoves her back inside.


     bethlehem and the postman

     bethlehem flicks at the uniform flag shoulder patch.

                             bethlehem
               the restored united states. do
               these people really believe that
               shit? who are you really?

     although he wants to confess everything, something tells
     the postman he has to try to brass it out.

                             the postman
               i am a united states postman.

                                bethlehem
                  i was at the battle of georgetown.
                  i watched the white house burn to
                  the ground. don't try to sell me
                  on any restored u.s...

                                the postman
                  the new capital is based in
                  minneapolis. inside the hubert
                  humphrey metrodome. you know,
                  where the vikings used to play?

                                  bethlehem
                  you're funny.    now, what are the
                  terms?

                                the postman
                  they'll open the gate and give you
                  double what they usually give.
                  just don't hurt anybody. this was
                  all a misunderstanding.

     bethlehem thinks this over.
