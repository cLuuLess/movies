41   int. abandoned hotel - room 7 - close on string-tied             41
     package - night

     ~from the previous scene.       it's on the table with a
     growing stack of mail.

     the postman is in bed, trying to sleep. but it's hard-
     coming. he laces his fingers behind his head, stares up
     at the moon through a hole in the wall. a knock at the
     door.

                                   the postman
                  just leave it.

     there's a pause.    and then, another knock.

                                the postman
                  i said leave it.

     the door opens. surprise. abby stands in the doorway,
     her hair held up by an old red ribbon. he sits up.

                                   the postman
                  hello, abby.

                                abby
                  you'll be leaving tomorrow?

                                   the postman
                  i guess.

                                abby
                         (enters; closes door)
                  everybody's up late writing
                  letters for you to take. we're
                  not supposed to waste candles like
                  that, but they're so excited.

                                   the postman
                  how about you?     do you have a
                  letter?

                                abby
                  i don't have anybody to write to.

                                the postman
                  i'll find you a pen pal. someone
                  with interests similar to your
                  own. dancing, checking for mumps.

     abby laughs.    the postman is charmed.

                                abby
                  you're funny. hardly anyone's
                  funny around here.

                                the postman
                  i guess no one feels much like
                  laughing.

     the two of them just look at each other a moment.         abby
     fingers the ribbon in her hair.

                                abby
                  have you decided yet?

                                the postman
                  oh, well, i've been thinking about
                  it.

     a beat. abby lets her shift drop to the floor, then
     slides under the sheets alongside him.

                                 the postman
                  sure.   why not?

     they lie there awkwardly for a moment.          he looks at her.

                                the postman
                  god, you're beautiful. sorry, i
                  know you'd probably like to keep
                  things more clinical.
                         (beat)
                  you don't even know my name.

                                                           (continued)

                                                                 55.

     she shushes him, covers his mouth with her hand.

                                abby
                  i don't want to.

     he nods he understands.     she stares into his eyes.

                                abby
                  it would be easier for me if you
                  closed your eyes.

     the postman closes his eyes. abby slides her hand away
     from his mouth. and as they start to make love...

                                                       dissolve to:
