142   ext. river - day                                             142

      a pair of boots are walking through the water. it's the
      postman. he turns over a body in the water. it wears a
      homemade postal uniform, a bag of mail twisted around his
      arm. it's a young face, one we haven't seen before. he
      looks up to abby on a ridge.

                                 the postman
                   i don't know him. do you?

                                 abby
                          (shakes her head)
                   where do you think he came from?

      puzzled, the postman shakes his head. he gently releases
      the body. the current takes it and they watch as it
      continues on its way to postal valhalla.
