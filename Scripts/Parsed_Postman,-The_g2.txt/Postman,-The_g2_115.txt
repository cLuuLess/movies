115   int. old george's trailer - night                               115

      as usual, old george is hunkered down before his short
      wave. he looks as the door opens and the postman enters.

                                 the postman
                   tell me about the other stuff you
                   know...

      george crosses the trailer, opens a cabinet. inside:
      twenty odd guns plus the parts for several more. the crow
      caws.
