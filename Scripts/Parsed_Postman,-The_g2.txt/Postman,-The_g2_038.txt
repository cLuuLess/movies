38   int. post office (pine view) - night                           38

     long ago stripped, it still has a proud, official, almost
     holy feel. the postman wanders in, stops to read the
     credo calligraphied on the wall. "neither snow, nor
     rain..." he turns at a sound. ford is here, leaning
     against a wall.

                                ford
                  i knew you'd come here.

                                  the postman
                  you did, huh?

     ford nods.    a sage sixteen-year-old.

                                ford
                  how do you get to be a postman,
                  anyhow?

                                the postman
                  you have to be in the right place
                  at the right time.

                                ford
                  how could i do it?

                                                      (continued)

                                                              50.

                                the postman
                  i thought you wanted to drive
                  cars.

                                ford
                  not anymore. that was kid's
                  stuff. this is real. so, where's
                  the right place?

                                the postman
                  could be anywhere. anytime. only
                  another postman can make you a
                  postman.

                                ford
                  kinda like vampires, right?

                                the postman
                  something like that. you have to
                  be sworn in.

     ford raises his right hand, palm out, ready to take the
     oath. it takes the postman a moment to realize.

                                the postman
                  the organization's kinda shaky.
                  it might not last.

                                ford
                  what does?

                                the postman
                  you'd meet a lot of people who
                  don't believe in you.

                                ford
                  i'll set them straight.

                                the postman
                  it's a lonely job.

                                ford
                  i've been lonely all my life.

     this response strikes a chord. the postman sees how badly
     ford wants something to hold onto. he sees himself.

                                the postman
                  so have i, ford. so have i.

     the postman looks up at the creed on the wall.    finally...

                                                      (continued)

                                                                51.

                                   the postman
                  what the hell?     repeat after me.

                                postman/ford
                         (repeating)
                  neither snow, nor rain, nor heat
                  nor gloom of night stays these
                  couriers from the swift completion
                  of their appointed rounds.

                                   the postman
                  okay then.

                                ford
                         (repeating)
                  okay, then.

                                the postman
                  no, no, no, i'm saying that. you
                  just listen... by my authority you
                  are now empowered to carry the
                  mail.
                         (extends a hand)
                  congratulations, you're a postman.

     they shake hands. the postman doesn't realize, but this
     is the most important moment in ford's life.

                                ford
                  i want you to know i'd die to get
                  a letter through.

     ford's intensity takes the postman back.       but the moment
     is broken when...

                                briscoe (o.s.)
                  johnny, why don't you run along.
                  i need to speak to this man.

     ford bristles at "johnny," looks to the postman.

                                ford
                  i'll see you around.

                                the postman
                  sure thing, ford.

     ford exits.

                                briscoe
                  johnny's real impressed with you.
                  whole town's real impressed with
                  you.

                                                        (continued)

                                                              52.

38   continued:    (3)                                              38

                                the postman
                  i take it you're not.

                                briscoe
                  smarter than you look.

                                the postman
                  what can i do for you, sheriff?

                                briscoe
                  you can clear out. or i can throw
                  you out. either way suits me
                  fine.

                                the postman
                  i'm afraid you don't understand,
                  sheriff. i'm a government
                  employee. authorized by --

                                briscoe
                  you're not authorized by shit.
                  you're nothing but a drifter who
                  found a bag of mail. and i want
                  you out of my town.

                                the postman
                  this is going in my report.

                                briscoe
                  these people don't need dreams,
                  mr. postman. they need something
                  real. they need help with the
                  goddamn holnists. are you going
                  to bring them that?
                         (as the postman
                          doesn't answer)
                  didn't think so. all you cost us
                  so far is a few bowls of soup and
                  maybe later a few broken hearts.
                  i aim to keep it that way. you
                  can stay till morning. then i
                  don't ever want to see you again.

     briscoe exits, leaves the postman alone in the post
     office.
