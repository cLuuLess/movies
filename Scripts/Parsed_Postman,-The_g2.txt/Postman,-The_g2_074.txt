74   int. hunting shack - day                                          74

     wind howling in the b.g. the postman lies back on his
     cot. the little shack has been scoured clean. abby
     stares listlessly at the fire. the silence is torture.
     the postman tries to strike up a conversation.

                                the postman
                  wind's come up.
                         (no response from
                          abby)
                  getting colder too. must be
                  another storm --

     abby gets up and throws a log on the fire.

                                   abby
                  anything else?

                                the postman
                  i didn't mean for you to --

                                abby
                  your legs are going to rot off if
                  you don't try to walk.

                                   the postman
                  i'm hurt.

                                                        (continued)

                                                              76.

74   continued:                                                      74

                                 abby
                  you're lazy.

                                the postman
                  lazy?! i got a hole in my
                  stomach. i'm weak. the two big
                  meals around here are grass and
                  snow. and we're running out of
                  grass.

     as the two of them glare at each other for a moment.     abby
     starts to put on her coat.

                                the postman
                  where are you going?

     abby doesn't answer. she picks up the rifle and starts to
     lead the horse outside.

                                the postman
                  you're not leaving me here, are
                  you?

     abby is out the door without a word.
