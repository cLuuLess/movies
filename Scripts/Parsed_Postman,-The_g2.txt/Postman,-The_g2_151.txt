151   ext. north bound lane (bridge city) - dusk                       151

      fog rolls in.    abby rests.

      ponytail, chubby and drew look up gratefully as one of the
      citizens of bridge city doles out bread.

      the mayor steps over, hands the postman two loaves.

                                 b.c. mayor
                   for you and your wife.

                                   the postman
                   thanks.    she's not my wife.

      the exchange cuts abby like a knife. she gets up and
      leaves. the mayor keeps his council -- not sure what to
      make of this arrangement.

                                 the postman
                   let me ask you something, have you
                   ever heard of a town with electric
                   lights?

                                   b.c. mayor
                   st. rose?

                                   the postman
                   yeah!

                                 b.c. mayor
                   never been. but they say it's a
                   ways down on the coast.

                                   the postman
                   how far?

                                                        (continued)

                                                                121.

151   continued:                                                       151

                                 b.c. mayor
                   couple hundred miles at least.   i
                   couldn't say for sure.

      it's the discovery of a lifetime. the postman looks to
      the west end of the bridge, where abby stands alone.

                                 the postman
                   you seem like a decent man. and
                   these seem like decent people.

                                   b.c. mayor
                   we try to be.

                                 the postman
                   and this seems like a safe place.

                                 b.c. mayor
                          (intuitive)
                   you want to leave her?

      the postman looks back to the mayor, then slowly nods.

                                 the postman
                   all of them. i'll give you the
                   horses and my gear. abby's
                   special. she's strong. probably
                   end up running the place.

                                 b.c. mayor
                   why don't you take the night to
                   think. decide if that's what you
                   really want.
