140   ext. interstate - day                                           140

      a sign prohibits pedestrians, horses and bicycles. the
      postman and abby ride by. the postman no longer wears his
      uniform. their gear is packed behind their saddles.

      as a family of transients begin to rise from where they're
      camped in the breakdown lane:

                                 the postman
                   we can't help you. we're just as
                   lost as you are.

      the postman rides on. abby watches over her shoulder as
      they slowly begin to sit back down.
