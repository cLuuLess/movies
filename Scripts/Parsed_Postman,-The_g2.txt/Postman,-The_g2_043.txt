43   ext. abandoned hotel - day                                        43

     the postman exits. in uniform, his bag slung over his
     shoulder. he starts then stops short. only now do we see
     most of the townspeople have silently assembled here.
     they've been waiting for him, starving for him.

     ford steps up, hands him another fresh packet of letters.
     the postman sees that ford hangs on to four or five.

                                the postman
                  what about those?

                                ford
                  these are going to blue jay.
                  about twenty miles east. i
                  thought i could take them.

     the postman scans the crowd.      looking for abby maybe?

                                 the postman
                          (absently)
                  okay.   they're yours.

     briscoe rides up, regards the postman sternly.

                                briscoe
                  i'm your escort out of town.

     some of the town's citizens lead up a saddled mare.

                                                       (continued)

                                                             56.

43   continued:                                                    43

                                citizen #1
                  we took a vote, mr. postman.   we
                  want you to have this horse.

                                citizen #2
                  now don't say no. a man on
                  horseback can cover ten times the
                  territory of a man on foot.

                                the postman
                         (smiles at briscoe)
                  i'll take it.

     he ties his mailbag to the saddle, swings himself up.

                                citizen #3
                  there's a bedroll, some oats and a
                  week's rations.

                                the postman
                  thank you.

                                citizen #1
                  where do you figure you'll go from
                  here?

                                the postman
                  go?... oh yeah... i'll head west,
                  then work my way back here in a
                  sort of figure eight.

     "8." everyone's quiet a moment. they shift
     uncomfortably. the postman looks out at the crowd. they
     crave hope. he should probably just keep his mouth shut.

                                the postman
                  times seem hard right now. but
                  you have to believe it's getting
                  better. birds are migrating
                  again. the rains are back.

     the people consider him and then each other. by god, they
     do feel hopeful. suddenly, ellen, her little boy by her
     side, begins to sing. it's weak at first, but one-by-one
     the others join in. soon the whole town is singing:

                                ellen & town
                  'oh beautiful for spacious skies,
                  for amber waves of grain. for
                  purple mountain's majesty, above
                  the fruited plain. america...'

     the postman looks around. they sing their hearts out.
     the guilt is overwhelming. he digs his heels into the
     horse's flanks and rides out of town.

                                                           57.
