     rain as the army moves. boots suck at the mud. war
     wagons heave out of ruts. a monster gun is mounted on an
     old john deere semi, pulled by a team of ten horses. the
     conscripts fill the middle ranks, each bearing a heavy
     pack.

                                                       (continued)

     marching beside woody, the postman stares blankly ahead.
     the cry to halt. the conscripts unsling their packs,
     catch their breath. idaho pulls the postman out of line.

                                idaho
                  the general would like a word with
                  you, shakespeare.
