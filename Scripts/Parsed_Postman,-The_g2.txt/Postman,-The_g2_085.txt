85   int. hunting shack - dusk                                    85

     abby sits huddled in blankets. the fire is blazing. the
     postman steps over, sets the once-again-hot bowl of stew
     before her.

     she considers the food a moment.

                             abby
               i told you that's all there was.

                             the postman
               that's why you should have it.

                             abby
               i knew you could walk.

                             the postman
               you're weird, you know that?

                                                             79.
