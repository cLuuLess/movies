54   ext. benning, oregon - day                                      54

     a long double-line of holnist cavalry stand in formation
     in front of the city walls made from stacks of crushed
     cars. on top, a skinny sentry cranks the siren while a
     chubby sentry watches.

     bethlehem rides through them with abby in tow -- her
     wrists tied by a rope which is looped around the pommel of
     bethlehem's saddle. her face is bruised, her bottom lip
     split. bethlehem reins up, puzzled by the apparent stall.

                                                       (continued)

                                                           66.

                                gibbs
                         (rides up; salutes)
                  they won't open the gates, sir.

                                bethlehem
                  what?

                                gibbs
                  they say they got a representative
                  of the restored united states in
                  there. they say this army is
                  illegal. they say --

     the chubby sentry answers from the top of the palisade.

                                chubby sentry
                  drop dead and go to hell!

     the chubby sentry disappears back behind cover. bethlehem
     remains controlled, but his manner becomes deadly.

                                bethlehem
                  the romans had an expression they
                  used to scare their children.
                  'hannibal ad portas!' -- hannibal
                  is at the gates. do you know who
                  hannibal was?
                         (as she doesn't answer)
                  of course not. a pretty girl like
                  you wouldn't know a thing.
                         (to getty)
                  colonel getty, get some men up
                  there and open that gate.
