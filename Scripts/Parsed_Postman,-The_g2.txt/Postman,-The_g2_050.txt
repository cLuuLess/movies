50   ext. parking lot (pine view) - early evening                     50

     bethlehem relaxes with his officers as wagons are loaded.
     michael is just passing with a sack of grain on his
     shoulder, when bethlehem looks across the street -- spies
     abby and some of the other women sewing grain sacks shut.

                                bethlehem
                  good lord. that, gentlemen, is a
                  first-rate piece of ass.

                                                      (continued)

     michael overhears. he looks over as bethlehem's men nod
     in agreement. michael sees that they're talking about
     abby.

                                bethlehem
                  tell the sheriff i want to be
                  introduced. she does not belong
                  in a mudhole like this.

     one of the men hurries off. it's concern for abby, not
     for his manhood that makes him step forward.

                                michael
                  excuse me.

                                bethlehem
                         (looks over)
                  you again?

                                 michael
                  that's my wife, general.   she's a
                  married woman.

                                bethlehem
                  do you know what system of
                  government we have here, son?
                         (as michael shrugs)
                  a feudal system. like the middle
                  ages. with lords and vassals.
                  that's you and me. those lords,
                  they had some ideas. if a vassal
                  got married, it was the lord's
                  right, his right, to sleep with
                  the bride on the wedding night.

                                michael
                  me and abby have been married for
                  three years.

                                bethlehem
                  sorry, but i wasn't invited to the
                  wedding. now, you've already done
                  me one favor, son. don't let this
                  be a black mark on an otherwise
                  perfect record.


     abby

     another woman has pointed out to her what's going on. she
     can't hear what's being said, but she watches, concerned.

                                                       (continued)

     parking lot

                                bethlehem
                  we'll be civilized about this. i
                  want you to give me your blessing.

                                   michael
                  sir, i can't.     you can't.

                                bethlehem
                  can't? i'm tired of can't. we
                  had a great nation once. do you
                  know what made it that way? i
                  can! till the weak came along.
                  the 'i can'ts' destroyed us. but
                  i'm going to make us strong again.
                  i'm going to be the father of a
                  new nation.
                         (draws his sword)
                  do you know why it will be me?

     michael looks to abby as she starts across the street.

                                   bethlehem
                  because i can!

     the sword whistles down.       accompanied by an anguished cry:

                                   abby
                  michael!

     abby rushes forward, but she's blocked by getty and
     another man. she cries out again and again.

     filled with impotent fury, briscoe squeezes out the words.

                                briscoe
                  you didn't have to --

                                bethlehem
                  didn't have to what, sheriff?

     three holnist soldiers draw down on briscoe.      bethlehem
     circles, menacing on his horse.

                                bethlehem
                  your people seem seditious.    you
                  seem seditious.

     briscoe stares down at michael's crumpled form.      abby
     wails.

                                                        (continued)

                                                           63.

                                   briscoe
                  aw, michael...

     briscoe might go after bethlehem despite the odds.

                                bethlehem
                  what am i seeing here? i'm
                  waiting.

                                briscoe
                         (burying his anger)
                  man came through here. with mail.
                  said he was a postman. said the
                  government had been restored back
                  east.

                                bethlehem
                  what government?

     from out of the crowd -- a voice.         ford.

                                ford
                  the united states government.

     bethlehem whirls his horse at the noise.

                                   bethlehem
                  who said that?

     not waiting for an answer, getty charges the crowd, knocks
     one of the onlookers down. a dead silence.

     bethlehem frowns, thinks it over a minute.

                                bethlehem
                  which way did he go?
                         (a beat)
                  do not make me ask again.

                                   briscoe
                          (lies)
                  east.

                                bethlehem
                         (to getty)
                  send a patrol east. send three
                  more south, north and west.
                         (to briscoe)
                  they'd better find him east.
