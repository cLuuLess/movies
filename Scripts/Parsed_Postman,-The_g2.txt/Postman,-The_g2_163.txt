163   ext. carriers' line - day                                      163

      the postman, chubby, ponytail and old george and all the
      carriers have taken positions.

      the postman sights through a telescope.

      he scans further down the line -- then stops when he sees
      ford. bloody, beaten within inches of his life. he's
      shackled -- surrounded by holnist guards.

      the postman's eyes turn to stone.

                              the postman
                       (to carriers)
                stay here. no one moves until i
                give the orders.

      he clicks his horse forward, toward the holnist line.
