22   ext. thicket - day                                              22

     thorns catch and tear at his clothes as the postman pushes
     his way through. he freezes. ahead, sprawled and
     twisted, the mauled, bloody corpse of a holnist soldier.

                               soldier (o.s.)
                 why are you stopping?

                                  the postman
                 i found him.

                                  soldier (o.s.)
                 he alive?

     clearly he is not.

                                  the postman
                 yeah.

                                  soldier (o.s.)
                 bring him out.

     the postman heaves the corpse onto his back. rising,
     steadying himself, he looks back over his shoulders at a
     guttural growl. he hurries forward.


     army

     everyone stares across the river, straining to see as the
     postman emerges with the corpse on his back.


     on bridge

     the postman starts across, hampered by his burden.   he
     pauses, at his feet, the cracked, knotty plank.

                               idaho
                        (across river)
                 hurry up! you still got a lion to
                 bag!

     the postman decides, deliberately steps on the plank.
     crack. the postman and the corpse drop thirty feet down,
     disappear in the river below.

     the corpse surfaces first, floats in the water.

     then the postman. farther down the river. swimming
     downstream with powerful strokes. between his efforts and
     the current, he's being quickly swept away from the
     holnists.

     as bethlehem's eyes narrow in fury.

                                                     (continued)

                                                              32.

22   continued:                                                     22

     a rifle barks a shell back after the postman, but he
     disappears around a bend in the river.

     bethlehem signals to two soldiers. they start running
     along the east ridge toward the riverbend.

     two more start across the bridge to the west -- moving
     with military precision.

     bethlehem wheels toward the conscripts, points out woody.

                                bethlehem
                  in the water. come back without
                  him and you and another man will
                  die in his place.

     woody dives in the water. bethlehem looks to idaho who
     dives in as well. conscripts buzz with nervous
     excitement.

                                conscripts
                  go!   go!

                                bandit #20
                         (caught up)
                  i'll get him, sir.

     he takes off running across the bridge.
