116   ext. elvis, oregon - day                                        116

      quiet. an old flag ruffles outside the post office -- the
      only new structure in town. old george sweeps the porch
      as a patrol of ten holnist soldiers ride into town.
      george makes no move to flee as they near. as they rein
      up across from him he just smiles and continues sweeping.

      sensing it, the holnist officer looks up. there, on the
      roof, stands the postman. ford and briscoe flank him --
      along with twenty mailmen and locals, armed with guns,
      bows and rocks.

      as the soldiers raise their rifles, the roofies open fire.
      george whips up a sawed-off shotgun. boom! caught in the
      storm, the ten soldiers go down.

      grim, the postman looks to ford as the locals cheer.
      george resumes sweeping. the mailmen climb down to strip
      the weapons off the dead.

                                 the postman
                   ford, i want you to get rid of the
                   bodies. i don't want these people
                   blamed for what we did.

      ford nods.
