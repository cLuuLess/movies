100   ext. rv camp - dawn                                           100

      ten letter carriers are on horseback. among them, red and
      ponytail. ford and the postman are also on horses. each
      rider salutes the postman, then gets a sheaf of anti-
      holnist propaganda from ford.

                              the postman
                i wish they'd stop saluting.

      it's annoying him. as chubby rides up. the postman
      catches his right wrist as he attempts to salute. so
      chubby salutes with the left hand instead. as they line
      up:

                              the postman
                just stay safe and remember. the
                mailman's more important than the
                mail.

                              chubby
                boy, he's smart.

      the sun just peeks up over the horizon. at that signal,
      the carriers thunder off, the ground trembling under them.
      the look on their faces. the glory of it all. they're
      alive! the postman hesitates, watches after them a
      moment.

                                 the postman
                what the hell?

      urging his horse forward, he rides after them. with them.
      and then, like an exploding firework, each postman shoots
      off in a separate direction. headed for all points of the
      compass and some in between.
