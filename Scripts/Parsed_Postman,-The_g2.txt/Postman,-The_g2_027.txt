27   ext. jeep - day                                              27

     wearing the blue uniform, the postman looks down at the
     fresh grave, realizes a eulogy is in order. he takes off
     the hat, holds it over his chest for a heartfelt moment of
     silence.

                                the postman
                  thanks for being there for me.
                         (raising the flask)
                  here's to you. i consider my
                  taxes very well spent.

     he swallows the last few drops, then sets the flask down
     as a headstone. what now?

                                the postman
                  all dressed up. nowhere to go.

                                                               37.
