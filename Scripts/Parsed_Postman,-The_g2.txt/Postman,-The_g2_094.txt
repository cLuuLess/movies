     the guts of the operation. several carriers are busy
     sorting and bagging letters. it goes out pinned to a
     clothesline which crisscrosses back and forth. everyone
     follows as ford takes the postman on a tour. there are
     hushed whispers among those who are seeing him for the
     first time.

                                ford
                  we bring all the mail here first.
                  we sort it, group it and then it
                  goes out. so far we got thirty
                  routes.

     ford leads the postman and abby into another winnebago.
     chubby and red and ponytail follow. those that can't fit
     just peer in through the windows.
