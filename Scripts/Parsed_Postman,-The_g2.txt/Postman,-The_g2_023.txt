23   ext. river - day                                               23

     a fallen tree spans the river. as the postman is swept
     beneath, he reaches up and catches hold. pulling himself
     out of the water, he scrambles for the west shore. he
     disappears into the woods as two soldiers appear.

     they catch hold of the tree, look to the west banking, see
     footprints in the mud where the postman pulled himself
     out. they start after him.
