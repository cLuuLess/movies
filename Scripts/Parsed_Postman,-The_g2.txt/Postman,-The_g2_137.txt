137   ext. r.v. camp - night                                          137

      twelve mail carriers, including ford, ponytail, chubby,
      luke and old george, wait as the postman steps up before
      them. abby's off to the side.

                                 the postman
                   is this everybody?

                                 ford
                   the rest are on the overdue list.

                                 the postman
                   this is everybody.
                          (for all)
                   got a letter from president
                   starkey.

      an excited murmur among the carriers. only ford eyes the
      postman suspiciously. the postman reads:

                                 the postman
                   'greetings all carriers.'

                                 carriers
                   greetings, president starkey!

                                 the postman
                          (reading)
                   'i've been in contact with the
                   postman. i've received all the
                   reports. i'm proud of you all.'

      he looks at them, doesn't need to read what's in his
      heart.

                                                       (continued)

                                                               110.

137   continued:                                                      137

                                 the postman
                   in dark days, in a weary world,
                   you gave everything and asked for
                   nothing. you beat back despair
                   and replaced it with hope and for
                   that your country can never repay
                   you. but the price is too high.
                   i won't see anymore of my bravest
                   die. it is my duty to hereby
                   disband the postal service of the
                   restored united states. you are
                   to burn your uniforms and the
                   postman is to return to
                   minneapolis at once. thank you
                   and that is all.

      a hushed silence. the postman walks away. the carriers
      exchange tired, defeated looks. abby just sighs, knows
      he's not necessarily wrong.

      ford catches up with the postman.    he stares at the
      postman; the postman stares back.

                                  ford
                           (low; fierce)
                   the president never wrote that
                   letter.

                                 the postman
                   if he could've that's what he
                   would have said.

      ford gestures to the second letter.

                                 ford
                   who's the other letter to?

                                 the postman
                   bethlehem. i'm taking it to him
                   in the morning.

                                 ford
                   what does it say?

                                 the postman
                   mail's private. you know that.

                                 ford
                   what does it say?

                                 the postman
                          (stops; turns)
                   it says it's over. it says we
                   quit.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                111.

137   continued:    (2)                                                137

                                 ford
                   it says you quit. what about the
                   oath?

                                 the postman
                   tell me something, ford. how much
                   mail can a dead postman deliver?
                   it's over.

      the postman starts to walk away again.

                                 ford
                   then i'll take it.

                                 the postman
                   i can't trust you.

      ford gathers courage and confronts the postman.

                                 ford
                   if this is the end. if this is
                   the last piece of mail that ever
                   gets delivered. i'll take it.

                                 the postman
                   whoever takes this letter probably
                   dies for it.

      ford thrusts out his hand.

                                 ford
                   i'm still a postman. you owe it
                   to me... i owe it to me.

      the postman hesitates, studies the intense young man.
      gives him the letter.
