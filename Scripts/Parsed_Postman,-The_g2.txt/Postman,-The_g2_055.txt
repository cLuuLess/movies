55   ext. inside gates - day                                     55

     the mayor hurries over, the postman following reluctantly
     behind. the mayor spots the sentries up on the parapet.

                                mayor
                  what the hell are you doing?!
                  open the gates!

                                skinny sentry
                  government's restored! we don't
                  have to take their crap anymore!
