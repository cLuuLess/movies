11   ext. holnist training camp (western idaho) - day             11

     spread out in the valley is general bethlehem's holnist
     expeditionary force. a five hundred-man army enjoying all
     the comforts a bivouac can offer.

     19 head-shaved conscripts, including woody and the
     postman, are held in a cramped, barbed wired pen. they
     watch as three more are shoved inside. one of them is
     bandit #20. he and the postman come face to face,
     recognize each other.

                              bandit #20
               hi.

                             the postman
                      (astonished)
               hi?

     the postman steps toward him, bandit #20 backs off
     quickly.

                             bandit #20
               well... i mean, we know each
               other, kind of...

                              the postman
               kind of.

                             bandit #20
                      (looking around)
               wow!

                             the postman
               so what did you guys do with my
               cigarettes?

                             bandit #20
               we traded them for a woman.

                              the postman
               wonderful.   what happened to your
               partners?

                             bandit #20
               they traded me to the holnists.

                              guard (o.s.)
               ten hut!

     general bethlehem approaches on horseback. colonel getty
     follows behind. bethlehem looks his new recruits over.
     dismounting, he enters the pen and walks among them.

                                                    (continued)

                                                               18.

                                bethlehem
                  welcome, gentlemen, to your new
                  life. you have been born again as
                  soldiers in the army of the united
                  clans of holn. the strong have
                  been sapped by the whimpering
                  propaganda of the weak. men,
                  strong men, have been denied their
                  destiny. you men have been saved
                  from that fate. redemption is
                  within your grasp.

     he starts down the line, looking the men over. he stops
     in front of a gangly recruit. the postman is alongside.

                                bethlehem
                  you. what did you do before you
                  were given this opportunity?

                                gangly recruit
                  i had a shovel. i digged holes.

     bethlehem regards him benevolently.

                                bethlehem
                  you digged holes... well, now
                  you're going to fill them.
                         (turns to postman)
                  and you?

                                 the postman
                  me?

                                bethlehem
                  is there any question in anyone's
                  mind that i was talking to you?
                  yes, you. you look like a
                  dangerous man. are you?

                                the postman
                  i'm just a performer.
                  shakespeare. stuff like that.

                                 bethlehem
                  shakespeare?

                                the postman
                  he was a writer. he --

                                bethlehem
                  i know who shakespeare was... 'cry
                  "havoc!" and let slip the dogs of
                  war.'

                                                       (continued)

                                                               19.

     bethlehem says the lines boldly, encourages his men to
     clap for him. he looks at the postman expectantly.
     finally...

                                the postman
                  i, um, you want a line?

     bethlehem nods.     the postman thinks a moment...

                                the postman
                  'to be or not to be: that is the
                  question.'

     bethlehem looks at his men as if to say, "is this all this
     guy's got?" bethlehem eyes the postman; he wants a
     contest.

                                bethlehem
                  'we few, we happy few, we band of
                  brothers.'

     the holnists clap, they know their general can best this
     guy.

                                the postman
                         (gaining confidence)
                  'now is the winter of our
                  discontent made glorious summer by
                  this son of york.'

     bethlehem claps the postman on the back.

                                bethlehem
                  you're pretty good. you're also a
                  fighter. i see it in your eyes.

     the postman doesn't answer. hesitant, he doesn't want to
     get into any more trouble than he's already in.

                                bethlehem
                  don't you agree? come on, a man's
                  got to speak his mind.

     bethlehem sounds sincere.    he seems like a good guy.

                                the postman
                  i don't mean any disrespect, sir,
                  but you'd be better off just
                  letting me go. a fighter is about
                  the last thing i am.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                20.

11   continued:    (3)                                                11

     the postman doubles over as bethlehem hooks a fist into
     his gut. bethlehem clubs him in the head, dropping him to
     his knees, then digs a boot into his side. the postman
     goes down.

                                bethlehem
                  don't you think i should be the
                  judge of that, soldier?

     the postman gasps to catch his breath.

                                 bethlehem
                  get up.   i said, get up.

     the postman staggers to his feet. blood trickles from his
     nose as he stares across at bethlehem.

                                bethlehem
                  put up your fists.

                                   the postman
                  you'd win.

     bethlehem looks to getty. click. getty shoves a pistol
     is into the postman's ear. the postman reluctantly raises
     his fists. bethlehem gives him a satisfied nod.

                                   bethlehem
                  now fight.

     the postman takes a tentative step forward. bethlehem
     drives him back with a flurry of blows. the postman is
     dazed, nearly out on his feet. bethlehem holds him up.

                                bethlehem
                  you're right. you're not a
                  fighter. but you will be. i'm
                  giving you a chance at a life that
                  means something. a life worth
                  living.

     that said, bethlehem delivers one last blow to the
     postman's face. everything goes black...
