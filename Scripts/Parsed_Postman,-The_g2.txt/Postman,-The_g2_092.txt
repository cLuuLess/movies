                  ford knows what to do?

                                ford
                  i thought you were dead.

                               the postman
                  so? i'm not making the
                  connection. what's all this then?

                                ford
                  i lied. i told people you were in
                  contact with me.

                                 the postman
                  why?

                                ford
                  because i didn't want it to end.

                                the postman
                  i don't know how long i can stay,
                  ford. president starkey will send
                  word one day and i'll have to move
                  on. understand?

                               ford
                  sure. but you'll stay till he
                  sends word? right?

     the postman can't answer, just turns and walks out of the
     tent.
