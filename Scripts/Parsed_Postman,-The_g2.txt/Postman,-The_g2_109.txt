109   ext. lonely road (southern oregon) - night                     109

      a mail carrier, red, rides like the devil himself was in
      pursuit. almost. it's getty and three holnists.

      intercut with:


      dance

      they whirl as the tempo picks up. the postman pulls abby
      in closer. her eyes now move up to his.


      road

      they're closing in on the terrified red.


      dance

      abby and the postman.    the chemistry is undeniable.


      road

      rifles crack. shot in the back, red throws back his arms.
      letters flutter from the mail bag over his shoulder; he
      seems to glide along that way forever.


      dance

      the postman looks at abby; she's so beautiful.    like only
      a pregnant woman can be.

                                 the postman
                   tell me about the baby, abby.   i
                   want to know.

      abby snaps out of the dream she's in. this isn't right.
      breaking away, she heads off. as he watches her go:


      road

      red falls from his horse.    one of the soldiers scoops up
      his mailbag.

                                                        cut to:
