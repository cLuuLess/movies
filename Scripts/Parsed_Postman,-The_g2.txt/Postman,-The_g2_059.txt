59   ext. parapet - inside walls - day                               59

     climbing an inside ladder, the mayor slams the chubby
     sentry against the wall.

                              mayor
               idiots!

                             citizen #1
                      (realizing; scared)
               they're gonna kill us all.

     the mayor peers out through an observation hole.   the
     postman and several others join him.

                              chubby sentry
               no!   let's fight them!

                             mayor
               with what? we got five guns maybe
               20 rounds of ammo in the whole
               town! how do we fight them with
               that?!

     the postman watches the holnists prepare for attack.

                            the postman
               you don't. negotiate a
               settlement. give them extra
               supplies.

     the men look at each other.   sounds reasonable enough.

                             mayor
               okay. you're a government rep.
               you go tell them.

     the look on the postman's face says it all.

                                                               68.
