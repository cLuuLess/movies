89   ext. hunting shack - day                                            89

     the fire is blazing. the hunting shack is too far gone to
     save. the postman turns around.

                                   the postman
                  what happened?

     he's nonplused to find abby standing beside a pile of
     their neatly-packed gear.

                                the postman
                  you got our stuff out.

                                   abby
                  of course.

                                                         (continued)

                                                              81.

                                 the postman
                  of course?   i don't understand.

                                abby
                  i set the fire.

                                the postman
                  am i missing the point here?

                                abby
                  you didn't think we'd stay here
                  forever, did you?
                         (the postman has
                          no response)
                  i'd appreciate if you'd walk with
                  me long enough to find someplace
                  safe for the baby. then we can
                  split up.
                         (a beat)
                  you shaved.

     the postman has all but forgotten.

                                   the postman
                  yeah...

                                   abby
                  it looks nice.

     before he can respond, she's heading off toward the pass,
     leaving the postman to shake his head at the absurdity of
     it all. he shouts after her.

                                the postman
                  you're really weird, you know
                  that?

                                                      dissolve to:
