141   ext. holnist camp - bethlehem's tent - dawn                     141

      bethlehem sits waiting at his camp table.     behind him, a
      finished painting.

      this time he's painted himself in the grand rococo-style -
      - as part of the holy family with doves and flowers and
      glowing rays from heaven. it's awful.

      getty and gibbs bring in a prisoner.       it's ford!

                                 bethlehem
                   good lord, what do we have here?

                                 ford
                   i'm a representative of the
                   restored united states --

      bethlehem backhands ford.

                                 gibbs
                   he's got a letter. says the
                   postman sent it.

                                 bethlehem
                   a letter?

      bethlehem tears open the letter and starts to read:

                                 bethlehem
                   'bethlehem. this letter is my
                   testimony to the fact that there
                   is no restored united states and
                   there is no postal service.'
                          (laugh; grim)
                   then who the hell have we been
                   fighting...?
                          (reads on)
                   'my carriers are returning home.
                   in exchange, i'm asking you to let
                   them be. the postman.'

      bethlehem eyes ford with undisguised contempt.

                                 bethlehem
                   he expects me to believe this?

                                 luke (o.s.)
                   it's true, sir. i was there. he
                   disbanded the carriers and rode
                   west.

      ford turns blazing eyes to luke -- he's been standing
      there all along.

                                 ford
                   traitor...

      it takes a moment for the news to sink in.      but it does.

                                                                  115.

                                    bethlehem
                   then i've won.     i've won.

      as the assembled holnists congratulate each other,
      bethlehem looks at luke.

                                 bethlehem
                   you were supposed to kill him.

                                 luke
                   i couldn't get close enough.
                          (re: ford)
                   this one's his second in command.

      bethlehem looks ford over.

                                 bethlehem
                   why doesn't that surprise me?

      ford stares back.    proud.     bethlehem looks to getty.

                                 bethlehem
                   bring out the one we found
                   yesterday. they can die together.

      a frightened carrier is brought up. he wears a purple
      uniform with cali sewn on the shoulder. neither we nor
      ford have seen him before. as a firing squad assembles,
      ford is shoved over with him.

                                    ford
                   who are you?

                                 cal carrier
                   name's clark. postal carrier of
                   the restored republic of
                   california. who are you?

      ford looks at him a second, can't help but laugh.      from
      gibbs; the shout of "ready!"

                                 ford
                   postmaster ford lincoln mercury.

                                    cali carrier
                   it's an honor.

      bethlehem watches as clark holds out his hand.      ford
      shakes it. "aim!"

                                 bethlehem
                   wait a minute... wait a minute!

                                                         (continued)

                                                            116.

                                   gibbs
                   sir?

                                  bethlehem
                   hold your fire! you don't know
                   each other?
                          (to himself, quiet
                           anger building)
                   this will never be over. it'll go
                   on except i'll be fighting a
                   goddamn ghost.

                                 gibbs
                   should we fire, sir?

                                   bethlehem
                   no goddamnit.

      bethlehem crumples the letter, tosses it.

                                 bethlehem
                   no, i won't fight a ghost. tabula
                   rasa, gentlemen. a clean slate.
                   i want all mail carriers hunted
                   down. i want the postman found.
                   i want him dealt with.
                          (to getty)
                   colonel, organize the scouts.
                          (to luke)
                   he rode west?
