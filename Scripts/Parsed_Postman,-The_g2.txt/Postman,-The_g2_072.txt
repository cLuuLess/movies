72   int. hunting shack - day                                         72

     the postman lies on a cot below the window.    he's
     conscious, but pale as a ghost.

     abby brings him a bowl of soup. very thin soup.       stirring
     it with a spoon, the postman smiles at abby.

                                the postman
                  thank you.

     she turns her back on him without a word.   the postman
     tries an exchange just the same.

                                                     (continued)

                                                               74.

72   continued:                                                      72

                                the postman
                  i don't think i ever had water
                  soup before. maybe next time we
                  could try it with a little sand?
                         (as she doesn't respond)
                  dirt? wood?
                         (as she doesn't smile)
                  a twig garnish?

     she goes about her business in silence.

                                the postman
                  you used to think i was funny.

                                abby
                  they killed michael.

                                   the postman
                  i'm sorry.

     he takes a spoonful of soup and she comes to him.

                                abby
                  how sorry are you?

                                the postman
                  what's that supposed to mean?

     her right hand flashes out, holds a knife up under his
     chin.

                                the postman
                  what's with you?

                                abby
                  you got the mark of eight on you.

     a long beat. finally, he swallows the soup in his mouth.
     the action presses his adam's apple against the blade.

                                the postman
                  a mark doesn't mean i'm a --

                                   abby
                  you're a liar.     i should've let
                  you die.

                                the postman
                  then, why didn't you?

     if she knows, she's not ready to say yet.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                75.

72   continued:    (2)                                                 72

                                the postman
                  you were with bethlehem. does
                  that make you one of them?

     abby considers this, the postman's gaze flickers down to
     the spoon he still holds in his hand. taking one last
     stab at a joke.

                                the postman
                         (re: the spoon)
                  don't make me use this.

     abby doesn't laugh.      but she does relent.   she steps away.
