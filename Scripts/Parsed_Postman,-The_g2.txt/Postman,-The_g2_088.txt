88   ext. fishing pool - day                                       88

     the postman kneels by the bank, sharpening a knife to
     clean the fish he's caught.

                                                   (continued)

                                                                   80.

88   continued:                                                          88

     then, he catches his reflection in the water.       tangled
     beard. matted hair. is that him?

     he suddenly starts sharpening the knife with renewed
     vigor. we get a sense he's not going to use it on the
     fish.


     hands

     plunge into the water, pull splashfuls up. we start on
     the postman's back, then arc around as he washes his face.
     he's just finished shaving off his beard with the hunting
     knife. he's nicked-up, but it's a definite improvement
     and he smiles in satisfaction -- until he sees --

     abby, reflected in the water.

                                   the postman
                  abby.

     the postman whips around to see her standing there.

                                 the postman
                  what is it?   what's wrong?    is it
                  the baby?

                                abby
                  the pass is clear. it's time to
                  go.

     behind her, he sees the cabin is on fire.       takes off
     running.
