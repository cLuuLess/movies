144   ext. plain - day                                                  144

      littered with rubble. the wood, brick, steel and concrete
      of what was once a small town. amazingly, one gray house
      still stands, miraculously untouched by whatever disaster
      visited this place.

      a wild-haired squatter steps out on the porch as abby and
      the postman ride by. he waves hello with a .45.

                             squatter
                howdy. welcome to sunny
                california.

                              the postman
                       (re: the town)
                what happened here?

                              squatter
                little accident. the ground
                started to shake big time and the
                hanford nuclear plant went...
                       (motions an explosion)
                ... 'poof.' destroyed everything
                for miles. but the sunsets are
                beautiful.

                              the postman
                you ever hear of a city called st.
                rose?

                              squatter
                friend, i've never heard of st.
                shit.

      the squatter laughs and laughs -- like it was the funniest
      thing in the world. the postman and abby exchange a look,
      continue on their way.

                              squatter
                hey, don't go! i got monopoly in
                the house! boardwalk, park place
                and the reading railroad!
