12   ext. holnist training camp (western idaho) - dawn                12

     a brutal reveille blasts the sleeping conscripts awake.

                                   idaho (o.s.)
                  let's move it.     everybody up and
                  at 'em.

     the postman comes to. he licks his dry, blood-caked lips.
     a sudden movement startles him -- it's woody, shoving him
     a battered cup of water. it's like he's been keeping
     watch. the postman is surprised, a little suspicious, and
     very grateful as he gulps the water down.

                                 the postman
                  thanks.   did i win?

     woody shakes his head "no."

                                the postman
                  i tried to tell him...

                                  woody
                  say it again.

                                  the postman
                  say what?

                                woody
                  the words you said in town. about
                  the wind blowing. and the rest...
                  say it again.

                                 the postman
                  'blow, wind. come wrack. at
                  least we'll die with the harness
                  off our back.'

                                woody
                  what's it mean?

                                the postman
                  live free or die.

     woody and the postman scramble to fall-to with the other
     conscripts. idaho surveys the ranks.

                                idaho
                  all right, girls. we're gonna
                  run. twenty miles. with packs.
                  you got three hours. everybody
                  makes it. or nobody eats.
