153   ext. bridge - close on pine box - morning                       153

      lowered from the top of the bridge. hands reach up to
      steady it and bring it gently to the ground. it's one of
      many.

      the postman and abby gasp as the mayor opens the lid to
      reveal: 20 well-oiled rifles and 15 pistols with ammo.
      the postman blinks over at the mayor.

                                 b.c. mayor
                   fact that we don't allow 'em
                   doesn't mean we don't have 'em.
                   we're not stupid, after all.

                                 the postman
                   i'm sorry i've brought this on
                   you.

                                 b.c. mayor
                   no need to be sorry. long as we
                   get our mail on time.

                                 ponytail (o.s.)
                   ready for duty, sir.

      the postman looks over to see ponytail, drew and chubby
      ride up. like him, they are back in uniform.

                                 the postman
                   the order was to burn all
                   uniforms.

      the carriers look away -- sheepish.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                  125.

                                 the postman
                   you know what to do then?

                                 ponytail
                   talk to the people. gather who's
                   willing. tell them it's
                   important. tell them we can make
                   a difference.

                                 chubby sentry
                   and tell 'em we're going to kick
                   ass.

                                 the postman
                   yeah, tell them that, too.
