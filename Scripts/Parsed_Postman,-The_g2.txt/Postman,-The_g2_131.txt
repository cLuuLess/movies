131   ext. pine view - day                                              131

      bethlehem looks the line-up over. the firing squad stands
      at the ready. bethlehem looks to the trees -- feeling
      something.

                                 bethlehem
                          (to getty)
                   he's out there somewhere.
                   watching. i can feel it.

      briscoe follows his gaze. he doesn't see anything, but
      maybe gets the same feeling. bethlehem looks to briscoe.

                                 bethlehem
                   you feel it too, don't you?
                   didn't have to end like this,
                   sheriff. he knew where i'd be if
                   he wanted to face me like a man.
                   instead, he's hiding like a
                   rabbit. so much for your postman.

                                    gibbs
                   ready!    aim!

      rifles are raised. briscoe seems to grow as he throws his
      shoulders back and shouts...

                                 briscoe
                   ride, postman! ride! you hear
                   me? i said ride!
