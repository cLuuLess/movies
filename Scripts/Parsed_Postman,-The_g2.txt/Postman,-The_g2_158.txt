158   ext. field - day                                                 158

      captured by a holnist cavalry patrol, old george and four
      other carriers are lined up, hands bound before them.
      holnist soldiers force them to their knees as gibbs
      organizes an impromptu firing squad.

                                                        (continued)

                                                                128.

      old george looks down the line.    the carriers are about to
      break down.

                                 old george
                   steady, boys, steady.

      and as gibbs steps up, all hope is gone.

                                 gibbs
                   in accordance with law eight...

                                 old george
                   get on with it, you floppy-eared
                   sonuvabitch!

      we see the faces of the young carriers. defeated, bitter.
      but there's a sudden spark in old george's eyes. he
      starts to rise.

      the soldiers pick up their guns and that's when they see
      the postman.


      the postman

      riding over the crest. galloping toward them. behind
      him, forty new mail carriers. all riding like mad. one
      of them carries the flag of the restored united states.

      gibbs and his men run for their horses. shots are fired.
      four holnists go down. the rest gallop away.

      the postman and his carriers meet.
