      abby, in bed, holding her new baby in her arms. she's
      reading a letter. what she reads makes her smile. she
      puts the letter down and cuddles her baby.

                                 abby
                   your daddy wrote to tell you that
                   he'll be here as soon as he can.
                   and that he loves you very much.

      abby looks up to see the postman standing at her door.
      she looks at him, smiling with tears in her eyes.

                                                        (continued)

                                                                  137.

                                  the postman
                   mail's slow.   i'll have to see
                   about that.

      abby smiles down at the child in her arms.

                                    abby
                   your daughter.     her name is hope.

      the postman takes the tiny child in his arms.

                                 woman (v.o.)
                   and so my father returned home
                   after the holnists were
                   defeated...
