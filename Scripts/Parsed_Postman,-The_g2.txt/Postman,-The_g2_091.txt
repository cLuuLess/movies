91   ext. r.v. park - day                                           91

     oregon's main post office. a silver airstream, fifty
     mobile homes and rusty winnebagos resting on flat tires.
     flying from a pole: the flag of the restored united
     states. a young recruit is ringing a bell on the top of a
     winnebago.

     ford walks along an rv boulevard. he's joined by two
     young carriers, red and chubby (the sentry from benning).
     all wear hip, personalized variations of the official
     uniform.

                                chubby
                  you got another letter?

                                                      (continued)

                                                              84.

     they come around the corner to where seven young recruits
     wait. they're joined by another twenty carriers.

                                   ford
                  more recruits?

                                red
                  seven of them. they're coming
                  from everywhere.

     ford looks them over in satisfaction.

                                chubby
                  did you get a letter or didn't
                  you?

     ford smiles, reaches into his pocket. he pulls out a
     creased sheet of paper. chubby grins.

                                ford
                  gather 'round, everybody. got
                  another letter here. came in last
                  night.

     buzzing with excitement, the carriers gather around ford.


     south end of boulevard

     ponytail leads abby and the postman. they come up in the
     back of the crowd. flanked by red and chubby, ford stands
     on the hood of a car, letter in hand. the postman taps a
     clueless young carrier on the back.

                                the postman
                  what's all this?

                                young carrier
                  postman sent ford another letter.
                  he's gonna read it.

                                ford
                         (reading)
                  'hello, all postal carriers.'

                                  carriers
                           (a ritual)
                  hello!

                                                      (continued)

                                                                 85.

                                ford
                  i'm here in minneapolis with
                  president starkey, but my thoughts
                  are with you. remember, nothing
                  worth doing can be done overnight.
                  keep your chins up and do your
                  best not to get shot. signed, the
                  postman.

     a buzz goes through the crowd.       ponytail looks over.

                                ponytail
                  his letters are always kind of
                  short.

     abby and the postman exchange a look.

                                ford
                         (looks up)
                  hold on now. there's a p.s...
                  anybody know what p.s. stands for?

     the postman raises his hand. ford looks his way. his
     mouth drops as he realizes. in silence, he walks over to
     the postman. they embrace and all the weight ford's been
     carrying on his young shoulders suddenly falls to the
     postman. the kid nearly collapses.

                                 chubby
                  holy shit...

                                red
                  that would be h.s., chubby.

                                chubby
                  i seen him once when i lived in
                  benning. it's the postman!

     word goes through the crowd like a wave.

     the postman takes the letter, reads.

                                 the postman
                  p.s.   ford knows what to do.

     ford shrugs sheepishly.

                                ford
                  guess you want to talk about this?

     the postman takes ford by the elbow. they disappear into
     the tent. the carriers just staring after them,
     awestruck.

                                                        (continued)

                                 ponytail
                  i found him!   i found him!

     they clamor around her.
