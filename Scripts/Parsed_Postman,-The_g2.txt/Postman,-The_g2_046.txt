46   ext. well (pine view) - day                                    46

     abby's washing clothes with a tub and washboard. waging
     war on dirt. michael leans against a tree, watches abby
     at work until she notices him. she wipes the sweat from
     her brow, tries not to smile.

                                abby
                  what are you looking at?

                                  michael
                  everything.

     he steps over and they're in each other's arms. this is
     love. but as michael kisses her, we hear a familiar
     alarm:

                                  sentry
                  holnists!    holnists are coming!
