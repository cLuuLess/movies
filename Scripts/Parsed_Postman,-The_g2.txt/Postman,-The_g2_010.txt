10   ext. village square (idaho) - day                            10

     a patch of mud. in the center of the square fifty
     townspeople stand before a plank stage where the postman
     wraps up a performance of macbeth. he plays it with a
     mis-remembered gusto the people enjoy. children
     especially are enamored. a heavily-muscled man, woody,
     lingers on the fringe of the crowd -- watching the postman
     with inscrutable intensity.

                             the postman
               they said, 'fear not, macbeth,
               'til birnam wood comes to
               dunsinane'!

     he looks off stage for someone, but no one appears.

                             the postman
               i said, birnam wood comes to
               dunsinane!

     bill trots on-stage. covered with twigs, bill is birnam
     wood. he brays lustily. the audience laughs in delight.
     the children clap. only woody seems unaffected.

                                                    (continued)

                                                              12.

10   continued:                                                     10

     the postman grabs two wooden swords -- he knows it's going
     well.

                                the postman
                  arm, arm yourselves! if the
                  witch's words are true, there'll
                  be no running or hiding here!

     shaking off the twigs, bill takes one of the swords in his
     mouth. the two of them dash back and forth pretending to
     fight off an imaginary attack. finally, the postman looks
     out at the audience, remembers the words the best he can.

                                the postman
                  tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the
                  day after that. out brief candle!
                  life's but a walking shadow, a
                  poor player that struts his hour
                  upon the stage and is heard no
                  more. it's a tale told by a
                  moron. full of sound and fury,
                  signifying nothing.
                         (waves sword)
                  but blow, wind! come wrack! at
                  least we'll die with the harness
                  off our back!

     the audience erupts in applause. but woody stands still
     as stone. the postman takes a bow. even bill does a
     cross-legged dip. knowing when to quit, he steps off the
     stage to many hearty handshakes.

     woody watches his every move. mrs. thompson, one of the
     town's leaders, steps up. she's accompanied by crotchety
     old curmudgeon larry.

                                mrs. thompson
                  the children have never heard
                  shakespeare before.

                                the postman
                         (grinning)
                  they still haven't.

     the curmudgeon is still clapping.

                                 the postman
                  thanks.   you're very nice.

                                curmudgeon larry
                  i'm clapping because you stink.

                                                      (continued)

                                                               13.

10   continued:    (2)                                               10

                                the postman
                  i don't think you understand how
                  it works.

                                curmudgeon larry
                  when i was young, i tried to be an
                  actor. i was awful. but now i
                  won't die thinking i was the worst
                  one.

                                the postman
                  i'm glad i could help.

                                mrs. thompson
                  larry, stop it.
                         (to the postman)
                  you were very good.

                                the postman
                  good enough to get something to
                  eat?

     before she can answer, a sentry cries...

                                 sentry
                  holnists!   holnists are coming!

     all eyes look down the road leading into town. a raiding
     party of holnist cavalry are on their way in. mrs.
     thompson sees the postman's concern.

                               mrs. thompson
                  it's okay. we give them food and
                  supplies. all the towns do.

                                man #1
                  they hardly kill anyone lately.
                  just take a woman sometimes.

                                the postman
                  well, i'd just as soon not give
                  them anything of mine. let's find
                  the back door, bill.

     the postman gathers his stuff, slings packs onto bill.

     the forty holnists in orange and black uniforms ride in.
     they're armed with mostly pistols and rifles. some carry
     bows, knives, spear guns and swords. on their bare
     shoulders, branded into the flesh -- the number "8."

                                                       (continued)

                                                              14.

10   continued:    (3)                                              10

     out front, always leading by example is, general
     bethlehem. tough, smart, merciless with style. commander
     of the united clans of holn. nothing escapes his eye.

     a little behind him is the mysteriously silent colonel
     getty, second in command.

     the postman, finished packing, begins to move from
     building to building -- careful not to attract any
     attention.

                                bethlehem (o.s.)
                  what are you doing there?

     the postman freezes, turns, is relieved to find
     bethlehem's not talking to him at all. the general looks
     down from his horse at children playing an impromptu game
     of "birnam wood."

     the children stop, stare at their feet. bethlehem affects
     a "kindly" smile to accompany his gentler tone.

                                bethlehem
                  i said, what are you doing?

     meantime, the postman continues his surreptitious escape.
     the mayor hurries forward to greet bethlehem.

                                mayor
                  it's just a game, general
                  bethlehem. something they saw in
                  a play. no harm in it.

                                bethlehem
                  a play?
                         (to kids)
                  show me. it's all right,
                  children, show me.

     one brave boy finds his voice, barely.

                                brave boy
                  arm, arm yourselves! no running
                  from the witches!

                                bethlehem
                         (surprised)
                  shakespeare, is it? well, i'm
                  sorry i missed it.

                                                     (continued)

                                                               15.

10   continued:    (4)                                               10

                                mayor
                  you should know, sir, we haven't
                  nearly stocked the game we thought
                  we would.

                                 bethlehem
                  really?   but you had time for a
                  play?

     head down, the postman makes for "the back way." but it's
     guarded by three daunting holnist soldiers. no getting by
     them. the postman does a quick 180, goes back the way he
     came.

     bethlehem looks at the frightened townsfolk.

                                bethlehem
                  i'm taking three conscripts from
                  each town. they will have the
                  honor of serving in the holnist
                  army until such time as i see fit.
                         (to mayor)
                  three men. you suppose you could
                  do that?

     the mayor nods in acquiescence. bethlehem looks to a
     holnist officer. the officer, idaho, steps up and
     addresses the town.

                                idaho
                  all men between 15 and 50 and of
                  suitable ethnic foundation are
                  required to show themselves now.

     the holnist soldiers fan out, prodding any likely or
     unwilling candidates forward.

     the postman is now walking behind bethlehem. some of the
     townspeople cast him a furtive glance as he makes his way
     toward the open courtyard and, ultimately, the gate out of
     town.

     three conscripts are hustled before bethlehem. he looks
     over the first -- woody. smells him. not much of a
     decision here.

                                 bethlehem
                  acceptable.

                                 idaho
                  sir?

                                bethlehem
                  acceptable, captain!

                                                       (continued)

                                                               16.

10   continued:    (5)                                                10

     the second -- a thin teenager. bethlehem feels his arm,
     turns his head from side to side.

                                bethlehem
                  you'll need to put some meat on,
                  but i like an impressionable mind.
                  acceptable.

     the third -- an innocuous man. or so we think. bethlehem
     stares hard at his olive skin, traces a finger over the
     bump on the man's nose.

                                 bethlehem
                  mongoloid.   unacceptable.

     soldiers shove the man back into the crowd. the brave boy
     that was playing birnam wood allows himself a tiny smile
     when he sees that the postman might make it.

                                bethlehem
                  i want pure blood. someone
                  like...

     bethlehem notes the boy, turns to see the object of his
     attention, and spots the postman leaving out the front
     gate.

                                   bethlehem
                  that man.

     idaho and another soldier are on it. the postman tries to
     back away as the two dismount and come toward him.

                                the postman
                  you don't understand...

     but idaho and the soldier aren't programmed for
     explanations -- they grab him.

                                idaho
                  you were required to show
                  yourself.

                                the postman
                  but, i'm not with these people.
                  i'm just passing through. i --

     idaho silences him with a rifle butt to the head.
     everything falls out of focus

                                   idaho (o.s.)
                  take the mule.

                                                       dissolve to:

                                                            17.
