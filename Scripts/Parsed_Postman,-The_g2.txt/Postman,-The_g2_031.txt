31   int. abandoned hotel - room 7 - night                         31

     a freestanding tub has been set up, water "bucketed" in.
     the postman luxuriates in his first hot bath in years and
     sings a familiar tune to himself.

                               the postman
                  'stop. oh, yes, wait a minute,
                  mr. postman. waaa-ait, mr.
                  postman...'
