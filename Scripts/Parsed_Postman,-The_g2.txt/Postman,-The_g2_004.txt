4   ext. highway travel stop (idaho) - day                        4

    a 76 station and the remains of a howard johnson's.
    alert, carbine in hand, the postman leads in the mule.
    rusting cars sag on flattened tires. there's a stripped
    fire engine, its cracked hoses leading to the hojo
    foundation which bristles with burned timbers.

    bill stops to drink out of a stream.   the postman swats at
    him with his hat.

                            the postman
              damnit, bill, you know i need to
              check it first!

    bill hangs his head. the postman digs through his pack.
    he removes an old tupperware container and replaces its
    contents -- a tiny sheaf of litmus papers and several
    small bottles -- with stream water. he adds a few drops
    from each bottle. swirls it around. then dips a tiny
    strip of paper into the water. the paper turns a vivid
    purple. the postman is dubious.

                            the postman
              better than turpentine.
                     (touches some
                      to his lips)
              tastes about the same. your call,
              bill.

    bill drinks.

                            the postman
              you ain't picky, bill. i like
              that about you.

    the postman takes his carbine and a burlap sack and
    crosses to the 76 station. an old extension ladder on the
    ground. the pole holding up the 76 ball has a 30-degree
    bend in it, like someone once tried to pull it over.
    beyond the 76 ball, the sun sets -- but we here in the
    20th century have never seen such a wild riot of color
    before.

    the postman tries the station door. locked. smiling
    ironically, he steps in through the blown-out window.
