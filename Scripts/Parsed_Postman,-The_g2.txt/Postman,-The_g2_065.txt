65   ext. woodland road - day                                           65

     abby is concerned as the horse slows to a trot.

                                abby
                  we can't stop now. they'll be
                  coming after us.

     the postman's head lolls forward. she feels something on
     her hand, pulls it back smeared with blood. the postman's
     shot in the belly.

     the horse is failing.       near death.

     we hear the sound of pursuing cavalry. abby urges the
     horse off the road. when the thicket grows too dense,
     abby jumps down. she catches the postman as he slides
     off, easing him to the ground.

                                   the postman
                            (disoriented)
                  abby...

     abby shushes him. she pulls on the horse's bridle to
     force him farther along. but it's no good, the wounded
     horse goes down on its knees.

     and five riders thunder past.       fooled.   all but the sixth,
     who pulls up to listen.

     in the deep b.g., flames lick at the billowing black
     smoke. the town is burning.

     the horse whinnies: in its death throes.        abby panics,
     tries to quiet the horse.

                                                         (continued)

                                                             72.

65   continued:                                                    65

     the sixth soldier has heard the suffering horse. he draws
     his rifle from the saddle boot and starts into the
     thicket.


     on abby and postman

     the postman lies unconscious on the ground. abby sits
     beside him, rifle in hand. the sixth soldier appears.

                                  abby
                  don't move.

     he hesitates at first. then dismounts and moves toward
     her. abby cocks the rifle.

                                sixth soldier
                  if you'd had a bullet, you'd a
                  used it by now.

     moving closer still, he doesn't see the branch pulled back
     in the postman's hand until it snaps hard into his face.

     he stumbles back.

                                  abby
                  you're right.

     abby dashes out, rifle in hand. she swings for the
     bleachers. the butt catches the side of the sixth
     soldier's head. he falls hard.

     the postman's eyes flutter. dazed, he watches as abby
     pilfers through the soldier's gear. she takes everything
     of value: a knife, bullets, a canteen. his eyes flutter
     closed.
