160   ext. holnist camp - day                                          160

      the army has gathered.    three hundred strong.

      bethlehem and getty stand outside the command tent,
      listening to a winded, frightened gibbs. we follow
      bethlehem's eyes over gibbs' shoulders to the horizon,
      where he sees: the postman and his army of two hundred
      carriers cresting a distant rise.

                                                        (continued)

                                                              129.

160   continued:                                                     160

                                 gibbs (o.s.)
                   ... we were outnumbered, sir.

                                 bethlehem
                   how many?

                                 gibbs
                   a least a hundred. with guns.

                                 bethlehem
                          (feigning shock)
                   with guns? are you sure?

                                 gibbs
                   yes, sir...

                                 bethlehem
                   looks more like two hundred to
                   me...

      he steps away to get a better vantage point of the
      approaching army. he reaches out -- getty hands him a
      pair of binoculars.

                                 bethlehem
                          (donning a pair of
                           leather gloves)
                   only thing worse than a coward is
                   one who can't count. lieutenant,
                   do yourself a favor. die well in
                   this battle. in my army a
                   deserter's life is a brief and
                   unpleasant one.

      bethlehem watches the postman through the binoculars -- a
      hint of a smile on his face.

                                 bethlehem
                          (to himself)
                   at last, someone with courage
                   enough to bring the fight to me.

      a holnist soldier stands by with bethlehem's horse.   the
      general mounts -- the model of military calm and
      precision. getty reins up beside him.

                                 bethlehem
                   reckoning, gentlemen. this is the
                   day i've dreamed of.
