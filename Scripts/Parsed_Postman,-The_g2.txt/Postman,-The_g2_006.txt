6   ext. 76 station - night                                         6

    embers of a campfire glow.    the postman is asleep, the
    carbine in reach.

    bill brays and nervously stamps his hooves. the postman
    reaches for the carbine only to find the barrel of a
    shotgun pointed in his face.

    three bandits! hard-eyed and ugly. one, barely 20, is
    mostly just ugly. the postman looks down the barrels of a
    shotgun, a rifle and a revolver. the lead bandit kicks
    the carbine out of reach.

                               the postman
                 i'm just passing through. i don't
                 mean anyone any harm.
                        (re: stream)
                 water's good.

    the lead bandit pokes at the postman's shoulder with the
    muzzle of his rifle. the postman knows why.

                               the postman
                 i'm not a holnist.

    the lead bandit pokes again. harder. the postman opens
    his shirt, reveals his bare left shoulder.

                               the postman
                 okay?

    they just stare at him, none saying a word.      creepy.

                               the postman
                 i'm headed for a town called st.
                 rose. somewhere west of portland.

                                                      (continued)

                                                             7.

                               lead bandit
                 portland's under twenty feet of
                 water.

                               the postman
                 well, i heard different.

                               lead bandit
                 you mouthin' me?

                               the postman
                 no, it's just that it's hard to
                 get good information.

    the third bandit, a hulking brute, has been quiet.

                               hulking bandit
                 he is mouthin' you; i say we kill
                 him.

                               lead bandit
                 don't be in such a rush, martin.
                        (back to
                         the postman)
                 now i see a pack mule over there,
                 but i don't see no packs.

                               the postman
                 this is all i got.

                               lead bandit
                 oh... kill him, martin.

    the hulking bandit, raises his shotgun. the butt end.
    he's going to bludgeon the postman to death.

                                the postman
                         (pointing)
                 okay!   my stuff's up there!

    the 76 ball is twenty feet above the ground. in the gloom
    you can just see a hole has been punched through the side.

                               bandit #20
                 what do you got in there?

    the lead bandit swats bandit #20 upside the head.

                               lead bandit
                 shut up.
                        (to postman)
                 what do you got in there?

                                                     (continued)

                                                               8.

                                the postman
                 dried peas.   beef jerky.
                 cigarettes.

                                all three bandits
                 cigarettes!

                                the postman
                 sure.   there's the ladder.

                               bandit #20
                 maybe he's got it booby-trapped.

    the lead bandit is about to smack bandit #20 again -- then
    he sees the logic out of it. the postman shakes his head,
    but isn't that convincing.

                               lead bandit
                 you go up and get it.

                                                     cut to:
