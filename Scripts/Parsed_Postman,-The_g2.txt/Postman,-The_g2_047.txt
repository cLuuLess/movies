47   ext. palisade gates (pine view) - day                          47

     led by bethlehem and getty, the soldiers ride in.
     something about the citizens disturbs bethlehem.

                                bethlehem
                  they don't usually look at me.

                                                      (continued)

                                                                59.

     bethlehem reins in across from the post office.     someone
     has hung a tattered old american flag.

                                bethlehem
                  who's responsible for that?!

     no one answers.     all heads are down now.
