110   int. command tent (southern oregon) - night                       110

      by lantern, bethlehem and getty watch as gibbs sorts
      through the contents of the confiscated mailbag.

                                 gibbs
                   births and deaths, the weather,
                   gossip. there's nothing here.

                                 bethlehem
                   nothing? everything is here.    am
                   i the only one who sees that?
                          (to gibbs)
                   get out!

      gibbs hurries away, leaving bethlehem and getty alone.

                                 bethlehem
                   give the people back their hope
                   and their dreams won't be far
                   behind.

      bethlehem sees getty waiting.

                                 bethlehem
                   what is it, getty?

      getty hands bethlehem a sheet of paper -- something gibbs
      missed. it's a propaganda sheet featuring a caricature of
      the postman leading a few carriers against bethlehem and
      his army -- represented as hitler and the nazis. the
      caption underneath reads: "ride against the holnist
      tide!"

                                                                96.

                                 bethlehem
                          (crumpling the paper)
                   a military man, especially a
                   commander, should keep a journal.
                   after he's gone, it's the only
                   real defense against the slander
                   that arises.
