122   ext. rv camp - day                                           122

      ford is swearing in four new recruits.


      on ford and recruits

      as they repeat after him we realize they've changed the
      oath a bit.

                              ford/recruits
                neither snow, nor heat, nor gloom
                of night. through bandit's hell,
                through fire fight. through flood
                and plague we cannot fail. no
                holnist trash will stop the mail.


      the postman

      riding his weary mount into town, saddlebags bulging with
      mail. he pauses by the new recruits long enough to hear
      the words they're saying.

      as he dismounts, a fresh-faced carrier takes the bridle.
      the postman's well past the point of fatigue. he's living
      on pure adrenaline.

                              the postman
                get this mail sorted. bring me a
                fresh horse. something to eat.

      as fresh-face starts away, the postman calls after him.

                              the postman
                and all the mail going south!

      the postman watches as ford shakes the hands of the new
      recruits.

      the postman reaches for his canteen. empty. damn. a tin
      cup filled with water appears from nowhere. abby. the
      postman takes it, too tired to acknowledge the gesture.

                              the postman
                they changed the oath.

                                                    (continued)

                                                                101.

122   continued:                                                       122

                                  abby
                   ford's idea.

                                 the postman
                   figures.
                          (scoffs)
                   they don't think to ask who
                   they're replacing. or why.

      he drains the cup and hands it back to her.      just then,
      one of the new recruits, luke, steps over.

                                 luke
                   sir? it'd be an honor if i could
                   shake your hand.

      a farmboy-type, luke looks like a younger version of
      woody. the postman sees this, is lost in reverie. luke
      still holds his hand out.

                                  luke
                   sir?

                                 the postman
                   you look like... do i know you?

                                  luke
                   no, sir.

                                 the postman
                   well, good luck to you.

      nodding in awe, luke heads off.

                                  the postman
                   nice kid.   probably be dead in a
                   week.

                                 abby
                          (ignores it)
                   you're exhausted. you need rest.
                   there's food in the trailer --

      ponytail rides by; two sacks of mail hang from her saddle
      pommel. the postman grabs her horse's halter, stops her.

                                 the postman
                   where are you going?

                                 ponytail
                   route twenty-two. i'm already an
                   hour late.

                                                        (continued)

                                                               102.

122   continued:    (2)                                               122

                                 the postman
                   you're grounded. get off the
                   horse. you know the rule.

                                 ponytail
                   what rule?

                                 the postman
                   twenty-two's too far south.

                                 ponytail
                   but they're waiting on their mail
                   down there.

                                 the postman
                   get off the goddamn horse.

      shocked, she does. at the same time, fresh-face comes up
      leading a second horse laden with mail.

                                  the postman
                          (re: ponytail's
                           horse)
                   tie him off to this one.

      fresh-face goes about tying the second horse to the first.

                                 abby
                   you can't keep doing this.

                                 the postman
                   doing what?

                                  abby
                   riding all the routes.   you're not
                   saving anyone.

      the postman climbs on ponytail's horse, looks at abby.

                                 the postman
                   did i ever tell you how i got to
                   be a postman, abby?
                          (doesn't give
                           her time to answer)
                   i don't know if you'd laugh or
                   cry.

      the postman digs in his heels. the horse gallops away,
      the second one following behind.

                                                               103.
