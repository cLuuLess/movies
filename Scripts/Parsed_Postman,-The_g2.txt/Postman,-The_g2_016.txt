16   int. general bethlehem's tent - day                             16

     bethlehem stands before a painter's easel, palette in
     hand. he's got a mirror set up so he can see his
     reflection. he's doing a self-portrait in the tradition
     of the great dutch masters -- but it's a dismal failure.

     he continues painting even as idaho leads the postman in.
     idaho salutes, steps back. for a moment, the postman
     doesn't quite know what to do.

                                 bethlehem
                         (re: the book and
                          binoculars on the
                          table)
                  they're yours. a solitary man,
                  aren't you? binoculars. to watch
                  life from a distance. and
                  shakespeare. to read about it
                  instead of living it.

     bethlehem wants an answer.    the postman clears his throat.

                                the postman
                  no offense, general, but you seem
                  to have read some shakespeare
                  yourself.

                                bethlehem
                  if he wishes to rise above mere
                  thuggery, a military commandeer
                  must be classically educated.
                  philosophy, history. even a sense
                  of the dramatic.
                         (a beat)
                  do you know what i did before the
                  war? do you think i was in the
                  army? i sold copying machines. i
                  was a salesman. the talent to
                  lead men and devise and execute a
                  battle plan were locked away
                  inside me.

     he picks up finding a way to win by nathan holn.     a 20-
     year-old self-help book.

                                bethlehem
                  if nathan holn hadn't come along,
                  i'd still be selling copying
                  machines. can you imagine the
                  wasted life? can you imagine the
                  magnitude of it? but war... war
                  gives men like me a chance.

     he turns to a dog-eared page in the book.

                                 bethlehem
                  here... 'the prize is often left
                  unclaimed. have the courage to
                  grasp it. for fortune always
                  favors the bold.'
                         (moved)
                  it always inspires me.
                         (beat)
                  i have a design for the future. a
                  master plan. i'll need able
                  officers to carry it out. you
                  have the intelligence. if your
                  heart matches, you'll go far.
                         (a beat)
                  we'll talk more in the weeks to
                  come. dismissed.

     the postman leaves.     idaho stands at the ready.

                                bethlehem
                  issue the binoculars to a scout.

                                idaho
                  and the book, sir?

                                 bethlehem
                  burn it.

     idaho leaves. bethlehem goes back to his painting. he
     considers himself in the mirror. after a long stare-down,
     he shouts:

                                 bethlehem
                  quit moving.
