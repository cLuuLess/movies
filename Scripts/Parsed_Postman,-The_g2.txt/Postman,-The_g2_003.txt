3   ext. 4-lane (idaho) - billboard - day                        3

    bill tugs up weeds as the postman is climbing up a ladder
    on a highway that razor cuts the plains to the horizon.

    above, the postman sands atop a billboard catwalk. he
    references a tattered road atlas, scans the horizon
    through binoculars with one broken lens. he pauses at a
    union 76 ball just visible above the tree line.

                                                            4.
