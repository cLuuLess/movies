39   int. abandoned hotel - room 7 - night                          39

     the postman arrives home. he pushes open the door,
     knocking over a stack of letters that have been shoved
     under the door. he gathers them up, flips through them.
     they're written on scraps, the backs of pictures, on
     handkerchiefs and homemade paper. they aren't old.

                                                      (continued)

                                                                53.

39   continued:                                                       39

     they're brand new.      shaking his head, he closes the door.

     the postman has no sooner done so when there's a knock on
     the window. he looks over at a woman. she shrugs,
     smiles, holds up a letter. the postman sighs; he's
     trapped in here.
