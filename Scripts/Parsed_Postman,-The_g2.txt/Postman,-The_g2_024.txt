24   ext. clearing - woods - day                                    24

     clothes in tatters, his lungs ready to burst, the postman
     stops. he takes cover as the two soldiers run past.

     breathing hard, the postman steps out, starts across the
     clearing. he's halfway when bandit #20 steps out from the
     trees. they look at each other for a moment.

                                the postman
                  just let me go. i don't want to
                  be part of your army.

                                                     (continued)

                                                             33.

     bandit #20 hesitates for a moment, then breaks into a
     grin.

                                 bandit #20
                  my army.   i like the sound of
                  that.

     the postman gestures with his knife.

                                  the postman
                  don't --

                                 bandit #20
                  i got him!   over --

     the postman lunges, digs into bandit #20's gut.   he blinks
     in surprise, then sags to the ground.

     the postman takes a step back. a shadow falls over him.
     it's woody. staring down at the postman. they can hear
     others approaching from the river.

                                woody
                  they sent me to kill you.

                                  the postman
                  come with me.

     at that moment, idaho and the second soldier come into the
     clearing. idaho grins, relaxes his grip on his gun when
     he sees the mismatch between woody and the postman.

                                 idaho
                  good, boy.   get him.

                                woody
                  it's you or me.

                                  the postman
                  i know.

                                  idaho
                  finish it.

     woody circles the postman, until he's facing idaho and the
     soldier. woody takes a long look at the postman, smiles.

                                woody
                  no harness on my back.

     as the postman realizes what he's doing, woody flips his
     knife through the air and into the soldier's throat.

                                                   (continued)

                                                             34.

24   continued:    (2)                                             24

     as woody rushes him, idaho raises his gun.

     idaho pumps two rounds into woody, but the big man keeps
     coming. the third round finds his heart, puts woody down.
     dead. but not before he lands on top of idaho.

     as idaho struggles to get out from under woody's massive
     frame, the postman heads for the trees.


     covered in woody's blood, idaho fires a round as the
     postman disappears into the woods. idaho starts after
     him.


     idaho

     tracking. he sees a dribble of fresh blood.   he touches
     it with his fingers and smiles.

     he cocks his head at movement to his left. smiling,
     hefting his pistol, idaho moves in. more shuffling.   just
     ahead. he's got him now.

                                idaho
                  you want your st. rose?

     there's a rustle of brush just before a roar splits the
     air. idaho doesn't even have time to scream as the lion
     pounces down on top of him.
