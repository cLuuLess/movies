9    ext. overlook hill (idaho) - day                             9

     the postman sits on a rock, holding bill's halter so the
     mule must face him. they are in the midst of an argument.

                             the postman
               it's true, we haven't done this in
               a while, but it's like riding a
               bicycle. now, open your mouth.

     the postman pries his mouth open. taking a toothbrush, he
     tends to bill's teeth, then gives him an appraising look.
     bill brays.

                             the postman
               i know the rule. it's my rule!
               avoid civilization at all costs.
               but we gotta eat, don't we?
                      (as bill brays again)
               what are you so worried about,
               bill? all you gotta do is stand
               there. i'm the one with all the
               lines.

     the postman leads the mule down the hill toward the town
     far below. making his case all the while -- even as bill
     brays in protest.
