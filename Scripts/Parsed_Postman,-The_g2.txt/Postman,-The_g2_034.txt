34   ext. street (pine view) - night                                 34

     ford leads the way as they leave the motel behind. the
     postman looks good in his uniform. they cross a parking
     lot where five partly-stripped cars have been sitting for
     years. there's a potted plant outside the driver's door
     of one.

                                ford
                  i live in that car. a 2003
                  pontiac sinatra. with a nine-
                  banger and a q-eight.

                                the postman
                  v-eight. eight cylinders.   that
                  means an eight-banger.

                                ford
                         (in awe of him)
                  were they fast?

                                ford
                  a buck seventy-five on a strip.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                  43.

                                ford
                  a buck seventy-five? i thought
                  maybe i could fix some of them up.
                  it's nothing compared to what you
                  do.

     this is the last thing he expected to hear out of this
     kid's mouth. a moment, then...

                                the postman
                  the important thing to remember
                  about cars is, you can't eat 'em.

     ahead, people are gathered inside an old foster's freeze.
