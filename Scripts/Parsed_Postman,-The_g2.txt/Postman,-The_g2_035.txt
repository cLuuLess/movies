35   int. foster's freeze (pine view) - night                           35

     the townspeople fill the booths, line the walls. they
     talk excitedly amongst themselves, break into spontaneous
     applause as ford and the postman enter.

     the postman is surprised, uncomfortable at this display.
     but then he sees that a banquet has been laid out on the
     counter. the centerpiece is a huge vat of steaming stew.

     the people clear a path for him.

                                man #1
                  tell us about the government!

                                woman #1
                  yes, tell us everything!

     startled, the postman doesn't quite know what to say.
     they seat him at a table -- but the food looks miles away.

                                man #2
                  is there a president?

                                the postman
                  yeah.

                                woman #2
                  what's his name?

                                the postman
                  you know, i'm pretty hungry.

     but these people won't be denied.       finally...

                                                          (continued)

                                                                44.

35   continued:                                                       35

                                the postman
                  his name is, uh... richard
                  starkey. from maine. he has a
                  saying. 'things are getting
                  better, getting better all the
                  time.'

     there's warm applause at that.    several people try the
     expression out on each other.

                                man #3
                  he a democrat or a republican?

                                the postman
                  parties are over with. the
                  individual is what counts. you
                  vote for the best man.

     ellen sets a steaming bowl of stew in front of the
     postman. famished, he digs in.

                                man #4
                  what about europe? any word?

     the postman tries to speak through a mouthful of food.

                                the postman
                  lady di's in charge. sixty years
                  old and she still kicks ass.

                                woman #3
                  is nathan holn still alive?

                                the postman
                         (smiles at irony)
                  he died. skin cancer.

     that's sure good news to everyone.       but...

                                woman #4
                  and the holnists? they're still
                  out there. what's the government
                  going to do about them?

     the postman looks at the desperate faces -- he'd rather
     get back to his meal -- but this may be the most important
     question of all. he doesn't want to lie.

                                the postman
                  the government's just getting
                  started. you're on your own for
                  at least eighteen months.

                                                       (continued)

                                                              45.

                                man #5
                  what about the marines corp?

     a clamor of holnist questions.

                                ellen
                  be quiet, everyone! can't we just
                  let this man eat?

     the people nod and the postman finally gets to eat. he
     catches sight of briscoe watching him from the door.
     after a moment, briscoe leaves.
