52   ext. burnt-out post office - night                            52

     before the smoking ruins, ford pulls on a blue shirt, his
     homemade postal flag on the shoulder. as briscoe steps
     up, ford shows him a bundle of singed, but intact letters.

                             ford
               i managed to save these.

                             briscoe
                      (re: shirt)
               take that thing off, johnny.    you
               want to die, too?

     ford shoves the letters in a makeshift bag, then climbs
     onto his waiting pony.

                             ford
               i'm headed south. with the mail.

                             briscoe
                      (grabs harness)
               don't be a damn fool.

                             ford
               what kind should i be?... haw!

     ford digs his heels into the pony and is off in a flash
     doing damn near a buck seventy-five.
