33   int. abandoned hotel - room 7 - night                         33

     the postman looks up at a knock. ford steps in. like
     most kids, he needs a hero. holding up the uniform, he
     just found one.

                                ford
                         (beaming)
                  cleaned and pressed, sir.

                                                     (continued)

                                                               42.

33   continued:                                                      33

                                the postman
                  thanks. didn't somebody say
                  something about dinner?

                                ford
                  yeah, i'm supposed to take you to
                  foster's.
                         (extending a hand)
                  my name's ford. ford lincoln
                  mercury.

     the postman just nods, hoisting himself out of the tub and
     hurriedly wrapping a towel around himself.

                                ford
                  used to be john stevens, but i
                  changed it on account of i want to
                  drive cars.

     hoping to impress, ford reaches into a pocket, pulls out a
     worn, creased flyer for a "ford lincoln mercury"
     dealership. ford finds the postman just staring at him,
     waiting for the uniform he's still got in his hand.
     embarrassed, ford quickly hands it over.
