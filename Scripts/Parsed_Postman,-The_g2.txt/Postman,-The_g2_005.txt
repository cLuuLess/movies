    a shambles. the postman kicks around the table. he finds
    a few beat-up cds, flips through them. reads the label.

                                                   (continued)

                                                              5.

                               the postman
                 'running on empty'? tell me about
                 it.

    tossing it, he turns, stops. there, resting on a pile of
    trash is a bashed-in portable tv. the postman smiles.

                                the postman
                 hey, bill! we got tv! 147
                 channels. everything from jesus
                 to 'jeopardy'.

    he steps over, switches on the set.      nothing happens, but
    the postman pretends just the same.      he mimics static,
    then:

                               the postman
                 'like sands through the hour-
                 glass, so are the days of our
                 lives...'
                        (switching channels)
                 'michael shields, come on down,
                 you're the next contestant
                 on...'the price is right'.'
                        (switching again)
                 i'll take domestic nuclear
                 disasters for two hundred
                 thousand, alex...

    the postman stops suddenly.    click.

                               the postman
                 we interrupt our regularly
                 scheduled program to bring you the
                 second civil war... well, shit.

    the postman stares at the blank screen a moment. there's
    a sudden, panicked rustling from behind the service
    manager's desk. the postman wheels around, raises the
    carbine.

                               the postman
                 i don't want any trouble... i bet
                 you don't either... let's just
                 call it a draw, okay?

    sudden movement. the postman shouts in surprise as a doe
    dashes out from behind the desk. scared, it bounds back
    and forth between the walls. then freezes in the corner.
    the postman sighs in relief, lowers the carbine.

                               the postman
                 look out, bill!

                                                      (continued)

                                                               6.

5   continued:    (2)                                               5

    the doe bolts for the window and runs right into bill.
    bill has a conniption fit.

    investigating further, the postman spots a cigarette
    machine. the front glass is smashed and all the slots are
    empty. but he looks down to the lock at the bottom. it's
    intact. he pulls a crowbar from the sack, crouches by the
    machine and digs the pry into a seam and pulls.

    the panel bursts open to reveal four half-open cartons of
    cigarettes. he doesn't believe it for a second. then:

                               the postman
                 i'm rich.
