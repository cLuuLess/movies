45   ext. on road - sun                                           45

     a green and lavender sunset. in the middle of nowhere,
     the postman rides, chewing a piece of jerked beef. he
     flips through some of the letters entrusted to him.

                                                   (continued)

                                                              58.

                                   the postman
                  eugene.     benning. portland.
                            (stops short)
                  boston!
                         (resumes)
                  seattle. boise... st. rose,
                  paradise on the pacific...

     he considers the letter, looks around as if someone may be
     watching. he just begins to tear the corner, then stops.

                                 the postman
                  maybe one thing can still be
                  sacred.
                          (to horse)
                  all in all, not a bad gig, huh?

     the horse snorts. smiling, the postman shoves the
     envelope into his bag. as he does, he finds something
     else. the red ribbon. he runs it through his fingers,
     thinks wistfully of abby. then, like a knight of old
     representing a lady's honor, he ties it to his mailbag and
     rides on.
