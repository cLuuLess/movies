108   ext. pine view streets - night                                  108

      pine view is throwing a party. it's in full swing. a
      couple of guitars. a banjo and a trombone. everyone
      dances.

      the postman walks with briscoe, sees mrs. march as her
      letter is read to her. catches a glimpse of abby dancing
      with ford. he seems, for the first time, truly happy.
      for that matter, so does briscoe.

                                 briscoe
                   things are getting better.
                   getting better all the time.
                          (a beat)
                   i don't know who you are, but i do
                   know i was wrong about you.

      the postman smiles, reaches in his bag for an envelope.

                                 the postman
                   got a letter for you, sheriff.

      briscoe turns it over in his hands, looks up in wonder.

                                 briscoe
                   it's from my sister. i thought
                   she was dead.

                                                        (continued)

                                                               94.

108   continued:                                                     108

                                 the postman
                   you thought wrong.

      briscoe has tears in his eyes.    the postman continues on,
      embarrassed but affected.


      dance

      the postman taps ford's shoulder, wants to cut in on him
      and abby. ford steps aside. a beat before abby decides
      it's okay. they begin. her eyes are on her feet, careful
      that she doesn't take a misstep. but his eyes are on her.
      and over it all, bleeding in, the sound of hoof beats.
