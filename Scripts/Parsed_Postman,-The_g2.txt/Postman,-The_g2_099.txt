99   int. bethlehem's tent - sunset                                  99

     bethlehem once again at his easel with palette in hand.
     he's trying another style -- impressionism -- and it's
     worse than the last. he looks over as getty and gibbs
     approach with a prisoner.

                                                       (continued)

                                                              90.

99   continued:                                                     99

                                bethlehem
                  what do you think, lieutenant?

                                gibbs
                  can't tell what it is if you stand
                  too close. the colors all kinda
                  run together, don't they?

                                bethlehem
                  yes...

     bethlehem looks away from his painting to see gibbs and
     getty flanking a scared, blue-clad mail carrier. for an
     instant, mistakes him for:

                                bethlehem
                  well, if it isn't our old friend
                  the u.p.s. man.

                                gibbs
                  we captured him on the oregon
                  border.

     realizing, bethlehem turns the face from side-to-side.

                                bethlehem
                  who the hell are you?

                                carrier (prisoner)
                  carrier twelve. united states,
                  um, postal service.

     getty sets some of the carrier's anti-holnist propaganda
     onto bethlehem's field table. bethlehem picks it up.

     it's hard to say what he's thinking.      finally:

                                bethlehem
                  i want the camp struck at dawn.
                  we're moving north.

                                gibbs
                  yes, sir.

     bethlehem looks back to carrier twelve.

                                bethlehem
                         (chilling)
                  you spelled tyranny wrong.

                                                              91.
