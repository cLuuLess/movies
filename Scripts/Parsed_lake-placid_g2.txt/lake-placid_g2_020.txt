     int. farm house - day

     jack, kelly and keough are questioning delores bickerman, mid-
     sixties, eccentric if not slightly daffy.  she's brought out
     refreshments.

                         bickerman
               oh, my husband passed away almost
               two years ago.

                         keough
               my department doesn't have any
               record of that, mrs. bickerman.

                         bickerman
                    (with some attitude)
               oh well, i'm sorry.  i didn't
               realize you keep such a firm track
               of the dead.

                         kelly
                    (gently)
               what was the cause of your
               husband's death, ma'am, do you
               know?

     off bickerman's silence--

                         kelly (cont'd)
               we don't mean to invade your
               privacy but... was he ill, was he
               sick?

                         keough
               was he swallowed?

                         kelly
                    (reprimanding)
               sheriff.

                         jack
               mrs. bickerman, the reason we're
               up here... a man was fatally
               attacked yesterday by some animal
               in this lake.  do you know how your
               husband died?

                         bickerman
                    (brightly)
               oh yes.  i killed him.

     keough clenches his eyes shut.  the old woman's a loon.

                         jack
               you killed him.

                         bickerman
                    (happily)
               oh, yes.

                         keough
               and how would you have accomplished
               this, ma'am?

                         bickerman
                    (rattling it off quickly,
                     simply)
               well, he was very ill and he
               refused to go see a doctor and
               well... i think he had alzheimer's,
               he would be coherent one day,
               incoherent the next and one
               coherent day, he asked me to end
               his suffering.  i wouldn't do it
               but he kept insisting and insisting
               and deteriorating till the point
               the only cognitive thing he could
               really do was that i finish him
               off.  finally i just gave in and
               hit him on the head with a skillet
               then buried him under the bulkhead.

     jack, keough, and kelly just stare back at this crazy woman.
     off their looks--

                         bickerman (cont'd)
                    (to keough)
               dig him up if you don't believe me,
               javert.

                                             cut to:
