     ext. bickerman house - continuous

     mrs. bickerman, singing "itsy bitsy spider" is happily leading
     the blinded cow to the shore.  the cow, tentative, just allows
     itself to be led, not knowing what the plan is.  as mrs.
     bickerman gets to the water, she looks out to the croc.

                         bickerman
               come and get it.

     and with that, she whips the hind of the cow causing it to jump
     forward.  almost simultaneously, the croc makes its charge and
     the cow is dead before it has a clue.
