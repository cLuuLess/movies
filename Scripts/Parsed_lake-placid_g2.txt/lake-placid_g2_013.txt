     kelly's in her office, working at her desk.  kevin enters.

                         kevin
               hey.

                         kelly
               kevin.  how's it going, what's
               happenin', family good, great, nice
               to catch up, get out.

                         kevin
               this is business.
                    (then)
               there was an accident in maine,
               some guy got killed by something in
               a lake.  probably a bear, but...
               they found a tooth.

                         kelly
               a tooth?

                         kevin
               a tooth they say couldn't have come
               from any bear.  they say it looks
               prehistoric.  like maybe a
               dinosaur.

                         kelly
                    (without looking up)
               oh, well then i'm sure that's it,
               he got killed by a dinosaur,
               anything else?

                         kevin
               i want you to go there.

     now she looks up.

                         kelly
               sorry?

                         kevin
               i'm sure it's nothing, but you're
               a paleontologist, this is what we
               do, i--

                         kelly
               this is what we do?

                         kevin
               i'd like you to check out this
               lake.  see--

                         kelly
               are you on drugs?

                         kevin
               kelly--

                         kelly
               i'm not going to maine, i won't
               even go west of forty-third street--

                         kevin
               part of our research--

                         kelly
               i'm not even a field person.

                         kevin
               well on this one i'd like you to
               be.

     kelly stares back.  the nickle drops.

                         kelly
               this was myra's idea, wasn't it?
               get me out of the office for a few
               days, until--

                         kevin
               it has nothing to do with--

                         kelly
               i never do field work and even if
               i did, maine, to look at a tooth of
               a dinosaur who bit somebody,
               couldn't you dream up something--

                         kevin
               kelly--

                         kelly
               i am not going to maine.  that's
               ridiculous.
