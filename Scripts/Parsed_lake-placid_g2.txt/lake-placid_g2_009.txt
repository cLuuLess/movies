     ext. boat - continuous

     keough.  oblivious.  waiting.  suddenly-- walt comes thrusting
     up with a scream!

                         walt
               sheriff!!

     and walt is promptly yanked back under.

                         keough
               hey!

     upon which walt surfaces.  he swims frantically for a beat
     before he's suddenly yanked under again.  then he surfaces,
     thrashing as keough speeds over with the boat.  he takes hold of
     him and pulls him on board.  actually... what's left of him.
     there's nothing below the waist.  walt is just a bleeding torso,
     though still conscious.

                         keough (cont'd)
                    (going into shock)
               jesus christ.

     angle walt's remaining hand

     clenching around keough's arm.

     angle walt's face

     he knows he's done.  off keough's continued horror, we:

                                             cut to:

     black and white

     a dinosaur (t-rex) is angry and out for blood.

     reveal
