               keep enough tension to hold him up,
               hector, we don't know if he can
               swim.

                         hector (o.s.)
                    (through headset)

                         jack
               the more he thrashes, the better.

                         hector (o.s.)
                    (through headset)

     meters.  the chopper lifts him out briefly.

                         jack
               it can't work.

                         kelly
