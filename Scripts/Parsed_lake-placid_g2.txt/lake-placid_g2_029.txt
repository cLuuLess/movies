     ext. beach campsite - night

     kelly stands, alone, skipping stones.  after a beat, jack
     approaches.

                         jack
               what are you doing?

                         kelly
               skipping stones.  look how flat
               that water is, you can get ten
               skips on a good one.

     a beat.

                         jack
               listen, uh... hank and i think it
               best if you stay on shore.

                         kelly
               i beg your pardon?

                         jack
               whatever's out there did flip over
               a canoe--

                         kelly
               i am not staying on shore.

                         jack
               it's too dangerous for--

                         kelly
               i didn't fly up here to roast
               marshmallows--

                         jack
               you flew up here because your boss--

                         kelly
               i am going out on that boat and why
               are you picking on me, is this some
               kind of--

            kelly (cont'd)                  jack
       hazing, new fingernails    i'm not picking--
       in the woods?

                         jack (cont'd)
                    (overriding)
               i'm beginning to see why you were
               shipped off.

     and her face falls.

                         kelly
                    (wounded; quietly)
               that was an awful thing to say to
               me.

                         jack
                    (feels bad now)
               i'm sorry but you're...

     a beat. he doesn't finish the sentence.

                         kelly
                    (genuine)
               i do know crocodiles and i won't
               get in your way.
                    (then)
               i really do want to be a part of
               this.

     jack reads her, he can see that she does.

                         jack
               okay.
                    (then)
               we're up at six.

                         kelly
               good.

                         jack
                    (a beat)
               'night.

     there's a little chemistry here, though both would probably deny
     it.  he heads off toward his tent, she sits with her book.  she
     gives one last look, watches him go.  then she goes back to her
     book.
