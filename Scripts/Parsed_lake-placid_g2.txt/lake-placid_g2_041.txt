     ext. lake - continuous

     keough, kelly, and burke, standing idly, scanning the calm
     surface.

                         keough
                    (into headset)
               hector, jack, we show you with
               about twelve minutes of oxygen
               left, and you're on the last tank.
               time to go home.

                         kelly
               that was a bust.

     a beat.  another beat.  then... something jerks the boat a
     little.

                         kelly (cont'd)
               what was that?

                         keough
               i don't know.  it was like a tug.
               something tugged us.

     upon which something really yanks the boat.  so hard... kelly
     flips over the back, into the water.

                         keough (cont'd)
               hey!

     the boat is moving, being dragged quickly.

                         burke
               something's got the anchor line!

                         keough
               kelly!!

     but kelly's alone in the water, the boat being pulled away.

     resume

                         keough
                    (into headset)
               jack!!  hector!  we're being
               dragged!!
                    (as he starts the motor; to
                     burke)
               cut the line!  cut the fucking
               line!

     burke goes to work on the anchor line as we angle kelly,
     treading water, in the middle of nowhere.  she's completely
     vulnerable.
