     ext. black lake - night

     the loon continues its hypnotic call, as the steamy mist lifts
     off the dark water, which doesn't even ripple.  the loon
     continues her nocturnal cry, as we savor the beauty of the lake,
     the elegance of the bird, and the haunting echo of her lonely
     call... until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under,
     silenced forever.  a lone feather surfaces and floats as:

     credits roll over the black lake to richie havens singing "i can
     see clearly now." then--

     over black

                         keough (o.s.)
               and they pay you for this?  to tag
               beaver?

                         walt (o.s.)
               imagine.

     as we fade in a face comes into focus from underwater.  it is
     the face of walt lawson (maine fish and game) looking down from
     a boat.
