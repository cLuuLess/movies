               hard to believe there could be a
               monster under such peacefulness.

                         jack
               i thought i might track the
               shoreline tomorrow, look for
               prints.

     she just stares out as if she didn't hear.  and he fixes his own
     stare on her.  feeling it, she turns, catches him looking at
     her, he diverts the stare.  she feigns a non-reaction.  a beat.

                         jack (cont'd)
               you know they say the brain
               confuses fear for passion.

                         kelly
               excuse me?

                         jack
               when you get scared, the brain
               releases a chemical, same chemical
               it releases when somebody's...
                    (a beat)
               in high school, the thing to do was
               to take the girl to a scary movie.

                         kelly
               what are you talking about?

                         jack
               i'm saying between the moonlight,
               a beautiful lake and a monster that
               bites heads off... you look good.

                         kelly
               gee, that was so poetic, jack.  i'm
               all moist.

                         jack
               forgive me for trying to be nice.

                         kelly
               nice?  nice would be "you look
               pretty," nice is not some man-
               eating monster has tricked my brain
               into making you look good.

                         jack
               i didn't say it like that.

                         kelly
               you did, you--

                         jack
               i was trying to pay you a
               compliment, i was guising it as
               science 'cause i know you're
               comfortable in that arena.
               science.

                         kelly
               a man just died, you're hitting on
               me with science.

                         jack
               just forget it.

                         hector
                    (arriving)
               beg pardon?  sorry to intrude but
               hank seems to have gotten himself
               stuck in a tree.
