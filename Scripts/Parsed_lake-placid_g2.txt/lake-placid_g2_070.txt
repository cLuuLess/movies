     ext. lake (surface) - continuous

     hector breaks the top.  lifts his mask, looks toward the
     chopper, which he sees about forty yards out.  he continues to
     breaststroke on the surface.  suddenly... the croc's head rises
     up right behind hector, who's oblivious.  he continues to swim.
     the croc follows.  then... maybe divine intuition... hector gets
     a feeling he's being followed.  he then turns to look the other
     way, upon which his face goes rigid.

     his p.o.v.

     about three feet from his nose... are two giant eyes staring at
     him.

     angle hector

     ashen.

                         hector
                    (weakly)
               oh.... my.

     the croc doesn't move.  it just stares at him.  then end of his
     snout is almost touching hector.  hector himself doesn't dare
     move, for fear of spooking the croc into action.  we get the
     idea that looking into the eyes of this crocodile is not filling
     any spiritual voids.  a beat.

                         hector (cont'd)
               i suddenly feel a bit foolish.
                    (then)
               you're different from the others.

     the croc raises his head now to reveal the snout.  and his
     deadly smile.  hector just tries to tread water with as little
     motion as possible.  he deathly fears a quick movement will
     cause his life to be over.  perhaps this is what he came for.
     to be judged by this symbol of mythology.

     he backswims ever so slightly.  the croc pursues just as slowly,
     their eyes are locked.  he could snap off hector's head in an
     instant.

                         hector (cont'd)
                    (terrified; trying to
                     convince himself)
               holy spirit of sobek.  holy ghost.
                    (swallows)
               holy shit.
