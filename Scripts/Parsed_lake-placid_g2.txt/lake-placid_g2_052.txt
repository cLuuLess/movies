     int. kelly's tent - night

     kelly is butterflying jack's wound, necessarily working very
     close to him.

                         jack
               ow.  shit.

                         kelly
               just gotta pull it a little
               tighter.

                         jack
               who taught you be be a nurse?

                         kelly
               father's a surgeon.  i can even
               stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a
               bad idea here.

                         jack
               no thanks.

                         kelly
               keep it dry.  no swimming.

                         jack
                    (dry)
               thank you.

     they hold a look.  then --

                         jack (cont'd)
               you're having the best time of your
               life, aren't you?

                         kelly
                    (caught)
               what?  why... people have been
               killed, i hardly think i'm having
               a good time, why would...
                    (off his look; copping)
               does it show?

     jack nods slightly.

                         kelly (cont'd)
               this is the first time i've
               actually... y'know been in the 
               middle of anything.  i've never
               really even gotten dirty before,
               with me showers have always been
               preventative.

     their eyes are locked now, making her self-conscious and
     nervous.

                         jack
               that's why you're here.  to get in
               the middle of something?

                         kelly
               maybe.  i've always read about
               what's happened.  i've never... i
               know it sounds silly but, it's nice
               to be someplace while something is
               actually... y'know... happening.

     something is happening right now.  a beat.

                         kelly (cont'd)
               we should probably go to bed.
                    (quickly)
               get rest, get some rest.  go to our
               separate beds, get some rest.

     the freudian slip of her life.  they hold another look.  then he
     starts to exit.  he stops at the door, turns back.

                         jack
               thanks for the... bandaid.

                         kelly
                    (please don't go)
               night.

     he holds another look, then leaves.  off her punishing herself
     for both the slip of the tongue and for cutting the moment
     short.

                                             cut to:
