     int. hector's tent - a minute later

     hector enters, sits.  a beat.  kelly enters, goes to sit next to
     him.

                         kelly
                    (softly)
               did you want to be killed by it?

                         hector
               you think i'm that nuts?

                         kelly
                    (softly)
               hector.
                    (then)
               what you just did... there was at
               least some sort of a death wish
               going on.

                         hector
               nothing's real.

                         kelly
               excuse me?

                         hector
               nothing's real.
                    (escalating)
               i'm rich, people are automatically
               my friends, sycophants ooze out
               like oil slicks and and and--

     he's sounding erratic.

                         hector (cont'd)
               with crocodiles... everything's
               even.

                         kelly
               i'm no psychiatrist.  but i would
               think there have to be better
               places to look for autonomy, than--

                         hector
                    (pained)
               i'm an empty man, kelly, wealth has
               robbed me of the dream in life, i
               sit here broken, a hollow sack--

                         kelly
               oh, bullshit.

     and hector drops the act.

                         hector
               didn't even sound good?

                         kelly
               no.

                         hector
                    (worth a try)
               eh.  fuck it.

                         kelly
               can i tell them you won't go back
               in the water?

                         hector
               yes.  you may.  but maybe... i
               don't know...

     he has trouble saying it.

                         kelly
               what?

                         hector
               could we have intercourse?

     she just whacks him.  then exits.  off hector, "worth a shot",
     we:

                                             cut to:
