     ext. lake - day

     keough and kelly are in the boat slowly traveling along the
     thickly wooded shoreline.

                         keough
               half mile up, there's a clearing.

                         jack
               you gonna dig up that lady's
               husband?

                         keough
               i'll call the coroner.

                         kelly
                    (looking around)
               what is with this lake?  it looks
               black and... there are no waves or
               anything.

                         keough
               they wanted to call it lake placid.
               but somebody said that name was
               taken.

                         kelly
                    (to jack)
               gee.

     jack smiles, gets her sarcasm.

                         keough
               the tents were sent ahead, they
               should already be set-up.

                         kelly
                    (what?)
               we're staying in tents?

                         keough
               i told you.  two days, we'd have to
               camp.

                         kelly
               yes, camp, i thought that meant
               holiday inn, i never heard "tents",
               will there be toilets?

                         keough
                    (seeing something)
               what the hell?

     keough's attention has been otherwise arrested.  he sees
     something in the water.

                         kelly
               what?

                         keough
                    (slowing the boat)
               i thought i saw...

                         kelly
               it looks like a branch.

     he leans over to grab something floating in the water.  looks
     like a branch.  he lifts it up, revealing it to be an antler.
     connected to the severed head of a moose.  keough, seeing it as
     he lifts it, screams, throwing it.

     it hits kelly and she screams, a blood-curdling scream, as the
     head hits the floor of the boat with a heavy thud.  kelly rears
     back, still screaming, and belts keough in the shoulder.

                         keough
               hey!!

                         kelly
               you threw it at me!!

                         keough
                    (denying)
               i just let go of it.

                kelly                       jack
       you threw it at me!!       alright.
           (to jack)
       did you see that?

     she belts him again.

                keough                      jack (cont'd)
       stop hitting me!           ma'am!

                         kelly
               don't throw heads at me,
                    (to jack)
               and stop calling me "ma'am"!

     angle the head

     resume

     a beat.  this head looks ripped off the body.

                         jack
               what is going on here?
