     ext. lake - sunset

     keough and kelly are in one canoe, hector and jack are alongside
     in another.  hector is operating one of his sophisticated sonar
     devices.  the calm.  the still.  the beauty.

                         hector
               if he's here, i'll find him.
                    (to jack, re kelly)
               did she tell you we had sex
               together?

                         kelly
               i never had sex with you!

                         hector
               even so, you're allowed to boast.
               you look thin by the way, i've
               mentally undressed you, i can see
               your ribcage.

                         keough
               i really don't mean to be
               discourteous.
                    (patronizing)
               but how is it a person could come
               to believe that a crocodile is in
               new england?

                         hector
               they have saltwater glands, they
               can swim across oceans, it's only
               a matter of time.

                         keough
               and what would he do come winter?

                         hector
               they can survive winter.  as long
               as their nostrils don't freeze,
               they survive,
                    (to kelly)
               am i foolish to explain things, he
               had such trouble with my name?

                  kelly                    keough
              (scolding)          hey.
       hector.

                         hector
                    (to keough)
               is this where it happened?

                         keough
               around here.  yeah.

                         hector
                    (knows his crocodiles)
               if he's eaten in the area, he
               shouldn't be far away.  crocs hang
               around the food source.

                         kelly
               but they're nighttime hunters,
               hector, he'd probably be on land
               now anyway.

                         hector
               'cept he wasn't before, was he?
                    (then to keough)
               you know, when friends or family
               members say things, they tend not
               to register so sometimes it helps
               to hear it from a total stranger.
               you're fat.

                         kelly
               hector.

     suddenly there are ripples, fish breaking surface about thirty
     feet away.

                         jack
               what's that?

                         keough
               white perch.

                         jack
               are they feeding?

                         keough
               doesn't look like it.

                         jack
               they look like they're jumping.

                         kelly
               they look scared.

     upon which something grabs the front of kelly's canoe and with
     one crisp yank, flips it over like a spoon on a dinner table,
     sending them all flying.

     in an instant, keough and kelly are swimming for their lives.
     screaming/yelling, they scramble for the canoe, climb onto it's
     flipped-over back.  breathless, they all exchange confused
     looks.  "what the hell happened"?

                         kelly (cont'd)
               my hair.
