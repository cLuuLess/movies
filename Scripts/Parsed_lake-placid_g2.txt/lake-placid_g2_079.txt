     ext. lake - an hour later

     the cow has been dipped more times than a stale donut now and he
     just hangs there like pasta.  jack, keough, and kelly are poised
     with tranq guns on the beach.

                         jack
                    (looking through
                     binoculars)
               he doesn't seem to be swimming.  is
               he swimming?

                         kelly
                    (looking through
                     binoculars)
               he's floating.  take it home.

                         jack
                    (into headset)
               hector.

                         hector (o.s.)
               hold on!
