     int. jackson hospital - day

     kelly is walking with keough toward the morgue.

                         keough
               he just came up screaming.

                         kelly
               did he say anything?

                         keough
               he just kinda gurgled.  he was
               pretty much dead.

                         kelly
               and you didn't see anything?

                         keough
               the lake was dead calm until up he
               came.  the tooth is in there.

                         kelly
                    (seeing)
               there?  that's the morgue.

                         keough
               yes.

                         kelly
               is the dead guy in there?

                         keough
               that's where they keep them.
                    (then)
               you want me to bring the tooth out
               here?

                         kelly
               um.
                    (bravado)
               no, no.  let's go.
