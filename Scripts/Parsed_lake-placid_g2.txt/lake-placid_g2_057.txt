     ext. lake (westside) - night

     the teenagers have some or most of their clothes back on.
     hector's chopper is hovering over the area, its beams lighting
     the water.  lying on the beach, covered... is tommy.  alive.
     and basically unhurt!

                         keough
               he was in his mouth?!

                         janine
               yes.

                         jack
                    (stunned; to tommy)
               you're okay?

                         tommy
                    (in shock)
               i think; just cuts.

                         danny
               the thing just came up out of the
               water and kind of spit him at us.

                         janine
               you should have signs posted, for
               god's sake!

                         jack
                    (examining him)
               you're really okay?

     tommy nods.  then--

                         tommy
               i might need a tetanus.

     keough and jack exchange a look of disbelief.
