     ext. campsite - seconds later

     hank hangs still, upside down, from the tree, as hector, kelly,
     and jack approach.

                         hector
               i probably could've accomplished
               freeing him myself but he had a
               look of mayhem on his upside down
               face.

     they arrive.  hank says nothing, he hangs there perfectly still.

                         kelly
               hank?

                         keough
                    (calmly)
               yes.

     the three exchange looks.

                         kelly
               are you okay?

                         keough
                    (calmly; almost sweet)
               other than feeling slightly
               embarrassed, i'm perfectly fine.
                    (then)
               could you cut me down?

                         hector
               promise you won't kill me, first.

                         keough
                    (calmly)
               i have no interest in ever looking
               at you, hector.
                    (again)
               could you please cut me down?

     jack gives kelly a knife.

                         jack
               you cut, we'll hold him.

     hector and jack grab hold, kelly cuts, they lower him to the
     ground.  he rises.

                         keough
                    (calm)
               thank you.
                    (then)
               i lied.

     and he charges after hector, who runs toward the beach.  keough
     chases, jack and kelly pursue, trying to stop him.  and
     suddenly, exploding out of the woods, a ferocious charging
     growl.  an attack.  screams all over, a half-second of confusion
     before we see it's a large black bear jumping out of the
     darkness, right at hector.  hector dives out of its path.
     screams, panic, shouting, as the bear rears up on his hind legs.
     seemingly about to lunge when... exploding out of the water
     the giant jaws of a crocodile.

     in a flash instant, the beast engulfs the bear, twisting it,
     slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water.

     the bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only
     be one outcome here.  in a matter of seconds, both bear and
     crocodile have vanished.  and the water is calm again.

     angle the faces

     utter catatonia.  shock.  whatever they expected to find in this
     expedition, they weren't remote prepared for that.  there are
     no words here.  shock is pre-empting every other human sensory.
     what they just saw... a crocodile head measuring five feet rise
     up out of the water and gobbled a fucking bear.  a beat.  then--

                         keough
                    (admitting)
               okay.  it's a crocodile.  i'll
               admit it.

     a beat as they gulp air.

                         kelly
                    (to jack)
               you're cut.

     there is a little blood over jack's right eye.  he dabs it.

                         kelly (cont'd)
                    (to hector)
               he was an indo-pacific.

                         hector
                    (daunted)
               are you sure?

                         kelly
               scales were oval.  it was an asian
               crocodile.

                         keough
               asia?  how... how could he get
               here?

                         hector
               obviously some asshole in hong kong
               flushed him down a toilet.

                         kelly
               he had to be thirty feet long.

     another beat.

                         jack
                    (charged)
               hank.  the little cannon you
               brought, get it.  guard the
               shoreline.  otherwise, we're done.
               we made the i.d., our job is
               finished.

                         keough
               alright, ms. paleontologist.  i
               wanna know why that monster is
               here.  you got a theory?

                         kelly
               why he's that big, i don't know.
               why he's here... the wetlands are
               being developed, crocodiles are
               moving.  australia, fiji, the
               things have started to cross
               oceans.

                         jack
               but why maine and why alone?  crocs
               are social, why's this guy on the
               move by himself?

                         hector
               maybe he doesn't play well with
               others.

                         keough
               is everything a big fucking joke to
               you?

                         hector
                    (re his groin)
               bite my bishop.

     and keough starts for him, but jack intercedes.

                         keough
               i'm sick of him!

               jack                       hector
           (interceding)        let him go!  i'm sick of you
       c'mon.                   too, let him go.
                                      (then)
                                thing about being rich, sheriff,
                                my parents had the added luxury of
                                being able to ditch me off at karate
                                school, i'm a brown belt.  so go
                                ahead.  take your best shot.

     keough throws a haymaker, decking hector.  lays him out.

                         kelly
               hank!

                         keough
                    (who knew?)
               he said he knew karate!

                         hector
                    (shaken)
               at school they'd always say "go"
               first.

                         jack
                    (to keough)
               get your big gun and guard the
               shore.  hector.  go to your tent.

                         hector
                    (muttering as he goes)
               he never said "go".

                         jack
                    (to keough)
               get the gun.

                         keough
                    (muttering as he goes)
               if i fall into a hole or get
               hoisted into a tree...

     and he's gone.

                         jack
                    (re keough and hector)
               like little children.
                    (then)
               you okay?

                         kelly
               yeah.  i got some stuff for your
               cut.

                         jack
               i couldn't believe... did you see
               the size of that thing's mouth?

                         kelly
               i wonder if he's some kind of
               mutant.
                    (then)
               that bear had to be surprised.

                         jack
                    (taking her arm; ushering)
               let's get away from the shore.

     she looks at his hand on her arm, which suddenly makes him self-
     consious.

                         jack (cont'd)
               sorry.

                         kelly
               it's okay.

     they hold a look.
