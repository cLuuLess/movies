     ext. beachside campsite - an hour later

     a small tent camp is being set up.  people unpacking.  two
     deputies, burke and stephens, present.  kelly is with jack.

                         kelly
               how big do the bears get?

                         jack
               big but... a bear couldn't do that
               to a moose or man in water.  on
               land maybe.  but...

                         kelly
               and they're sure he didn't get
               tangled under the outboard somehow?

                         jack
               hank says he's sure.

     kelly takes in the scenic surroundings.

                         kelly
               it really is beautiful, isn't it?

                         jack
               never been to maine before?

                         kelly
               i was told they discriminate
               against people with hygiene.
                    (off jack)
               i never believed it.

     he measure her.  then--

                         jack
               why are you here?  really.

                         kelly
               i told you.

                         jack
               the museum of natural history
               doesn't send out investigators to--

                         kelly
               how would you know, what--

                         jack
               and even if they did, i doubt he or
               she would have problems with tents.

                         kelly
               so i don't like tents, why--

                         jack
               you don't like tents, mosquitos,
               look at your fingernails, you have
               about as much business being in the
               woods--

                 kelly                      jack (cont'd)
       what's wrong with my       --as emily post, it doesn't
       fingernails these are      make sense--
       perfectly good--

                         jack (cont'd)
                    (overriding)
               they sent you out to examine a tooth,
               why are you out here on the on the lake?

     a beat.  might as well tell.

                         kelly
               i am a paleontologist.
                    (throwing it out)
               i also was dating my boss he turned
               out to be involved with a co-worker
               who was also my friend and for the
               sake of comfort, theirs, i was
               shipped off to maine.
                    (then)
               i don't feel like going back yet.

     there.  she said it.  he stares back.

                         kelly (cont'd)
               i'm not making it up.

                         jack
               well.  you don't have to stay out
               here, why don't--

                         kelly
               i've come, i'm here, i'm staying.
               unless there are ticks.

     we then hear the sound of a descending helicopter.  she looks
     up.  then:

                         kelly (cont'd)
               oh my god.

                         jack
               what?

                         kelly
               if this is who i think it is.
                    (as it gets closer)
               it is.

                         jack
               who?

                         kelly
               hector cyr.  he's a rich kook
               mythology professor.  he's done
               some work with our museum.  he also
               treks the world to swim with
               crocodiles.

                         keough
                    (arriving)
               with what?

                         kelly
               crocodiles.  he's an expert on
               them.  and if he's here... then he
               must think that's what's in this
               lake.

                         jack
               in maine?

                         kelly
               there have been northern sightings.
               but not this north.

     as hector cyr, this giant ball of life, deboards his chopper--

                         hector
                    (spotting kelly;
                     disappointed)
               you beat me.  balls.
                    (then)
               i need some of you to help me
               unpack.
                    (to burke and stevens)
               you and you.
                    (to keough)
               not you.
                    (to kelly)
               who do we have from fish and game?

               keough                      jack
            (to kelly)                 me.
         who is this man?

                         hector
                    (rapid fire)
               i could see the algae blooms just
               coming in, how long has this lake
               been stagnant?
                    (extending his hand to
                     keough)
               hi, hector cyr.  the earth is round
               and so should you be.

                         keough
                    (to kelly)
               --who is he?

                         hector
               i'll need any and all topographic
               studies.

                         keough
               wait just a second.  you don't just
               fly in here and start barking
               orders.

                         hector
               i apologize, i just don't want to
               lose the light, we've got time for
               a quick scout,
                    (to kelly)
               you've had work done.

                 kelly                keough
            (flaring)             (frustrated)
       i have not.           who is this man?

                         hector
               hector cyr, i said it once, let me
               know when it sinks in,
                    (to kelly)
               have you seen it?

                 kelly                      keough (cont'd)
       no.                        mister...

                         kelly (cont'd)
               it couldn't be a crocodile.

                         hector
               they've been migrating north,
               kelly, this lake connects to the
               ocean,--

                         keough
                    (frustrated)
               mr. cyr!

                         hector
               c'mon, we're losing light,
                    (to kelly)
               why does the big one heckle me?

     kelly yanks him aside.

                         kelly
                    (sotto)
               hector.  the big one has no sense
               of humor.  and since he's the one
               who decides whether you get to
               play, try not to be your obnoxious
               self.

                         hector
               that hurt my feelings.

     and it did a little.  hector is a big teddy bear.

                         jack
                    (arriving)
               if we're gonna go we better go.

                                             cut to:
