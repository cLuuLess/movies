     int. hector's tent - continuous

     his tent is on the palatial side.  stereo, generator, he's got a
     margarita bar going.  there's a party.  hector's dancing with
     deputy gare, others are enjoying the drinks and music.

                         hector
               you're a beautiful woman.

                         gare
               thank you.

                         hector
               and law enforcement, such dangerous
               work.  the idea that you could die
               suddenly with no offspring,
               disconcerting, let's mate, commit
               your genes to perpetuity.

     upon which, keough enters, doesn't like what he sees.

                         keough
               hey.

     he goes, turns off the music.

                         keough
               we are here on official business.

                         hector
               cocktail?

                         keough
               no!!
                    (then)
               what's with digging the holes?

                         hector
               they come on land and they're
               brazen.  they're also attracted to
               noise, you can see i make a lot of
               it.

                         keough
               everybody out, back to your tents,
               now!

     they start to leave.

                         hector
                    (re gare)
               could she stay, we've tentatively
               scheduled intercourse.

                         keough
               no!!  out!

     and they all go, including gare, who shrugs to keough "he's kind
     of funny".

                         keough (cont'd)
                    (to hector)
               you listen to me.  the only reason
               i'm letting you be part of this is
               'cause you got the helicopter and
               the radar--

                         hector
               and you like me.

                         keough
               i do not like you.

                         hector
               deep down, gut check.  i'm growing
               fond of you and it's liberating to
               say so.

     keough stares back.

                         keough
               you're a whacko.

     and keough leaves, to:
