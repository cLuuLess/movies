     int. kevin's office - day

     they enter on the cut, he closes the door.

                         kevin
               i had a great time last night.
               again.

                         kelly
               me too.

     reading his look, she suddenly smells it.  her face drops.

                         kelly (cont'd)
                    (deducing)
               that's not what you came to say.

                         kevin
               you work for me.  i'm not
               comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...

     she's a little crushed.

                         kelly
               i was working for you when "us"
               started, what's--

                         kevin
               i know and i thought i could handle
               it but work and pleasure along with
               somebody else, it's a dangerous
               mix.

                         kelly
               kevin, as long as we...
                    (suddenly)
               what was that last part?

                         kevin
                    (sheepish)
               the somebody else part?

                         kelly
               yeah, that part.  there's...
               somebody who's um...

                         kevin
                    (feels terrible)
               else.

     a beat.

                         kelly
                    (covering)
               oh.  oh.  that's okay.  well.  this
               uh... this probably wasn't meant to
               be, y'know.  i mean, i'm... god, i
               gotta be ten years younger and you,
               you... you're y'know...

                         kevin
                    (reading her mind)
               a jerk.

                         kelly
                    (you have no idea)
               oh...
                    (then)
               no, no, i'm not angry i'm not, i'm
               just thrown, i'm...
                    (checks her watch)
               i actually have an early lunch,
               so...

                         kevin
               it's ten after nine.

                         kelly
               yes, well...
                    (smiling)
               famished.

     and she rushes out of the room.  off kevin, we:

                                             cut to:
