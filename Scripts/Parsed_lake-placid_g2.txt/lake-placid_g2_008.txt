     ext. underwater - continuous

     walt continues to swim.

     his p.o.v.

     not much to look at.  then suddenly... no, just a snapping
     turtle swimming away.  walt descends a little deeper.  he loves
     it beneath the water, there's a tranquility he can find nowhere
     else.  next best thing to meditation.  suddenly, he stops
     kicking.

     his eyes focus

     a black water snake, it must be almost three feet in length.

     resume

     walt flippers himself closer, wants a closer look.  the snake
     seems unimpressed.  then suddenly, the snake lunges at him,
     misses.  shit.  walt's look says "what the fuck?"  a beat.  then
     the snake swims off.  walt relaxes.  a beat.  but then... he
     looks around, uneasy.  he gets this feeling he's not alone down
     there.  looks about, nothing but murky water.  but he's not
     alone, we can feel he's not alone.

     he looks left, right... then... four snakes, swimming, hovering,
     looking back at him.  what's with these snakes?  walt decides
     he'll go back to the boat.  then... boom.  something hits him...
     and it's no snake.
