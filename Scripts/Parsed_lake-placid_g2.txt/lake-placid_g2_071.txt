     int. sea chopper - continuous

     gare still scans the water's surface, looking for any sign of
     hector.  and her face freezes.  oh yes, there's the sign.

     her p.o.v.

     hector continues to backswim slowly to the plane and the croc
     slowly follows.

                         gare
               hector!!

     we can hear the quaking fear in hector's voice.  as he continues
     to slowly backswim.

                         hector
                    (to gare; forced calm)
               just turn the ignition, it's fuel
               injected.

     gare turns the ignition, the engine kicks and dies.

                         gare
               come on.

     she turns it again and the engine turns over.

     angle hector

     the crocodile is still right with him as they inch closer and
     closer toward the chopper.

                         hector
               i know under the circumstances,
               biting off my head might seem
               viable.  it would cheapen you.

     but nothing's funny about this to hector now.  what he's staring
     into is death.  his own.  gare raises her rifle.

                         gare
               i might get a shot.

                         hector
                    (fear in his voice)
               no.  if you don't kill him
               instantly, i'm dead and you'll only
               kill him instantly if you get his
               brain, which is about the size of
               a cherry.  and even if you were on
               target, a bullet might not
               penetrate his hide.

     angle gare

                         gare
                    (re the croc)
               jesus.
                    (to hector)
               about twelve more yards.  keep
               coming just like that.

     angle hector

     craning to see how far away he is and as soon as he breaks eye
     contact with the crocodile, it growls.  hector quickly locks
     eyes with him again.

     angle gare

                         gare
                    (weakly)
               oh my god.

     resume

     by now hector is almost to the chopper, the croc is right there
     too.  hector's right hand then goes slowly for his belt though
     it's impossible to discern why.  the crocodile seems poised to
     finish him.  there's a slight growl.

     and then suddenly, a small underwater pop, followed by an
     explosion out of the water.  it's an inflatable life vest and as
     it pop tarts out of the water, the croc lunges for it.

     as the croc goes for the vest, hector makes his dash for the
     chopper.  in almost an instant, he's climbing on board as the
     croc pulls the vest into darkness underwater.

     hector's up on the chopper's ski.

                         hector
               move over!!

     the crocodile's head comes thrusting up, its massive jaws
     snapping shut, missing hector by an inch, maybe two.  hector
     dives into the chopper, screaming.

                         gare
               go!!

     she revs the chopper.  the croc comes up again, chomping down on
     one of the landing skis.  both gare and hector scream as the
     whole helicopter is jerked mightily.

                         gare (cont'd)
                    (screaming)
               go!!!

                         hector
               i'm trying!!!

     the croc releases and the chopper rights itself and begins to
     thrust off, when the croc surfaces again, mouth open.  gare
     fires her revolver.  it might as well shoot bb's.  the croc is 
     undaunted but he does miss the ski and by now the chopper is up
     and running, finally safely out of the reptile's reach.

                                             cut to:
