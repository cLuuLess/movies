     int. morgue - day

     the medical examiner, steven daniels, is there with keough and
     kelly.  walt's torso is covered.  kelly is examining the tooth.

                         kelly
               i need to get a microscopic look at
               it.

                         daniels
               fine.
                    (indicating)
               there you go.

                         kelly
               maybe i should see...
                    (the body)

                         keough
                    (reading her)
               i wouldn't.

                         kelly
               i'm fine, thank you.

                         keough
               have you ever seen a dead body
               before, ms. scott?

                         kelly
               well.
                    (admits)
               at wakes.

                         keough
               this is a little different.

                         kelly
               i can look at dead things.

     and daniels is about to pull the sheet back--

                         kelly (cont'd)
               wait.

     she takes a breath.

                         kelly (cont'd)
               okay.

     and daniels peels back the sheet.  kelly strains to disguise her
     extreme horror.  finally--

                         kelly (cont'd)
                    (fighting off nausea)
               this... how long did this attack go
               on for?

                         keough
               seconds.  three, four.

                         kelly
               and this is how he came to the
               boat?

                         keough
               yes.

                         kelly
               okay.
                    (then)
               and is there a place nearby i could
               go to vomit?

     off this, we:

                                             cut to:
