                                gabriel
                  you'll appreciate the irony
                  here --

     gabriel gets out of the car, still talking.       stanley

                                gabriel
                  -- in the early eighties the
                  d.e.a. set up a network of dummy
                  corporations as a government front
                  to launder drug money and gather
                  evidence. problem is, the front
                  companies started making money.
                  lots of money. by 1986, when
                  operation swordfish was
                  terminated, there was close to 400
                  million dollars in the d.e.a.'s
                  accounts.
