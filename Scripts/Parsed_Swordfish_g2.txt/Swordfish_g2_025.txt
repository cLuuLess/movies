25   int. boardroom (washington, d.c.) - day                           25

     senator james reisman -- r. (georgia) strides confidently
     into a small, windowless boardroom.

                                senator reisman
                  this better be important, you
                  pulled me out of session.

     darwin kaplan, the president's aide and one of the four
     men in the room, definitely the most intense, smiles
     thinly.

                                kaplan
                  senator, i wouldn't have asked you
                  to come here if it wasn't.

     the senator starts to sit down.    kaplan turns toward the
     senator.

                                kaplan
                  senator, we just received a
                  communication that axl torvalds
                  was intercepted entering the
                  continental u.s.

                                                       (continued)

                                                               12.

25   continued:                                                      25

                                senator reisman
                  when?

                                kaplan
                  within the last two hours.
                  according to our source inside the
                  f.b.i., he was nabbed coming
                  through customs at l.a.x.
                  alone...

                                senator reisman
                  do they know who they are dealing
                  with?

                                kaplan
                  it is unlikely, sir. it was a
                  routine check and torvalds freaked
                  out. they just got lucky.

                                 senator reisman
                  this ain't good, boys. the vortex
                  has used torvalds before. what do
                  the feds know?

                                kaplan
                  nothing as of yet. he's refusing
                  to speak english and the finnish
                  consulate has already contacted
                  the state department...

                                senator reisman
                  so we haven't been compromised?

                                kaplan
                  we're not sure. we're working on
                  that right now.

                                 senator reisman
                  you better get sure real quick,
                  son, 'cause someone's cock's
                  liable to end up on the block on
                  this one. and i promise you it
                  won't be mine.

                                kaplan
                  senator, i think we'll be okay
                  here --

                                senator reisman
                  i don't fucking pay you to think,
                  kaplan. i pay you to keep me
                  informed. i know the vortex.
                  that's why i voted against using
                  him on american soil.

                                senator reisman (cont'd)
                  it's like using the ebola virus to
                  cure a cancer patient. son, what
                  do you think's going to happen if
                  he starts tying up loose ends.

     they look at each other.

                                 kaplan
                  yessir.   i understand.

                                                     cut to:
