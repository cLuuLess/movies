78   int. starbucks - day                                              78

     gabriel and stanley walk through the door and sit down at
     a window table.

                                                        (continued)

                                                                60.

78   continued:                                                       78

                                stanley
                  money that just sorta disappeared.

                                gabriel
                  it didn't disappear. it just sat
                  in those accounts earning interest,
                  it's been 15 years. you have any
                  concept how much money we'd be
                  actually talking about today?
                  billions, brother. that's nine
                  zeros.
                         (beat)
                  look, this is a sweet deal. we
                  go in over phone lines. pop the
                  firewall, drop in the hydra, and
                  just sit back and wait for the
                  money.

                                stanley
                  before we can tap into the secure
                  cluster, you have to find one of
                  the banks on the backbone of this
                  network. do you know how many
                  banks there are in the u.s.? it
                  could take years.

                                gabriel
                  no problem.
                         (beat)
                  look behind you, stan.

     stanley turns and looks out the window.    they are sitting
     directly across from the world banc.
