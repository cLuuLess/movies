106   ext. street (somewhere in santa monica) - morning                106

      early morning in los angeles.    people go peacefully about
      their early morning business.

      suddenly, three red, white and blue hummers crest a hill
      and tear toward us down the street.

      halfway down the street, they veer right, jump the curb,
      and smash through the front plate-glass windows of the
      world banc.
