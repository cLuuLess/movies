    silence -- no sounds on the soundtrack.

    gabriel and stanley stop just outside the doorway.
    gabriel dons a pair of hip little shades, then continues
    across the sidewalk and into the street.

    he nonchalantly looks up. suddenly the thump of
    helicopters and the wail of sirens dominates the
    soundtrack.

    pandemonium. helicopters rip the sky, l.a. county pd and
    a bunch of news vultures. squad cars block off both ends
    of the street while swat trucks, news vans, and looky-
    loos are packed together into the distance.

    sharpshooters lean out of windows and snipers are
    positioned on every open rooftop. hundreds of weapons
    are pointed at this man who saunters across the street as
    if he's on his way to sunday service, without a care in
    the world.

    slowly, stanley follows gabriel into the street.

    gabriel steps up on the far sidewalk, a huge armored bus
    blocks most of the windows. he walks beside the bus,
    under a huge "world banc" sign, and through the glass
    front door, which shuts in our face.
