                  i fly to where i am to meet him.
                  he sends one of his people to meet
                  me.

     a boeing 777 screams overhead. we tilt down. stanley
     and ginger walk out of lax. a white limo idles directly
     in front of them.

     stanley is wearing a black t-shirt which proclaims in
     large white letters across his chest, in true scarlet
     letter fashion, "loser!"

                                torvalds (v.o.)
                  he tells me what he needs. i do
                  my job, i'm paid.
