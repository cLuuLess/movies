    we cannot see the headlines. federal and state officers
    scramble around handling problems. the phone rings.
    assistant director bill joy (a.d. joy), an older-looking
    guy who looks more like an accountant than an assistant
    director of the fbi, is handed the phone.

                               a.d. joy

                         paper)

                               a.d. joy
                        (to swat leader)

                 high ground one and two. you
                 have a green light.

                 the f.b.i. does not negotiate with
                 terrorists. i assumed you'd be
                 aware of that.
