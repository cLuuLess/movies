     holly hits the phone and then presses speed dial. we see
     "yellow cab" scroll across the phone. she hits "send."

                             man (o.s.)
               can i give you a lift?

                             holly
               look, creep, i don't think so --

     she stands up, ready for a fight. and there, next to her
     is her father; transformed. under his arm is a three-
     foot-tall stuffed giraffe wrapped with a big red bow.

                               holly
               daddy?
                        (recognition)
               daddy!

     she runs to him and wraps her arms around him.

                             stanley
               hey, sweetheart.

                             holly
               daddy... what are you doing here?
               i missed you so much.

                               stanley
               me too, baby.    i brought you
               something.

     he holds the stuffed giraffe to her.

                             holly
               oh, daddy. if mom finds out
               you're here she's gonna have you
               thrown back in jail.

                             stanley
               it's okay, baby. let me give you
               a ride home.

     he grabs her stuff.

                               stanley
               c'mon.

     he walks toward ginger's silver mercedes clk which he's
     borrowing. holly runs and jumps on his back. they laugh
     as he carries her to the car.

                                                              48.
