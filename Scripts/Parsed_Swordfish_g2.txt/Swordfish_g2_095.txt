     ext. river - morning

     reisman, dressed in your average, fly-fishing garb,
     stands in the shallow water of a wide river, thinking he
     has contained the situation, is doing what he enjoys
     most. he rewinds the reel and flicks it out again; the
     hook sails into the distance.

     a huge cohiba cigar hangs from his satisfied grin.

     faintly, we hear the whine of machinery. jim hears it,
     too, odd since we are so far in the boonies. he looks
     around, then up and we push in to a closeup.


     reisman's pov

     an evil-looking, camouflaged gunship suddenly crests the
     hill directly above him, rotors thumping.


     back to scene

     reisman ducking, his cigar falling from his mouth, has to
     fight to hold on to his ridiculous fishing hat.

     angle from above helicopter

     water sprays everywhere as it hovers.

     slowly it drifts over to the bank and lowers where it
     touches down briefly, the side door slides open.


     angle (slow motion)

     as gabriel steps out and walks toward us.     the copter
     lifts off behind him.


     back to scene

     reisman drops his rod and digs into the fishing box at
     his right. gabriel saunters toward him as the helicopter
     disappears over the rise. reisman is not happy.

                                gabriel
                         (sniffing in air)
                  ahh, the great american outdoors.
                  i'll never understand the appeal
                  of fly-fishing, jim. a little too
                  much like masturbation for me,
                  without the payoff.

     gabriel looks around, suddenly realizing something.

                                gabriel
                  this's a catch-and-release stream,
                  isn't it?

                                  reisman
                  that's right.

     gabriel starts to laugh.      reisman doesn't catch the joke.

                                gabriel
                  oh c'mon, jim. you gotta see the
                  irony in the chairman of the
                  joint sub-committee on crime,
                  fishing in a catch-and-release
                  stream.


     closeup - reisman

     grimaces, not thinking it is funny.

     wider

                                gabriel
                  how could you do it, jim? after
                  all we have sacrificed. all the
                  blood, all the death... i've
                  changed my identity so many times,
                  i don't even know what i look like
                  anymore. how could you turn on
                  me when we are so close?

                                reisman
                  you did this to yourself.

                                gabriel
                  you brought me in to get the job
                  done and you didn't want to know
                  about the consequences.

                                reisman
                  the f.b.i. was watching you --

                                gabriel
                  i told you there was nothing that
                  i was unaware of --

                                reisman
                  that's why we're here. you are
                  too arrogant, too aggressive --

                                gabriel
                  you have misplaced your loyalties,
                  senator. you have sold america out.
                  i am a patriot, and patriotism does
                  not have a four-year shelf life.
                  unfortunately, politicians do.

     gabriel pulls out his h&k, dangling it by his side.

                                reisman
                         (arrogantly)
                  and what are you going to do
                  with that?

                                gabriel
                  thomas jefferson once shot a man
                  on the white house lawn for
                  treason, senator. you tried to
                  execute me in the name of politics,
                  now i execute you in the name of
                  the people.

     gabriel shoots reisman in the chest.     he falls into the
     water.

                                                                74.
