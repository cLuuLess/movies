      int. theatre - morning

      stan inside. it's as if he's just teleported into
      beirut. weapons, hummers, a huge armored bus is
      jacked up at one end of the theatre. gabriel's men go
      about readying themselves. one of the mercs walks over
      to gabriel to show a modified electronic dog collar.

                                 stanley
                          (realization hitting
                           him)
                   you're going into the fucking bank.

                                 gabriel
                   that's what i'm telling you,
                   stanley. we are at war.

                                  stanley
                   war?   who are we at war with?

                                 gabriel
                   anyone who infringes on america's
                   freedom. terrorists' states,
                   stanley. someone must take their
                   war to them. they bomb a church,
                   we bomb ten. they hijack a plane,
                   we take out an airport. they
                   execute american tourists, we
                   tactically nuke an entire city.
                   we must make terrorism so horrific
                   that it becomes unthinkable to
                   attack americans.

                                  stanley
                   i'm out. i'm not doing this.
                   you're insane.

                                  gabriel
                   maybe. i wanted you to do this
                   because you wanted to, because we
                   need men like you, but our
                   time table's been moved up. just
                   relax and it will all be over in
                   twenty-four hours. you're rich,
                   stanley. pretty soon holly and
                   you will be basking in the sun on
                   the deck of some eighty-foot
                   scarab, eating bon bons and living
                   the good life.

      he turns to walk off. stanley looks around. he spots a
      generator and moves toward it. stanley reaches down to
      the power board on the generator and gives a large dial a
      twist.

                                                         (continued)

                                                                 79.

105   continued:    (3)                                                105

      suddenly, the hundreds of lights in the rack begin to
      arc. in a shower of glass they start exploding from the
      huge amperage shooting through them from the generator.
      gabriel turns to see stan standing next to the generator.
      he moves toward him just as the room goes black.

      in a moment the secondary lights come up.    no stanley.

                                 gabriel
                          (to himself)
                   pretty slick.

                                 marco
                          (walking over)
                   you want to send a team after him?

                                gabriel
                   no. he'll be back. we gotta
                   move. load up.
