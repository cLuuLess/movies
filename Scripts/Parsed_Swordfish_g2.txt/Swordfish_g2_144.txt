159   ext. skyscraper roof - day                                       159

      the sikorsky attempts to set the bus on the rooftop. the
      back wheels miss the rooftop and the entire bus starts
      sliding toward the edge. the sikorsky lifts the entire
      bus back up into the air and then gingerly sets it on the
      rooftop on all four wheels. the cables are cut loose
      from the helicopter, and drop down onto the roof with a
      loud clang.
