                  yessir.
                         (beat)
                  sir, he does work for us.

                                reisman
                  excuse us.
                         (as the communication
                          guy leaves)
                  son, let's say you have a 200-
                  pound rottweiler. he loves you,
                  and it's his job to protect you.
                  but if he ever bites you, even
                  once, you gotta put him down. you
                  can't have an uncontrollable
                  weapon running unchecked in your
                  back yard. he becomes a
                  liability. you never know who he
                  might bite next.

                                kaplan
                  yessir, i understand.
