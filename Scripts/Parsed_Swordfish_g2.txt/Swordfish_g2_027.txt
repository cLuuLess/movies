27   ext. trailer - roof - day                                       27

     stan stands on the roof of his trailer, which was a
     dilapidated shack in the 1950s and now is a lot worse.     a
     chained but scruffy-looking rottweiler runs around in
     front of the trailer.

     stan looks completely different than he did in the
     opening sequence. he hasn't taken very good care of
     himself. his hair is long, and right now standing on
     end. he is wearing nothing but a dirty towel, and is
     slicing golf balls off the roof. whack.

     as the ferrari drives up he begins hitting golf balls at
     it, but he just isn't very good. nevertheless, after a
     dozen bad hits, a lucky shot ricochets off the aluminum
     hood.

     clang!


     back to scene

     stan smiles as the car slides to a halt in the gravel
     driveway, and turns back to his "work."

     angle on stanley

     as we hear the door shut and someone comes up the
     aluminum extension ladder.

     a few moments later, in slow motion, ginger appears at
     the top of the ladder and steps onto the trailer's roof.
     stan turns around.

     she is what the hack writers of the thirties would call a
     vision. thesauruses could be exhausted searching for
     adjectives that do her justice.

     in the low-rent light of stanley's white trash haven, she
     is, by definition, a goddess.

                                stanley
                  who are you supposed to be?

     whack (slice).

     she lights a cigarette, inhales deeply, then exhales.

                                ginger
                  hello, stanley.

     she knows his name.

                                   ginger
                  i'm ginger.

                                   stanley
                  is that right?

     whack (slice).


                                ginger
                  for someone the n.s.a. has listed
                  as the most dangerous hacker in
                  america, you sure don't look like
                  much.

     whack (slice).

                                ginger
                  don't look so surprised. i know
                  everything there is to know about
                  you, stan. from your mom's maiden
                  name to how big your...

     she glances downward then back up.

                  bank account is.

                                stanley
                  how'd you get past my dog?

                                  ginger
                         (cute)
                  boys like me.

                                 stanley
                  great.   what are you selling
                  again?

     whack (slice).

                                ginger
                  did i say i was selling something?
                  i'm here to help you, stan. look
                  at you, you're a mess.

     whack (slice).

                                ginger
                  my employer wants to meet you.

     whack (slice).

                                ginger
                  you're not very good at this, are
                  you?

                                stanley
                  you're fucking up my chi.

                                ginger
                  can i see that?

     begrudgingly he hands her the club. she tees up a ball,
     pulls up her skirt far enough to reveal thong, and whack,
     hits a ball that tiger woods would envy. clang.

     she smiles, hands him the club back and pulls down her
     skirt.

                                ginger
                  you need to straighten your left
                  arm. you're bending it.

     he looks at her.

                                  ginger
                  trust me.

                                                       (continued)

                                                               16.

     he does and the ball goes flying 200 yards, perfect,
     whacking a fridge with "200 yards" painted on it. clang!

     stan looks at the club, then tosses it to the ground,
     climbing back down an aluminum extension ladder that
     leads up through a makeshift hatch on the roof.
