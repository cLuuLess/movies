34   int. fbi interrogation room - night                             34

     torvalds sits at a table in a room with a two-way mirror.
     to his left, a three-piece suited euroweasel (obviously
     his lawyer) nurses a steaming cup of coffee while
     providing air cover from the two interrogating fbi
     agents.

     the table is covered with empty coffee cups and cigarette
     carcasses. roberts eases quietly into the room in mid-
     interrogation.

     torvalds says something in finnish to his lawyer.

                                agent #1
                  what did he say?

     torvalds again speaks to his lawyer in finnish.

                                agent #2
                  your client is wanted on 24 counts
                  of electronic crimes in seven
                  different countries --

                                lawyer
                  finland does not recognize these
                  allegations as crimes. your
                  laws --

                                agent #1
                  do you see a finnish flag hanging
                  on the wall, ikea boy?

     torvalds speaks to his lawyer.

                                agent #1
                  what did he say?

                                lawyer
                  he said ikea is swedish.

                                agent #1
                  he understands english?

     the fbi agent's head is now close to imploding.

                                                       (continued)

                                                               23.

34   continued:                                                      34

                                roberts
                  okay... guys, why don't you give
                  me a few minutes here?

     they turn to see roberts smiling.

                                 agent #2
                  uh, sir...

                                 roberts
                  it's okay.   just a couple of
                  minutes.

                                 agent #1
                  yessir.

                                agent #2
                  you've fucked up now, hamlet.

                                roberts
                         (never taking his
                          eyes off torvalds)
                  and michaels.

                                 agent #2
                  yessir.

                                roberts
                  hamlet was a dane.

                                 agent #2
                  adane?

                                 roberts
                  forget it.

     roberts sits down in a chair facing torvalds.     he stares
     at him a moment, just smiling, then...

                                roberts
                  why would the number one cracker
                  in the world risk life
                  imprisonment to enter the
                  continental u.s.?

                                lawyer
                  my client has repeatedly reserved
                  his right not answer any questions
                  at this time.

     torvalds looks at roberts' badge and says something in
     finnish, the only recognizable word being "roberts." the
     attorney and torvalds both laugh. roberts looks at the
     attorney.

                                                       (continued)

                                                           24.

34   continued:    (2)                                           34

                                lawyer
                  he told me to tell mister roberts
                  that he is quite fond of 'the
                  x-files.'

     again they smile. roberts looks at the lawyer's cup of
     steaming coffee and with one finger pushes it over into
     the lawyer's lap.

                                roberts
                  you need another cup of coffee --

                                lawyer
                         (jumping up in
                          great pain)
                  goddammit!

     roberts grabs him by the collar and slams him into the
     wall, then pushes him out the door with a kick in the
     ass. he grabs the briefcase and tosses it out after him
     and locks the door.

     he turns on torvalds, smacking him across the face. he
     pushes him into the wall and holds his badge in front of
     him.

                                roberts
                  until a year ago i was head of the
                  largest task force on cyber-
                  criminals in the entire world.
                  but, i burned out. it happens. i
                  snapped. i shot a suspect in the
                  fucking hand. accident. do you
                  know how hard it is to work a
                  keyboard with one hand?

                                 torvalds
                  whatever you can do to me, he can
                  do worse. i'm already dead. the
                  only place i stand a chance is
                  back in my country. i have
                  friends there.

                                roberts
                  i tell you what, you tell me what
                  i want to know and i guarantee
                  you'll be on the next flight to
                  finland. first class. courtesy
                  of the u.s. government.

     torvalds thinks quietly.

                                                                25.
