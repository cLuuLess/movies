55   int. club - rest room - night                                    55

     stanley pushes into the bathroom.       he kicks the
     wastebasket across the room.

                                stanley
                  shit!

     he pushes a club kid out of the way of the sink. he
     turns on the water and washes his face. slowly he leans
     his forehead against the mirror. ginger appears behind
     him.

                                stanley
                  what are you looking at?

                                ginger
                  relax, stanley. you can do this.

                                                        (continued)

                                stanley
                  get away from me.

                                ginger
                  i want to help you.

                                stanley
                  help? help what, squeegee my
                  brain off the ceiling?

                                ginger
                  it was just a test, stan, you
                  passed.

     ginger pulls out a cigarette and a lighter from her
     plastic overcoat.

                                stanley
                  a test... i don't know why i let
                  you talk me into this. i can't
                  believe how desperate i am.

     she exhales toward stanley.

                                ginger
                  i thought you were here saving
                  your daughter, stanley.

     he turns around.

                                 stanley
                         (pissed)
                  look... i'd do anything to get
                  holly back. but, if i end up in a
                  box or back in jail, then i really
                  can't help her, can i? what i
                  should do, is take my money and go
                  back to court.

                                ginger
                  back to court? back to melissa's
                  gladiators? you throw a hundred
                  grand at her, she'll throw five
                  back at you. it's not about
                  holly, it's about beating you.
                  you know that. think, stanley.

                                stanley
                  what i'm thinking about is that
                  you're willing to put a gun to my
                  head to see if i can hack --

     suddenly three club kids come busting into the bathroom.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                      37.

     ginger interrupts him by slamming stan between the
     urinals and ramming her tongue into his mouth with the
     kind of wet, aggressive action that takes a movie from
     pg-13 to an r.

     when the kids realize that the urinals are occupied, they
     leave. slowly ginger takes her tongue out of stan's
     mouth. they look at each other. she smiles at him.

                                   ginger
                         (coyly)
                  sorry...

     a beat, for a moment there exists something between them,
     then bam, she's all business again.

                                ginger
                  so, let me sum it up for you,
                  stanley. you live in a trailer.
                         (beat)
                  you're a felon, working a dead-
                  end job. you want to get holly
                  back, gabriel's your only shot.


     angle on stanley

     as he realizes she's right, he's got nothing to lose.
     slam! he smacks the mirror with his fist, then walks out
     of the rest room. ginger slowly lifts the cigarette.
     she exhales, then slowly smiles. she's got him.
