167   ext. skyscraper roof - day                                       167

      sitting there on a helipad is an evil-looking, matte-
      black, explorer helicopter.

      gabriel and his men walk off the bus toward the waiting
      helicopter. gabriel turns back to stanley who is
      standing on the stairs of the bus.

      we hear the sound of hundreds of sirens approaching.

                              gabriel
                well, stanley, gotta fly. take
                care of that little girl. maybe
                i'll see you again one day.

                              stanley
                it can't end like this.     you can't
                get away.

                                                        (continued)

                                                                  104.

                                  gabriel
                    c'mon, stan. everything doesn't
                    always end the way you think it
                    will.
                           (beat, then)
                    'sides, audiences love happy
                    endings.

       gabriel strides away. we hear the whine of the explorer
       as it does its final power up for lift off.

       stanley looks around the bus futilely for some way to
       stop gabriel. stan can hear the cavalry about to arrive.
       the explorer slowly lifts upward.
