118   int. bank - day                                                118

      stanley is standing in the bank. three mercs in donna
      karen suits point modified m-16s at his head. he stares
      at the ground, shaking his head. gabriel tosses his
      frappacino against the wall.

                              gabriel
                get that son-of-a-bitch on the
                phone.

      gabriel walks towards the window, slinging his fn-fal,
      and pulling on his headset. a.d. joy answers.

                              gabriel
                if you need to test my resolve
                then god help you. you have 25
                minutes. that plane better be on
                the runway.

      he clicks off.    he turns to stan.

                              gabriel
                get my money, stanley.

                              stanley
                not until i see my daughter.

      gabriel snaps his fingers and a ballistic cloth duffel
      bag is thrown to gabriel. gabriel is very unhappy. he
      looks at stanley who is terrified of its contents.

                                                                88.

      back to stanley

      stanley almost can't bear to look.

      the giraffe.

      stanley's heart almost stops.    he sighs as gabriel tosses
      him the giraffe.

                                 gabriel
                   do you really think i wanted it to
                   come to this. do you? i am not a
                   psychopath, stanley, but i told
                   you, i will sacrifice as many
                   lives as it takes to protect our
                   country, including my own.
                          (beat)
                   now get me my money.

                                 stanley
                   will you let holly go once you
                   have the money?

                                gabriel
                   both of you. you have my word,
                   stanley. c'mon.

      they walk past a merc sitting at a desk, a laptop open in
      front of him.

      marco is paying very close attention to stan.
