                                gabriel
                  how you doing, stanley?

                                   stanley
                            (obviously not fine)
                  fine.

                                gabriel
                  something you need to say to me?

                                stanley
                         (freaked)
                  what the hell is going on here?

                                gabriel
                         (totally cool)
                  you know anything about harry
                  houdini?

     stan definitely doesn't get the point.

                                                        (continued)

                                                              67.

                                gabriel
                  he used to make an elephant
                  disappear in a theater full of
                  people. you know how he did it?

     gabriel unwraps a piece of gum --

                                  stanley
                  how?

     -- and sticks the piece in his mouth.

                                  gabriel
                  misdirection.

     gabriel whips right down a side street and drops the
     hammer. he blows through a stop sign, then another.
     cars crash. he is calm, cool, but continues to glance in
     his rearview mirror.

                                stanley
                  what are you doing?

                                gabriel
                  we have a tail.
                         (beat)
                  hope you had a light lunch, stan.

     gabriel slides left into an alley, gets it under control
     and screams toward the other side. a black suburban
     pulls up, closing off the alley. he slides to a stop and
     slams it into reverse. backwards at 60-plus miles per
     hour.

                                gabriel
                  hold the wheel.

     gabriel reaches in the passenger floorboard and pulls up
     a duffel bag. he unzips it, and withdraws what the
     marines call a saw -- a belgian-designed machine gun,
     compact but with 1500 rounds of swiss cheese action per
     minute, powerful enough for the u.s. to replace the m-60.

                                stanley
                  shit, it's blocked.

     gabriel looks behind them, another black suburban has
     blocked them in. the one from the other side and a third
     comes toward them down the alley.

                                gabriel
                  keep it straight.

                                                      (continued)

                                                                68.

     the speedometer needle is pegged at 0 as they scream
     backwards.

     gabriel unfolds the stock and then withdraws a 100-round
     box wrapped in white tape and printed with ap. he clips
     it and pulls back the bolt. he grabs the wheel from
     stan.

                                gabriel
                  it's just rough when you grow up
                  lovin' james bond movies. don't
                  worry, stanley, it'll be over soon.


     angle on lambo

     as the diablo slams backwards into the suburban at sixty
     mph. bam.

     gabriel unbuckles himself and stands up through the open
     roof and unloads full-auto into the suburban. the armor-
     piercing shells penetrate the armalite glass, ripping the
     occupants to shreds.

     gabriel turns, firing at the other suburban.

                                  gabriel
                  drive, drive!

     stanley slides under gabriel as gabriel steps into the
     passenger side. the wheels spin, the lambo is wedged
     under the suburban.

                                  gabriel
                  go, go!

     gabriel continues to blast full-auto, tearing the
     suburban to shrapnel.

                                  stanley
                  i am!

     finally the mortally wounded but still kicking
     lamborghini tears free of the suburban and rockets head- on
     toward the other. stanley drives like a maniac.

     gabriel rips it on full-auto, meatloafing the driver.
     the suburban veers into the wall. smack.

     stanley whips beside it and gabriel strafes down the
     side, opening it up. stan whips right onto a main
     street.

                                                        (continued)

                                                                69.

92   continued:    (3)                                                92

     more suburbans head at them. stan screams left into
     another alley. through the cross streets whipping by at
     100 mph, we see suburbans parallel to them.

     stan cranks his wheel right.

                                 stanley
                  shit!

                                gabriel
                         (changing out a clip)
                  keep your cool, stanley.

     the lambo rolls to a stop and gabriel hops out, running
     at the suburbans.

     after a moment of all-out gi joe-style blitzkrieg, it's
     over.

     gabriel walks to a body lying in the street.    he turns
     over the body and looks at the face.

                                 gabriel
                  goddamit.   i knew it.

     gabriel walks back to one of the burning suburbans where
     stanley stands.

                                gabriel
                  get in the fucking car, stanley.

                                stanley
                  i'm not going anywhere until you
                  tell me what's going on.

     gabriel pulls out his h&k, points it at stanley.

                                gabriel
                  you're on my good side and you
                  want to stay there. stanley, i
                  like you, but don't confuse
                  kindness with weakness. so, get
                  in the fuckin' car. i need my
                  hydra.
