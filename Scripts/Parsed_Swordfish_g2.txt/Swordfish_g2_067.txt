66   ext. sheer cliff - day                                         66

     we realize what stan did probably wasn't the smartest
     move in the world. the cliff is just barely on this side
     of 90 degrees and drops off about five hundred yards
     straight down to the pch.

     stan falls in slow motion about thirty feet before the
     cliff face angles out enough to break his fall. he begins
     a combination of sliding and tumbling down the bluff.
