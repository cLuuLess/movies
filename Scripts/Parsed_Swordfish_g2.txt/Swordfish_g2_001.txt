    int. starbucks coffee shop - morning

    three men sit at a window booth drinking coffee and
    talking. two of the men sit on one side of the table;
    stanley is in his early thirties, agent roberts, early
    forties. both wear suits, the younger's is fairly
    expensive and well cut, the other's is polyester, enough
    said. the man across, however, is quite different. he
    is what they used to call a "cool-cat."

                              gabriel (man)
                take dog day afternoon for
                example. arguably pacino's
                greatest performance, excepting
                the godfather, part i, and
                scarface, of course. a
                masterpiece of directing, easily
                lumet's best. the acting, the
                script, cinematography, all top
                notch. but, they didn't push the
                envelope. what if in dog day,
                sonny really wanted to get away
                with it? what if, and here's
                where it gets tricky. what if
                they'd started killing hostages?
                no mercy, no quarter, meet our
                demands or the cute blonde in the
                bell bottoms gets one in the back
                of the head, bam, splatter. what?
                still no bus?
                              (more)

                                                    (continued)

                                                              2.

                               gabriel (cont'd)
                 how many innocent victims would
                 they let get sprayed across the
                 windows before the city reversed
                 its policy on hostage situations?
                 and this was 1976. no c.n.n., no
                 c.n.b.c., no m.t.v. no internet.
                 fast forward to the present, same
                 situation. can you imagine the
                 feeding frenzy of the modern
                 media? in hours it would be the
                 top story from boston to budapest.
                 all caught in 150 millimeter zoom,
                 computer enhanced, and color
                 corrected. you would practically
                 taste the brain matter. six
                 hostages die. ten. twelve.
                 twenty. thirty. relentless. one
                 after another. all over a bus, a
                 plane, and a couple of million
                 dollars that were federally
                 insured.

    he sits, letting the pictures sink in, then:

                               gabriel
                 just a thought. i mean it's not
                 really within the realm of
                 conventional cinema, but what
                 if...?

                               roberts
                 you know, this movie of yours, i
                 don't think it would have worked.

                                gabriel
                 really?   how come?

                               roberts
                        (shrugs)
                 audiences love happy endings.

                               gabriel
                 pacino escapes. with the money.
                 boyfriend gets the sex change
                 operation. they live happily ever
                 after.

    stanley shakes his head.

                                gabriel
                 no?

                                                      (continued)

                                                             3.

                               stanley
                 no.

                               gabriel
                 homophobia?

    stanley shakes his head.

                               stanley
                 bad guy can't win. it's a
                 morality tale. one way or the
                 other, he's gotta go down.

                                gabriel
                 oh, well. life does tend to be
                 stranger than fiction.
                        (looking at watch)
                 well, guys, gotta jet. this place
                 is kinda dead.

    camera pans around the coffee shop. not a soul in the
    place. we continue to pan around 270 degrees to the
    front door, which is open. outside the open doorway are
    crouched a squad of heavily body-armored swat members,
    packed together, and aiming automatic weapons inside.


    angle on gabriel

                               gabriel
                 thanks for the coffee.

    he gets up. in his left hand, which has been hidden by
    the table until now, he is holding a strange-looking
    spring-loaded grip. gabriel is looking back at them.
    smiles.

                               gabriel
                 rene descartes is sitting in some
                 bar in paris. bartender says,
                 'hey, you want another drink?'
                 descartes says, 'i think not.'
                 and disappears.

    he smiles at his own joke, then turns and walks over to
    the front door.

                               gabriel
                 move.

    no one even twitches.

                               gabriel
                 i won't ask again.

                                                     (continued)

                                                             4.

    he lifts up the device in his left hand.


    angle on roberts

    who nods his head. the swat team moves back, letting
    gabriel out of the coffee shop.

                               gabriel
                 thank you.

    gabriel looks back at stan sitting in the booth.

                               gabriel
                 stanley... you coming?

    stan slides from the booth as gabriel exits the coffee
    shop --
