     two fbi agents (bad agents #1 & 2) watch the
     interrogation through a two-way mirror. one of the
     agents looks surprisingly like gabriel's merc that
     carried the young blonde girl killed outside the bank
     earlier.

               i'll tell you what i know.

     the agents look at each other.    bad agent #1 dials his
     cell phone.

               him as soon as possible. thank
               you.
