54   int. vip section - night                                          54

     stanley and ginger walk into a large area with individual
     private booths in small rooms around the perimeter. the
     rooms have the ability to be closed off by drawing huge,
     thick velvet drapes.

                                                       (continued)

                                                              30.

                                ginger
                  i wish you'd let me buy you a
                  suit.

                                stanley
                  i'm happy with what i'm wearing.

                                ginger
                  you have no self-esteem, stanley.

                                      stanley
                            (dryly)
                  i know.

     they walk into one of the booths in the back. sitting
     around a large, oval table is our antihero, gabriel
     shear, surrounded by a handful of his crew and a gaggle
     of beautiful model-types.

     ginger kisses gabriel and with a healthy exchange of
     fluids, then...

                                      ginger
                  miss me?

     gabriel smiles, then looks back at stanley.

                                ginger
                  gabriel, stanley. stanley,
                  gabriel.

     gabriel just stares.

                                gabriel
                         (very familiar)
                  big stan. nice suit.

                                      stanley
                  thanks.

                                gabriel
                  you know, they say it's the
                  clothes that make the man...

                                      stanley
                  you buy it?

                                gabriel
                  hope not.
                         (then)
                  buy you a drink?

                                                      (continued)

                                                               31.

                                stanley
                  i flew fifteen hundred miles for
                  this meeting, how 'bout we get to
                  the point.

                                gabriel
                  actually you flew 1500 miles for
                  100 grand. but that's not the
                  point.

     stanley sits down.    gabriel pours stan a glass of crown.

                                gabriel
                  i heard this story about this
                  young hacker who made a virus that
                  broke the f.b.i.'s carnivore
                  program that was actively reading
                  every subscriber's e-mail and
                  scrambled the systems. he did
                  what the federal judges wouldn't
                  do and kept the government out of
                  our privacy.

                                stanley
                  i think i heard that. story is he
                  went to jail and the federal
                  carnivore program is back in full
                  swing. it was a real tragedy.
                  what can i do for you?

     changing the subject.

                                gabriel
                  stanley, meet helga.

     gabriel smiles.

     the beautiful woman to stanley's right slides closer.

                                helga (woman)
                         (heavily accented)
                  hi, stanley.

     stanley looks at her, she's a knockout; artificially
     perfect. he looks back at gabriel.

                                stanley
                  look, i don't have a lot of
                  patience for this --

                                gabriel
                  stanley, we have a problem, maybe
                  you can help us out.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                 32.

     stan looks around; everyone is smiling.       helga moves
     closer to him.

                                gabriel
                  take a look at this.

     he is handed an open laptop, it glows. he sets it on the
     table and spins it around in front of stanley.

                                stanley
                         (like an alcoholic
                          faced with a fifth
                          of tequila)
                  you know i can't touch that.

     helga pours a shot of tequila.

                                helga
                  you like tequila, stanley?

     helga shoots the tequila, then turns to stanley, places
     her lips against his. the gold liquid drips from their
     lips as she spits it into stanley's mouth.

     he pushes her away, breaking the liplock, and swallowing
     the tequila. she licks it from his face.

                                gabriel
                  no need for modesty, we're all
                  friends here, stanley.

                                stanley
                  this is bullshit. i came --

                                gabriel
                  you want something from me, amigo,
                  i want something from you. d.o.d.
                  dbase, 128 bit r.s.a. encryption.
                  whattaya think? impossible?

     stanley's having a little trouble concentrating on
     gabriel.

                                stanley
                  nothing's impossible.

     helga begins sucking on stanley's fingers.      he pulls them
     away.

                                gabriel
                  so it can be done? maybe slide in
                  a trojan horse hiding a worm?

                                                        (continued)

                                                              33.

                                stanley
                  something like that. is this an
                  interview?

                                gabriel
                  sort of. marco, let's give him
                  some incentive.

     the drapes close. two of gabriel's crew step out. marco
     yanks out a .40 caliber glock and quickly screws a well-
     used silencer onto the end. marco walks around behind
     stanley.

                                stanley
                         (now totally confused)
                  what are you doing?

     helga smiles, then drops her head into stanley's lap.    we
     hear his pants unzip.

                                gabriel
                  relax, stanley.

     he has to go with it.

                                 gabriel
                  i've been told the best crackers
                  in the world could do this in
                  sixty minutes. unfortunately,
                  i need someone who can do it in
                  sixty seconds.

                                stanley
                  you're kidding...

                                gabriel
                  'fraid not.

     stan realizes now no one is smiling.    he grabs the blonde
     by the hair but can't pull her up.

                                gabriel
                  forty-five seconds. time is a
                  wasting, big guy.

     the silencer is pressed into the back of his head.
     stanley tries to focus on the screen. stanley sucks air
     through his teeth, trying to focus.

                                gabriel
                  you have thirty seconds, stanley.

                                                      (continued)

                                                                  34.

     stanley gives up on trying to get her up and his hands
     start flying over the keyboard. we intercut the action
     with a closeup of stanley's hands working the keyboard,
     and a closeup of gabriel, and a closeup of the lcd screen
     which reads in flashing red letters --

     "access denied."

                                gabriel
                  she's very good, isn't she,
                  stanley?

     tension builds as stanley continues to work the keyboard.

     "access denied."

                                gabriel
                  c'mon, stanley. 20 seconds.

     "access denied."

                                   gabriel
                  fifteen.

     "access denied."

                                   gabriel
                  ten... nine...

     faster and faster.       "access denied."

                                gabriel
                  three... two...

     "access denied."

     he grabs her head.       she doesn't come up.   the screen
     flashes:

     "access denied."

                                gabriel
                  too bad, stanley. ya gotta die.

     marco puts the silencer to his eye.

                                   stanley
                  wait... !

     click. the gun is empty. stanley tries to catch his
     breath. helga lifts up her head. everyone laughs.
     gabriel walks around the table.

                  i was just fucking with you,
                  stan.

     stanley is pissed. helga, smiling, kisses him on the
     cheek. stanley tries to calm down. he gets up, shoots
     someone's half-drank drink, zips his pants, then --

                                stanley
                  so was i.

     stanley hits the enter key and spins the computer around.


     closeup - computer screen

     "access granted" appears, and the department of defense
     logo scrolls across the screen.

     stanley gives them all a "fuck you" smile, then stomps
     out through the curtain.
