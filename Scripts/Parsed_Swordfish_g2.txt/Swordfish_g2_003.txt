    the interior of the bank looks like new orleans on fat
    tuesday. three hummers sit in the middle of the floor,
    surrounded by broken glass. between them rests a bright
    red ferrari f50 (gabriel's).

    all but one of the front windows of the bank, the one
    with the door in it, has been welded over with 3/4 inch
    plate steel.

    over two dozen hostages lie face down on the floor, arms
    cable-tied behind their backs. something has been duct-
    taped around their chests and each is wearing what
    appears to be a dog collar.

    the other occupants of the room are nine men. all of
    whom would look as if they were attending the fashion
    event of the year were it not for the automatic weapons
    each one carries.

                 how we doin'?

    one of the armed men finishes putting a collar on a
    young, normally good-looking-but-now-covered-in-mascara,
    whimpering blonde girl.

                 good.   take her out.

    the front door opens and one of the suited men drags out
    the pretty blonde from earlier. she is sobbing and is in
    such grief she can't even walk.
