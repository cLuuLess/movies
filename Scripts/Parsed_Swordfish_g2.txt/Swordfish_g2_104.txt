109   ext. street (somewhere in santa monica) - morning           109

      a red ferrari f50 whips around the corner at light speed,
      screams down the street toward us and screeches to a halt
      outside the bank. it shifts into reverse and slowly
      backs over the curb and into the bank.

      a huge armored bus rolls down the street, through two
      parked cars, and up onto the sidewalk, effectively
      sealing off the front of the glass bank. mercs begin
      welding metal plates around the armored bus. we hear the
      approaching sirens of a fleet of cop cars.

                                                                86.
