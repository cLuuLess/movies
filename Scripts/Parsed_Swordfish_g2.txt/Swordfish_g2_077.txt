     as he talks, we track down an old, concrete stairwell and
     down a long, dank hallway.

                  my senior year at m.i.t., i
                  created the source code for the
                  worm that i've been using for
                  years.

     we track around a corner.

                                stanley (v.o.)
                  in the basement and through a file
                  room is the only p.d.p.-10 still
                  active and on the internet,
                  although only a few people know
                  this. it's an i.t.s. machine and
                  kept online just for historical
                  sake. i hid my worm inside it
                  where no one would ever think to
                  look.

     we dolly into a closeup on a large, ominous, dark
     mainframe.

     angle on stan

     who turns around, a cocky grin on his face, like a proud
     parent, she smiles at him.

     gabriel walks in.

                                stanley
                  now i just have to modify the
                  code.

                                ginger
                  he's fucking amazing.

                                gabriel
                  yes he is.

     she runs her hand affectionately across the side of his
     head and walks out.

                                gabriel
                  i see you have a groupie.

                                stanley
                         (ignoring that)
                  you know, it'd be a lot simpler if
                  you would tell me exactly what the
                  hydra is going to be used for?

     push in on gabriel as he thinks about it.
