     stanley is working at his terminal.

                              ginger
               stanley?   you alright?

                             stanley
               what do you think? i just watched
               that maniac murder ten men in the
               street. i'm just fucking great.
               it doesn't matter if i get my
               daughter back if i'm dead. even
               if i do survive this, who's gonna
               keep me out of jail? you?

     she walks over to him and kneels down, places her hand on
     his leg, looks up at him.

                             ginger
               i won't let anything happen to
               you, stanley. you have to trust
               me.

                             stanley
               trust you? two hours ago i
               found out you're d.e.a. the
               feds are crawling up my ass and
               there's a dead body in the
               basement that looks just like
               gabriel.

     she doesn't move.

                             ginger
               stanley, if we don't find out who
               he's working for then we're just
               going to have to do this all over
               again.

                             stanley
               your little slush fund is not my
               problem. i'm pulling the plug on
               this rodeo. roberts may be an
               asshole, but he is definitely the
               lesser of the two evils.

                             ginger
               i've been working on this thing
               for eight months, and i will not
               let some jarhead fed fuck up my
               operation. please, i know what
               i'm doing.

                                ginger
                  c'mon, stanley. you have twelve
                  hours. do what he wants. finish
                  the worm.

                                stanley
                  you're starting to sound just like
                  him.

     they look at each other.    stanley turns toward the
     computer screens.
                                                       fade to black.
