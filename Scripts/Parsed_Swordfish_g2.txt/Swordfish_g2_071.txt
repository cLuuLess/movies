70   int. gabriel's house - ginger's room - day                        70

     ginger walks in and closes the door. she walks over to
     the dresser and takes off her earrings. then she reaches
     under her dress and unvelcros the modified 10mm. glock
     and its thigh holster, dropping it on the dresser. she
     then pulls off the hip, little designer dress she is
     wearing, revealing the fact that she is wearing a tiny
     transmitting receiver taped between her breasts.

     she stares at herself in the mirror for a moment, then
     slowly starts to untape the bug.

                                stanley (o.s.)
                  i have to hand it to you, ginger.
                  you look good wearing anything.
                  even a wire.

     ginger grabs her glock and spins around, the holster
     dropping away with the touch of a button.

     she levels it on the dark corner of the room where
     stanley sits waiting, drinking a bottle of gabriel's
     expensive wine.

                                stanley
                  you gonna kill me?

                                                       (continued)

                                                                55.

                                ginger
                  i'm thinking.
                         (beat)
                  what are you doing here, stanley?

                                stanley
                  i should probably ask you the same
                  question.

     he leans forward into the light.

                                ginger
                  what happened to you?

                                stanley
                  little accident.
                         (tossing her
                          her keys)
                  sorry about your car. i've had a
                  pretty shitty day so far. looks
                  like it just got worse.
                         (beat)
                  who are you, ginger?

                                ginger
                  i can't tell you.

                                stanley
                         (incredulous)
                  you can't tell me? well, that's
                  just fuckin' peachy.

                                ginger
                  think, stanley.

                                stanley
                         (loudly)
                  who are you?

                                   ginger
                  he'll kill me.
