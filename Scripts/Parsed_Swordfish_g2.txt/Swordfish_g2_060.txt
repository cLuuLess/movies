59   int. gabriel's living room - night                              59

     stanley and gabriel stand in gabriel's primo designed
     pad, staring at an array of supercomputers.

     stanley stands in front of the six huge flat panels,
     linked together, in complete awe.

                                gabriel
                  pretty impressive, huh.
                         (beat)
                  so...

                                  stanley
                  so?

                                                       (continued)

                                                             42.

                                gabriel
                  here's the deal. i need a worm,
                  stanley. a hydra, actually. a
                  multi-headed worm to break an
                  encryption and then sniff out
                  latent digital footprints
                  throughout an encrypted network.

                                stanley
                  what kind of cypher?

                                gabriel
                  vernam encryption.

                                stanley
                  a vernam's impossible. its key
                  code is destroyed upon
                  implementation. not to mention
                  being a true 128 bit encryption.

                                gabriel
                  actually, we're talking 512 bit.

                                stanley
                  it's impossible.

                                gabriel
                  tell ya what, i'll pay you ten
                  million dollars. that should be
                  enough to get your daughter back...
                         (beat)
                  ... unless of course it's impossible.

     stan thinks about it.

                                stanley
                  nothing's impossible.

     they shake hands and gabriel heads toward the back of the
     house.


     long shot - gabriel

     walking up the stairs toward his room.

     stan looks over to see ginger staring at him.

                                stanley
                  what?

     ginger pulls herself up on the desk, spreading her legs
     on either side of the keyboard.

                                                     (continued)

                                 ginger
                  c'mon, stan.   let's get to work.

     she turns on the computers.     he backs away.

                                ginger
                  it won't bite you, i promise.

                                stanley
                  i don't know. it's gonna be
                  pretty hard without a gun to my
                  head.

     she reaches out and pulls him to her.

                                ginger
                  well, let's put a gun to your
                  head.

     she kisses him and slowly he responds.       she smiles.

                                ginger
                  tell me about your worm, stanley.

     they kiss.

                                ginger
                  you surprised that a girl with
                  real breasts and an i.q. over 70
                  can give you a hard-on?

     stan shakes his head.

                                stanley
                  i thought you were gabriel's.

     she looks at him a moment. she smiles at him and slowly
     bends forward to whisper in his ear.

     at stanley's ear.

                                ginger
                         (very slowly)
                  i am not what you think i am.


     angle on ginger and stanley

     as she leans back. she stares at him a moment then
     slides off the desk.

                                                        (continued)

                                 ginger
                  you're a smart guy, stanley.    you
                  figure me out.

     she hands him the bottle of expensive wine she's been
     drinking, and then grabbing stan by the belt-buckle,
     pulls him casually behind her toward the pool house.

                                                        fade to black.
