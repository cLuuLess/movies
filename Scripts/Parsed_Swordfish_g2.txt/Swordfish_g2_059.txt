58   ext. gabriel's house - pool - night                              58

     the house is at the very top of the hills and the pool
     hangs off the side of the cliff, way below the house.

     the outer edge appears nonexistent, like the water hangs
     frozen in air.

     a very hip but very nasty soiree is in progress.    more
     ibiza than hollywood hills.

     stanley sits in a chair beside a pool containing a half-
     dozen beautiful un-clad model-types.

     gabriel is mingling through the crowd.

     stanley stares off into the glittering lights of l.a.
     widen.

                             gabriel
                      (smiles)
               so stan, tell me. how'd you do
               it?

                             stanley
               do what?

                             gabriel
               break the code. at the club.
               you broke the entire encryption, a
               silencer against your eye and your
               cock in someone's mouth, all in
               less than sixty seconds. how?

                             stanley
               i used a logic bomb, dropped it
               through the trap door --

                             ginger
               no, you didn't. you didn't have
               time.

                             gabriel
               c'mon, you can do better than
               that. how'd you do it?

                             stanley
               i used a password sniffer.

     gabriel glances at ginger who shakes her head.

                             ginger
               uh uh.

                                                      (continued)

                                                               41.

58   continued:                                                      58

                                  stanley
                  yes, i did --

                                gabriel
                  c'mon, stanley. how'd-you-do-it?

                                stanley
                  i don't know exactly. i see the
                  numbers. in my head. all my
                  life. i don't answer equations, i
                  just see the answers. same with
                  code. i can't explain ---

     ginger eases over to where stan is sitting. she runs her
     hands across his shoulders as she moves around him,
     dancing to the music.

                                ginger
                  mozart always said he didn't write
                  music; he just wrote down what he
                  heard in his head. so did
                  faulkner, just with words.

                                gabriel
                         (drinking wine)
                  you definitely have a gift, stan.
                  the most powerful people on the
                  planet are like you. with a laptop
                  and a phone line you can make god
                  look like a thirteen-year-old
                  with a stack of playboys and a
                  lack of imagination.
                         (beat)
                  c'mere, stan, let me show you
                  something.
