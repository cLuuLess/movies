ext.  wide street - night

silence...

the cacique is poised on all fours, every muscle tensed.

a band of about twenty hemocytes are with him.  they are
stalking something.

the cacique leads them as they move forward like a pack of
predatory lions, inch by inch, almost imperceptible movement,
their eyes burning toward the prey.

a band of wild horses is slowly meandering down the street.

in a flash -- the hemocytes attack -- the horses stampede in
panic -- exactly like a herd of gazelle being chased by a
pack of lions --

a terrifying flash of the hemocytes' speed and agility as
they sprint alongside the horses at incredible speed --
occasionally striking at a slower or vulnerable horse.

an orgy of violence as the hemocytes feast on the blood and
flesh of the horses -- some still alive --

the cacique buries himself in the carcass of a horse in a
feeding frenzy --

another hemocyte crouches and watches him feed.  beneath its
bedouin wrappings we note a antique silver locket hanging
around its neck.  this is not completely bizarre as many of
the hemocytes have odd personal tokens or ornamentations on
them.

at last the hemocyte with the locket slowly creeps forward on
all fours -- wary -- and buries itself in the carcass
alongside the cacique --

the cacique snarls and swats the hemocyte away brutally -- it
flies away and bounces up --

it squats for a moment, its head tilting back and forth,
gazing at the kill.

again it creeps forward -- only now with its head down, eyes
averted, very submissive -- this time the cacique shifts away
slightly and allows it to feed next to him.
