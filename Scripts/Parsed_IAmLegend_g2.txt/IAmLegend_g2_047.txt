int./ ext.  neville's house - day

now dressed in casual clothes, neville attends to his needs.

he sweeps through the living room and presses a button on his
stereo.

"life during wartime" (live, 1983 version) by the talking
heads plays as we see:

--  neville goes to his medical facility:  a bedroom he has
    given over to any emergency medical needs he might have.
    medical books line the shelves of the room.  a
    refrigerator sits in a corner, attached to a humming gas
    generator and a solar power battery system.  he plucks a
    bottle of iodine from a shelf and begins sterilizing some
    of his cuts and bruises.

--  he checks his huge los angeles map in the kitchen and
    makes some marks on the plastic with a grease pencil.  he
    has "safe house" written at the location of the downtown
    apartment building.  he crosses the words out.

--  he goes outside to the huge backyard of his estate and
    tosses down some feed for his chickens.

--  he checks his vegetable garden.  nothing much growing now
    but he gently tests the soil for watering.  okay for now.

--  he wanders through an orchard of fruit trees and checks
    the progress of his oranges and apples.  he plucks off an
    apple and munches on it as he proceeds.

"life during wartime" pauses for a moment as he goes into his
garage...
