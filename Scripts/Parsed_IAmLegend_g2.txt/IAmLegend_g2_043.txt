ext.  rover - street - night

meanwhile, the feral dogs are still tearing at the deer
carcass on the disabled rover.  they snarl and fight for any
remaining scraps.

then they stop, suddenly alert, ears erect.

they glare into the darkness.  something is there, vague
shapes, shifting and moving.

the dogs are nervous.  they are crouching, tails down, heads
swiveling, sniffing the air.

the predators are now the prey.

a huge alpha-male dog stands on the hood of the rover and
peers into the darkness.  the forms around the dog are
circling.

the forms stop circling.  a tense beat...

then the alpha-male slowly lowers his eyes, submissive
behavior.  he yelps, leaps off the rover and races away into
the night.  all the other dogs follow, fleeing in panic.

one of the figures moves to the rover.  it is the leader of
this band of creatures we saw in the ambassador hotel
ballroom.

he looks at the rover and then raises his head, as if
sniffing the air.  his head tilting back and forth.  he
stops.  then he emits a high-pitched call and the creatures
immediately take off --

they run in the direction neville had escaped -- they run
incredibly quickly -- long effortless strides -- the elegant
grace of panthers --

the high-pitched call continues as they run and --

suddenly, a large flock of starlings sweeps like a cloud
above them and zooms into the night.
