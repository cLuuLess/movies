ext.  desert - day

we are floating inches over a sea of sand, over an arid
desert landscape...

credits as we continue to slowly float over the sand -- we
pass a side-winder rattlesnake undulating across the desert
-- we pass cacti and desert shrubs blooming with flowers...

as the credits continue and we continue to float slowly over
the desert we become aware of a sound...

distant, barely audible at first...

it sounds like bursts of radio static and something like
words -- the rhythms and cadences of speech but strange and
repetitive -- we cannot make out the speaker -- we cannot
make out the words -- just the static and the steady,
monotonous echo of something like language...

we finally stop floating and focus on a pair of scorpions
locked in mortal combat, their claws are fastened together in
the death struggle.  when fighting, scorpions will often stay
locked together like this, frozen, for hours.

end credits.
