int.  neville's house - living room - day

neville enters the living room.  emma follows.

the blinds are open on the enormous picture windows
overlooking the city and the sun streams in.

we see what she does -- blinding light -- overexposed, almost
painfully shining hues.

she shields her eyes from the light.

                     neville
          are you all right?

                     emma
          yes.

                     neville
          do you want to go on?

she ignores him and walks across the room toward the window.
a shaft of sunlight burns across the room.

she stops before the shaft of sunlight.  she looks at it
through half-closed eyes -- we see burning light and heat.

then she slowly reaches out...

her hand touches the sunbeam.  the flesh on her hand begins
to go through a metamorphoses.  the pigmentation begins to
discolor, but not as quickly or as violently as it did with
the cacique earlier.

she holds her hand in the light for a moment.  a flood of
unexpected memories wash over her, kinesthetic responses to
the sun.  we see strange, disjointed flashes of picnics and
the beach and happy people playing in the sun --

she pulls her hand away from the sun.

a pause.  she does not look at him.  for the first time, we
see a tiny flash of vulnerability.

                     emma
               (quietly)
          it's so... warm.  i forgot that.

he closes the blinds as:

                     neville
          how much do you remember?

                     emma
               (looking around the room)
          it comes back.  flashes.  my name.

she wanders around the darkened living room, looking closely
at all the artifacts from the old world.  they are at once
mysterious and familiar.

she continues around the room, fascinated by what she sees.
not paying much attention to him:

                     neville
          do you remember where you lived?

                     emma
          it was warm.  i was outside.  the
          ocean?

                     neville
          what about... now?

                     emma
          with them?

                     neville
          yes.

                     emma
          we move.  place to place.

she picks up a cd case, turns it in her hand, sets it down
and continues to explore.

                     neville
          when you're here, in the city, where
          do you live?

                     emma
          dark and large.  with vines -- no,
          not vines.  not alive.

she stops before the framed picture of virginia.

                     emma
          who is this?

                     neville
          my wife.

emma looks at the picture closely.

                     emma
          was this -- "beautiful?"  before?

                     neville
          yes.

she nods tersely and continues to walk around the room,
looking at things.

                     neville
          do you remember where it is?

                     emma
          what?

                     neville
          where you lived with them.

she stops, turns to him.

                     emma
          why?

he does not respond.

                     emma
          you want to find them.

                     neville
          yes.

                     emma
          you want to kill them.

he does not respond.

                     emma
          why don't you start with me?

                     neville
          you're not them.

a beat.  she stares at him, defiant.

                     emma
          open a vein and let me feed -- then
          tell me what i am.
