int.  neville's house - garage - day

he stands before four large vehicles covered in tarps,
munching the apple.

he pulls the tarp off the first vehicle.  it is another range
rover, identical to the other but not customized.

all the vehicles he looks at are up on blocks awaiting his
ministrations.

he looks at the rover.  nope.

he moves to the second vehicle.  he pulls off the tarp.  it
is a toyota land cruiser.

nope.

he moves to the third vehicle.  he pulls off the tarp.  it is
a gorgeous, classic bentley.

he shakes his head with a smile.

                     neville
          robert, what were you thinking...?

nope.

he moves to the final vehicle and pulls off the tarp.  it is
a hummer.  beautiful and black and invulnerable.

he looks at the hummer and slowly smiles.

"life during wartime" explodes again as he prepares the
hummer:

--  he checks a fresh battery on a voltage meter and then
    installs it.

--  he inserts new spark plugs.

--  he fills the oil.

--  he carefully checks and then puts on the tires.

--  he checks all the gas and fluid lines and then fills the
    hummer with gas and coolant.  he has clearly become quite
    an expert on auto maintenance.

--  then the fun begins.  he slides on a welding helmet and
    begins welding his "extras" to the hummer:  crash bars,
    metal grill work and a gun rack.  as well as clamps to
    hold his extra jerry cans of gasoline and spare tires.
    he enjoys all of this very much.

--  he hooks on the jerry cans and spare tires.  he fastens
    his hunting rifle inside.

finally he lowers the hummer and it waits.  a moving
fortress.

"life during wartime" ends.

neville gazes at the hummer, delighted.

but he has forgotten one thing.  the final and most important
touch.  he reaches into the hummer and slides virginia's
picture onto the sun visor.
