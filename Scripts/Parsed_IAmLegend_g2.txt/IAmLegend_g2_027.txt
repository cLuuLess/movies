int.  rover - street - day

he drives for a bit, scanning left and right for anything
promising.

then he sees something.  he suddenly jams on his brakes and
the rover screeches to a halt.  he backs up quickly and grabs
his machine gun.  he stops the rover and aims the gun out the
window.  we have no idea what he is aiming at.

he squeezes off a short burst from his machine gun -- a toy
store window shatters -- he is blasting a huge stuffed,
annoying, smiley barney dinosaur to bits.  he smiles and
grabs a marker and draws another hatch mark above his head.

he continues on his way, whistling the mind-numbing barney
theme song.
