int.  neville's house - racquet ball court - above - night

the hemocyte is wild.  as if going through some terrible drug
withdrawal.  it prowls the racquet ball court and quivers and
shakes.

neville, his forearm now bandaged in gauze, watches from the
observation area above as it stalks the court.  he
occasionally takes a sip from the vodka bottle.

it finally senses him and spins into a ferocious leap to get
at him -- its talons reach up and it batters itself in the
attempts -- it can jump an unnaturally long way, but not far
enough -- it growls and howls in frustration.

neville watches as the hemocyte stalks the court.

he takes a swig of vodka and leaves.
