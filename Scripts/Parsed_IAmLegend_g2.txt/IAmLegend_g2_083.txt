int.  neville's house - racquet ball court - day

neville hands the plastic container of blood to her.

she is now dressed, somewhat haphazardly, in the bathrobe.
she takes the blood very calmly.  there is almost a trace of
sadness, or shame in her eyes as she turns away and drinks.

she always turns away from him to feed.

the mutation is almost complete.  she is as human looking as
she will ever be:  no hair, unusual albino-like skin.  we can
still see the hints and shadows of blue veins around the
corners of her face.  in a way, she is beautiful.  sleek,
tall and limber.

she hands the container back to him.

he is about to leave when she makes a sharp sound.  he stops.

she very slowly moves to him.  he is cautious but stands
without moving a muscle.

she slowly reaches toward him -- he does not move.  she
gently feels along the contours of his face with her talon-
like nails.

his demonstration of trust is extraordinary as her nails
trace along his skin.

her expression is absolutely neutral.
