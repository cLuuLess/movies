int.  motel room - desert - day

rainfall.  violent and unrelenting.

the rain pounds a fearsome rhythm on the windows of a motel
room.

robert neville is on the phone, pacing, waiting.  tense.

neville is a fit, handsome and methodical man.  he is also,
as we shall see, a very resourceful man.

as he paces we see he is in a clean motel room, a breakfast
tray is on a table.  we see a briefcase open on the desk next
to long plastic tubes for blueprints.

finally:

                     neville
               (on phone)
          yes, dr. madden this is robert
          neville, i... i understand that...
          my wife, virginia neville is...
          yes...
               (a flash of concern
                crosses his face)
          ... i'll be there in the morning.

he hangs up.

he hesitates for a moment, unsure of exactly what to do next.

then he grabs his briefcase and blueprint tubes and goes.
