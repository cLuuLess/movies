ext.  safe house - street - night

neville runs around a corner to a street of apartment
buildings.  he is covered in sweat, panting.

he goes to a particular apartment building, goes to a side
door, a service entrance.

neville hauls some debris from around the door then quickly
checks around the door frame.  a thin layer of grease and
dust has been applied, it has not been disturbed.  he pulls a
key from his body suit and unlocks the door.  he goes inside
and then, from the inside, pulls the debris against the door
again and pulls it shut.  he locks it from the inside now...
