int.  neville's house - kitchen/living room - night

neville is in his kitchen, cutting up some vegetables for
dinner.

he stops cutting and just stands.  he has not been this
lonely for years.  having the hemocyte woman so close and yet
so far is terrible.

then he hears a strange whispering sound.  ghostly.

he quickly goes into the living room and dims the lights.  he
steps to the windows and stares into the darkness --

he leaps back in shock --

the picture windows are covered with thousands upon thousands
of the starlings fluttering against the glass.

he can barely see anything through the fluttering mass of
birds.  a shifting cloak of frenzied black feathers.

the starlings are not attacking the house exactly.  it is
more as if they are scouting, looking, trying to find a way
in.  reconnaissance.

and then -- as if some silent signal were given -- the
starlings are suddenly gone, sweeping away in a great, black
cloud.

neville stands for a moment... stunned.
