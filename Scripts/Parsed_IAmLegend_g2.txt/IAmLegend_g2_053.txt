ext.  neville's house - terrace - day

unusually threatening black storm clouds are gathering over
the city.

neville, now dressed in one of the black body suits, is on
the terrace outside his living room.

on the terrace he has a series of military telescopes of
various dimensions.  he is peering through the largest.

we see the view through the telescope as he focuses, digital
range-finding numbers snap along the edge of his view.

he scans the city.  finally settling on the tallest building
downtown, the (fictional) branson building.
