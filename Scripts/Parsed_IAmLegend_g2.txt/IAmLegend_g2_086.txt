int.  neville's house - racquet ball court - day

the hemocyte woman is standing in a corner, waiting for him.

he unlocks the door and enters.

                     hemocyte woman
          my -- name --

neville freezes, stunned.

she struggles for more words.

                     hemocyte woman
          is -- emma.

the words came out oddly and strained, but intelligible.  she
braces herself and tries again.

                     emma
          my name -- is -- emma.

a pause.

                     neville
          my name is robert.

a beat.

then he slowly and carefully extends a hand, offering a
handshake, offering contact.

                     neville
          robert.

she does not take his hand.

a beat.  he withdraws his hand.

she looks down at the container of blood.  he hands it to
her.

she takes the container from him and turns her back, quickly
draining the blood.

her back remains turned to him as:

                     emma
          you -- think i am -- i'm --
               (she shakes her head
                violently)
          -- an animal.

                     neville
          no.

she turns to him, defiant.

                     emma
          you lie -- like a human.

appropriate music over a quick sequence as we see emma
practicing speaking with neville:

--  they never leave the court.  she stalks around like a
    caged tigress.

--  she now interacts with the things he has put in the court
    as they talk.  speech is coming back to her in a great
    wave.

--  then neville paces as she sits, he is excited to be
    speaking again after so long.

--  they converse continually.  her speech rapidly improving.

--  day passes to night.  the glow of the sun on the tarp-
    covered skylight disappears.  night passes to day.  the
    sun glows on the tarp above again.

--  although we do not hear a word we sense it is not a
    particularly pacific conversation.  she is continually
    defiant and occasionally angry.

--  tension is the clear undertone and tenor of their
    conversations.

the sequence ends as we burst into mid-scene:

emma's speech is almost human, though she still has to fight
for occasional words or thoughts.  her speech patterns and
cadences are still somewhat strained and unusual.

she paces back and forth:

                     emma
          i can't live like you do -- all your
          machines and -- cold metal and sharp
          corners --

                     neville
          you lived like this once.

                     emma
               (angrily)
          that is not now, human!

                     neville
          my name is robert.

she physically brushes aside the name as she stalks past.

                     neville
               (grumbles)
          great, i finally find someone to
          talk to and all you want to do it
          argue.

the concept of humor is totally alien to her.

                     emma
          it is not arguing to speak the
          truth.

                     neville
          listen to me, my blood somehow...
          helped you.  it could help all of
          you.  we could find some way to --

she stops.  looks at him.

                     emma
          to become human?  is that what you
          think we want?

a beat.

                     emma
          look how you live.  you -- fight --
          for warmth and meat and light.  you
          fight through every day in this
          place that has moved past you.  it
          is a place for us now.

a tense beat.

a stand off.

then:

                     neville
          would you like to see the sunlight?

she looks at him.
