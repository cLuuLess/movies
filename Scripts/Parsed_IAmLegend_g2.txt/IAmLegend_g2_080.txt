int.  neville's house - racquet ball court - night

neville sits right outside the court at the plexiglass wall,
watching the hemocyte.

he has dimmed the lights for her comfort.

the hemocyte woman is crouched in a darkened far corner,
watching him.  she is quiet.  the terrible fits are over for
a moment.

across the court the blood pouch is now empty, by now she has
drained it.

he watches with fascination as she stands and slowly moves
toward him, her eyes averted.  very cautious.

then she swiftly crouches right against the glass, her back
to him, but near.  a demonstration of trust?

on an impulse he reaches into a pocket and removes his zippo.

he lights it.  she turns.  face to face.  inches away, only
separated by the plexiglass.

a stunning moment of realization.

her eyes are now much closer to human than traditional
hemocyte feline.

he carefully eases up the dimmer on the court lights.

she does not seem unduly uncomfortable in the light.

he stares at her in amazement.

the translucent patina covering her veins, arteries and
muscles is congealing a bit.  it is forming into some sort of
skin, a pigmentation making her easier to look at, less
monstrous.

his blood is triggering some chemical/biological mutation.
she is becoming something more human.
