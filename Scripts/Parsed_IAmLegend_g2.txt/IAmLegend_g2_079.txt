int.  neville's house - racquet ball court - above - day

it is as if the hemocyte woman were burning alive from the
inside.  she writhes and twists around the court in some sort
of violent seizure.  she slams into walls and into the
plexiglass door in a grotesque and unnatural way, her whole
body vibrating.

she has seemingly no control over the fire burning inside her
body.

it is agonizing to witness.

neville watches from above with concern.

the hemocyte woman is letting out a frightful sound -- an
inarticulate moan punctuated by savage howls -- a jumble of
sounds -- almost like words -- she snaps her jaw as if
fighting with them -- her throat muscles work crazily.

and there is something different about her.

her movements are somehow less hemocyte -- less feline or
insect-like -- they are somehow more human.  the rhythmic
head tilting and unnatural gaping jaw movement are almost
gone.

and her "skin" is glistening as if a patina of sweat or
translucent material was covering her.

neville runs to his medical room and grabs a pouch of blood
from the fridge.  he races back to the observation deck and
tosses the blood down into the court.

the hemocyte woman leaps on it and tears it open -- she turns
her back and begins drinking the blood eagerly -- but then
she suddenly flings it away from her and retreats to a corner
of the court -- the moaning and strange transmutation
continuing.

the blood pouch remains, unfinished.

neville stares at the blood pouch.  his blood is doing this.
it is hurting her.  it is changing her.
