int.  bank - day

he glances around, dust and desolation.  he passes the
tellers' counters, desks and offices without a glance and
immediately heads down an inactive escalator in the center of
the bank.

as he descends he snaps on the flashlight affixed to his
machine gun.  the escalator leads down to the underground
vault and hallways.

he steps from the escalator and is wading through debris,
mostly paper, as he casts the beam from his machine gun light
around him.  he completely ignores the open vault and finds a
door marked "maintenance."  he opens the door and checks
inside, smiles.

inside is a shelf full of light bulbs.  he takes an armful of
light bulbs and wades out through the debris.

only then do we realize that the paper he has been wading
through is millions and millions of dollars -- a sea of cash.
