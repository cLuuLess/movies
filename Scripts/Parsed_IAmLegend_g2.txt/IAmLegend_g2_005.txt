ext.  gas station - desert - night

the downpour continues as neville pulls into a small gas
station by the highway.

huge floodlights illuminate the station with an eerie
blue/white, making it a lonely oasis in the pitch black.

absolute emptiness in the black desert around the station.

neville climbs from the jeep as an old man emerges from the
station and goes to him.

                     old man
          need some gas?

                     neville
          please.

                     old man
          only got one kind.

                     neville
          that's fine.

neville stands by the jeep as the old man begins pumping the
gas.

a beat.

                     neville
          hell of a night.

                     old man
               (smiles vaguely)
          you got that right.

there is something odd about this old man, an ephemeral
something, something neville can't quite put his finger on.
something strange.  perhaps something in the eyes.

the only immediately unusual thing about him is that he is
very, very pale.  his skin is white in the harsh floodlights.

                     old man
          so, what do you do?

                     neville
          i'm am architect.  i'm working on a
          site back in --

                     old man
          you built things.

                     neville
          i guess you could say that.

the old man is watching him, rather intently, as he pumps the
gas.

the old man's stare is making neville just a tad
uncomfortable.

                     neville
          bathroom?

                     old man
          round back.

neville goes.

we linger on the old man for a moment.

a drop of rain water trickles down his forehead, over his
eyebrow and straight down across his eye.  he does not blink.

perhaps it is only a glass eye.

perhaps it is something infinitely more peculiar.
