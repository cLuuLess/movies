int.  the neville home - bedroom - night

virginia is sleeping.  her breathing is labored.

a dinner tray lies untouched on the bed.

on the night stand we note a hand-held tape recorder and a
collection of cassette tapes.

neville enters and watches virginia sleep for a moment.

then he picks up the dinner tray and goes.
