ext.  the neville home - day

the neville's palos verdes home on the california coast is
spacious and pleasant.  a lovely view of the pacific.  birds
fly happily overhead.

it is an upscale suburban enclave much like any other.
normal.

neville emerges from the house and goes to the mailbox at the
end of the driveway.

only then do we notice that the street appears absolutely
deserted.  a kid's bicycle lies abandoned on a neighbor's
yard as if the kid has just gone inside for lunch.  all the
lawns are a bit overgrown, the gardens untended.

neville reaches into the mailbox.  nothing.

he glances down the street.  utterly normal but for the
overgrown yards and total lack of people.
