ext.  branson building plaza - day

it is raining.  driving, violent rain.

neville is in the hummer, nearing the branson building, but
he is wary.

he slowly cruises down the street, keeping an eye out for the
hemocytes.  for anything.

as he patrols the area we hear one of virginia's tapes:

                     virginia (v.o.)
          no one really knows.  that's why
          we're all so scared.  we're lost,
          you see?  this thing is killing
          everyone and we have no idea where
          to go or what to do.  we've just
          been... abandoned... haven't we?

he slowly passes by the plaza in front of the branson
building.  he checks it out as he cruises past.  through the
steady rain we see a large forecourt and some overgrown lawns
and a child's playground.

neville doesn't see anything alarming but is always careful.

he continues around a corner, past a store directly across
from the plaza.

                     virginia (v.o.)
          but at least i'm going as i am, or
          as i was.  those others, the
          mutations, the suffering they must
          be going through, god, that must be
          awful.  like their blood is
          betraying them.
