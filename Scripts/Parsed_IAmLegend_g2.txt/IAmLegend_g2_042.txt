int.  safe house - penthouse - night

neville seems at home here.  the antique and luxurious charms
of the august penthouse still exist through the decay.

he lights a waiting candle inside the door and checks his
domain.  all the windows are tightly sealed with blackout
drapes which are duct-taped to the walls.  he goes to one
window high in a corner and pulls aside a bit of drapery and
opens the window.  fresh air.

he passes by a cache of weapons he has secreted here and goes
into the kitchen.  canned and powdered food line the shelves
along with much bottled water.  a small camp stove sits on a
counter.

he opens a door and looks into a vast wine cellar.  he goes
in and picks out a bottle of wine.  he checks it, rotates it
and returns it.  he selects another.  this will do.

he goes back into the living room, opening the bottle of wine
and pouring a glass.

he sits at a desk and sips the wine.  some abandoned mail is
on the desk before him.  he aimlessly looks through the mail.
bills, mostly.

a series of framed photographs on the desk catch his eye.
they show many generations of a single family; from formal,
posed sepia pictures of european grandparents to modern
snapshots of a rich family on a yacht.  father, mother, three
kids.  happy.

neville stares at the pictures.
