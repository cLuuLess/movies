int.  ambassador hotel - ballroom - night

strange animal sounds -- high-pitched barks punctuated with a
low keening -- echo around the huge ballroom.

the ballroom is filled with figures.  about fifty of them.
in the refracting light of the moon through the windows we
cannot see much of them, they are fully shrouded in bedouin
wrappings.

one of the figures quickly crouches on the floor of the
ballroom.

the figure is strong, imperious.  he is the leader of this
band of creatures (who we will meet a bit later).  we see
practically nothing of them here, they are enigmatic shapes
and forms.

the crouching figure tilts his head back and forth as he
looks at the slaughtered remains of the three things neville
killed.

his talon-like fingernails are digging into the polished wood
of the dance floor.

his nails rip long, jagged gashes in the wood --

suddenly he raises his head and roars -- a terrifying primal
screech -- and we see a flash of his eyes in the moonlight --
the eyes are almost feline -- the pupils are intense vertical
slits, contracting and expanding strangely in the light --

the eyes are not human.
