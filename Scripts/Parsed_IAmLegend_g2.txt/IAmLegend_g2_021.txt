ext.  los angeles - aerial - day

we travel up with the cranes as they soar up from the turret,
higher and higher...

then we are sweeping with them above the city...

neville's rover disappears below and his horn echoes
strangely in the silent city as we soar with the cranes...

this is our first shocking wide view of the empty city.  it
is a breathtaking vista of desolation and ruin.

los angeles is a necropolis.
