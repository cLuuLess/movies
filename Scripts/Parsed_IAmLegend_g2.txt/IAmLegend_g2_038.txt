ext.  street - sunset

neville is running, flying through the empty streets.

but he runs smart:  at an even cadence like a marathon
runner, controlling his breathing.

but panic is a heartbeat away -- because the sun is truly
sinking now.  he checks the crimson glow of the sunset as he
runs.

he stops for the briefest moment, panting -- he yanks his map
out and quickly looks at it -- he scans his position, looks
at the street signs around him trying to get his bearings --

he stuffs the map into a pouch again and takes off.

he is clearly heading somewhere.

we follow neville's urgent journey as he pounds through the
streets:

--  he swerves through alleys -- racing around garbage --
    past abandoned cars -- casting his eyes around
    constantly, wary and alert, but not slowing down -- he
    takes any shortcut he can...

--  every corner is threatening and each new street a
    potential nightmare, still he runs on relentlessly...

--  the streets he runs through are ominous; a perilous
    phantasmagoria of twisting debris that seems to reach for
    him like skeletal fingers...

--  he tries to remain calm but panic is beginning to set
    in...

it is a race against time as the sun sinks, painting
neville's world red as blood.

his feet pound and echo in the dead city.
