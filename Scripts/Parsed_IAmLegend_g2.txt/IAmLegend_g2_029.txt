int./ ext.  rover - street - day

he is tearing through the streets -- spinning along at top
speed, swerving around anything in his path -- he zooms
around a corner to another street -- looking for a shortcut
-- sees it --

a commercial plaza is ahead -- he shoots across the street --
bangs up over the curb and tears across the sidewalk --
sending the rover flying down a bank of wide pedestrian steps
-- he bounces and jolts down the stairs then spins across a
courtyard --

ahead of him is a large commercial building with huge plate
glass windows -- he can see that the enormous lobby beyond
the windows extends to the next street --

he speeds toward the plate glass windows -- closer, closer --
he yanks his machine gun up and reaches out the driver's
window -- pointing it toward the glass --

at the last second before impact -- he fires -- a short burst
that blasts the plate glass to dust -- he speeds through the
shattered windows and into the lobby -- across the lobby,
between banks of elevators -- he races toward the set of
plate glass windows on the other side of the building --
blasts them and shoots through to the street --

he swerves up this street.

he slows as he nears the wide street the deer were on.

he unfastens the high-powered hunting rifle from behind him
and holds it ready on his lap.

the rover crawls the last few feet and finally creeps to the
street...
