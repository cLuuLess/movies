int.  sound stage - night

the cacique, amazingly, seems to be crouching in a victorian
parlor.

he is shifting back and forth on his haunches and twisting
his head back and forth, faster and faster -- very strange --
a low rumble is building within him -- his intense energy
mounting --

we pull back and realize that the cacique is not in a
victorian parlor at all, he is on a movie set.

we keep pulling back and see the victorian parlor set is in
the midst of a vast and decaying sound stage.  scaffolding
climb the walls and cables hang down everywhere.

decimated animal carcasses, some hanging from the scaffolding
pollute the place.  it is a enormous, echoing charnel house.

about fifty hemocyte are gathered, watching the cacique
eagerly, rabidly.

they are the hemocyte warriors -- the tallest, strongest and
most fervent of the tribe.  they wear unique and grisly
ornamentations of bone and skin.

the cacique's low rumble is building -- building -- his head
snapping back and forth faster and faster --

the hemocyte warriors share his growing passion -- they shift
back and forth -- they rend at their own flesh and beat at
their heads -- they slam their hands on the floor in a
building, percussive frenzy -- they leap around the
scaffolding with increasingly hysterical physicality --

the building animal energy is mounting to an explosion --

finally the cacique vaults to his feet -- roars -- the
warriors respond -- a ferocious, violent cacophony thunders
around the cavernous sound stage --

it is a terrifying, feral burst of absolutely maniacal
zealotry.
