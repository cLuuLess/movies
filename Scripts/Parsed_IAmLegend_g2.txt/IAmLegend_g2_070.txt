int.  neville's house - living room - night

neville is reading an old newsweek magazine.  the date is
january 13, 1999.  the decaying cover shows a picture of an
early hemocyte mutation -- not horrific yet, but not entirely
human either -- with the headline:  ab blood.  our only hope
against the virus?

he is reading a long article.  we see flashes of the text,
references to:  "... blood mutation..." and "... immunity to
the virus..." and "... extreme sensitivity to uv light..."
and "... epidermal layers shedding..." and "... brain
functions affected..."

we also see bits of newsweek graphics showing the circulatory
system and skin layers as well as blood group charts (ab
blood is only 5 percent of the world population.)

he closes the magazine, it is late and time for bed.

he decides to check on the hemocyte one last time.  he
descends a stairway and disappears down some corridors...
