int./ ext.  rover - streets - day

he doesn't get far.

a pierced tire is quickly reduced to nothing as neville tries
to escape.  he is driving on the rim -- sparks shoot up --

and the dogs remain close -- racing after the rover and
snarling -- blood drips from the savaged deer carcass on the
hood -- the dogs follow the blood trail as neville tears
around corners --

a high-pitched electronic beeping inside the rover --
neville's wristwatch -- 4:30 -- the sun is going down!

the tire finally disintegrates and the rover lurches forward
-- the right front side slamming and scraping brutally along
the street --

the rover smashes to a halt.  he has made it only about three
blocks.

neville immediately grabs his machine gun and the photo of
virginia from the visor and leaps out of the rover.

without a moment's hesitation he races away from the rover on
foot, sprinting like mad.

the dogs spin around a corner and swarm toward him --

but they go for the deer instead.  they leap on the rover and
descend on the deer carcass like jackals on a dead gazelle.
