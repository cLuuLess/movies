ext.  desert construction site - day

the almost blinding downpour allows us a strange view of a
large industrial construction site in the desert.  huge
earth-moving machines, cranes and bulldozers dot the sodden
landscape.

title:  fall 1998

we see day laborers and construction workers huddling under
the gigantic machines as they try to stay out of the rain,
packed together like tiny animals in the shadow of the
dinosaurs.

but there is something immediately wrong about this scene.

there should be more workers on a project this big.
