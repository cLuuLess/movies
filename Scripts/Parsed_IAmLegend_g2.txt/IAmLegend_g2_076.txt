int.  library - day

neville is hunting for books in a cavernous, echoing library.

we see that he has totally rearmed:  a fresh machine gun,
pistol and diver's knife.

he is scanning the spines of books on biology and medicine
with his machine gun light.  he is particularly interested in
books on blood, transfusions and immunology.

he selects a few books.

he hears a scuttling sound -- and quickly spins the machine
gun light around -- a rat is scampering along the checkout
counter.

a sign on the counter:  quiet please.  no talking.

he smiles ruefully.
