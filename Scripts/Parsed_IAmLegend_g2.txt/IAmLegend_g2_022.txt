ext.  office building - day

neville pulls to a stop in front of an office building and
climbs out of the rover.

at the top of the building a tall radio tower reaches up to
the perfect blue sky.

when he leaves the rover he always carries a machine gun with
a high-powered flashlight clamped to the barrel.  he also has
a sidearm in a holster on his hip and the diver's knife
strapped to his ankle.

he grabs a jerry can of gas from the rover and goes into the
office building...
