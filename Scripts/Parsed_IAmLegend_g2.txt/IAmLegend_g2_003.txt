int.  construction shed - day

neville is standing in the high-tech construction shed.  he
is the architect of this project.

neville stands with a grave expression, his arms folded,
watching tv.

his chief engineer, domingo, sits nearby and eats a sandwich.

on the tv:

a local washington reporter is standing in front of the white
house, the flag at half mast:

                     local washington reporter
          the first lady was buried in a brief
          ceremony at arlington national
          cemetery and then the president and
          the remaining members of the cabinet
          met with the cdc emergency response
          team to coordinate...

the construction foreman enters, shaking off rain, and goes
to domingo:

          the men.  we don't have enough to do

neville doesn't turn from the tv.

                     domingo

the foreman goes.

                     domingo
          bob?

neville turns off the tv.  the only sound is the pounding of
the rain.

neville's back is to domingo.

a silent pause.

then:

                     domingo
               (gently)
          she's going to be fine, bob.

neville finally turns.

                     neville
          i'm going home.
