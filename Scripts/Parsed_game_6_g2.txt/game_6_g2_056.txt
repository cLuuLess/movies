michael, nicky's father, is making an omelette on the old
stove. he is pushing eighty, slow-moving, with a two-day
stubble.

knock at the door.

michael goes to the intercom, inches from the door.

                         michael
                    (into speaker)

                         nicky (v.o.)
               i'm at the door.

                         michael
                    (into speaker)
               go way. i'll call a cop.

                         nicky (v.o.)
               pop, will you let me in?

                         michael
                    (into speaker)
               where the hell are you?

                         nicky (v.o.)
               right here. at the door.

michael goes to the door and looks through the peephole.

intercut as necessary

                         michael
               what do you want?

                         nicky
               it's me. nicky.

                         michael
               nicky comes on sunday's.

                         nicky
               where are your glasses? go get
               them.

                         michael
               if it's you, what are you doing
               here?

                         nicky
               i'm on my way to get a haircut.

                         michael
               where does nicky get his hair cut?

nicky stands against the door, speaking softly into the
peephole.

                         nicky
               across ninth avenue. dodgie's.
               where you've been getting your hair
               cut for fifty years. where uncle
               billy and uncle marty got their
               hair cut. where jim rorty shot a
               man for cheating at poker.

                         michael
               it was rummy, not poker. but i'll
               take a chance and let you in.
