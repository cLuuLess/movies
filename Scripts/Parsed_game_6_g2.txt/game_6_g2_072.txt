int. manion's old timer tavern - later

cheering from the bar crowd.

nicky is a little disheveled. he has finished his dinner and
is eating from toyota's plate finishing and watching the
game.

                         toyota
               you're a family man, frankie?

                         nicky
               wife and daughter. my father's
               still alive.
               he outlives me, starting tonight.
               because the mets just tied the
               score. it was only a matter of
               time, wasn't it?

                         toyota
               an how many years does it take a
               person to make his family safe and
               secure and happy, and then in one
               dumb moment, what does he do?

                         nicky
               i don't know toyota. what does he
               do?

                         toyota
               and the people he hurts the most
               are the people who love him.
               despite who he is and what he does
               for a living. we're always saying
               we want to take control of our
               lives. you don't want to take
               control. you want to lose control.
               jesus knows it.

nicky is standing again but he's not looking at the tv screen
this time. his gaze is directed at someone who has just
entered the tavern.

a woman stands at the entrance, middle-aged and somewhat
anxious, looking for someone. she is lillian rogan, nicky's
wife.

                         nicky
               it's a complicated subject.

                         toyota
               it's a simple subject.

nicky gestures that he will be right back.
