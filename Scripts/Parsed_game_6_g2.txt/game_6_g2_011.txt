int. steven schwimmer's loft

steven is just waking up. the radio plays soft music.

he reaches over and hits the off button, then activates the
cassette player. he struggles out of bed and sufi music
begins to fill the room.

he stands at the foot of the bed, a man in his mid-twenties,
hollow-chested, slightly potbellied, wearing rumpled pajama
bottoms and a mostly mozart t-shirt.

he does not remove the sleep mask.

the music has a sensuous, driving beat. voices begin to
chant.

steven holds his arms parallel to the floor. slowly he begins
to turn, clockwise. the beat picks up and he whirls more
quickly, his mouth coming open.

now he begins to whirl about the room. the chanting grows in
intensity. although he is blindfolded, steve deftly avoids
running into furniture and other objects.

steven stops whirling at the precise moment the music stops
playing. he is back at the foot of the bed, arms stretched
wide.
