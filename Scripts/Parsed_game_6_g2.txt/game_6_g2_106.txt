int. the landing

nicky stands with his back to steven's door. his gun is out.
he holds it up near his face, muzzle pointed up.

he looks at the gun as if it had feelings and personality,
and he speaks to it as to a sympathetic friend.

                         nicky
               i used to go to the movies all the time
               i saw a hundred situations like
               this. a man and a gun -- and a
               locked door. lee marvin or steve
               mcqueen. and i used to say to
               lillian because we went to a
               hundred movies that we saw together
               or that i saw because she had seen
               them, and i'd say, `watch him kick
               in the door with one kick,' and it
               might be steve mcqueen or jeff
               chandler, holding the gun up like
               this, and he would turn and kick
               the door and it would fly open at
               once, and i would say to lillian,
               `how completely phony. whoever made
               this movie has no idea how hard it
               is to kick in an actual door in
               real life.' i still love lillian.
               but it's not easy to kick in a
               door. i knew they would lose and
               they lost, so what are we so upset
               about? they lost tonight, they'll
               lose tomorrow. it's written on the
               wind.
