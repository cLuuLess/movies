nicky rejoins toyota and matthew. he carries the wine bottle
and his glass.

                         matthew
               great game. red sox are winning.

                         nicky
               they're always winning. until they
               lose.

                         toyota
               your problem is you take the easy
               way out. losing is easy.

                         nicky
               winning is easy. losing is
               complicated. it's a lifetime's
               work.

                         toyota
               it may be work but it's not honest
               work. faith is the real work.

strikes.

                         nicky
               he's a twenty-four-game winner. he
               pitches seven solid innings. we
               scratch out a one-run lead. of
               course he gets a blister. of course
               they put up greenwell even though
               baylor's sitting on the bench. of
               course greenwell strikes out.
