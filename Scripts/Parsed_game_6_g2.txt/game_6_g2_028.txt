int. steven schwimmer's loft

stillness. a slow whirling 360-degree shot. the kitchen area
is empty. the door of the portable toilet is open and no one
is inside. the makeshift wardrobe is empty except for four or
five hangers with shirts and jackets. there is no one at the
desk or exercise bike.

a sound, faint but persistent, like an intake of air.

the bathroom. the toilet bowl has been ripped out and taken
away, leaving a hole in the floor. brownish water drips from
the tap into the wash basin, which is indelibly stained. the
drip makes a two-part sound and it matches the rhythm of the
intake of air. one-two. pause. one-two. the bathtub has been
sprayed by a graffiti artist. multi-colored swirls and
arabesques.
steven is sitting on a mat in the tub, arms in the air and
folded so that his fists are close to his ears. he is in
lotus position, breathing in serious meditation -- a deep
intake of breath followed by a softer expulsion, matching the
beat of the dripping faucet.

he is still wearing the sleep mask.
