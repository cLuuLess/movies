ext. 48th street near eleventh avenue

a yellow taxi comes speeding past, moving eastward on 48th
street. we see it from various perspectives and elevations.
it is a large checkered cab, the only thing moving in the
night. steam comes billowing from funnel vents. the taxi
catches every light just before it turns red.
