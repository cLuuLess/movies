int. steven's loft

steven and laurel on the sofa. he is unbuttoning her blouse.

two sources of light. a candle on the coffee table. the small
                         tv set on the counter -- showing a newscast, with sound
               turned off.

                         laurel
               why won't you tell me your name?

                         steven
               it's only our first date.

steven undoes the last button.

                         laurel
               i'm willing to tell you my name.

                         steven
               names are incredibly intimate. we
               barely know each other. trust me on
               this.

she decides she will trust him. they kiss softly.

                         laurel
               you have to tell me what you
               thought of the play.

                         steven
               first you tell me.

                         laurel
               brilliantly moving.

she begins to remove his jacket.

                         steven
               what else?

                         laurel
               packs an emotional wallop.

                         steven
               what else?

                         laurel
               a flat-out hit.

together they get his jacket off.

                         steven
               are you majoring in theater
               criticism.

laurel sees the shoulder holster and gun.

                         laurel
               criminology.

they kiss passionately.

                         steven
               if you're wondering about the
               firearm.

                         laurel
               yes.

                         steven
               this building is not secure.

they are all over the sofa, working on the removal of
steven's shirt.
