int. the barrymore theater - the orchestra

nicky sits down in the orchestra, looking darkly into space,
brooding. he surveys the set, a working class kitchen, behind
it a backdrop of dark streets and looming tennaments. a
portly well-dressed man appears, moving along the row toward
nicky. this is sidney fabrikant, the producer.

                         nicky
               aybe we ought to postpone the
               opening.

                         sidney
               joanna loves this play. she has
               sunk tons of money. she is
               completely ncommitted.

                         nicky
               appreciate that, sidney. but our
               leading man can't remember his
               lines. and his understudy can't
               carry the play.

nicky looks out at the rehearsal in progress on stage. the
director, jack haskins and the actor peter redmond
(50)confer, move about gesturing and blocking.

                         sidney
               i had lunch with joanna. she said
               she told you about peter. you
               weren't concerned, she said.

                         nicky
               hat was this morning.

                         sidney
               so what happened since? you're
               worried about this kid who writes
               these reviews?

nicky looks across the theatre. paisley porter sits alone,
tenth row center, watching rehearsal with rapt attention.

                         nicky
               'm not worried about this kid.

                         sidney
               well i am. worried sick. everybody
               quotes steven schwimmer. he's here
               to announce the death of
               civilization. he kills a play every
               time he farts.

                         nicky
               postpone. we have every right.

                         sidney
               too late. all the elements are in
               place. delay the opening and we
               lose the theater.

                         nicky
               i've had three straight washouts,
               sidney.

                         sidney
                    (deliciously)
               you're dangling from the last
               letter of your last name.
