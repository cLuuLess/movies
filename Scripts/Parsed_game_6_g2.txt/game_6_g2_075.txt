int. manion's old timer tavern - the booth - later

dinner has arrived with a bottle of wine. a cigarette burns
in the ashtray in front of lillian.

                         nicky
               opening night, lillian.

                         lillian
               who the hell cares?

                         nicky
               the whole thing is my fault. i took
               unfair advantage of your patience
               and understanding. you understand
               me.

                         lillian
               that's always been my problem.

                         nicky
               and you've been extremely patient.

                         lillian
               you know why, don't you? because i
               am patient, chain-smoking lillian.

                         nicky
               you smoked because i smoked. we
               were falling in love, remember? i
               used to see certain movies only
               because you had seen them. i wanted
               to see what you saw.

                         lillian
               i'd forgotten that.

                         nicky
               i went because you went. you smoked
               because i smoked.

                         lillian
               that's very lovely actually.

                         nicky
               laurel wants us to be honest and
               open. let's be open with each
               other.

                         lillian
               be open with me. i'd like that.

                         nicky
               there may be things you'd rather
               not know about.

                         lillian
               i want to know. we haven't talked
               this way in years.

                         nicky
               i had an affair -- are you sure you
               want to hear this?

                         lillian
               joanne bourne.

                         nicky
               alma wetzel.

                         lillian
               nicky, no. this is insupportable.
               how could you?

                         nicky
               i'm a man. she's, you know, a
               woman.

                         lillian
               she's my gynecologist.

lillian begins to weep lightly.

                         nicky
               i am really, deeply sorry.

                         lillian
               it violates so many trusts.

                         nicky
               it was an animal thing. no real
               intimacy.

                         lillian
               i never thought of dr. wetzel as
               having a sex life outside the
               office.

                         nicky
               we did it in the office. she
               thought her apartment was too
               impersonal.

                         lillian
               i'm glad we're having this talk.

                         nicky
               i feel great. i feel impeccably
               alive. i'm elated. eat something.
               please. i love you.
