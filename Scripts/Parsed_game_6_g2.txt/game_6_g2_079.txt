               you made him strike out. you wished
               it on him. you want to lose. it's
               too hard for you to believe in
               something. it's hard to have faith.
               it's hard nwork to trust somebody.

               you're afraid to risk believing.
               believe in them. believe in your
               self. take a risk. it will humanize
               you as a person.

               i want to believe.

                         toyota
               if you believed, you wouldn't be
               walking around with a handgun in
               your belt. what does that tell me?
               you want to make the night come
               down.
