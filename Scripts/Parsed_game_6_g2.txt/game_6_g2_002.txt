ext. loft building2

steven's loft is in an old squat building on 47th street near
twelfth avenue. the structure looks abandoned. graffiti
everywhere. entranceway filled with debris.

                         lone eagle (v.o.)
               another day of traffic. traffic
               everywhere i look. cars stop and
               move and stop again. people sit at
               the wheel thinking their thoughts.
