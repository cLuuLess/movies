int. bedroom -- later

nicky and joanna are undressing after the fact, very slowly
and distractedly. joanna stands by a chair near the window.
nicky is on the other side of the bed and he alternates
between standing and sitting as he takes off his clothes.

                         joanna
               last night. alan albright called me
               a handsome woman. second time he's
               done that. son of a bitch.

                         nicky
               i hear alan's sick.

                         joanna
               alan's very sick. he has to go to
               new mexico and sit in a lukewarm
               solution.

                         nicky
               you know about adele.

                         joanna
               what about her?

                         nicky
               she's dying.

                         joanna
               she died.

                         nicky
               i talked to her two days ago.

                         joanna
               apparently it didn't help. you know
               about peter, of course.

                         nicky
               our peter?

                         joanna
               peter redmond. they found out why
               he can't remember his lines.
               there's something living in his
               brain. a parasite he picked up in
               borneo, doing the movie.

                         nicky
               can he get through it?

                         joanna
               they're watching him closely.
               there's a special rehearsal set for
               this afternoon. to bolster his
               confidence. and that's not all.

                         nicky
               i've got bigger problems, joanna.
               personal problems.

                         joanna
               that's not all, nicky. i've been
               backing your plays for fifteen
               years. and i've never been more
               depressed.

                         nicky
               about what?

                         joanna
               steven schwimmer. the most powerful
               critic in america gets his first
               crack at nicky rogan.

                         nicky
                    (hiding his concern)
               look. all i want is a haircut. i'm
               not worried about this guy.

                         joanna
               ever since he started reviewing the
               broadway theater, nobody in this
               business has been worried about
               anything else.

                         nicky
               they can send their heartless
               brilliant boy-critic. there's a
               much bigger thing going on than
               tonight's opening.

                         joanna
               what?

                         nicky
               the red sox

                         joanna
               you mean the world series? i
               thought the red sox were winning.

                         nicky
               three games to two. but if you know
               their history, you realize there's
               a tragedy in the making. i've been
               carrying this franchise on my back
               since i was six years old.

                         joanna
               it can't be all that personal.

joanna enters the walk-in closet to finish undressing and get
a nightdress.

                         nicky
               if you have a team you've followed
               all your life, and they raise your
               hopes and crush them, and lift them
               and crush them, do you want me to
               tell you what it's like? it's like
               feeling your childhood die over and
               over.j
                         joanna
               i mean nicky, really, no.

nicky follows her into the closet, still in his shirt and
boxer shorts.

                         joanna
               i'm proud of this play. it's so
               different from anything you've
               done.

                         nicky
               this is how we've managed to last.

                         joanna
               we're able to surprise each other.

                         nicky
               in and out of bed.

                         joanna
               because we're completely
               mismatched.

                         nicky
               we don't even like each other, do
               we?

nicky walks out of the closet, takes off his shirt, gets into
bed.

                         joanna
               i used to tell myself. talent is
               more erotic when it's wasted. will
               i see you tonight?

                         nicky
               the red sox blow a chance to win
               their first world series since
               1918. you expect me to miss that
               for an opening night?

joanna emerges from the closet in her nightdress and gets
into bed.

                         joanna
               it makes me so mad. steven
               schwimmer ready to strike. the
               exterminating angel.

                         nicky
               it's all worked out. they'll lose
               tonight. then they'll lose
               tomorrow. i see it with stunning
               clarity.

                         joanna
               it's your best play, nicky.

                         nicky
               they'll lose because they're my
               team.

                         joanna
               he will absolutely hate it.
