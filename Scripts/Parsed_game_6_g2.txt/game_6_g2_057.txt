int. michael rogan's kitchen - later

michael is eating his omelette at a small enamel-topped table
in the kitchen. nicky stands by the boxlike refrigerator,
drinking a beer. this is the kitchen that is the centerpiece
of the theatre set. the new play is nicky's young life.

                         nicky
               it's a constant shock to me, how
               small this place is. how did we do
               it? five people in these little
               rooms.

                         michael
               get yourself something to eat.

nicky takes some eggs out of the refrigerator.

                         nicky
               we must have been heroic.

                         michael
               five's not so many. there were
               families with seven kids. a
               grandmother. a dimwit uncle.

                         nicky
               lillian says it once a week. `why
               doesn't he come live with us?'

                         michael
               you know the answer to that.

                         nicky
               i do know the answer to that. why
               don't we watch the ball game later?
               we'll go to mannion's.

                         michael
               they're only gonna lose.

                         nicky
               of course they're gonna lose. we'll
               watch them lose. what good is
               heartbreak if we don't experience
               it firsthand?

                         michael
               the red sox are your problem. i
               never understood about you and the
               red sox. everybody rooted for the
               yankees.

nicky is scrambling the eggs.

                         nicky
               remember 1949? last two games of
               the season. against the yankees.
               the sox lost on saturday. then they
               lost on sunday. first i cried for
               twenty-four hours. then i had fist-
               fights the rest of the week.

                         michael
               it's one thing for kids. you get
               older, you nhave other things.

                         nicky
               it's all connected, pop. it's one
               life. baseball is memory. how do
               fathers and sons show their love?
               they go to a ball game together.
               thirty-five years later, they sit
               in the kitchen and remember.

                         michael
               but the son is suppose to stop
               crying.

                         nicky
               i could have grown up happy. a
               yankee fan. a divorce lawyer.

nicky sees his father's glasses on a shelf above the stove.
he puts them on the table.

                         nicky
               you'll need these. tonight. for the
               play.

                         michael
               don't make me sit through one of
               your plays.

                         nicky
               hey, pop. i know you don't like the
               commotion of opening night. but i
               especially want you to see this
               play. it's new territory for me.
               and for you too. i have to know
               what you think.

                         michael
               since when did that matter?

                         nicky
               let's not start that again.

                         michael
               my back is killing me.

                         nicky
               where's your elastic brace?

                         michael
               i can't find it.

                         nicky
               you're suppose to wear it when your
               back gives you trouble.

                         michael
               i lost it. i lose everything.

                         nicky
               i'll go get you another one. you
               have to wear it.

nicky takes a roll off the counter, makes a sandwich for his
scrambled eggs, takes a bite and heads for the door.

                         nicky
               be right back. take a good look at
               me.

michael puts on his glasses.

                         michael
               so i know who i'm letting in.

nicky leaves the apartment.
