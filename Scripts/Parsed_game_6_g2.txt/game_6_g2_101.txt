int. manion's old timer tavern - the bar area - a little 103

later

the crowd is slowly breaking up. a few people still clustered
near the tv sets, which are showing replays.

nicky is standing alone near a small set at the back on the
room. his clothing torn and stained. one shoe and pants leg
dripping wet. a bruise on his forehead.

he is watching a replay.

tv screen

wilson hits the ball. it bounces twice, then goes under
buckner's glove. knight scores from the third with the
winning run. a 6-5 victory for the mets.

the main light in the tavern goes out. the tv sets keep
replaying buckner's error. regular speed, slow motion, color,
black and white.

nicky stands in the darkness, brooding.
