int. coffee shop - near the cash register - later

nicky and laurel stand on a short line at the cash register,
each holding a check.

                         laurel
               mother won't tell me how long
               you've been seeing this person.
               she's embarrassed to tell me. so
               why don't you tell me?

                         nicky
               don't call her mother all the time.
               it makes her sound tragic and
               unforgiving. what happened to mom?

                         laurel
               i didn't turn her into mother. you
               did.

                         nicky
               this person and i are a thing of
               the total past. i promise you.

nicky takes laurel's check away from her, intending to pay
himself.

laurel snatches it back.

                         laurel
               know what mother said to me?
               daddy's demons are so intense he
               doesn't even know he's lying.
