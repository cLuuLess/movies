               i can't take this anymore. he
               forgets simple lines. he forgets
               where to stand. we tell him and
               tell him and tell him. i know he's
               a sweet man. i love peter. it's not
               his fault. but i've never worked in
               a show where the leading man has
               4parasites in his brain.
