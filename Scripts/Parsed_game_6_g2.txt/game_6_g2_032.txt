int. the men's room - a little later

cramped quarters. intensely claustrophobic. elliot at the
urinal. nicky at the hand-dryer. an actor-waiter standing
between them at the sink.

                         elliot
                    (quoting steven schwimmer)
               `one thing saves elliot litvak's
               work from complete mediocrity, and
               this is his lack of ambition.'

                         waiter
               it gets funnier.

                         elliot
                    (zipping up)
               it gets funnier. see, nicky? they
               chart the laughs. this from a
               critic who lives like a fallen
               monk. whose address is a carefully
               guarded secret.

                         waiter
               a critic who has to disguise
               himself.

                         nicky
               what do you mean?

                         waiter
               to go to the theater. wears i don't
               know what. make-up, padding.

                         nicky
               why?

                         waiter
               because he is so deeply hated by so
               many people in the business.

                         elliot
               he has to disguise himself, nicky.

                         waiter
               for his own safety and peace of
               mind.

the waiter squeezes past and leaves.

                         elliot
               do you want me to tell you what it
               was like, reading that review at
               the newstand with trucks rumbling
               past and street vendors facing
               mecca?

                         nicky
               what was it like?

                         elliot
               i said, `i'm dead'. he killed me.
