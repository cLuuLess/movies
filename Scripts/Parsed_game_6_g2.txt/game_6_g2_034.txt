elliot watches nicky embrace giorgio. nicky carries the
tabloid he'd been reading -- the "daily news". elliot and
nicky stand at the door and watch the whitish mist that
continues to linger.

                         elliot
               is it safe?

                         nicky
               do we care?

                         elliot
               i think we nought to wait.

                         nicky
               i say we go.

                         elliot
               you say we go?

                         nicky
               do not inhale.

                         elliot
               i'm not ready.

                         nicky
               here we go.

they pull up their collars and run outside.
