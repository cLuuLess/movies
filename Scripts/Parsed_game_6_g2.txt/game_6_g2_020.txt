                         elliot
               nicky. i was thinking about you. i
               went to the preview last night.

                         nicky
               i don't want to hear about it.

nicky attends to his own transaction.

                         elliot
                    (whispering)
               a lovely piece of theater. small
               but important.

                         nicky
               shut up, elliot.

                         elliot
               quietly effective.

nicky takes his cash and begins to move away.

we don't appreciate what they've
built for us. we're artists who are
too dumb to see that this is the
peak moment of western culture.

                         nicky
               you're an artist. i'm a craftsman.

                         elliot
               press a button and they give us
               money.

                         nicky
               ride with me. we need a haircut.
