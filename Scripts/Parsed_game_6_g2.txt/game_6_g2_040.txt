nicky and paisley in a corner of the back room.

                         nicky
               you keep slipping away. how do you
               do that?

                         paisley
               i was one of those silent,
               listening children. glued to the
               shadows.

                         nicky
               i was all noise. played the radio
               loud. battled constantly with my
               brother and sister. here i am,
               world.

                         paisley
               i hear good things about the new
               play.

                         nicky
               so do i. over and over.

                         paisley
               peter redmond is an actor i admire
               enormously.

                         nicky
               would you like to meet him?

                         paisley
               he doesn't want to meet some out-of-
               work ingenue.

                         nicky
               i'm trying to prolong our
               afternoon. in case you haven't
               noticed.

                         paisley
               the fact is, i have to get going.

                         nicky
               is it true?

                         paisley
               is what true?

                         nicky
               he wears a disguise.

                         paisley
               steven goes to extremes to protect
               his privacy. no friends. no phone.

                         nicky
               but you're his friend.

                         paisley
               sort of. sometimes. you're not
               building an obsession about steven,
               are you? look. i understand opening-
               night jitters, but you've got one
               of the great actors in american
               theater starring in your play.
