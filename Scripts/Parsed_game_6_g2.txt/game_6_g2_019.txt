int. taxi

nicky rides again.

                         nicky
               it's life, it's taxis. people
               trying to make contacts, make
               deals, meet their lovers. taxis are
               sexy. you can't have manhattan
               without taxis. i was proud of my
               taxi. i kept my taxi clean.

nicky shifts his gaze. he sees elliot litvak slinking across
the street, looking faintly unclean and shows a trace of a
smile. he watches elliot enter the lobby of the chemical
bank.
