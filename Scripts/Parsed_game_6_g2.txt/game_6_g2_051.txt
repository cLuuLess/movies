int. steven schwimmer's loft - a little later

steven is back in the chair by the window. paisley nervously
prowls the loft.

                         paisley
               in other words i never understood
               until today how much pain and
               anxiety you've been causing with
               your reviews. steven, it's so
               unfair.

                         steven
               of course it's unfair. the truth is
               always unfair. why do you think i
               live this way? hiding out. stealing
               electricity from a lamp post.
               because people who write the truth
               are outcasts of society. i can't
               live openly, in a nice clean
               doorman building, with my name on
               the mailbox. they'd come after me
               in packs.

                         paisley
               not if you stopped hurting people.
               write the truth gently.

                         steven
               the truth is never gentle. listen
               to me carefully. each of us lives
               in the thinnest possible wrapping
               of wishes and dreams. truth is the
               force that penetrates this wispy
               skin. it hurts and maims.

                    (reaching down to clutch a
                    fistful of letters)
               look how they hate me for telling
               the truth. it's an education,
               paisley. the college of raw nerves.
               letters dripping blood. cries of
               revenge.

                         paisley
               yes. i've seen your victims. one
               past and one future. i thought i
               might convince you to reconsider.

                         steven
               and i thought, at last, she's here,
               she wants me.

                         paisley
               i don't want you, steven.

paisley moves towards the door.

                         steven
               stay. teach me to be compassionate.

                         paisley
               i'm going home to my machine.
