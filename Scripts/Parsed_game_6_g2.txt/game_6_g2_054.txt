               a man is hit the other day by
               another taxi. i mean he is flying.
               crash against the windscreen. right
               here in my face. blood is
               everywhere.

               windex.

               i was barrister in kenya. i said to
               him, get off from here. i cannot
               drive with your body on my
               windscreen.

                         nicky
               i drove twelve hours straight
               through. ate at the wheel.

               you have to eat at the wheel. you
               cannot get anywhere.

               that's the drama. we're waiting for
               life to continue. where do you pee,
               ibrahmin?
