nicky is launched into a full breakfast. laurel has a tea bag
in a cup -- no water.

                         nicky
               if lawyers for the mob are called
               controversial, why are divorce
               lawyers called prominent?

                         laurel
               because they get outstanding
               settlements. and mother is
               determined that this time there's
               no turning back.

                         nicky
               i just had breakfast with her. she
               didn't say a word about this.

a young waiter recognizes nicky and unobtrusively points him
out to another waiter.

                         laurel
               because you refuse to believe she's
               serious. you've always refused.

                         nicky
               don't be so steely-eyed. it's that
               course you're taking in
               criminology.

                         laurel
               oh please. not now.
                    (beat)
               she wants you to stop seeing what's-
               her-name. finally. now and forever.
               do you think that's too much to
               ask? for a wife of nineteen years.

                         nicky
               you're too young to be studying
               criminal behavior. it's making you
               obsessive.

                         laurel
               she is kicking you out.

                         nicky
               your mother and i have something
               between us that's too strong to
               damage permanently. believe me, i
               know this. that's right, nineteen
               years. and what about the days and
               minutes? sharing small moments,
               sharing memories, raising a
               beautiful child. we're wedded in
               the deepest and strongest ways.
               lillian isn't only my wife. she's
               my best friend.

nicky shrugs.

                         laurel
               bullshit, daddy.
