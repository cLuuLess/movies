ext. the street

nicky with one arm raised, hailing a taxi. he and lillian
kiss sweetly.

a taxi pulls up and lillian gets in. she and nicky hold hands
through the window.

                         lillian
               you look awful, sweetheart. get a
               haircut. get a lawyer.

across the street, the man in the cutaway is dancing with his
doll. the tape machine plays, "in the wee small hours of the
morning."
