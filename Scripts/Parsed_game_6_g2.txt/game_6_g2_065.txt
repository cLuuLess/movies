                         nicky
               i loved my taxi. a checkered cab.
               big and rumbly.

                         toyota
               i'm looking at you trying to think.
               put your face in the mirror. i know
               i recognize you from somewhere.

                         nicky
               everybody else does. why not you?

                         toyota
               you're frankie lazzaro. the
               gangster from rhode island.

                         nicky
               oh yeah?

                         toyota
               matthew, look at him. when i lived
               in roxbury, the media followed this
               man everywhere. he was bigger than
               ten movie stars.
                    (to nicky)
               where's your white lincoln limo?

nicky is delighted at the mistake and alters his voice
slightly, using a gangsterish inflection.

                         nicky
                    (to matthew)
               some little kid stole the hubcaps.

                         toyota
               the most charming gangster in new
               england. where are we going, mr.
               lazzaro?

                         nicky
               call me frankie. and it looks like
               we're going nowhere.

                         toyota
               might be an accident on the west
               side highway.

                         nicky
               how come you got the kid with you?

                         toyota
               matthew's my grandson.

                         nicky
               a grandmother. god bless you.

                         toyota
               he does bless me, each and every
               day. matthew's mother works a
               hospital shift, so i pick him up at
               school. we stop for a meal usually
               around this time. he does his
               homework and gets some experience
               meeting people. but we never had a
               famous mobster before.

                         nicky
               it's the kid's lucky day.

                         toyota
               this is one charming crook. if
               shooting people is charming.

                         nicky
               now that's a complicated subject.

                         toyota
               that's a simple subject.

                         nicky
               look, we're stuck here front and
               back. it's dinnertime for you, game
               time for me. let's park the cab and
               go to mannion's. what do you say,
               matthew? we'll drink beer and talk
               baseball.
