int. the barrymore theater - the stage

nicky and peter still conferring. jack and renee approach.

                         peter
               i feel shaky about one line in
               particular. if i can get past this
               line. i think i can handle the last
               long speech.

                         renee
               which line, peter?

                         peter
               the son says to the father, this
               could be it.

                         nicky
               and the father replies?

                         peter
               that's the line i can't ever, for
               the life of me remember. i just
               can't get it.

                         jack
               it's the same line. the father
               simply repeats what the son says to
               him.

                         renee
               this could be it.

                         nicky
               this could be it.

                         peter
               i know it sounds easy. but
               something happens between the time
               i hear the line and the time i'm
               suppose to jrepeat it.

                         jack
               this could be it.

                         peter
                    (long pause)
               this could be it.

                         jack
               let's work on it.

                         peter
                    (long pause)
               let's work on it.
