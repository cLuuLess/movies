nicky and paisley porter make their way out of the theatre.

                         paisley
               do you think he can do it?

                         nicky
               i don't know.

                         paisley
               he's a very sweet man.

                         nicky
               where are you going now?

                         paisley
               home.

                         nicky
               someone waiting for you?

                         paisley
               no one's waiting.

                         nicky
               there's a certain kind of wounded
               young man who uses his oddness to
               get laid. is that our steven?

                         paisley
               if i'm sleeping with him, and i
               haven't said i am, then so what?

                         nicky
                    (quietly)
               so everything. that's so what. so i
               begin to hate him. so i want to do
               him grave harm.

                         paisley
               but you don't even know me. how can
               you care what i do with whom?

                         nicky
               i know you both. enough. how much
               knowledge does it take before a man
               does something crazy.

                         paisley
               do you want to talk about doing
               crazy things.

                         nicky
               yes.

                         paisley
