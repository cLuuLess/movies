int. loft apartment - manhattan - morning

steven schwimmer, a drama critic, asleep on his bed. he
wears a sleep mask.

the bed is a mattress on a makeshift platform.

papers strewn on the floor.

an exercise bike.

a desk with and old manual typewriter, reference works,
periodicals, styrofoam cups.

a cast-off sofa with pants, shirts, sweater, underwear and
socks tossed haphazardly on the cushions and arms.

a counter that sets apart the kitchen area. a portable tv set
on the counter. the remains of dinner for one.

a row of stacked cardboard boxes with mail spilling out on
the floor. boxes are labeled in crayon: hate mail.

a coffee table with a candle nub in a saucer and six gleaming
rounds of ammunition scattered next to a llama comanche .357
magnum with a checkered walnut stock -- overall length, nine
and a quarter inches.

a port-o-san toilet, about seven feet high, orange, scarred
and dented -- scavenged from a construction site.

a snapshot on the bedside table. it's a blurry picture of
steven holding a cat. steven wears a peaked cap, and a shadow
falls across his face. next to the picture is a clock radio,
which comes on with a buzz as the clock shows nine am.

radio announcer begins to speak --

                         lone eagle (v.o.)
                    (softly)
               traffic flowing smoothly on the
               deegan right now but if you're
               lucky enough to have a ticket for
               tonight's game, be sure to leave
               early because it's going to be
               bumper to bumper.

steven does not stir.
