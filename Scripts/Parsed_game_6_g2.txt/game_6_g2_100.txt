int. manion's old timer tavern - men's room

cramped space. nicky at the washbasin, disheveled but happy,
washing his face.

one man at the urinal. second man behind him, waiting his
turn.

nicky drying his face with a paper towel.

                         nicky
               great game.

                         first man
               unbelievable.

                         nicky
               classic.

                         second man
               scintillating.

                         first man
               i still don't believe it.

                         nicky
               have to hurry back.

                         second man
               hurry back. hurry back to what?

                         nicky
               eleventh inning. what else?

                         first man
                    (zipping up)
               i think you're a little confused.
               nothing personal friend.

                         nicky
               what are you talking about?

                         first man
               what are we talking about?

                         nicky
               yes. what are you implying?

the second man approaches the urinal.

                         second man
               game six is history,pal.

                         nicky
               you're not making sense.

                         first man
               we're not making sense.

                         second man
               did you see mookie hit the ball?

                         nicky
               of course i saw it.

                         first man
               did you see the winning run score?

                         nicky
               you're not making sense. make
               sense.

nicky throws his paper towel at the men. no one moves. they
are trying to interpret this action.

                         nicky
               you're implying i missed something.
               what did i fmiss?

                         irst man
               you missed the boat, popeye the
               sailorman.

nicky charges the men. he and the first man wrestle each
other into the stall.

                         second man
               hold him till i zip up, tommy.

nicky and the first man are grappling in the stall. second
man hurriedly washes his hands at the basin.

                         nicky
               baseball is life. life is good.

al three men in the stall, wrestling. nicky has one foot in
the bowl as someone's elbow strikes the handles and the
toilet flushes.
