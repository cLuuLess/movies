int. manion's old timer tavern - the main room - later

people cluster around tv sets.

raucous noise.

a waiter with a tray of food standing transfixed, watching
the game.

nicky is now sitting next to matthew and they are watching
the game.

                         matthew
               what's it like to shoot somebody?

                         nicky
               i respect a kid who does his
               homework in a taxi. but let's put a
               lid on the questions.

                         toyota
               go on, tell him. tell the truth.
               tell him how you feel, shooting a
               piece of hot metal in somebody's
               flesh who was once a child, who was
               once the same age as this boy.
               somebody's flesh who was innocent
               once.

                         nicky
               it's complicated. it's a whole
               life. a person doesn't commit an
               act of violence out of nowhere.
               there are strong forces at work.
