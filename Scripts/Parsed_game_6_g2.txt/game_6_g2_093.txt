the bar crowd remains silent.

                         nicky (v.o.)
               one more out. one more out.

mitchell singles to center.

slight stirring among the bar patrons. a few people, about to
exit, return to the bar.

               it's all right, frankie. just a
               little touch of suspense. life is
               good.

                         matthew (o.s.)
               baseball is life.

                         nicky (o.s.)
               one more little out. a nubber. a
               pop-up. all year long, thousands of
               outs. we want one more little out.

knight singles to right center. carter scores and mitchell
goes to third. the score is 5-4.

the whole tavern is rocking.
