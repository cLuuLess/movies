ext. the street

bank towers. the bank of india, banco di napoli, bear
stearns, the bank of new york, the chemical bank,
manufacturers hanover. a sense of real institutions looming
over the busy street. the bank names engraved on bronze
markers, carved in granite, incised on glass.

street level. a glimpse of the bronze statue called "taxi on
park avenue" -- a man with and attache case and raincoat,
hailing a cab. the real people hailing cabs, well-dressed men
and women striding along with briefcases -- purposeful,
successful.
