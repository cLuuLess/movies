nicky pushes in next to her. laurel is eighteen, slightly
overweight, with a pleasant and expressive face. she is
carrying books in a nylon haversack.

                         nicky
               i never see you anymore. where are
               you all day?

                         laurel

               knew.

                         nicky
               do you want to get some coffee?

                         laurel
               i don't drink coffee, daddy. and
               this is not what we should be
               talking about.

                         nicky
               what do you want to talk about?
               i'll talk about anything. what's
               this?

nicky lifts a small radio and headset out of her bag.

                         laurel
               i'm seeing your play tonight,
               remember?

                         nicky
               why do you need a radio?

                         laurel
               so at the intermission i can listen
               to the ball game. do you know that
               mother is seeing a prominent
               divorce lawyer?

                         nicky

               prominent? what are you implying?

                         laurel

               divorce thee. i divorce thee. i
               divorce thee'
