his pocket for later.

to see nicky approach with liqueur and a glass on wine. he
sits opposite her, placing the wineglass in front of her.

                         nicky
               you've worked with elliot?

                         paisley
               i was in the fish-market play. what
               happened to him?

                         nicky
               there was a review.

                         paisley
               i think i remember.

                         nicky
               so does elliot.

                         paisley
               not one of steven's finer moments.

                         nicky
               oh. you know him.

                         paisley
               a little.

                         nicky
               and he has finer moments now and
               then.

                         paisley
               he has -- something. a funny little
               quality i find --

                         nicky
               endearing.

                         paisley
               engaging.

                         nicky
               elliot wants to kill him with a
               railroad spike.

                         paisley
               a little drastic maybe?

                         nicky
               say it again.

                         paisley
               what?

                         nicky
               you know what.

                         paisley
               alla puttanesca.

                         nicky
               one more time.
