ext. street - day

the street is deserted. nicky holds the newspaper over his
face for protection. each man has an arm in the air, trying
to hail a taxi. they are standing near a trash receptacle
that carries an advertisement for "new york magazine". it is
a reproduction of the cover that we'd glimpsed earlier in
joanna's apartment when her maid was reading the magazine. a
furtive man shielding his face with the newspaper -- and a
headline about a phantom. nicky and elliot do not see the
receptacle.

a bus comes down the street with a large horizontal ad
covering its right side. it is the same ad -- five of them
actually, five "new york magazine" covers side by side.
elliot is trying to hail a cab and doesn't notice the ad. as
the bus bears down, nicky steps out of the way, removing the
newspaper from his face and getting a clear look at the five
photos on the side of the bus -- a man concealing his face
with a newspaper.

nicky reads the text under the logo of "new york magazine".

                   the phantom who haunts broadway

                  learning to hate steven schwimmer

nicky stares after the bus. another bus comes along, carrying
the same ad.

nicky watches darkly.
