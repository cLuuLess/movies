ext. the street

about a dozen people gathered together including several
diamond merchants in their beards, black suits and fur hats.
they are watching the man in the cutaway dancing with his
cloth doll. someone places a donation in the cigar box. from
the tape player: "dancing in the dark."

elliot ends up near the gotham book mart, on the north side
of the street. nicky looks right past him into the bookstore
window. he sees something that interests him.

                         elliot
               where are you going?

                         nicky
               don't wait efor me.

                         elliot
