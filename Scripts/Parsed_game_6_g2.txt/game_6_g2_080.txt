iew from the wings. jack haskins and renee simon looking on.

the stage. peter redmond as the father sits at the end of the
sofa. the fifteen-year-old actor who plays the son approaches
him, sitting on a footstool and leaning close.

                         father
               i always thought a night's sleep is
               what you get for a hard day's work.
               but these last weeks i lie there
               helpless. hour after hour. i've
               come close to praying for the first
               time since i was your age. pray to
               god to put sme out.

                         son
               i talked to the doctor again, pop.
               he said she's not getting any
               better. he wants to talk to you. i
               think he means right away.

                         father
               how bad is she?

                         son
               this could be it.

peter stares at the son, a look of desolation slowly entering
his face.

in the wings, renee looks at jack. she is equally desolate.
