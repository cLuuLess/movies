int. the barrymore

laurel rogan, seen from behind, is somewhat slumped in her
seat. she turns off the radio, removes the headset and rises.
she moves along the row toward the aisle.

she appears to be the only person in the theater.

she moves trudgingly up the aisle toward the exit. at the
head of the aisle she is startled by a figure standing in
dimness.

it is steven schwimmer.

they look at each other. sound of the cleaning crew in the
lobby and then a door opening at the rear of the orchestra.
light from a flashlight plays across the seats and walls. the
beam hits laurel first and then steven.

the beam holds on steven. what laurel sees is a strikingly
handsome young man, dramatically lighted . he takes off his
dark glasses, so she can see his eyes.
