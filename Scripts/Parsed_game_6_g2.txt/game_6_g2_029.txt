int. restaurant - main room - later

the kitchen staff is eating at a group of tables pushed
together. nicky's table has been absorbed by this cluster and
he sits reading the sports section in a tabloid and having an
espresso with his cigar.

elliot, paisley and actor-waiter stand at the small bar in
conversation.

next to nicky, two kitchen workers talk about the ball game.

                         first man
               i got a good feeling about tonight

                         second man
               we got ojeda going. he pitched
               beautiful last time out.

                         first man
               plus darryl's due for a big game.

                         nicky
               i hate the mets.

                         second man
               how come?

                         nicky
               when the mets lose, they just lose.
               it's a flat feeling. but the red
               sox -- here we have a rich history
               of interesting ways to lose a
               crucial game. defeats that keep you
               awake, that pound in your head like
               the hammer of fate.

paisley walks across the room toward the kitchen. nicky
pauses to watch her, then resumes speaking.

                         nicky
               you can analyze a red sox defeat
               day and night for a month and still
               uncover layers of complex feelings -
               - feelings you didn't know you were
               capable of. the pain has a memory
               all of it's own.
