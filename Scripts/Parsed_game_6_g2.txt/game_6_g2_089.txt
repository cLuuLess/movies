int. manion's old timer tavern

toyota, matthew and nicky are huddled closely, watching the
screen. matthew is seated now and nicky leans over him from
behind, framing the boy's head in his hands so that matthew's
attention will be directed unswervingly to the action on the
screen.

the bar crowd is somber.

nicky drops his mob accent.

               this is something no one has been
               privileged to see in almost seventy
               years. very few people now alive
               can say that they have seen what
               you are about to see, matthew. the
               red sox win a world series. this is
               deeply, intensely personal. all the
               mistakes i've made, all the envy,
               fear and violence that's encased in
               this little envelope we call a
               person -- all washed away in the
               next few minutes. and your
               grandmother knows why.

               because god loves a winner.

               he used to love losers. but the
               laws of physics changed.
