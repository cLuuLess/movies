ext. united nations plaza apts - - morning

the shimmering glass facade of the united nations plaza
apartments at 48th street and first avenue. a man visible at
a window on one of the high floors, a cup of coffee in his
hand.

                         lone eagle (v.o.)
               day in, day out. red light, green
               light. traffic on the major
               arteries and traffic in the little
               veins.

from his pov we see the traffic below creeping along, nearly
at a standstill.

                         lone eagle (v.o.)
               cars, vans, taxis, trucks, limos,
               mopeds, bikes and buses. emergency
               vehicles screaming and wailing.
               birth and death, walk and don't
               walk.

the man takes a sip of coffee.

                         lone eagle (v.o.)
               traffic yesterday, today and
               tomorrow. bumper to bumper, soul to
               soul. this is lone eagle over and
               out.
