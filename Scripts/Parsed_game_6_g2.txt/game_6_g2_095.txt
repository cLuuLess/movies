int. manion's old timer tavern - the table

                         matthew
               you're hurting my head.

nicky releases his grip on matthew's head.

the bar crowd begins to chant.

                         bar voices
               mookie, mookie, mookie, mookie!

tv screen

mookie wilson stands in against bob stanley.

                         matthew (o.s.)
               we're still winning. that's what
               counts.

first pitch to wilson -- he swings and misses.

silence from the bar crowd, cheers from nicky's table.

second pitch to wilson -- he fouls it off. no balls, two
strikes.

sound begins to fade. wilson fouls off a pitch. wilson takes
a ball, outside. wilson fouls off another pitch.

absolute, unnatural silence.

stanley prepares to throw. the silence suddenly breaks and
for the first time we hear the tv announcers clearly.

                         announcer 1
               the sox are one pitch away.

                         announcer 2
               one pitch away.

                         announcer 1
               stanley's getting ready.

                         announcer 2
               this could be it.

                         announcer 1
               this could be it.
