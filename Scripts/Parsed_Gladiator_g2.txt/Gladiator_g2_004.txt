ext.  hill - twilight

the mighty catapults dwarf the humans.  soldiers from the
elite felix regiment -- a legion of the roman army -- haul
the monstrous machines up a hill.

the commanding general of the felix regiment, maximus,
walks between two of the catapults.  he is a striking and
intense man in his 30's.  like all the soldiers who
surround him, he is caked with mud and exhausted.

he trudges up the hill with his two lieutenants, titus and
quintus.

					titus
		you would do as well to read the
		mind of a rhinoceros.

					quintus
		these barbarians would rather drown
		in blood than yield an inch.  if i
		didn't hate them so much i would
		admire them.

they have reached the top of the hill.  stunning martial
preparations are underway.  the catapults join ten others.
archers are taking up position.  brutal "scorpions" --
devices for firing multiple crossbow bolts -- are being
loaded.  soldiers are also loading the catapults with
enormous "greek fire pots" -- large, round terra cotta
pots.

maximus and his lieutenants gaze down from the hilltop.
below them they can see a german encampment.

					titus
		they simply will not surrender.

a beat as maximus gazes down at the german position.

					maximus
			(quietly)
		a people should know when they are
		conquered.

a beat.

					maximus
		at the first signal release the
		catapults.  we'll use the cavalry to
		cut off the retreat.

					quintus
		general, i don't recommend that.
		our cavalry might be caught in the
		flames.

					maximus
		i hope not, because i'm going to be
		leading them.

a beat as he gazes down at the enemy.

					maximus
		why don't they know they're already
		dead?
