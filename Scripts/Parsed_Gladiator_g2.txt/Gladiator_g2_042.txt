ext.  slave wagon train - day

maximus' eyes slowly open --

inches away from his face -- a lion roars --

maximus lurches back.

he looks around to realize he is in a filthy slave wagon.
three other wagons slowly move over the desert landscape.
exotic animals are caged in pens or led alongside the
wagons:  lions, panthers, zebras, a giraffe.  a dozen
slaves are chained together alongside sacks of spices and
other cargo.  bedouin slave traders jabber in a surreal
babel of foreign tongues.

and someone is looking at him.  juba, a striking african,
is gazing at him impassively as he chews something.  juba
is also chained.

					maximus
			(weakly)
		am i in hades?

					juba
		yes.

juba spits what he has been chewing into his hands and
moves to maximus.

					juba
		for your wound...

maximus stares at him.

					juba
			(nods)
		for your wound.

maximus looks down -- the bloody wound at his side.

juba carefully places his poultice over the wound --
maximus hisses in pain -- juba massages the poultice into
the wound gently as:

					juba
		if you die in the wagons they feed
		you to the lions... the lions are
		worth more than we are.  i think we
		are worth more than the zebras
		though.  so they don't feed us to
		them.

maximus stares at him.  juba looks down at him with the
barest hint of a smile.

					juba
		i'm not sure about the giraffe.
