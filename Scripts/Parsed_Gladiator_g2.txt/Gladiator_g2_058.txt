int.  palace - commodus' bedroom - night

commodus sits on his bed, rubbing his aching head.
lucilla is preparing a drink for him, a medicinal tonic.

					commodus
		all my desires are splitting my head
		to pieces -- there's so much i want
		to do -- but all my efforts to show
		my children they are loved go
		unappreciated by those dragons in
		the senate --

					lucilla
			(mixing tonic)
		quiet, brother...

unseen by him, she adds a little special powder to the
drink from a vial secreted in her robe.

					lucilla
		leave the senate to me.  don't
		trouble yourself.

					commodus
		all i want is to be a good father to
		my people.  why don't they
		understand that?

she goes to him.

					lucilla
		shhh.  the tonic will help...

she takes a sip and then hands it to him.

					lucilla
		yes, just drink this down.

she sits on the edge of the bed.  he drinks as:

					commodus
		i must take a firmer hand with them.
		they must know their father can be
		firm.  as our father was firm with
		us.

					lucilla
		our father lost his way.  his
		mistake was believing the old songs
		of the "republic."  we know better.
		so let the senate talk.  they have
		no real power.

					commodus
		yes... yes... you always know the
		way.  you were always so wise in
		these matters...
			(he takes her hand)
		you know if i didn't have my duty to
		rome i think i should be an artist.
		i should go away and paint pictures
		of the sea and leave all the
		politics to you...

a beat.  he is sleepy, he lies back on his bed.

					commodus
		will you stay with me?

					lucilla
			(smiles gently)
		still afraid of the dark, brother?

					commodus
		still.  always.

a beat.

					commodus
		my dreams would terrify the world.

a beat.

					lucilla
		i'll stay with you until you are
		asleep.

					commodus
			(falling asleep)
		and after... just sit with me.  keep
		me safe...

he is asleep.

she watches him for a moment and then rises.

she goes.
