int.  colosseum - trainer's lair - day

proximo is with a dozen other gladiator trainers and the
colosseum's orator and majordomo, cassius.  they are
haggling in an secluded area not far from the arena
itself.  huge chalkboards chart the day's matches and
wagers and odds.

colosseum touts continually erase and mark new figures on
the chalkboards to keep up with the swiftly changing
bouts.

the roar of the lions and the unnerving screams of the
christians can clearly be heard.

					cassius
		... and the emperor will have no
		more animal battles today --

upset roars from some of the trainers.

					trainer #1
		you promised me a bear match,
		cassius!

					trainer #2
		i have ten damned gorillas!  you
		said gorillas yesterday!

					cassius
		talk to the man in the imperial box.
		who has the next slot...?
			(he checks the
			boards)
		-- lentulus, gideon, trebonius and
		proximo --
			(to proximo)
		-- nice to have you back, you
		piratical bastard -- now listen, the
		emperor wants the carthage
		spectacle.

the four trainers explode in a flurry of resistance --

					proximo
		no -- have pity, cassius -- !

					trainer #3
		my men are too good for -- !

					cassius
		you give us the carthage match or
		lose your spot on the rotation --
		but don't worry -- gold is flowing
		from the emperor's fingers.

					trainer #3
		it'll cost you --

					proximo
		i won't do it for less than 100,000
		sesterces -- !

					trainer #4
		120,000!  all i have is my best
		thracians!

					cassius
			(to proximo)
		and i want to see this famous
		spaniard of yours -- his reputation
		soars from the provinces.  the
		people are eager for him --

					proximo
		i won't throw my spaniard into a
		spectacle!  damn you and damn the
		rotation!

					cassius
		you will and the price will be
		90,000 sesterces each --
			(to all)
		-- which you all know is exorbitant
		-- and if you extorting blood-whores
		try to pawn off lesser fighters on
		me i will see you dead in the arena
		tomorrow!

					trainer #4
		my thracians are worth -- !

					cassius
		give me your best, brothers.  they
		die before caesar.

he strides back to the arena.  the touts instantly begin
making new marks on the boards to represent the mysterious
"carthage spectacle" as some of the trainers hurry out.

proximo walks with trainer #4:

					proximo
		i give you 30,000 my spaniard will
		kill at least one of your thracians.

					trainer #4
		30,000?!  on a spaniard?!  that
		provincial sun has curdled your
		brain!

					proximo
		then make the wager, you smug
		bastard!

they disappear down a dark corridor, negotiating all the
while.
