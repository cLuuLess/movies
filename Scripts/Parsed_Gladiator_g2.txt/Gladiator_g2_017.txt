int.  mess tent - night

an immediate swirl of noise.  the grand mess tent is
crowded with soldiers.  they are still filthy with caked-
on mud and blood.  wounds are bandaged and tankards are
raised in celebration of the victory.

marcus sits in a central position and receives visitors.
currently two senators, falco and gaius, are bowing before
him.

					falco
		hail, marcus aurelius.

					marcus
		stand up, senators.  that unfamiliar
		posture doesn't suit you.

					gaius
		we live in supplication to your
		glory.

					marcus
		all the while conspiring with that
		fat man in rome.  how is the old
		monster?

					gaius
		senator gracchus is hale, sire.

					marcus
		still damning me to the four winds?

					gaius
		still eager for your triumphant
		return to rome, caesar.

					marcus
		i would have silenced him decades
		ago -- but i just like him too much.

meanwhile, maximus stands with his lieutenants, titus and
quintus.  a wound on maximus' arm has been bound.

					maximus
			(to titus)
		if you want to stay on, i support
		you.  so do the men.  i'll ask the
		emperor to appoint you in my place.

					titus
		it won't be the felix regiment
		without you.

					maximus
		i'll return after a season at home.
		maybe two.

					quintus
		that means after three or four more
		babies.

					titus
		and you'll be too fat from vibia's
		cooking to get on your horse by
		then.

					maximus
		should the gods so bless me.  i
		would be thankful.

commodus perambulates up to them.

					commodus
		hail, warriors.  my congratulations.

					titus and quintus
			(bowing)
		highness.

					commodus
			(to maximus)
		my old friend, my father tells me
		you're returning to spain?

					maximus
		yes.

					commodus
		a pity.  i'll need men like you in
		my army...

an awkward glance between the soldiers.  this sort of talk
is offensively premature.

					commodus
		there are larger division that might
		appeal to you.  even the praetorian
		guard.  you've never been to rome.
		imagine arriving as head of the
		praetorians!  they have really
		splendid uniforms.

					maximus
			(cold)
		i'm going home.

senators gaius and falco join them.

					gaius
			(to maximus)
		... and why not apply for entry to
		the senate?

					falco
		a war hero with a handsome face and
		a strong heart could go far.

					commodus
		general maximus, may i present
		senators gaius and falco.  beware of
		this gaius, he'll pour a honeyed
		potion in your ear and you'll wake
		up one day and all you'll say is
		"republic, republic, republic..."

laughter.

					falco
		have you never considered rome?

					maximus
		no.

					commodus
		you've had my ear since we were
		children.  you could be a valuable
		ally in the senate.

					gaius
		are you a believer in republicanism?

					commodus
			(laughs)
		there -- i warned you.

					maximus
		i'm a soldier, not a politician.

meanwhile, a dark eye is studying the men through a hidden
slit in the tent wall.  the eye is particularly drawn to
maximus.

					gaius
		if your heart lies with the people,
		i would back you for the senate.
		i'm sure gracchus would as well.

					commodus
		not a word about that sodomite
		bastard.

					gaius
			(smiles to maximus)
		the august senator gracchus has been
		rather a gadfly on the flesh of the
		imperial family.

					falco
		he's a damned provocateur.

					gaius
		he lives under the antiquated
		assumption that the senate should
		represent the people with vigor.

					commodus
		i won't tolerate it.  his incessant
		criticism exhausts me.  the man can
		speak for five hours without taking
		a breath.

					gaius
		he serves rome best when he serves
		it with honesty.

					commodus
			(sharply)
		enough... maximus, i would like to
		inspect the felix regiment at dawn.
		please arrange it.

					maximus
		i can't do that.

					commodus
		excuse me?

					maximus
		my men have been fighting for five
		solid days.  they're too busy dying
		to go on dress parade.

a beat.  commodus' eyes flash fire at this public rebuke.
he very quickly gets control.

					commodus
			(smiles)
		of course, how foolish of me.  some
		other time...

he notes his father being helped out of the tent by
several body slaves.

					commodus
		caesar retires early tonight.
