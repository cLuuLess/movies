int.  marcus' tent - day

maximus enters marcus' darkened tent.  flickering braziers
provide the only light in the enormous imperial tent.
heavy beams support the canopy and they creak like the
timbers of a ship as the tent sways slightly in the wind.

marcus stands before a map of the roman empire.

					maximus
			(bows)
		caesar.

marcus holds out a scroll.

					marcus
		read this.

					maximus
		i never acquired the art, sir.

					marcus
		of course.  no matter.  in this
		letter i denote my intention to
		nominate you to stand for the
		emperorship after my death.

a stunned pause.  maximus stares at him.

					marcus
		my son is not a moral man.  you have
		known this since you were young.  he
		cannot rule.

					maximus
		caesar, i am honored but --

					marcus
		for twenty years i have been
		spilling blood.  for twenty years i
		have written philosophy and
		ruminated and conquered.  since i
		became caesar i have only had four
		years without war.  four years of
		peace in twenty.  so perhaps i can
		be... forgiven.

a long beat.

					marcus
		while i have been fighting, rome has
		grown mad and corpulent and
		diseased.  i did this.  and now i
		shall make it right.

					maximus
		sire, you brought the light of the
		gods to barbarian darkness.  you
		brought civilization and justice to
		the farthest --

					marcus
			(fierce)
		i have brought the sword -- nothing
		more!  rome is far away and we
		shouldn't be here.  what matter is
		it to the gods if we subdue one more
		tribe of parthians or gauls?  what
		matter is it to rome if a thousand
		more barbarians bend to our lash?

a beat.

marcus sits.  he doesn't look at maximus.

a pause.

					marcus
		winter, maximus.  it's winter now...

a beat.

					marcus
		there was a dream that was rome.  i
		can only whisper of it now.
		anything more than a whisper and the
		dream vanishes.  it's so... fragile.
		the true glory of rome is in a very
		fragile idea.  imagine a place
		devoted to the rights of the
		citizen.  where every free man has a
		voice.  that was the dream... and i
		fear it will not survive the winter.

he holds out a hand to maximus.  maximus takes his hand,
deeply moved, kneeling.

					marcus
		let's just whisper here, you and i.

					maximus
		yes, caesar.

					marcus
		if the dream is ever to live again
		the people must have a true voice.
		the voice i took from them.  that
		all the caesars took from them, bit
		by bit, conquest by conquest.  and
		now that i am dying i am going to
		give them that voice again.

					maximus
		you're not dying.

					marcus
		i am, maximus.  it's strange... i
		find as i near the end i think
		little of the waning moments around
		me... instead i think much of the
		past... and of the future.  how will
		the world speak my name in years to
		come?  will i be known as the
		philosopher?  the warrior?  the
		tyrant?  or will there be a more
		golden sounding to my name?  will i
		be the emperor who gave rome back
		her freedom?

a beat.

					marcus
		before i die i will give the people
		this final gift.  i will give them
		the senate reborn.  the voice of the
		people empowered again, as it was
		always meant to be.  it is my design
		that they will elect the next
		emperor.  and i would put forward
		your name with my backing.

					maximus
		caesar, you do me honor -- but your
		son has pride of place for
		succession.

					marcus
		you are the son i should have had...
		although i fear in my deepest heart
		that if you had truly been my son my
		blood would have polluted you as it
		did commodus.  we're a cursed
		bloodline.  we have lived so long in
		power and depravity that we no
		longer remember a life without it.
		we can no longer even imagine a life
		without it.

a beat.

					marcus
		look at me, son.

maximus looks at him.

					marcus
		son... i know that one grove of your
		vineyard is worth more to you than
		all the treasures of rome.  i know
		one loving word from your wife is
		worth more than the accolades of an
		empire.  but... a fond old man, who
		loves you more than he can say, begs
		you to at least think about what he
		has said tonight.

					maximus
		i shall, caesar.

a beat.

					marcus
		i'll keep this letter to myself.  i
		hope that with the sunrise you will
		agree.  and embrace me as a father.

maximus nods and rises.  he begins to go.  stops.

					maximus
		you have always been my father.

he goes.
