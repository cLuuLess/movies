int.  palace - throne room - day

emperor commodus is standing before a group of male
children and their tutors in his throne room.

the throne room is still very much the province of his
father.  manuscripts and astronomical charts and papyrus
scrolls and wax tablets litter the heavy desk.  a large
bust of marcus aurelius is in one corner.

lucilla and senator falco are present.  so too senators
gracchus and gaius and captain marcellus.

a well-rehearsed child presents commodus with a laurel
wreath.

					child
		we honor caesar with the laurel to
		show our love and appreciation for
		his benevolence.

					commodus
		caesar is honored to accept your
		tribute, citizen scholar.

the child smiles and moves back to his fellows.

					commodus
			(to all)
		it is the most sacred duty of the
		emperor to oversee the education of
		the young.  if i could leave no
		other legacy than the scholarship of
		all children my life would be
		blessed.  tutors, you hold the
		future of rome in your hands.  teach
		them well so that they will bring
		honor to the empire.  i salute you.

commodus actually bows before them, an unimaginable honor.

the tutors bow in response and herd the children out.

					commodus
		look at them, senators... my truest
		gift to rome.

					gracchus
		darling children, to be sure, now if
		i may proceed?

					commodus
			(sighs)
		very well...

commodus moves to the desk, standing over it and gazing at
marcus' scrolls as:

					gracchus
		caesar, your presence in rome is an
		invaluable opportunity to begin
		correcting some of the ills that
		have beset the city since your
		father went to the wars.  we would
		like to --

					commodus
		peace, good gracchus, peace...

commodus slowly begins pushing marcus' papyrus scrolls off
the desk to the floor, one by one, as:

					commodus
		my beloved father was a careless
		shepherd to his flock.  i shall be a
		good father to my children.  i shall
		remain in rome and show them how
		they are loved.

					gracchus
		with respect, sire, the people don't
		need love -- they need law.  the
		senate has prepared a series of
		protocols to begin addressing the
		corruption in the city --
			(gaius hands him a
			scroll)
		-- starting with basic sanitation in
		the hebrew quarter.  if caesar could
		study this and --

					commodus
		you see that's the very problem,
		isn't it, my old, old friend?  my
		father spent all his time at study.
		at books and learning and
		philosophy...

as commodus speaks he moves to the chair behind the desk,
tries it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave.  the chair is
whisked away.

					commodus
		he spent his twilight hours reading
		scrolls from the senate.  all the
		while, the people were forgotten.

					gracchus
		the senate is the people.

					commodus
		i doubt many of the people eat so
		well as you do, senator gracchus...

as commodus speaks he moves to the bust of marcus, studies
it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave and the bust is
whisked away.  lucilla watches this closely.

					commodus
		i doubt many of the people have such
		splendid armor, captain marcellus.
		or such fine mistresses, senator
		gaius.  no... only their true father
		knows what the people need.  i shall
		show them they are loved.  i shall
		hold them to my bosom and embrace
		them tightly --

					gracchus
		have you ever embraced someone dying
		of plague, sire?

commodus stops.  looks at him.  a lethal moment.

					commodus
		no.  but if you interrupt me one
		more time i assure you that you
		shall.  i will emulate the immortal
		caesars of the past.  i will give
		the people what they truly want.
		starting this day i will draw all of
		rome to the colosseum.  i will give
		them bread.  and they will want
		nothing more.

startled looks between gracchus, gaius and marcellus.

					gracchus
		you want to hold games?

					commodus
		not just any games, senator!  a
		series of games that will make the
		gods envious and leave my children
		happy!  i will subsidize the arena
		from this day forth -- and i will
		culminate this celebration in a
		great spectacle the likes of which
		the world has never seen!  a great
		spectacle to honor my father!
		magnificent, unending weeks of
		festivity all in the name of marcus
		aurelius!

a beat.

					gracchus
		if i may, caesar... how are you
		going to pay for this?

					commodus
		that is not your concern.

gracchus ignores a warning look from gaius.

					gracchus
		respectfully, sire, taxation and
		import duties are the exclusive
		province of the senate --

commodus spins on him so quickly and with such feral
violence that everyone is shocked --

					commodus
		my father deserves to be honored and
		i will honor him! -- and the people
		will love me! -- and the senate will
		obey me or every one of you will
		burn!  burn!  burn! -- i will have
		order!

he snarls like a great jungle cat and he stalks away.
senator falco quickly follows.

a dreadful silence.

then:

					lucilla
		gentlemen, in the future do not
		concern my brother with these
		matters.  come to me.

she sweeps out.

a beat.

					marcellus
		games?  he wants to hold games?

					gaius
		it's madness.

					gracchus
		no... it's not...

a beat.

					gracchus
		he knows who rome is.  rome is the
		mob.  he will conjure magic for them
		and they will be distracted.  and he
		will takes their lives.  and he will
		take their freedom.  and still they
		will roar.  the beating heart of
		rome isn't the marble of the senate.
		it's the sand of the colosseum.  he
		will give them death.  and they will
		love him for it.
