ext.  tent city - dawn

maximus is slogging through the mud and snow that blankets
the rome camp.  he stops to observe an unusual sight.

commodus is stripped almost naked, his chiseled body
covered in a fine sheen of sweat.  he and his six
centurion body guards are going through their daily
ritual.  they defy the sub-zero temperatures and hack at
small trees with swords.

it is an eerie, zen-like workout.  commodus' intense
concentration is unnerving.

maximus watches for a moment then moves on.  he approaches
a large network of tents.  he enters.
