ext.  forest - below the road - dawn

maximus eyes the two assassins as they troop down the
hill away from the road, he notes their sparkling armor.
the armor of men who have never seen real battle.

					maximus
		have you ever done this before?

					assassin #3
		what?

					maximus
		killed a man with a sword?

					assassin #3
		not like this, exactly... this is
		good, you can stop.

they stop.  they are far down the hill, out of sight of
the road.

					maximus
		it can be very messy -- you could
		get blood all over your armor.  you
		don't want to hack me up now.  you
		want one clean stroke.

					assassin #3
		would you kneel, general?

maximus kneels, his whole body secretly coiling.  assassin
#3 stands over him as:

					maximus
		one good stroke -- you do know
		where, don't you?

					assassin #4
		be quiet.

					maximus
		if you miss the spot there'll be
		blood everywhere.  quite a spray.

					assassins #3
		all right, where?

					maximus
		here -- you don't want to hit the
		vein on the neck --

maximus points his bound hands at a spot on the back of
his neck.

					maximus
		put the point of your sword here...
		you want one, good blow right at
		this spot --

assassin #3 dutifully puts the point of his sword on the
spot on maximus' neck.

a grave mistake.

maximus instantly grabs the blade of the sword with his
hands and yanks it from assassin #3 -- exploding up -- his
hands are bleeding but he tosses the sword into the air
and catches it -- swings the sword with brutal efficiency
-- decapitating both assassins --
