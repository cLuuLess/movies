ext.  colosseum - day

a flurry of images from around the colosseum, the energy
mounting.  at this point we see practically nothing of the
inside of the colosseum:

slaves are balancing high above the empty arena.  they are
on ropes unrolling huge rolls of muslin; sun tarps that
provide shade below...

merchants open stalls in the curved arcade around outside
of the colosseum.  they sell everything from food to magic
elixirs, from toys to aphrodisiacs.  they immediately
start declaiming and demonstrating the virtues of their
products...

gangs of whores of both sexes trawl the streets.  they
have bizarrely-colored hair and elaborate makeup...

citizens begin arriving, pushing past the vendors and the
pickpockets.  we see whole families with picnic lunches...

ferocious animals are brought into the colosseum in barred
cages...

in the busy arcade, barbers and blood-letters practice
their craft alongside exotic alchemists, fire eaters and
contortionists...

richer citizens arrive in sedan chairs and chariots, they
feign indifference to the hooting mob...

mounted city guard police units try to retain some
order...

gamblers crowd betting booths and haggle mercilessly...

finally, we see maximus and the other gladiators in a
slave cart.  maximus watches everything as the slave cart
disappears into the colosseum...
