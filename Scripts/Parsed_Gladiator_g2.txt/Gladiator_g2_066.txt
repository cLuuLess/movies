int.  colosseum - route to holding cells - day

the interior of the colosseum is a busy world unto itself.

maximus and the others are lead by proximo's guards down a
long ramp and past countless animal cages.  gamblers
circulate everywhere and observe the warriors, angling for
the best odds and the best matches.

maximus and the others are led even deeper into the bowels
of the colosseum to a new whole subterranean realm.
numerous cells line the walls.  racks and racks of
weaponry and armor.

and, most striking, everywhere around them is the heavy
machinery of the spectacles above.  huge "elevator"
platforms and ramps and pulleys and counterweights are
manned by teams of sweating slaves.
