int.  colosseum - holding cells - day

maximus is resting in his cell after the battle, head
down, deep in thought.

					lucius' voice
		is it true you're a general...?

maximus looks up, lucius is standing at his cell.  maximus
has no idea who the boy is -- just another young fan --
but maximus is immediately struck by lucius' resemblance
to his own son.

					maximus
		i was a general.

					lucius
		i saw you fight.  the carthage
		battle too.  i've never seen so much
		courage.

					maximus
		it doesn't take courage to kill.

					lucius
		my father was killed.

a beat.

					maximus
		i'm sorry.

					lucius
		he still comes to me in my dreams.
		do you have a father?

					maximus
		i had a father.  he wasn't really my
		father but i cared for him very much.

					lucius
		i hope he comes to you in your
		dreams.  my father and i ride horses
		in mine.

these simple words strike something deep in maximus.

lucilla appears from the shadows and puts her hands on
lucius' shoulders.

					lucilla
		lucius, run along now.  i need to
		talk to the general.

lucius runs off to his male attendant, who leads him away.

a long beat as maximus and lucilla look at each other.

finally:

					maximus
		where is my army?

a drum beat is heard.  it increases throughout the
following scenes, building momentum like a roman gallery
accelerating to ramming speed.

the conspiracy scenes are enclosed in a montage of scenes
in and around the arena showing maximus' growing
popularity with the people of rome...
