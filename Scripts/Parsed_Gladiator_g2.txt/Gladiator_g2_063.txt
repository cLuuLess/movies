ext.  proximo's compound - courtyard - night

inside the gates is a large courtyard, much like proximo's
moroccan school but much more impressive.  a fountain with
an enormous statue of the war god mars is central in the
courtyard.

the gladiators climb from the wagon, stretching after the
long journey.  vibius leads maximus and juba to the
statue.  he wades through the fountain and kisses the toe
of mars.

					vibius
		tradition.  he watches over us.

juba steps up and kisses the toe.

					vibius
			(to maximus)
		oh go on, it won't kill you.

maximus kisses the toe as well.

					proximo
			(calling to them)
		stop that!  you'll get some
		monstrous disease and then you'll be
		worth nothing to me!

guards come and lead them to their cells, which line one
side of the courtyard.
