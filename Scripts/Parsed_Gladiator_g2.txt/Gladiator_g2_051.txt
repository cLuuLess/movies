ext.  rome - wagon - day

senator gracchus, an imposing, moral and corpulent man in
his 60's, is riding in a luxurious wagon with senator
gaius.

and captain marcellus, the handsome head of the roman city
guard.

their wagon slowly maneuvers through the crowded streets
of rome.  the cosmopolitan bustle of the great urban
center is everywhere around them.

					gracchus
		we have plague in the hebrew quarter
		and it is spreading... we have
		looting at the granaries... we have
		so much filth in the tiber that the
		water is undrinkable... we have
		praetorian guard units that are
		demanding protection payments from
		the merchants at the exchange --

					marcellus
		my city guard units have tried to
		curtail these excesses but no
		constabulary can police the entire
		city.  and the praetorians outnumber
		us two to one.

					gracchus
		rome dies as the emperor plays at
		beneficence.  at least nero gave us
		music!

					gaius
		do you think he'll listen to us?

					gracchus
		it is his duty to hear the will of
		the senate.

their wagon stops -- hopelessly stuck in a massive traffic
jam of chariots, wagons and sedan chairs.

					gracchus
		not to mention the damn traffic!
