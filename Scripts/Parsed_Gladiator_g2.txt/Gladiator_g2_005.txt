ext.  trees - twilight

maximus and titus are on their horses, the cavalry of two
hundred felix regiment warriors surrounds them.  steam
flares from their horses' nostrils.  they wait in a thick
stand of trees -- the german position can be seen across a
muddy plain.

a large wolf -- "the wolf of rome" -- waits at maximus'
side.

maximus nods to an archer.  the archer lights the tip of
an arrow and sends it flaming into the night sky.
