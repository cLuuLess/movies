ext.  forest road - dawn

assassin #1 waits on his horse.  he hears the commotion
below -- spins his horse around just as maximus bursts to
the road.  he stands with a sword.

assassin #1 spurs his horse and gallops toward maximus at
full speed -- maximus crouches and prepares --

assassin #1 and maximus swirl together for an instant --
both slashing brutally --

assassin #1 continues to gallop past maximus.  he stops.
he looks down.  a wound in his stomach.  he falls off his
horse.  dead.

maximus has also been wounded -- a deep gash on his side.
he fights the pain as he moves toward the horses...
