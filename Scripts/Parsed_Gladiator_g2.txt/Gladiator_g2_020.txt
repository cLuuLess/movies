int.  tent corridor - day

maximus emerges from marcus' tent into a long tent
corridor, deep in thought.

					lucilla's voice
		he always favored you...

he turns.  lucilla is waiting.  she glides to him.

					lucilla
		even over his son.

					maximus
			(turning away)
		that's not true.

					lucilla
		maximus, stop...
			(he stops)
		let me see your face.

he turns to her.

					lucilla
		you've been crying.

					maximus
		i lost too many men.

					lucilla
		what does my father intend?

he turns and walks.  she walks with him.

					maximus
		i don't know.

					lucilla
		you're lying.  i could tell when you
		were lying even when we were
		children.  you hate it.

					maximus
		i never acquired your comfort with
		it.

					lucilla
		true.  but then you never had to.
		maximus, stop...
			(he stops again)
		... is it really so terrible seeing
		me again?

					maximus
		no.  i'm sorry.  i'm tired from the
		battle.

					lucilla
		and you are hurt to see my father
		dying.

a beat.

					lucilla
		he will announce commodus'
		succession.  that's why he summoned
		us.  will you serve my brother as
		you served his father?

					maximus
		i will always serve the ideals of
		rome.

a beat.

					lucilla
		do you know i still remember you in
		my prayers...?  oh yes, i pray...
		ever since that day you saved me
		from drowning off capri.  do you
		remember?

					maximus
		yes.

					lucilla
		commodus was so angry that a mere
		peasant -- a spaniard no less --
		touched the royal person, do you
		remember his anger?

					maximus
		yes.

					lucilla
		mark this, maximus:  that is the man
		who will be emperor.

a beat.

					maximus
		may i be permitted to go, highness?

she smiles sadly.

					lucilla
		there was a time when you didn't
		call me "highness."

					maximus
		and there was a time when you were
		just a little girl drowning in the
		sea.  all that was a different life.

					lucilla
			(quietly)
		very different... i wonder if it was
		better?

					maximus
		it was more honest.

a moment between them.  we sense there is much to be said,
much that could be said.

finally:

					maximus
		i thank you for your prayers.

he goes.  she watches him walk away.
