ext.  proximo's school - compound - night

a large mess area has been set up.  the tables around the
compound are crowded with gladiators.  guards everywhere.

maximus and juba enter.  move to get food.  all
conversation gradually drains away as the other gladiators
watch them.  silence.

maximus and juba note the strange silence as they move to
a large table.

vibius is at the table with a number of other gladiators.
there are no places for maximus and juba.

vibius stands and kicks two other gladiators off their
bench.

					vibius
		move aside!  this is a table for
		men!

maximus and juba sit.

vibius remains standing.  he begins to pound on the table
with his fist.  soon all the gladiators are pounding on
their tables.  it is a cacophonous din honoring maximus.
