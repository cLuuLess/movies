int.  palace - lucilla's chambers - night

senators gracchus and gaius and captain marcellus are
waiting.

					lucilla
		he's asleep.  be quick.

					gracchus
		we've taking a sounding, the senate
		is with us.

					lucilla
		good.

					gracchus
		but we are only words.  we are air.
		we need steel.

					marcellus
		the city guard is faithful to the
		republic.  but we don't stand a
		chance against the praetorians.

					lucilla
		can they be bought?

					marcellus
		they are zealots -- totally
		committed to your brother.

					gracchus
		well, can they at least be rented
		for a day?

					marcellus
		i doubt it.  he pays them exorbitant
		salaries and lets them loot and
		extort as they see fit.  the city
		belongs to them.

					lucilla
		and they've started arresting
		scholars now.  anyone who dares
		speak out -- even satirists and
		chroniclers.

					marcellus
		and mathematicians and christians.
		all to fill the arena.

					gaius
		and what pays for it?  these games
		are costing a fortune and yet we
		have no new taxes.

					lucilla
		the future.  the future pays for
		it...

a beat.  she looks at them.

					lucilla
		he's started selling the grain
		reserves.   

					gaius
		no.

					marcellus
		that can't be true...

					lucilla
		he's selling rome's reserves of
		grain.  the people will be starving
		in two years.  i hope they are
		enjoying the spectacles because soon
		enough they will be dead because of
		them.

					marcellus
		rome must know this.

					lucilla
		and who will tell them?!  you,
		marcellus?  you, senator gaius?
		will you make a speech on the senate
		floor denouncing my brother?  and
		then see your family in the
		colosseum?  what town-crier would
		dare?

a long beat.

					lucilla
		he must die.

a beat as her words sink in.

					gaius
		the praetorians would only seize
		control themselves.

					lucilla
		no -- cut off the head and the snake
		cannot strike.

					gracchus
		lucilla, gaius is right.  until the
		city guard can neutralize the
		praetorians we can accomplish
		nothing.

					marcellus
		and i haven't enough men.

					lucilla
		what about the army?

					gaius
		no roman army has entered the
		capital in a hundred years.

					lucilla
		so we do nothing?!

a door opens, a voice...

					lucius' voice
		mother...

an eight-year-old boy stands in a doorway, sleepy.  he is
lucius, lucilla's son.

					lucius
		i heard voices...

					lucilla
			(going to him)
		it's all right, darling, you --

lucius suddenly notices senator gracchus:

					lucius
			(running to gracchus)
		senator!  what did you bring me?!

he leaps onto gracchus -- gracchus laughs and pulls
something from his robe.

					gracchus
		for you prince lucius... a sea
		monster!

gracchus gives lucius a beautifully painted toy of a sea
serpent.

					gracchus
		off the coast of achaea they grow
		twenty times this size, with
		snapping teeth to devour any nasty
		praetorians they come across... now,
		where is achaea?

					lucius
		below macedonia!

					gracchus
		show me on the map.

lucius runs to a map and stabs his finger at achaea.  we
sense this is an old game between them.

					lucilla
		lucius, you go in now, i'll be in
		shortly.

					lucius
			(to gracchus)
		thank you, senator mountain!

					gracchus
		you're welcome, prince anthill!

lucius goes.  lucilla shuts the door after him.  a moment.
she turns to the others, a deep anguish in her eyes.

					lucilla
		what are you going to do?

gracchus goes to her, holds her.

					gracchus
		peace child... one dark night the
		gods will light our path.  they will
		give us the voice we need.  have
		faith in that.  have faith.
