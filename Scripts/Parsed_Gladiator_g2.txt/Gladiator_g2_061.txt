int./ ext.  roman streets - slave wagon - night

maximus cranes for a sight of the eternal city through a
hole in the wooden slats that cover the slave cart.

he can see only glimpses of rome as they pass.  but the
images are not what he expected.  alongside the undeniable
glory of the city, the madness and disease marcus aurelius
spoke of are readily apparent.

maximus sees flashes of plague victims being tossed on
carts heaped with bodies -- he sees getting and spending
and commerce everywhere -- he sees fascist praetorian
guard units trooping past -- he sees the magnificent
architecture of the city -- he sees starving children
begging from filthy gutters -- he sees rich citizens out
for a stroll -- he sees a swirling combination of
sophistication and depravity, of civilization and
corruption.

he sits back in the cart, deep in thought.  vibius looks
at him.

					vibius
		not what you expected?

					maximus
		no.

					vibius
		rome is nothing but a slaughter
		house.  and we are the meat.
