int.  proximo's compound - cell - night

later.  maximus and juba again share a cell.  it is more
comfortable than their cell in morocco, befitting maximus'
new status as one of the "stars."  a high, barred window
on one wall opens to the city.  another barred window is
directly over them, twenty feet above.

maximus pulls himself up to the side window, he looks out.

and sees at last... the colosseum.

it is a breathtaking sight.  monolithic albert speer-like
columns of light shine up from the colosseum.  it seems to
illuminate the whole city and the heavens above.

maximus drops back to the floor.

					juba
		do you think it will be much
		different?  here in rome?

					maximus
		bigger arena.  same killing.

a beat.

					juba
		are you scared for tomorrow?

					maximus
		no.

a beat.

					juba
		me too.

a beat.

					juba
		i never though it would be so easy
		to kill.

a beat.

					juba
		so you're finally home.

					maximus
		this isn't my home.

					juba
		for all romans... this is home.

a beat.

					juba
			(quietly)
		among my people we honor the soil of
		our home.  our ancestors are in that
		soil.  all their dreams live there.
		i will never see my home again.  the
		soil is dead and no one honors them,
		so the dreams die.

a beat.

					maximus
		perhaps one day you'll return.

juba looks at him.

					juba
		how can i go back?  i am not what i
		was.  when a man kills for no
		reason, he has lost himself.

a long beat.

juba leans his head back and quietly begins to sing.  a
haunting lament in his native tongue.
