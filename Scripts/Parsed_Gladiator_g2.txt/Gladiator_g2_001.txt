germania.  the far reaches of the roman empire.

winter 180 a.d.

incongruously enough, the first sound we hear is a
beautiful tenor voice.  singing.  a boy's voice.

credits as we hear the haunting song float through dense
forests.  we finally come to a rough, muddy road slashing
through the forest.  on the road a german peasant father
is herding along three sickly looking cows.  his two sons
are with him.  his youngest son sits on one of the cows
and sings a soft, plaintive song.

they become aware of another sound behind them on the road
-- the creak of wood, the slap of metal on leather.  the
father immediately leads his cattle and his sons off the
road.  they stand-still, eyes down:  the familiar posture
of subjugated peoples throughout history.

a wagon train rumbles past them.  three ornate wagons
followed by a mounted cohort of fifty heavily-armed
praetorian guards.

the young boy dares to glance up at the passing romans.
his eyes burn with hatred.
