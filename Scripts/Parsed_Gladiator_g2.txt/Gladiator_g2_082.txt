int.  proximo's compound - cell - night

maximus and juba are with lucilla and gracchus.  lucilla
is writing on a piece of parchment.

					maximus
		tell him we will enter rome on the
		first day of commodus' festival.

					lucilla
		and they will march on rome for you?

					maximus
		yes.  but this letter must go to the
		lieutenant named titus, no one else.

					lucilla
		captain marcellus will take it.  and
		his city guard will by with you when
		you get to rome.  is that enough to
		face the praetorian guard?

					maximus
			(looks to her)
		the felix regiment will never be
		defeated.

a beat.

					gracchus
		i only have one question for you,
		general... why?

a beat.

					gracchus
		you will lead an army of your
		brothers on rome.  many will die.
		why?

					maximus
		i want commodus dead.

					gracchus
		that's not the reason.  tell me the
		truth.

a beat.

					maximus
		because one night an old man
		whispered to me about a dream.  i
		will die for that dream.

a long beat.

					gracchus
		i knew the old man well.  and i
		loved him very much.  in our youth
		we would spend hours building that
		dream together.  after he went to
		the wars and lost his way... i was
		very cruel.  i tormented him to
		remember that dream we spoke of.

					maximus
		he did.

					gracchus
		you can have no idea how much that
		means to me.

a beat.

					gracchus
		any man who will die for a whispered
		dream deserves my respect.  i honor
		you, general.

the drums continue...
