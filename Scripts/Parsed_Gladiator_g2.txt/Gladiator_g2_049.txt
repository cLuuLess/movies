ext.  provincial arena - dugout - day

in the cramped holding area of the arena, a dugout beneath
the stands, maximus and the other gladiators are waiting.

proximo walks before them, giving a final "pep talk."  he
gazes at them evenly, his eyes going from face to face.

					proximo
		some of you say you can't fight, you
		won't fight... they all say that...
		but one day you will pick up a sword
		and thrust it into another man.  and
		the crowd will cheer you and love
		you.  and you will love them for it.
		on that day... you will be a
		gladiator.

he stops at maximus.

					proximo
		in this life, we all die.  all we
		can choose is how we die.  and how
		we are remembered.  be remembered
		proudly.

drums are heard from the arena.  proximo nods to a waiting
blacksmith.

the blacksmith begins slamming shackles on the gladiator's
wrists -- chaining them together in teams of two by a
chain about four feet long.

the blacksmith is about to chain maximus to the scribe.

					proximo
		no...
			(he points to juba)
		... give the spaniard to him.  give
		the scribe to vibius.

proximo nods to vibius, who, for reasons we shall soon
see, makes no protest to being chained to the whimpering
scribe.

proximo watches the blacksmith shackle maximus and juba
together and then strides off.

					juba
			(to maximus)
		are we going to fight each other?
