ext.  vineyard - day

maximus' home in spain is beautiful beyond measure.

we see verdant farmlands and vineyards and a spacious
house nestled amid gently rolling hills.

maximus' eight-year-old son is in a paddock playing with
his pony.  he stops, sees something.  over a hill, he can
just glimpse a battle flag, approaching.

he screams with joy and runs toward the flag as he calls:

					maximus' son
		mother!  mother!  father's home!

maximus' wife emerges from the house, drying her hands on
a cloth and smiles.

maximus' son races toward the flag.  he can just see the
soldiers beginning to appear over the hill.  not a roman
legion at all.  twenty praetorians canter over the hill.

maximus' son stops, confused.
