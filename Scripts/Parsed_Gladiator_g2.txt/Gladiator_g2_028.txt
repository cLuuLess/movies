ext.  forest road - dawn

the four praetorian assassins lead maximus along a road.
he sits slumped in his saddle, drained.

					assassin #1
		all right, this is far enough.

the three other assassins climb from their horses.
assassin #2 pushes maximus from his horse.  he falls to
the ground hard.

					assassin #1
		you two take him down there where no
		one will find him.

					assassin #3
		come on, general...

assassin #3 and assassin #4 drag maximus down a densely
forested hill along the road.  maximus' hands are still
bound in front of him.  he seems totally lacking in any
resistance.
