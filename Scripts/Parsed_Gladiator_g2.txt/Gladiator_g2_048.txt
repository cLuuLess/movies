ext.  slave wagon - provincial streets - day

blood appears to be flowing across an oxen's back.  but
the blood is too rich, too red.

the oxen are pulling an open slave wagon through the
crowded streets of the town.  hanging above the street is
dyed wool drying in the sun.  vermilion and crimson dyes
drip down and splash across the oxen -- and splash across
the gladiators.

maximus, juba, the formidable vibius are chained in the
back of the wagon.  also the frightened scribe.

proximo and a few of his guards drive the wagon.  proximo
has an umbrella over him, colored with years of dripping
dyes.

they pass a banner honoring vibius, the star of proximo's
stable.

meanwhile, the terrified scribe is almost weeping,
chattering nervously to vibius, chained next to him:

					scribe
		i know nothing of armaments and
		warfare!  i'm a scribe -- i write
		down words!  i can write down seven
		languages --

					vibius
		be still.

					scribe
		i don't -- how do you hold the
		sword?!  i've never held a sword!

					vibius
		you point the sharp end at your
		opponent and you shove it in his
		guts.

					scribe
		i can't -- i --

he suddenly vomits.

					vibius
			(calling to proximo)
		proximo!  you insult me with this
		carrion!  chain him to someone else!

					proximo
			(calling back)
		don't worry, noble vibius, he won't
		be bothering you for long.

the scribe begins to weep.

the crowds in the street jeer at the passing gladiators.
occasionally throwing trash at them.  a pack of children
run alongside the wagon, chanting:

					children
		dead guts!  dead guts!  dead guts!

maximus watches the children for a moment and then another
sight draws his attention.  over some buildings he can see
vultures circling in the distance.
