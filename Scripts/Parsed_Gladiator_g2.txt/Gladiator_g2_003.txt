int.  wagon - day

mist momentarily obscures a man's face.  frozen breath.
the man is in his 20's, imperious and handsome.  he is
swathed in fur, only his face exposed.  he is commodus.

he glances up.

					commodus
		do you think he's really dying?

the woman across from him returns his gaze evenly.  she is
slightly older, beautiful and patrician.  a formidable
woman.

she is lucilla.

					lucilla
		he's been dying for ten years.

					commodus
		i think he's really dying this time.

a beat.  their breath turns instantly to mist.

					commodus
		he has to be bled every night now.

					lucilla
		how do you know that?

					commodus
		i've been so informed.

she arches an eyebrow.

					commodus
		if he weren't really dying he
		wouldn't have sent for us.

					lucilla
			(a smile)
		maybe he just misses us.

					commodus
		and the senators.  he wouldn't have
		summoned them if --

					lucilla
		peace, commodus.  after two weeks on
		the road your incessant scheming is
		hurting my head.

a beat.

					commodus
		the first thing i shall do is honor
		him with games worthy of his
		majesty.

					lucilla
		the first thing i shall do is have a
		hot bath.

the wagon rumbles to a halt.  voices are heard outside.

commodus leaps out...
