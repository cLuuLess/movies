ext.  wagon - outpost - day

three roman soldiers guard an outpost, a watchtower, on
the roadside.

					commodus
		why have we stopped?

					praetorian guard member
		we're here, sir.

					commodus
			(to soldier #1)
		where is my father?

					soldier #1
		he's at the front, sir.

					commodus
		is the battle won?

					soldier #1
		don't know, sir.  they've been gone
		for eight days.

commodus tosses off his furs -- beneath them he wears a
beautiful set of lorica segmentata -- the traditional
formed armor of rome.  he moves to a horse as:

					commodus
			(to soldier #1)
		my sister wants a bath, take her to
		the camp.
			(to soldier #2)
		take me to my father.

he leaps onto the horse and canters back to the praetorian
guard unit.

soldier #2 climbs on his horse and leads them.  commodus
rides off with most of the praetorian guard unit.

lucilla peeks her head from the wagon.  she glances at the
remaining soldiers.  distinctly unpromising.

					lucilla
			(dry)
		civilization at last.  gods preserve
		us.
