ext.  provincial arena - day

we continue with maximus as he strides into the roaring
arena.

we finally see him in the blazing sunlight -- he wears
traditional gladiator armor and now has longer hair and a
beard --

a battle is already in progress, fighting and dead and
dying gladiators crowd the arena --

we stay with maximus as he wades through his opponents,
fighting them heroically, slashing through them without
stopping --

the large crowd cheers mightily -- chants of "spaniard!
spaniard!  spaniard!"

we stay with maximus as he cuts through the four celts
like a scythe through wheat and then we dramatically pull
up and away --

taking in the roaring arena and the hero.
