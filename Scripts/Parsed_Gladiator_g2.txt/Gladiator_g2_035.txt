ext.  tent city - day

a gloomy day.  emperor commodus stands before the
assembled felix regiment.

the soldiers are already uneasy.  they note quintus
standing by commodus, wearing maximus' seal of office.
where is maximus?

					commodus
		even as the gods curse this dark day
		with clouds, so too does the sun
		begin to shine forth on a promised
		tomorrow.  even as we mourn the
		passing of our father, so too do we
		celebrate the coming of a bright,
		new age for rome.  at my side,
		brothers, you shall pull fresh
		glories from the heavens.  at my
		side, brothers, you shall know the
		adoration of the gods.  doubly-dark
		is this day because my friend, your
		noble commander maximus meridas, has
		been called to rome to deal with
		urgent matters of state...

titus glances quickly to gallus, whose hand is bandaged
from surgery.  they know this cannot be true.

					commodus
		until his promised return i
		appointed quintus domitian to serve
		in his stead.  i salute you,
		legionnaires!

					quintus
			(raising his sword)
		hail, caesar!

the felix regiment responds, many unsure.

					felix regiment
		hail, caesar!

commodus strides off and the felix regiment slowly
disbands, muttering to one another in confusion.

titus and gallus go to quintus.

					titus
		quintus, what is -- ?

					quintus
			(firmly)
		don't speak of it.  never speak of
		it.

he stalks off.  titus and gallus, concerned, watch him
follow after commodus.
