ext.  trees - twilight

maximus watches the german camp.

					maximus
			(to his men)
		hold steady... steady...

he can see the nightmare destruction of the encampment
continuing -- fire pots and scorpion bolts and flaming
arrows -- panic in the german encampment.

					maximus
		steady...

he sees the germans begin fleeing across the plain.  he
quickly raises his sword and whispers a prayer, then turns
to his men:

					maximus
		brothers -- i salute you!  for rome!

he spurs his horse and races out of the trees to the
plain...
