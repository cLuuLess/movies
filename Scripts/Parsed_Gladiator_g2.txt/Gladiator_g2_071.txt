int.  palace - throne room - night

to our great surprise, commodus is not raging.  he sits
quietly on the polished marble floor in front of a model
of the colosseum.  he moves model pieces around in the
colosseum, planning his festival.

lucilla stands, tense.

					commodus
		why is he still alive?

					lucilla
		i don't know.

					commodus
		he shouldn't be alive.  that vexes
		me.  i am terribly vexed...

lucilla watches her brother cautiously, expecting the
explosion.  he carefully moves some model pieces in the
arena.

					commodus
		there, that's better.  do you like
		the platform here?

					lucilla
		mmm.

					commodus
		i do too.  simple, elegant...

lucilla is growing more and more unnerved at commodus'
unusual serenity.

					commodus
		father would have wanted something
		more ornate but he's dead now.

a beat.  commodus laughs.  a beat.

					commodus
		maximus meridas haunts me.  i see
		father turning away from me and
		gazing at him.  how many times did i
		suffer that indignity, i wonder?

					lucilla
		what are you going to do?

					commodus
		i'm going to kill him.

					lucilla
		good.

					commodus
			(glances at her)
		oh, you're too clever, sister.
		don't tell me part of you won't weep
		for him.

					lucilla
		when he defies my brother the
		emperor, he defies me.  but you
		shouldn't send assassins.

					commodus
		no?

					lucilla
		the people embraced him today.  they
		will be expecting his next match...
			(she kneels next to
			him)
		... let him die in the arena like
		the slave he is.  let the people see
		what comes of defying caesar.

a beat as he looks at her.

					commodus
		he wounded you deeply, didn't he?
		long ago.

she does not answer.

					commodus
		nonetheless, your political acumen
		is, as always, unerring.

he picks up a model tiger and puts it in the arena.  he
looks at the model tiger and smiles.
