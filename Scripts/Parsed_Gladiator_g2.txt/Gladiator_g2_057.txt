int.  proximo's school - proximo's chamber - night

proximo sits on a terrace overlooking his compound,
sipping wine.  various gladiators can be seen working out
below.

a guard brings maximus.  proximo nods for the guard to
leave.

					proximo
			(holding up a plate)
		butterfly?

the plate is filled with honeyed butterflies, their wings
still moving slightly.

maximus shakes his head.  proximo pops one into his mouth.
he chews as he looks at maximus.

					proximo
		perhaps you'd like a woman?

maximus shakes his head.

					proximo
		boy?

maximus shakes his head.

a beat.

					proximo
		gold?

maximus shakes his head.

					proximo
		well, i have nothing left to offer
		you!  a man who turns down a
		butterfly, a woman, a boy and gold
		confuses me.  personally, i'd grab
		them all and then grab some more
		because the gods are fanciful and
		take us at their whim.  does the
		spaniard have any needs?

maximus shakes his head.

a beat.  proximo studies him.

					proximo
		you fight like a soldier.  you have
		wounds like a soldier who has been
		on long campaigns.  you eye the
		world around you like an enemy.
		what is your name, roman soldier?

					maximus
		gladiator.

a beat.

					proximo
		and nothing more?

					maximus
		nothing more.

a beat.

proximo watches maximus very closely for the following:

					proximo
		in two days we leave for rome.

maximus' eyes suddenly flash to proximo.  he is
transfixed, his eyes burning.

					proximo
		ah... so it's rome you want.  well
		you shall have her, gladiator.  the
		new emperor has ordered a series of
		matches to culminate in a grand
		spectacle.  if you do well i shall
		become very, very rich.  if you do
		well enough i shall set you free.
		is it freedom you want?

a beat.

maximus shakes his head.

					proximo
			(quietly)
		not even that.

					maximus
			(barely controlled)
		the emperor -- will he be there?

					proximo
		oh yes.  he's apparently quite mad
		about the games.  spending a
		fortune, which is, needless to say,
		good for me again.  but what is good
		for you, gladiator?

					maximus
		have you -- how does one meet the
		emperor?

					proximo
		as a gladiator?

					maximus
		yes.

					proximo
		one doesn't.

a beat.  proximo sees that maximus' mind is racing.

					proximo
		except... if one has proven oneself
		in battle.  if at the end of the
		games you are the final man standing
		-- the emperor will present you with
		a small wooden sword.  the sword is
		your freedom.

					maximus
		he give it personally?

					proximo
		he did to me...
			(maximus is surprised
			at this)
		our great father marcus aurelius
		looked into my eyes and touched me
		on the shoulder.

					maximus
		you knew marcus?

					proximo
		i didn't know him.  he touched me on
		the shoulder.  just once.  but that
		was enough.

a beat.

					proximo
		all right, gladiator.  we shall go
		to rome together and have bloody
		adventures.  the great whore will
		suckle us until we are fat and happy
		and can't suck another drop.  that
		is rome.
