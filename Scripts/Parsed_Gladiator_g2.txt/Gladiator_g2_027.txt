ext.  maximus' tent - tent city - night

five horses are waiting.

					maximus
		quintus, what -- ?

					quintus
			(anguish)
		i have no choice --

they are almost run over by a stern cohort of twenty
praetorians who gallop past.  maximus knows immediately
what this means.

					maximus
			(suddenly)
		my family?!

a beat.

					maximus
		what about my family, quintus?

					quintus
			(quietly)
		they will greet you in the
		afterlife.

maximus lunges at him -- the praetorians subdue him --
slamming him with a sword hilt -- knocking him
unconscious.

					quintus
			(quietly, to
			assassins)
		take him as far as the sunrise and
		then kill him.
