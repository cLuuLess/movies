ext.  vineyard - day

an unusual jingling sound is heard.  maximus appears to be
dead, his gaping wound beginning to fester.

the source of the jingling becomes clear when we see the
feet of bedouin brigands, with delicate anklets, shuffling
around him.  a hand touches his sandals.  rich sandals.
another touches his tunic.  good cloth.

suddenly maximus groans.  the hands stop.  he's alive.  a
bit of quick language in an unknown tongue.

then the hands grab maximus and drag him away.
