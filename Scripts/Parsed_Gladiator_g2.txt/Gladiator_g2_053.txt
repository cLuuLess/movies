int.  provincial arena - dugout - tunnels - day

maximus is marching relentlessly through the dugout and
cramped, serpentine trench-like tunnels that lead to the
arena.

we don't really see maximus well in the dark tunnels.

proximo scurries to keep up with him -- they brush past
gladiators who line the walls.  some are wounded, some are
being attended to by surgeons, some are shell-shocked,
some are nervously waiting to go on, whispering prayers.

we twist and turn in the tunnels with proximo and maximus
as:

					proximo
			(quickly)
		i've wagered on you against the
		celts -- ignore the others and go
		for them -- there are two axe-and-
		net and two long spear.  now the
		celts aren't used to the sun so you
		have the advantage there...

the roar of the crowd is growing, they are nearing the
arena...

					proximo
		and keep them moving, their lungs
		aren't strong, ground the spears as
		soon as you can and then go for the
		ax-men.  if you get all four there's
		an extra bonus so don't be
		distracted by the spartans...

without a word to proximo, or a moment's hesitation,
maximus strides into the arena.
