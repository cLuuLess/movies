ext.  colosseum - arena - day

vibius defeats an opponent -- he stands over him.  he
looks around at the crowd.  then he tosses down his sword
and walks off.

the crowd goes mad with pleasure.  vibius eats it up,
raising his arms and soaking up the applause.

maximus watches from the holding cells.  he smiles.

the drums continue...
