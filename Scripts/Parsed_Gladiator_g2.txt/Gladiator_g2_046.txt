int.  proximo's school - maximus' cell - night

maximus and juba share a small, filthy cell.  the cell
door faces the open compound.  across the compound they
can see the much more comfortable cells of the "star"
gladiators such as vibius.

they both sit on the floor, leaning against the wall.
juba is eating a bowl of food with a wooden spoon.
maximus' bowl and spoon are at his side, he has not
touched them.

					juba
		have you killed a man before?

maximus does not respond.

					juba
		you should eat.  you'll need your
		strength tomorrow.

maximus does not respond.

					juba
		i've never killed a man.  but i
		think you have.

maximus does not respond.

					juba
		i almost killed once.  the romans
		destroyed my village.  i was with a
		hunting party and when we
		returned... i would have killed
		every roman in the world.

a long beat.

					juba
		if you don't eat you will die.

maximus does not respond.

a beat.

					juba
		in the village i come from there was
		a man once.  he went fishing one day
		and his boat was attacked by
		crocodiles.  one of them ate his
		leg.  he pulled himself to the shore
		and a lion attacked him.  it ate one
		of his arms.  he dragged himself
		through the desert on the way home
		and a scorpion stung his eye.  so he
		only had one eye.  when he reached
		the village i sat with him.  i said,
		"you have lost a leg, an arm and one
		eye.  you must have a mighty will to
		live."  he said, "no, lord, it's
		just better than the alternative."

maximus finally looks at him.

					juba
		life is a gift from our fathers to
		us.  who are you to give it up for
		lack of lifting a spoon?

maximus does not respond.
