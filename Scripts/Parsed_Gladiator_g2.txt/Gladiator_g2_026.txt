int.  maximus' tent - night

maximus is kneeling before his ancestors, head down, his
fists clenched, praying.

quintus and four praetorian assassins suddenly burst in --
the assassins move immediately to bind maximus -- swords
at his throat --

					maximus
		what -- ?!

					quintus
			(ashamed)
		please don't fight, maximus --

					maximus
		quintus --

quintus goes to maximus' armor, which hangs nearby, and
slowly removes his seal of office.

					quintus
		i'm sorry, general, caesar has
		spoken.

they pull maximus out --
