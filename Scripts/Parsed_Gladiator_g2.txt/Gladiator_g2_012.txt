ext.  battlefield - sunset

maximus, bloody and spent, walks through the aftermath of
the carnage.  the wolf of rome is at his side.  dead and
dying by the hundreds are scattered everywhere.  roman
surgeons are attending to the wounded.

marcus walks to him, embraces him warmly.

					maximus
		caesar.

					marcus
		maximus, you prove your valor again.
		let us hope for the final time here.

					maximus
		i don't think there's anyone left to
		fight.

					marcus
		there are always people left to
		fight...

marcus takes maximus' arm and they walk through the masses
of bodies.  maximus holds marcus' arm firmly, quietly
supporting him as they walk.

					marcus
		but this night, at least, germania
		is at last defeated... what will you
		do now, my friend?

					maximus
		should caesar permit, i'll go home.
		i've been away too long.  i've
		forgotten my wife's face and i
		barely know my son.

suddenly, a tethered german prisoner they are passing
calls out to them:

					german prisoner
		this blood means nothing, conqueror!

maximus and marcus stop.  a soldier moves quickly to
silence the german prisoner.

					marcus
			(to soldier)
		stop...
			(to prisoner)
		... you speak our language?

					german prisoner
		you have been in my homeland for
		twelve years.  of course i speak
		your language.  so did my son, who
		you murdered.  so did my daughter,
		who you raped.

					maximus
			(to marcus)
		come, caesar...

					marcus
		no.  let him speak...
			(to prisoner)
		... i am rome, what would you say to
		me?

					german prisoner
			(points to sunset)
		you are that sun, rome, and your
		time is over... you can slit a
		thousand throats here, and you can
		put a thousand babies to the sword,
		but it will always be our home.

					marcus
		now it is rome.

					german prisoner
		it will never be rome.  not as long
		as one german breathes.

the soldier moves to kill the insolent prisoner.

					marcus
		no... release him.  give him safe
		passage.  let him go to his family.

the soldier leads the german prisoner away.

maximus and marcus continue walking in silence for a beat.
then:

					marcus
		tell me again, maximus, why are we
		here?

					maximus
		for the glory of the empire, sire.

					marcus
			(quietly)
		yes.  i remember.

they continue walking through the mountains of bodies...
