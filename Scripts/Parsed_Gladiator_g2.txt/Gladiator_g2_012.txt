ext.  hilltop - twilight

we see an old man's face, staring down at the battle.  the
face is weather-beaten, ailing.  the roaring flames from
the battlefield below flicker in his sad eyes.

marcus aurelius, the emperor of rome, is on a horse.  a
metal brace extends from the back of his saddle.  he is
strapped to the brace with thick, leather straps.

he watches as the felix regiment below concludes the
battle.  the cheering of the regiment can be heard as the
final, isolated pockets of germans are cut down.

behind marcus the sun is setting, painting the world blood
red.
