int.  hospital tent - night

maximus enters a large tent and is met by a spectacle of
the dead and dying.  roman surgeons are working feverishly
to save lives.  limbs are amputated, the bloody stumps
quickly cauterized with hot irons.  leeches and bronze
cups are employed for blood-letting to balance "humours."

anesthesia as we know it is nonexistent.  wine amphoras
are passed around and orderlies fan narcotic smoke toward
the patients.  mostly, though, they just hold down the
writhing patients.

maximus moves through the tent, offering a word of comfort
here and there.  all the wounded are delighted to see him.

he goes to an older soldier, gallus, who has one wooden
hand.  his other hand is bandaged.

					maximus
		what, gallus, losing your other
		hand?

					gallus
		aye, general, they're going to make
		a bronze one for it.  long fingers
		this time.

					maximus
		and the women of your village will
		crave your touch even more.

					gallus
		ah, then you know the women of my
		village.

maximus smiles and moves on.

he stops at a young soldier, valerius, whose head has been
shaved.  a hole has been bored into his skull to relieve
the pressure on his brain.  the young soldier is dying.

					maximus
		what's your name, son?

					valerius
		valerius, general.

					maximus
		the name suits you.

					valerius
		why am i dying?

a beat.  maximus sits by his cot.  he takes valerius'
hand.

					maximus
		you're dying because you love rome,
		as i do.

					valerius
		i've never been to rome.

					maximus
		neither have i.  rome for us lives
		here...
			(he touches his
			heart)
		... it's a thing inside us that came
		from our ancestors and that we give
		to our children.

					valerius
		it must be glorious, rome.  i've
		only seen pictures.  is it a
		glorious place?

a beat.

					maximus
		yes, it's a glorious place.

					valerius
		it must be.

he smiles.  and he is dead.

maximus sits for a moment.  he gently closes valerius'
eyes.  and maximus finds that he is weeping.

he is not ashamed of the tears.
