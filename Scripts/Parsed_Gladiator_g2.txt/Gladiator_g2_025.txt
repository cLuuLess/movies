int.  marcus' tent - night

maximus and quintus stride into the tent -- maximus slams
to a halt.  stunned.

commodus stands before him.  lucilla stands in a corner of
the tent, head down.

and marcus aurelius dead, lying on his bed.

maximus stares at marcus.

					commodus
		lament with me, brother, our great
		father is dead.  i want --

maximus, not even hearing, steps past him to marcus.

he stands for a moment and then slowly kneels before
marcus and gently kisses the old man's forehead.  a ritual
farewell.

a moment of silent mourning and then maximus stands.  he
turns very, very slowly to commodus.

					commodus
		general, the gods' have taken the
		great man and left me alone.  my
		first desire as emperor is that you
		take my hand in friendship.  i need
		you at my side, maximus, at this
		moment above all others.  stand with
		me.

maximus glares at him:

					maximus
		how did he die?

commodus does not respond.

					maximus
		how did he die?

					commodus
		the surgeons say it was his breath
		that gave out.

maximus glances to lucilla, she avoids his eyes.

					commodus
		take my hand, maximus.  i only offer
		it once.

a beat.

maximus turns back to marcus.

					maximus
		how will the world speak your name
		now, old man?

without a glance to commodus, he stalks out.

a silent beat.  then commodus nods to quintus.  quintus
goes.

lucilla looks at commodus for a long moment, her face an
enigmatic tornado of complex emotions.

then:

					lucilla
		hail, caesar.
