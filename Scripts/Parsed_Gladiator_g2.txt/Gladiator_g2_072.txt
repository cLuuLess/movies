int.  proximo's compound - cell - night

maximus silently awaits commodus' assassins with juba.
they hear footsteps outside the cell.  maximus stands,
preparing for death.

					juba
			(also standing)
		i will fight with you.

					maximus
		this isn't your battle.

					juba
		better to die for a friend than to
		die for gold.

the door swings open and they are surprised to see proximo
sweeping in with a cloaked woman.  the woman gives proximo
a bag of money.

					proximo
		enjoy yourself, madame...
			(he glances to
			maximus)
		general, perform well and there will
		be riches for you.

he beckons to juba, they go, shutting the door behind
them.  the woman pulls off her cloak, it is lucilla.

maximus glares at her, his muscles tensing.

					lucilla
		rich matrons pay well to be
		pleasured by the bravest champions.

maximus backs up, fighting the urge to strangle her on the
spot.  he finally bumps into a wall of the cell.

					maximus
		i knew your brother would send
		assassins.  i didn't think he would
		send his best.

					lucilla
		maximus, listen to me --

					maximus
		my family were crucified and burnt
		while they were still alive.

					lucilla
		i knew nothing of that.

					maximus
			(low)
		don't lie to me.

					lucilla
		i wept for them.

					maximus
		don't.

a long, tense moment.

she does not look at him.

					lucilla
		do you know what it is to be the
		daughter of the emperor?  i learned
		on the night my father had my
		husband killed.  i loved my husband
		very much.  very... simply.  he was
		a man who believed in the republic.
		he was a man who thought marcus
		should be tending to rome and not
		conquering the world.  one night my
		father had him strangled for
		conspiring with the senate.  my
		father never spoke of it.  i never
		spoke of it.  that is what it is to
		be the daughter of rome.

she finally looks up at maximus.

					lucilla
		my son will live.  he will survive
		this cursed bloodline.  rome will
		die and the jackals will pick her
		clean -- but my son will survive.
		empires come and go.  cities crumble
		to dust.  only family matters.

a beat.  despite himself, maximus is moved.

					maximus
		my son was innocent.

					lucilla
		so is mine.

a beat.

					maximus
		i want your brother dead.

					lucilla
		so do i.

a beat.  maximus is surprised at her direct answer.

					lucilla
		my son will never be safe while he
		lives.

a beat.

					maximus
		how do you plan it?

					lucilla
		the senate is with us, and the city
		guard.  we have growing power in the
		streets.  but we need a leader.
		someone the people can --

					maximus
		so the crown passes to your son.

					lucilla
		no.  so that my son will be safe.
		so that we may leave this charnel
		house forever and never look back.
		look into my eyes, maximus, and
		believe what i say to you...

she rivets him intensely with her eyes.

					lucilla
		by all the gods, and in the name of
		my father who loved you, and in the
		name of the husband i loved... i
		swear to stand by your side in this
		now and always.

a beat.

					maximus
		what is your son's name?

					lucilla
		lucius verus.  like his father.

					maximus
		i weep for him.

a long beat.  maximus' cold eyes give away nothing.

lucilla turns and starts to go.  she stops, not looking
back.

					lucilla
		commodus plans to kill you in your
		next match in the arena.  he's
		planning something.  i will pray for
		you.  as i have always done.

she then pulls something from her robes and sets it down,
a little bundle wrapped in cloth.  she sweeps out.  the
sound of the door being bolted shut on the other side.

maximus stands for a moment and then goes to what she has
left.  he opens the cloth.  inside are his six "ancestor"
figures.

he picks up one of the figures.  he looks at it deeply,
gently feeling along the contours with a finger.
