int. hospital room - night

cut to a shot of a hospital room. a very pale, sick-looking
rose lies in a hospital bed. the nurse, mother, daddy, buddy,
doll and waski enter, all of them looking very grave.

another angle, close on rose as she weakly turns her head on
the pillow. her eyes well with tears as she recognizes the
children.

			rose
		(a feeble whisper)
	pray for me...

another angle, on the nurse as she speaks in a whisper we
don't hear to mother and daddy, obviously telling them they'd
better go. daddy beckons to the children and they start to
leave, all looking depressed.
