ext. hillyer home - patio - day

cut to a shot of rose on the stone patio of the hillyer
house, an attractive area with outdoor furniture and
crabapple tree limbs overhead. rose is busy sweeping. the
camera pans to follow her and we pick up mrs. hillyer,
mother. it is a nice day and she is studying out on the
patio, books and notebooks piled around. rose glances down
curiously at her.

			rose 
	what are you studying now, mrs.
	hillyer?

			mother 
	more history, rose.

			rose 
	are you going to get your degree
	soon?

			mother 
	well, i am working on my thesis.

			rose 
		(as she busily sweeps)
	it must be wonderful to be so
	smart. i don't see how you do it,
	reading all those books, learning
	all that stuff.

			mother 
		(looks up, and gently)
	rose, you work too hard. why don't
	you go sit down somewhere and drink
	a co-cola?

			rose 
		(smiles, trusts and knows
		 mother now, not at all
		 afraid of her)
	you're so sweet.

rose again busily sweeps.

			mother 
	really, why don't you go sit down
	somewhere?

			rose 
	i like to work. i don't mind work.
	it's the least i can do after all
	you and mr. hillyer have done for
	me. 
		(stares worshipfully at
		 mother)
	you're so sweet. there never was
	nobody like you.

			mother 
		(gently)
	well, you run on now.

			rose 
	yes, ma'am.

exit rose. mother adjusts her notebook and turns the page of
a history book as she resumes her studies. we hear the sound
of an approaching car and she glances up.
