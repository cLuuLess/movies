int./ext. model a - day

cut to a shot of daddy, rose and buddy in the car. buddy is
in the middle. daddy is staring expressionlessly straight
ahead. his tone is sternly neutral as he speaks.

			daddy
	you were up late last night,
	brother.

			buddy
	well, a little.

			daddy
	reading dirty comic bocks.
		(glances shrewdly at him)
	and you admitted it?

			buddy
		(a trifle uncomfortable)
	well, yeah.

both rose and buddy begin to look increasingly tense.
hawkshaw the detective is on the scent. daddy stares ahead.

			daddy 
	you were up late last night, too,
	rose.

			rose 
		(meekly)
	yes, sir. i had to go to the
	bathroom.

a long pause, as daddy stares ahead. his expression is
inscrutable.

			daddy 
		(finally, "casually")
	sometimes i think i was born to be
	a detective. i get a feeling about
	things. i'm not always right, but
	often i am.
