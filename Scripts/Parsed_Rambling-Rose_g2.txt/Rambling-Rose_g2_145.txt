int. hillyer home - master bedroom/study - night

cut to a "keyhole shot" of daddy and mother in the bedroom.
mother sits in her study chair, a handkerchief to her eyes.
daddy sits in a chair nearby. he looks depressed.

			daddy 
	i'm sorry, darlin', i hate it as
	much as you do.

			mother
		(wanly)
	well, she does seem to cause a lot
	of trouble, i admit. but she
	doesn't mean any harm and it'll
	break the children's hearts, they
	all love her.

			daddy 
	it's because of the children she's
	got to go. i don't want to be
	holier-than-thou, but the girl
	doesn't have the same outlook we
	do. morals don't mean a thing to
	her, not a thing, and we can't have
	a girl like that in this house.

			mother 
	who is to say our morals are better
	than hers?
		(frowns, sighs)
	but maybe you're right. she
	could... influence dolly...

			daddy 
	that is exactly what i'm afraid of. 
		(pauses, and firmly)
	the girl has got to go, darlin'.

			mother 
	but morals come from the heart, not
	from rigid rules and empty laws.
	and in her heart rose has never
	hurt anyone and she never would.
	therefore, she's not immoral. not
	really.

			daddy 
	now look, darlin', this is no time
	to go off into the fourth
	dimension.

			mother 
	but what i said is the simple
	truth. and now i see something
	else, i see more deeply into it...

mother has a slightly "other-worldly" look on her face. daddy
glances at the door of the bedroom, he suspects something.

			daddy 
	just a moment, darlin'.
