int. dr. martinson's some office - night

cut to a shot of dr. martinson's private office in his home,
quite a bit more luxurious than his office at the hospital. a
sober-looking mother and daddy sit talking to him. he almost
seems to relish the situation.

			dr. martinson 
	i'm not surprised you thought she
	was pregnant. an ovarian cyst can
	look very much like pregnancy. but
	it was pure wishful thinking on her
	part. the girl can never have
	children, she had gonorrhea at
	fifteen and it was untreated.

			mother 
		(shocked, rather feebly)
	gonorrhea?

			dr. martinson 
	don't worry, madam, she can't
	infect your dear little kiddies.
	she long ago fully recovered, but
	the disease did irreparable damage.
	the girl is permanently barren.

			mother 
	well, that's pathetic. poor rose,
	what a life she has had.

			dr. martinson 
	we make our own lives, madam. as
	for malignancy, i don't think so,
	it's very unlikely. i probably
	shouldn't have even mentioned that
	possibility to her.

			mother 
		(rather coldly, seems
		 disenchanted with him)
	no, you shouldn't have, it was
	needlessly cruel. she thinks she
	has cancer and is going to die.

			dr. martinson
	she's an adult, mrs. hillyer, i was
	merely giving her the facts.

			daddy 
	well, it's a disaster. i don't know
	what to say, doctor, i am floored.
	how dangerous is the operation?

			dr. martinson 
	any major operation is dangerous.
	however, as we know from her
	previous illness, she's a very
	strong girl.

			daddy 
	well, if it isn't malignant and she
	can get through the operation all
	right, it might be better than her
	really being pregnant. she doesn't
	even know who the father might have
	been.

			dr. martinson 
	oh, it's definitely better, beyond
	question. a fatherless child, an
	ignorant girl with no job, no
	money, no home. it's fortunate, a
	blessing really, and a stroke of
	good luck for another reason i want
	to mention to you.

			mother 
		(totally disenchanted with
		 the doctor)
	this conversation is making me a
	little sick.

			daddy 
	honey, that's no way to talk to the
	doctor, he's merely doing his job,
	dear.

oddly enough, in the stress of the situation, daddy now seems
almost friendly to dr. martinson, whom previously he
considered a polecat.
