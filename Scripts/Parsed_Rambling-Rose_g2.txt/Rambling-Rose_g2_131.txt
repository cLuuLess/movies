int. dentist's waiting room - day

cut to a shot of mother and buddy in the waiting room. enter
dr. winton with a little frown.

			dr. winton 
	well, she finally let me look in
	her mouth. is it true she's never
	been to a dentist?

			mother 
	she was raised on a poor dirt farm.
	i'm sure she's never seen a dentist
	or hardly even a doctor.

			dr. winton 
	well, she has one mouth in ten
	thousand, i don't see teeth like
	that once in ten years. her trouble
	is an impacted wisdom tooth, but
	there isn't a cavity in her head,
	not a single one. she has perfect
	teeth.

			mother 
	but the wisdom tooth will have to
	be pulled?

			dr. winton 
	yes, and it's very bad. it probably
	should be done at the hospital
	under general anesthesia.

			mother 
	that would scare her to death.
	she's terrified of hospitals. to
	her, a hospital is where you go to
	die.

			dr. winton 
	i think you're right, it would be
	harder on her. but you'd better
	call mr. hillyer, she's going to
	need help to get home.
