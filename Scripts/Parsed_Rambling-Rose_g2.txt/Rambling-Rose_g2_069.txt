int. hillyer home - front porch - night

a shot of daddy and rose on the front porch of the house. the
scene is murky, dark, gloomy night and the weather is bad.
daddy has his arm rigidly thrust outward as he points down
the driveway. a weeping, slumped rose sadly walks down the
steps carrying her cardboard suitcase. fantasy.

			daddy 
	out! out, you viper in the grass!
	out! never darken our doorstep, you
	immoral, terrible girl!
