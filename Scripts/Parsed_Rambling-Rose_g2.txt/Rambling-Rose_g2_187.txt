ext. hillyer home - driveway and patio - day

a shot of the model a coming up the driveway of the hillyer
house. it is late afternoon.

cut to a shot of daddy getting out of the car. he has a
triumphant little smile on his face.

a shot of daddy as he walks onto the patio, a rolled-up copy
of the glenville tribune in his hand and his straw hat on the
back of his head. he definitely has a triumphant expression.
buddy on the patio notices it.
