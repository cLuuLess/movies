int. delta airplane

another angle, on the pretty young stewardess as she brings
two more drinks. dave stares sourly at her, wholly unmoved by
her charm.

			dave wilkie 
	took your time gettin' here.

			willcox hillyer 
	she has other things to do, dave.

willcox smiles apologetically at girl.

			dave wilkie 
	supposed to get two drinks in the
	first place. this friggin' airline
	can't do nothin' right.

the stewardess purses her lips at dave, who is bowed over his
drink busy opening it. hillyer lifts an eyebrow at the girl
as if to say, "don't blame me because of this damned idiot,"
and she half smiles at him.

			willcox hillyer 
		(obviously getting him off
		 subject)
	tell me about that job in
	alexandria, dave, the big motel
	you're building.

			dave wilkie 
		(with pedantic exactitude,
		 the man is a complete
		 pain in the ass)
	near alexandria. it isn't in
	alexandria, it is outside it.

			willcox hillyer
	i see. outside it.

			dave wilkie
	that's correct -- outside it, not
	in it. as for the job, well, the
	jewboy suppliers give me a lot of
	grief and we use a pile of niggers
	to haul and tote and they ain't
	worth a sorry-ass damn. 
		(takes big swallow of
		 drink)
	but i can build anything, buddy.
	give me the plans and i can build a
	goddamn staircase to the moon. it's
	a fact, i can build anything... 
		(pauses, then bitterly)
	... but she never believed that.
	oh, hell, no, she never believed in
	me.

this is another pointed bitter reference to the unknown
"she." once again, willcox hillyer is deliberately
unresponsive.

			willcox hillyer
	um-m, well...

			dave wilkie 
		(broodingly)
	doubted my ability all along, the
	little bitch. i never remarried,
	buddy, you know that, don't you?

			willcox hillyer 
	well, no, i didn't actually.

			dave wilkie 
	she's te reason -- cured me of
	women once and for all. oh, i got
	rid of her, buddy, i didn't waste
	no time kickin' that bitch out.
	hell, she was screwin' everybody in
	savannah. i caught her in a motel
	with this long tall son of a bitch
	and boy did i beat the everlastin'
	piss out of him!

dave wilkie's eyes narrow with vindictive anger as he says it
and one can well believe the streak of raw violence in the
man. it is frightening even now; he is a clown, but he is a
dangerous clown. as his long, bitter, impassioned tirade
continues, willcox hillyer becomes increasingly tense and
pale -- it is obvious he detests what the man is saying and
he is struggling to control himself.

dave's tone and voice are laconically southern, but the
hatred and misery in his eyes are raw.

			dave wilkie (cont'd)
	she didn't marry him, though, later
	she married another guy and went to
	winston-salem. it didn't last
	that girl couldn't have no lastin'
	marriage, she left him and married
	another dumb sucker and went out
	west. little bitch left him, too,
	and you know what she's married to
	right now?
		(puts a big finger on
		 hillyer's chest)
	a kike. that's right, some kind of
	kike horse doctor named schapiro
	out in seattle, who's got the nerve
	to have the same first name i got.
	wouldn't you know it, rose would
	wind up married to a goddamn kike?
	she was always out of her friggin'
	head and i'll tell you why.
		(his eyes narrow and again
		 he puts a finger on
		 hillyer's chest)
	buddy, she was sick in her mind and
	between her legs, too. she was
	a nymphomaniac.

			willcox hillyer
		(he has had enough; with a
		 pale trembling anger and
		 in even tone)
	dave, you are as full of shit as a
	christmas turkey and you know it.
	now if you want to start a fight on
	this plane and get yourself in
	jail, go right ahead. but i am
	telling you, you are full of shit
	right up to your eyeballs.

			dave wilkie 
		(with surprising mildness;
		 a little smile almost as
		 if he is pleased)
	i don't want to start no fight with
	you, buddy. why do you say i'm full
	of shit?

			willcox hillyer 
	dave schapiro is no horse doctor
	and rose has been a good wife to
	him for a long time. to call her a
	nymphomaniac is the most stupid
	thing i ever heard in my life.

			dave wilkie 
		(again surprisingly mild)
	you loved her, didn't you. well, so
	did i. 
		(a little shrug)
	you'll have to admit she had four
	husbands.

			willcox hillyer 
	yeah, it took her a while to grow
	up and find mr. right, but she did
	it. she found him.

			dave wilkie 
		(another little smile)
	she used to call me mr. right.
	remember that, buddy?

			willcox hillyer 
		(he is pale with anger)
	yeah, i remember it.

willcox picks up galley sheets, half turns away.

			dave wilkie 
	well, i tell you, i don't know what
	the world's come to these days.
	things used to be better. we didn't
	have any money, but things were
	better. 
		(grimaces in anger)
	goddamn niggers and kikes burning
	the flag, rioting, raising hell --
	they ought to shoot their asses
	off. i tell you, buddy, where this
	country made its mistake was
	allowing people without property to
	vote.

during this speech, willcox hillyer grits his teeth but says
nothing. he keeps his eyes down on the galley sheets. as dave
shakes his head in sorrow at the state of the nation ..
