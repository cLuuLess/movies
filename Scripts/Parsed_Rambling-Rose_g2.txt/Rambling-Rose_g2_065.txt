int. hillyer home - rose's bedroom - night

cut to a shot of rose as she enters her small bedroom.
feebly, as if totally exhausted, she shuts the door behind
her then leans against a bureau and states into its mirror.
the horror of her own criminality has overwhelmed her. with
trembling hands, she takes a cigarette from her half empty
pack and finds a wooden kitchen match on the bureau.
her hands tremble visibly as she strikes the match. she has
not turned on the light in her room and her considerable
charms are very apparent in the orange glow of the match.
burning match in her fingers, she stares at her own
reflection in the bureau mirror, transfixed by a horrible
realization.
