int. hillyer home dining room - night

cut to a pov shot of daddy and rose, as seen by children. the
table now is cleared and rose stands half behind daddy,
staring down at him with a stricken expression.

			daddy 
		(half to himself)
	ehh, lord, should have bought that
	stock when we had some money. a
	thousand millionaires.

rose suddenly makes up her mind, places her hand on his
shoulder, turns sideways, sits down on his lap, puts an arm
around his neck.

			rose 
	oh, oh! oh, mr. hillyer, i love
	you, i love you so much! i've
	tried, but i can't help it! please
	kiss me -- will you kiss me?

for a long time daddy stares groggily at her with a half
frown as if he can't believe it. in order to stare at her, he
must tilt his head back and, handsome man though he is, he
looks a bit like a startled rooster. her breasts are pressed
against him, and her eager -pink lips are waiting for a kiss.

			daddy 
		(finally clears his
		 throat)
	ahh-hem! now, rose, get off my lap.
	what are you doing, girl? are you
	crazy?

			rose
	yes, crazy about you! kiss me, mr.
	hillyer!

			daddy 
	why, i'm not going to kiss you, you
	crazy girl. now i'm telling you
	again, get off my lap. come on,
	rose, get up. now you get up, i
	say, and stop this!

			rose 
	no, no! you don't understand, i
	love you! it's real love and i
	can't help it! please kiss me, mr.
	hillyer, i love you, i love you so
	much...

rose breaks down and begins crying, her head on his shoulder.
she has her arms wound tight around him and daddy seems at a
loss what to do.

			daddy
		(in a shaken voice)
	all right, all right. now calm
	down, rose, the children will hear
	you. calm down, let's talk... about
	this thing, let's discuss it.

			rose
		(sobbing)
	don't make me... me... me... get
	up!

			daddy 
	calm down, rose, let's calm down
	and discuss it ...
