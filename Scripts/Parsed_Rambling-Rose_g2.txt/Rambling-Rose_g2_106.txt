cut to a shot of daddy in pajamas peering out of the bedroom
window.

			daddy 
	well, she's back.

			mother (o.s.)
	what time is it?

			daddy 
	quarter of twelve.

			mother (o.s.)
	is she all right?

			daddy 
	i don't see any bruises or broken
	bones.

cut to a shot of mother in bed in the four poster.

			mother 
	bruises and broken bones, what kind
	of thing is that to say?

daddy walks into the shot, sits on the edge of the bed.

			mother (cont'd)
	why shouldn't she go out and have
	boyfriends?

			daddy 
	no reason at all, darlin'.

			mother 
	well, i wish you'd stop criticizing
	and picking on her.

			daddy 
	forgive my crudity, darlin'. all
	i'm saying is that a girl who would
	wear clothes like that is going to
	get in trouble sooner or later.

			mother 
		(doubtfully)
	well, time will tell, won't it?

			daddy 
	yes, darlin', time will tell.
