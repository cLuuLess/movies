int. dr. martinson's home office - night

cut to a close shot of dr. martinson. an expression of
distaste is on his face. the camera pulls back as he talks to
mother and daddy.

			dr. martinson 
	i'm sorry the truth nauseates you,
	mrs. hillyer, because before you
	leave there's a bit more of it i'd
	like to put to you. this operation
	provides a therapeutic opportunity
	that i feel is quite important in
	regard to this particular girl, who
	suffers not only from an ovarian
	cyst but from a certain
	psychoneurotic condition as well.

			mother 
	what do you mean, what kind of
	gobbledygook talk is that?

			daddy 
	go ahead, doctor, i think i am
	following you.

			dr. martinson 
		(gives mother an aloof
		 glance, then to daddy)
	first, about the girl's history.
	evidently she's been very
	promiscuous since early childhood,
	she has no control over her sexual
	impulses. furthermore, she is
	permanently barren, she can't have
	children.

			daddy 
	go on, doctor.

			mother
		(quietly)
	yes, go on.

			dr. martinson 
	i am thinking particularly of the
	other ovary. as a rule i don't
	believe in removing it. the woman's
	hormonal system is profoundly
	disturbed, she is subject to
	possibly serious depression, she
	loses many of her secondary sexual
	characteristics for example, her
	breasts might shrink and become
	flabby, facial hair might appear
	along with a coarsening of the
	features, and of course her sexual
	drive is greatly diminished,
	especially in a girl or young
	woman. for these reasons i am
	opposed to removing the other
	ovary, as a rule. do you follow me?

			daddy 
	i am ahead of you.

			dr. martinson 
	then... may i speak quite frankly
	with you, mr. hillyer?

			daddy 
	please do.

			dr. martinson 
	i have of course observed the girl
	in treating her.

			daddy 
	of course.

			dr. martinson 
	i think we both know her.

			daddy 
	yes, we know her.

			mother 
	what are you talking about? i don't
	understand all this mumbo jumbo and
	the funny looks on your faces.

			dr. martinson 
	mrs. hillyer, this girl is sick in
	more ways than one. she is an
	extreme psychoneurotic with
	uncontrollable sexual impulses. it
	would be a mercy to spare her the
	suffering she causes herself and
	others. therefore i recommend as a
	therapeutic measure the removal of
	her second ovary. it is ethically
	and medically the only proper
	decision in this case and i suspect
	your husband agrees with me.

			daddy 
	reluctantly, i do. it would be a
	blessing to her and everyone else.
	the girl is oversexed and i say --
	spay her!

			mother 
		(slowly rises to her feet
		 and in a trembling voice)
	over... my... dead... body!

a long, frozen pause as both daddy and dr. martinson stare at
mother in surprise. she stares at the doctor with fire in her
eyes. he seems already to shrink a little. finally she speaks
with a calm fury.

			mother (cont'd)
	are you human beings or are you
	some kind of male monsters? is
	there no limit to which you won't
	go to keep your illusions about
	yourselves?

			dr. martinson 
		(shrinking a little)
	illusions, madam?

			mother 
	you'd go so far as to mutilate a
	helpless girl who has no means to
	defend herself, you'd go that far?
	don't you think i know what you've
	just said and don't you think i
	understand the dreadful and
	revolting crime you've just
	conspired to commit?

dr. martinson stares at her in fear and shock, intimidated by
the calm fury and ice-cold moral indignation.

he opens his mouth as if to speak, but no sound comes out.
mother turns to daddy.

			mother (cont'd)
	i thought i knew you. i thought i
	knew you better, i thought in your
	heart you were a good and kind man.
	well, i can't believe what i've
	just heard in this room. a
	defenseless girl depending on you
	for protection, and you propose to
	mutilate and destroy her. how could
	you listen even for a moment to
	that sadistic man?

			daddy
		(slightly shattered)
	well, now, darlin'... give me a
	chance to defend myself.

			mother 
	i can't believe you really meant
	it, if i did i'd want to die. you
	aren't a male monster, that man is
	but you aren't. look me in the eye
	and tell me, do you really want to
	take rose's womanhood away from her
	when it's all she has got?

			daddy 
	well, i... i hadn't thought about
	it that much. i was thinking...
	well, it's an idea, the girl is
	oversexed, and...

			mother 
	rose isn't oversexed, that's
	ridiculous. if you're going to talk
	nonsense, i don't want to talk to
	you at all. rose is exactly the
	same as the rest of us, except more
	so.

			daddy 
	well, i know, more so. that's why i
	was thinking... maybe she'd be
	better off.

			mother
		(with a quiet fury)
	better off? how could she ever find
	love and happiness, if you did what
	you're talking about? are you
	insane?

			dr. martinson 
		(rather feebly)
	now, may i say, i am against that
	particular procedure, as a general
	rule. but in a case of near
	nymphomania, it doesn't seem
	monstrous to me at all, but
	medically advisable.

both mother and daddy totally ignore him. mother's eyes are
fixed on daddy and he is struggling with himself, staring
down at the floor.

			daddy 
	well, now, i admit... in rose's
	case, it would be cruel. if rose
	wasn't attractive and pretty...
	well, it would probably be bad for
	almost any young woman. i don't
	know exactly what i was thinking
	about, the doctor said it and it
	sounded reasonable.

daddy finally looks up at mother and admits his error like a
man.

			daddy (cont'd)
	but you're right, darlin', you're
	absolutely dead right, it would be
	an awful and horrible thing to do.
	i'm sorry, honey, forgive me, i
	didn't mean it.

mother turns from daddy and walks up to the desk and stares
down at dr. martinson as if he is a loathesome bug upon which
she intends to step.

			mother 
	i will not cry like a woman. if i'm
	upset it's because of what my
	husband said, not because of you.
	you can't make me cry like a woman,
	a woman has got just as much
	intelligence and self-control as a
	man. and you get this in your head.
	if you hurt that girl, i'll hire
	lawyers and sue you for malpractice
	for every penny you have got, i'll
	do my level best to ruin you. do
	you understand me?

			dr. martinson
		(a sickly smile, he is
		 licked totally)
	yes, i understand you, but you have
	misunderstood me completely.

			mother 
		(icy cold)
	i understand you perfectly. you
	leave that girl alone, you wretched
	man, or you will be sorry.

			dr. martinson 
		(a foolish smile, as if
		 mother has paid him some
		 kind of compliment)
	actually of course i won't operate,
	i don't do major surgery. dr. hardy
	will operate and of course he'll be
	guided by your wishes in this
	respect.

			mother 
	let him be guided not by my wishes
	and not by rose's wishes, although
	i am sure they are identical. let
	him be guided by the wishes of the
	creative power of life itself,
	because that is what has spoken
	through me tonight.
