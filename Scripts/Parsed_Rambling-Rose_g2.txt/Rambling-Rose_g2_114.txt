ext. hillyer house - front porch

cut to a shot of a worried-looking mother on the front porch
of the house. buddy and a meek-looking rose are in the
background in the doorway. a weary, out-of-breath daddy comes
into the shot and walks up the steps, straw hat in hand.

			daddy 
	i couldn't catch him. he ran like a
	deer.

daddy fixes a stern glance on rose. as he does so, mother and
buddy also turn and look at her. rose smiles wanly.

			rose 
	i don't know him.
