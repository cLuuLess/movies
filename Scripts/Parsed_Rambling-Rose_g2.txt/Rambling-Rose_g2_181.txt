int. hillyer home - upstairs hall - day

cut to a shot of daddy in the upstairs hall. he is fully
dressed and is banging angrily on rose's door.

			daddy
	rose! rose! open this goddamn door!
	open it or i'll break it down!

another angle on buddy as he hurries down the hall up to
daddy, in khaki pants and pulling a shirt over his head.

			daddy (cont'd)
	open that door, damn you!

			buddy
	daddy, what's the matter?

			daddy 
		(glances around at him)
	she's got somebody in there,
	brother! his shoes are on the back
	porch -- there they were, naked and
	smiling at me! 
		(bangs on door)
	rose, open this door immediately!

another angle on daddy as he bangs on the door. we see a
frightened doll in her nightgown in the b.g. down the hall, a
hand to her mouth. daddy commences kicking at the door.

another angle, close on daddy.

			daddy (cont'd)
	open up, rose! procrastination
	won't help you!

finally, the click of a bolt and slowly the door opens. we
see a wide-eyed, terrified rose. she has a sheet around her
and evidently nothing more.

			daddy (cont'd)
		(he pushes past her)
	all right, where is he? where's the
	culprit?
