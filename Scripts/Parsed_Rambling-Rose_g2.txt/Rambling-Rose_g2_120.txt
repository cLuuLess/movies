int. hillyer home - dining room - night

a shot of the family at dinner at night. daddy, mother, rose,
buddy, doll and waski. the shot favors mother.

			mother 
	that sulky boy was here again this
	afternoon. i was almost scared, he
	wouldn't go away.

			daddy 
		(throws his napkin on
		 table)
	rose, my patience is wearing thin.
	first a scruffy man who runs like a
	deer and now a sulky boy who wont
	go away. this is getting to be a
	regular monkey and dog show.

			rose 
	i swear to god i don't know who in
	the world he is. really, i don't, i
	don't know no boy like that, i
	don't.

slowly, his face grim, daddy returns his napkin to his lap
and resumes eating. the children are very silent and look a
trifle scared.

			mother 
		(finally, in a small
		 voice)
	well, it isn't rose's fault boys
	and men like her. you cant blame
	her for that, hon.

			daddy 
	rose, i realize you don't know this
	boy, but if you know anybody who
	does know him, if you have even a
	faint clue as to who he might be,
	then convey to him that he had
	better stay away from my house and
	stop scaring my wife... and i don't
	mean maybe.
