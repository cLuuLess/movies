int. hillyer some - buddy's bedroom - night

cut to a shot of buddy in his room at night. he is dressed
and at a study table listening with cheap earphones to a
homemade crystal radio set. enter a rather somber-faced doll
in her nightgown.

			buddy 
		(listening)
	chattanooga. i had st. louis,
	missouri.

			doll 
	buddy, i'm worried about rose.

			buddy 
	so am i.

			doll 
	she hasn't got any sense. in some
	ways, she's awful dumb.

			buddy 
		(takes off earphones,
		 gives it a moment of
		 grave consideration, then
		 his opinion)
	it isn't that she hasn't got any
	sense, doll. her basic intelligence
	is probably above average, maybe
	quite a bit above average.

			doll 
	then why does she act so dumb?

			buddy 
	dumbness doesn't concern her, doll.
	and neither does smartness. you see
	--

buddy is interrupted by the sound of the distant angry shout
of a man's voice, evidently from somewhere outside in the
woods because buddy and doll turn at once toward the window.
in shock they listen.

			first man's voice 
	you son of a bitch, what are you
	doing here?!

			second man's voice 
	i'd like to ask you the same
	question, you bastard!

			first man's voice 
	i told you to stay away from her,
	goddamn you!

			second man's voice 
	you got no right to tell me to stay
	away from her, i knew her before
	you did!

			buddy 
	oh, boy. oh, boy, oh boy. daddy
	isn't going to like this.

			first man's voice 
	she told you to leave her alone,
	didn't she?

			second man's voice 
	like hell she did! you're the one
	she wants to get shed of!

			buddy 
	come on!

he and doll hurry from the room.
