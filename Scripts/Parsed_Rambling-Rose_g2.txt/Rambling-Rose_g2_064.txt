int. hillyer some - upstairs hall and downstairs hall

cut to a shot of daddy walking down the downstairs hall in
his bathrobe. the shot is down the staircase and rose in the
upstairs hall tiptoes into the picture. a floorboard creaks
and he looks up and sees her.

			daddy 
	rose, what are you doing up?

			rose 
	nothin', just goin' to the
	bathroom.

			daddy 
	is anything wrong?

			rose 
	no, sir.

			daddy 
	well, good night.

another angle on rose in the upstairs hall. fortunately for
her the light is dim. her knees are shaking beneath the
nightgown, she looks as if she might faint.

			rose 
	good night.

the camera follows her as she goes on shaky legs down the
hall.
