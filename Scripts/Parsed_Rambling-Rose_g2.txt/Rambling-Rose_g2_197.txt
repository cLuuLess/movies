int. hillyer home - kitchen - day

a shot of daddy sitting with mother at the kitchen table.

bright cheerful sunshine comes in the window that opens on
the patio. rose comes into the shot carrying a coffee pot, a
sunny smile on her face.

			daddy 
	you're looking very chipper this
	morning, rose. sow do you feel?

			rose 
	perfect, wonderful, good as i ever
	felt! except for a big old scar on
	my stummick, i wouldn't even know i
	been in the hospital.

			daddy 
		(with mild irony, as she
		 pours him coffee)
	well, we know you were there. the
	bill that hospital sent was
	absolutely horrendous.

			rose 
		(her smile fades a trifle)
	well, i'll pay you that back
	sometime, mr. hillyer.

			mother 
	don't worry about it, honey.

daddy pauses, seems to be struggling with himself, he is
frowning.

			daddy 
	rose... i hate to be mean, but... 
		(another pause, then a
		 little shrug)
	oh, nevermind, forget it.

			rose 
		(in a little sad voice)
	what was it, mr. hillyer?

			daddy 
		(rises)
	nothing, rose.

daddy stops beside her, puts an arm around her shoulders and
with weary irony.

			daddy (cont'd)
	we all love you, darlin'.

daddy wearily picks up his straw hat from the kitchen counter
and walks out of the kitchen on the patio, as the camera
stays on rose and mother.

			mother 
	don't worry, honey, you'll find
	something.

			rose 
	i was offered that job as a
	waitress.

			mother 
	forget about it, i don't want you
	working in one of those honky
	tonks.
