ext. hillyer home - patio - day

cut to a shot of buddy on the patio. he has eight or nine
gourds on an outdoor table and is cutting round holes in them
and emptying out the seed. he glances up as rose walks up to
him, pocketbook in hand. she seems a little sad. but she
smiles at him.

			rose 
	hi, buddy. 
		(puts an arm around his
		 shoulders)
	how's my sweetheart who never told
	on me when i was bad?

			buddy 
	okay.

			rose 
		(picks up a hollowed out
		 gourd)
	makin' homes for purple martins,
	huh? we had 'em on the farm.
	they're the prettiest things.
	that's what i wish i was, a bird.
	just fly around catch bugs and have
	a lot of fun.

			buddy 
	what are you going to do, rose?

			rose 
	take a little walk with me, huh?
