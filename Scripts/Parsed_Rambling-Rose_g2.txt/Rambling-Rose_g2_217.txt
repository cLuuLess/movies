ext. hillyer home - patio - day

cut to a shot of daddy putting out seed for birds on a table
on the patio. daddy now is a very old man, but his
personality and style are the same as ever. he looks up with
a stern frown as willcox hillyer comes out on the patio.

			daddy 
	well, you rascal, where'd you come
	from?

			willcox hillyer 
	hello, daddy. how are you?

			daddy 
	about as good as can be expected
	with one foot in the grave. good to
	see you, son. 
		(they shake hands)
	did you bring any of that yankee
	whisky with you?

			willcox hillyer 
	it isn't yankee whisky, daddy, it's
	scotch.

			daddy 
	it's yankee whisky to me.

daddy takes him by the arm, leads him back into the kitchen.

			daddy (cont'd)
	how do you stand it up there, boy,
	in all that ice and snow? what are
	you, a polar bear?
