int. hillyer home - buddy's bedroom - night

cut to a shot of rose and buddy in the bed. the extremity of
her crime has dawned on rose and she is sitting up in the bed
with a look of horror on her face. buddy is staring worriedly
at her.

			buddy 
	rose, are you all right? are you
	sick or something?

			rose 
		(staring off in space,
		 lost in horror)
	no. no, i'm all right. 
		(turns, stares at him,
		 puts a hand in woe on her
		 forehead)
	oh, god, what have i done? i have
	robbed a cradle and fallen into
	hell!
		(fumbles desperately on
		 bed for cigarettes)
	i must be crazy, a child like you.
	oh, god, oh, lord. this is awful,
	this is terrible, i gotta get outta
	here!

another angle, on rose and buddy as rose in a panic gets out
of the bed, pulls down her thin nightgown and tiptoes toward
the door. she stops and looks back as a chilling thought
occurs to her.

			rose 
	buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody,
	would you?

			buddy 
		(a trifle too piously)
	don't worry, rose, i won't tell a
	soul.

			rose 
	i sure hope you don't.
		(still in a panic)
	i gotta get outta here, good night.

			buddy 
		(sweetly)
	good night, rose.
