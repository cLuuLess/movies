int./ext. model a - day

cut to a shot of daddy, rose and buddy in the car. daddy
turns and stares sternly at buddy.

			daddy 
	son, was rose in your room last
	night?

			buddy 
		(scared, but a good liar)
	no. why should rose be in my room?

daddy sternly scans them both. they stare back "innocently"
at him. finally he seems to accept it.

			daddy 
	i can't imagine why. it was just a
	thought.

daddy shifts gears and faces front. buddy glances upward in
relief, as if to say, "wow, that was close."

			daddy (cont'd)
	where do you want me to let you
	out, rose?

			rose 
	oh, anywhere downtown.

			daddy 
	you don't know where you're going?

			rose 
	oh, i'll just mosey around here and
	there.
