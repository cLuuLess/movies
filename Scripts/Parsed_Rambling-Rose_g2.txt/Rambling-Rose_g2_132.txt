ext. country road - day

a shot of daddy behind the wheel of the model-a. rose lies
pale and exhausted on mother's shoulder on the front seat. a
trace of bloody gauze can be seen in her mouth and her eyes
are closed. buddy is on the back seat.

			rose
		(a whisper, muffled by the
		 bloody gauze)
	never again, never again...

			mother
		(with pity, gently)
	i know it was bad, honey. i'm
	sorry...

			rose 
	no more dentists, no more
	dentists...

			mother 
	it'll get better now.
