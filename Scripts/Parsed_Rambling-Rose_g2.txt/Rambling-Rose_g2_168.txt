ext. hillyer driveway - day

cut to a shot of the model a driving up in the driveway of
the hillyer house.

another angle on them all as they get out of the car. rose
takes doll's hand with one hand and waski's hand with the
other.

			rose 
	all right, we'll play monopoly
	then.

mother, daddy and buddy watch rose go up the steps with doll
and waski.

			mother 
	she's like a different person.
	being so sick made a big impression
	on her. i really think she's
	learned a lesson.

			daddy 
	um-hmm. 
		(waits as mother goes on
		 up steps, then turns to
		 buddy and in a low tone)
	come with me, brother. i want to
	show you something.
