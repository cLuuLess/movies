beside him and she has dried her tears and got herself in
hand.

			rose 
	well, ill tell you this. i have
	learned a lesson tonight. i wasn't
	gonna run around, but when i start
	botherin' your daddy and worse
	robbin' a cradle, i gotta face the
	facts of life. 
		(pauses, then with firm
		 resolution)
	tomorrow mornin', i'm gonna get
	myself up and go out.

			buddy 
		(a wee mite puzzled)
	you're going to get yourself up and
	go out?

			rose

	somewhere and i'm gonna find him!
