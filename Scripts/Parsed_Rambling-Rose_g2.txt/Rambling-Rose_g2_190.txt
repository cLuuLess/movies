int. hillyer home - kitchen

cut to a shot close on daddy. he is peering intently at rose.

			daddy 
	what did you say, rose?

close on rose, as she turns, weeping.

			rose 
	well, i was born on a farm
	myself... and i hate to think of
	the baby being born on one.

on them all. daddy and mother stare in shock at rose.

			daddy 
	what baby? what baby? what baby are
	you speaking about?

			rose 
	mine.

			daddy 
	your baby?

			rose 
	yes, mine. i'm going to have one.

			daddy 
		(he is "poleaxed,"
		 staggered)
	good god almighty. this is a
	catastrophe, they won't hire her.

			mother 
		(looks up, sees buddy in
		 patio window)
	brother, get out of that window!

buddy ducks down out of eight instantly. both mother and
daddy, however, are too preoccupied and upset to be concerned
with him.

			daddy
		(stares off groggily into
		 space)
	this is a total catastrastroke. as
	of this moment i am stumped, i
	admit, i am stumped and treed both,
	the hound dogs have me surrounded.

			mother 
		(as rose begins crying)
	poor thing, don't cry, rose. i know
	you feel awful, but don't cry,
	honey, nobody's perfect. who's the
	father, dear?

			rose 
	well, i... i... i don't know...
	maybe it was... but no, you can't
	be sure about a thing like that. it
	wasn't billy, i didn't know him.

			mother 
		(gently)
	i know it's embarrassing... but who
	were you exposed to, dear?
	rose 
	well, now, mrs. hillyer, i... ah-h,
	that's kinda hard to say.

			daddy 
	you're not going to get anywhere
	with that line of questioning. the
	problem is, what are we going to
	do?

			mother 
	that's why i'm asking her who the
	father is. it's the most vital
	question of all. who's the father,
	dear?

			daddy 
		(offhand; he is thinking
		 hard about what to do)
	she already told you, she doesn't
	know.

			mother
		(naively)
	but she must know... unless...
	unless... rose, was there more than
	one person?

			rose 
		(weeping in handkerchief)
	oh-h, mrs. hillyer, i... i can't
	think. i... i'm not really sure.

			mother 
		(gently, a tiny frown, a
		 bit shocked)
	rose, really, you shouldn't act
	like that.

			rose 
		(weeping)
	oh, i know. but i didn't, really.
	honestly, i didn't. there was only
	one, but he's out of town and leave
	no forwardin' address.

			daddy
		(a brilliant idea)
	ah, ha! hold the phone! no
	forwarding address, huh? 
		(turns to mother)
	in the shock of this brilliant
	move, i forgot something.

			mother 
	what did you forget?

			daddy 
	i forgot that rose will lie like a
	child. she's no more pregnant than
	i am, she just doesn't want to go
	to that farm!

			rose 
	yes, i am.

			daddy 
	no, you're not.

			rose 
	yes, mr. hillyer, i am.

			daddy 
		(triumphant, sure he's
		 right)
	all right, tell us, rose, what
	makes you think you're pregnant?

			rose
		(simply)
	i haven't had my period for three
	months and my stomach is getting
	big.

			daddy
		(again "poleaxed" for a
		 moment, but pulls himself
		 together)
	i don't believe it.

			rose
	it's so, mr. hillyer.

			daddy
	all right, damn it. we've seen you
	with your clothes off around here,
	stand up and pull up your dress and
	let's take a look!

			mother
	honey!

			daddy
	she doesn't have to take her
	panties off, we can see her stomach
	with 'em on. all she has to do is
	pull up her dress and let us see
	her belly.

			rose 
	well, all right, if you just won't
	believe me.

rose stands up.

			mother 
	rose, you don't have to.

			rose 
	i don't mind.

			daddy 
	now, you will see, she's lying like
	she always does -- that belly will
	be flat as a pancake!

rose lifts her dress and daddy leans forward eagerly to
confirm his belief. rose stands there with her skirt lifted.
she has on a pair of skimpy white panties. an unmistakable,
definite protrusion can be seen in the area below her navel
just above the line of her panties. a stupefied look is on
daddy's face.

			mother 
	i'd say about three months. are you
	satisfied?

			daddy 
	i am poleaxed and in a non compos
	mentis condition. i wash my hands
	or the whole thing.
