int. hillyer home - front hall - night

cut to a shot of buddy coming with great furtiveness from the
living room out into the front hall. very cautiously, he
tiptoes across the hall and bows down and listens at the door
of his mother's bedroom-study. he crouches down, peeps
through the keyhole.
