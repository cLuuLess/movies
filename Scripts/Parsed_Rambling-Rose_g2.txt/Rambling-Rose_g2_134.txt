ext. hillyer patio - day

a shot of mother and daddy and buddy on the patio. it is a
beautiful sunny morning. mother and daddy are seated at an
outdoor table about to have coffee. daddy is opening mail and
buddy, in the b.g., is gluing up a kite. enter a smiling and
healthy rose with orange juice, toast, cups and coffee on a
tray.

			daddy 
	good morning, rose. and how do you
	feel today?

			rose 
	wonderful. except i can touch the
	place back there with my tongue, i
	wouldn't even know i had that tooth
	pulled.

			daddy 
		(dryly, as he looks at
		 mail)
	well, i know it, i just got the
	bill for it.

			rose 
	boy, for four or five days there i
	didn't think i'd live. but i'm my
	old self again!

			daddy 
	umm. well. yes. but no more strange
	voices in the night, rose.

			rose 
	oh, no, sir.

			mother 
	rose has learned her lesson,
	haven't you, rose?

			rose 
	yes, ma'am.
