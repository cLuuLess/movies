int. hillyer home - kitchen - day

cut to a shot of buddy in the window of the kitchen. he is
propped on his elbows and listening with keen interest to the
talk on the patio. we hear the voices of his parents over the
shot.

			mother's voice 
	if you mean... boys and men, i
	don't think so. rose seems very
	calm about all of that.

			daddy's voice 
	well, so far i have to agree. she
	seems calm as lettuce.

the camera follows buddy as he draws back into the kitchen.
we see doll and waski playing a game on the kitchen table.

			buddy 
	daddy says rose is calm as lettuce.
	do you believe that, doll?

			doll 
	no.

			waski 
	neither do i.

			buddy 
	oh, waski, you don't even know what
	we're talking about.

			waski
	i do, too.

buddy turns, looks back out the window.
