int. hillyer home - buddy's bedroom - night

a shot close on rose and buddy in bed. evidently rose has
weakened and is allowing him to fiddle with her, but we can
only surmise this, the shot is on their heads and shoulders
and a cloud has crossed the moon, the light is more dim. a
different look is on her face, a solemn expression as if she
is listening to some far away sound that she finds strangely
haunting. she moistens her lips, speaks in a slightly feeble
voice.

			rose 
	you better quit that.

			buddy 
	but rose...

			rose 
	i must be outta my mind. buddy,
	quit it.

			buddy 
	am i hurting you?

			rose 
		(pauses, stares off as if
		 listening, then in an
		 even feebler tone, a half
		 whisper)
	no. no, you're not hurting me. 
		(moistens her lips,
		 swallows)
	but i think you better quit it.

			buddy 
	but why, if i'm not hurting you?

			rose 
	you wouldn't understand.
		(puts a hand on his
		 shoulder as if to push
		 him away, but can't; puts
		 her other hand over her
		 eyes)
	oh, god, i must be outta my mind.
	what would your momma think?

the hand falls limply from rose's eyes and she turns her head
to the side and closes her eyes. helplessly, she lies there
as the boy fiddles with her.
