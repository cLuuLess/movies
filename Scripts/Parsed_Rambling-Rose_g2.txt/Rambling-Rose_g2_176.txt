int. hillyer home - master bedroom - night

cut to a shot of daddy, mother and rose in mother's bedroom
study. we see the grillwork of the heat ventillator in the
floor. daddy is at the climax of his speech.

			daddy 
	we all love you, rose. even more
	now, since you've bravely
	surmounted all these epizootics. we
	admire you, we esteem you, we hold
	your hand with love and affection,
	we have an investment in you -- and
	i don't mean money, although god
	knows we have that, too,
	considering those godawful hospital
	bills...
