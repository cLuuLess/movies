int. hillyer home - rose's bedroom - night

cut to a shot of buddy and rose as he stands in the doorway
of her room. rose is sitting on the edge of her bed in her
nightgown, a damp cloth held against her jaw which seems a
little swollen. a look of fear and guilt is on her face.

			rose 
		(rather feebly, as if it
		 explains something)
	i got an awful toothache.

			buddy 
		(quietly)
	rose, if you don't keep your
	boyfriends away from the house,
	daddy is going to fire you.

			rose 
		(innocently)
	but i don't know who they are.

buddy makes an exasperated grimace and exits, shutting door.
the camera remains on rose as she rolls her eyes upward in
dismay.
