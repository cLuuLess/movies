ext. hillyer home - porch

cut to a shot of buddy on the porch. expressionless,
unreadable, neither friendly nor hostile, he stares with an
even gaze directly into the camera. he has his hands on his
hips in a distinctive way that we will later see is a
mannerism of his father's.
buddy tries to imitate the style of his father, not always
with complete success. unreadable as a sphinx, he stands
there, waiting.
