ext. hillyer home - driveway - day

on the red ford as it turns into a familiar driveway, that of
the old hillyer home.

but insofar as possible it looks different now, like a relic
from the past.
maybe the house needs painting, the garden is in weeds -- the
place is not exactly dilapidated, but it is marked by time.

a shot of willcox hillyer as he gets out of the red ford and
walks up the familiar steps of the front porch, travel bag in
hand.
