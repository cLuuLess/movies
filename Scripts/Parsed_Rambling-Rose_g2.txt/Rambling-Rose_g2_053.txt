int. hillyer home - master bedroom - night

cut to a shot of mother's bedroom-study in the moonlight. we
see daddy lying wide-awake in a single bed staring broodingly
out into space. mother lies asleep in a big four poster in
the background of the shot. daddy sighs wearily to himself in
the grip of "insomnia in reverse."
