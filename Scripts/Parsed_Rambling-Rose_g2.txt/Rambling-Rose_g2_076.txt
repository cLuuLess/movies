int. hillyer home kitchen - day

cut to mother and daddy at the kitchen table.

			mother 
		(earnestly)
	i wish you wouldn't pick on rose
	and tease her like that. of course
	her clothes are silly, but she's
	ignorant, naive, she doesn't know
	any better.

			daddy 
	the girl worries me. if she walks
	down the street like that, an army
	will be following her.

			mother 
	well, i admit that outfit isn't
	very modest. but she doesn't mean
	any harm, she just wants to
	attract, attention.

			daddy 
	she will succeed.

			mother 
	i don't think you understand her.
	it isn't sex she wants, it's love
	she wants and this is the only way
	she knows how to get it.

			daddy
		(musingly)
	that farmer in gadsden was awful
	eager to get rid of her, and i'm
	beginning to see why.

			mother 
	he and his wife both said she had a
	fine moral character and was
	wonderful with children.

			daddy 
	well, she loves children, all
	right.
		(adds dryly)
	she loves everybody.

			mother 
	but that's a wonderful quality, not
	a bad quality.
		(takes his hand)
	have a little patience with her.
	she's such a good-hearted little
	thing and tries so hard.

			daddy 
		(stares pensively at her)
	you are the one who's good-hearted.
		(rises)
	as for rose, let's hope for the
	best.

			mother
		(rises, again takes his
		 hand)
	be kind to her. she loves you so
	much.
		(daddy stiffens slightly,
		 and she adds)
	in a perfectly proper way, of
	course.

			daddy
	yes, of course.
