int. hillyer home - kitchen - day

cut to a shot of willcox hillyer and daddy as they enter the
kitchen. the former opens his travel bag and takes out a
bottle of teacher's.

			willcox hillyer 
	i can use a drink after the plane
	ride i had.

			daddy 
	your wife and children are back in
	new hampshire in the snow?

			willcox hillyer 
		(a little smile; it is
		 summer, there couldn't be
		 snow in new hampshire)
	yeah, they're in the snow.

willcox opens whisky, looks for glasses in the dusty familiar
cupboard.

			daddy
	are they polar bears, too?

			willcox hillyer 
		(frowns at cupboard)
	good god, the way you live here.
	this place hasn't been dusted since
	mother died. look at that goddamned
	refrigerator.

			daddy 
	got another twenty years in it,
	boy. 
		(something seems to be
		 bothering him)
	by the way, son, do you recall
	rose, that pretty blonde girl who
	came to our house way back in 1935
	or 1936 and caused such a damnable
	commotion.

			willcox hillyer 
		(frowns, turns and stares
		 at him)
	of course i recall rose. in fact
	i've been thinking of no one else
	for the last hour and a half.

			daddy 
	how could that be, son?

			willcox hillyer 
	dave wilkie of all people was
	sitting by me on the plane -- her
	first husband. it's funny you would
	mention rose. did you hear from
	her?

willcox pours out whisky.

			daddy 
		(casually)
	well, yes, in a manner of speaking.
	you'll have the back bedroom, son,
	mother's old art room. just be
	careful going down the stairs you
	don't break your yankee neck.
