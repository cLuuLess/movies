int. hillyer home - dining room - day

a shot of the family at breakfast in the dining room. the
silence is deafening. everyone looks depressed except daddy,
who is aloofly calm. rose's head is bowed meekly over her
plate as we hear the clatter of silverware. finally, daddy
speaks in an almost pleasant tone.

			daddy 
	well, rose, my sleep was a little
	disturbed last night, and so was
	mrs. hillyer's, and so was the
	children's. how about you? was your
	sleep disturbed, too?

			rose 
		(solemnly)
	yes, mr. hillyer, it was. i... i
	heard strange voices in the night.

			daddy 
		(softly strumming fingers,
		 finally)
	strange voices, rose?

			rose 
		(innocent as an angel)
	yes, sir.

			daddy 
		(still aloofly polite)
	now rose, stop behaving as if
	you're bo peep. those men had a
	flight last night because of some
	female in this house, and it wasn't
	dolly or mrs. hillyer.

			mother 
		(very tense)
	i don't think we ought to discuss
	this in front of the children.

			rose
		(weeping, a hand over her
		 eyes)
	oh... oh... oh! i think... maybe...
	one of 'em... was foster... but i
	don't hardly know him!

			daddy
	oh, shut up, rose. shut your mouth
	and quit crying!

			mother
		(draws herself up)
	i will not sit here and listen to
	you be brutal to this poor girl.

			daddy
	i am not being brutal to her!

			mother
	you certainly are! she has an awful
	toothache, look at her jaw, it's
	all swollen.

			daddy
		(trying to restrain
		 himself, aloofly polite
		 to the utmost)
	darlin', it is not my fault if the
	girl has epizootics --

-- the word means "an animal epidemic," and it's a pet word
of daddy's; he pronounces it epi-zoo-tics, not epi-zoo-ot
tics, and uses it to mean any outrageous human malady --

			daddy (cont'd)
	-- i am not responsible for her
	epizootics and i did not bring
	about her epizootics. now listen to
	me. when i have to get up in the
	middle of the night and defend my
	home with a shotgun against a
	couple of damned scoundrels
	fistfighting in the bushes --

			mother
	scoundrels? they weren't
	scoundrels, they were just boys.

			daddy 
	boys? you say to me boys?

			mother
	yes! yes, i say that to you, they
	were boys! boy friends of rose,
	chat's what they were, and why
	shouldn't she have boy friends? do
	you want her to be unnatural? don't
	you think she's human the same way
	you are yourself? it's the south,
	that's what it is, the south with
	its horrible traditions, of slavery
	and crime and the oppression of
	women, who are just as good as men
	and just as human!

			daddy 
		(his eyes are a trifle
		 glazed)
	now darlin', what has the south got
	to do with this?

			mother 
		(in a real snit, afraid he
		 will fire rose)
	and when i try to talk to you
	seriously, when i try to explain to
	you the unlimited creative power of
	life, how beautiful it would be if
	we gave up this hopeless struggle
	and simply loved each other from
	our hearts, what do you do -- you
	mock me!

			daddy 
		(mildly, his eyes are even
		 more glazed)
	i don't intend to mock you, dear. i
	respect your philosophy. it's
	beyond my comprehension, but i
	respect it.

			rose
		(head bowed, weeping in a
		 little handkerchief)
	ohhh-hh, ohhh...

			daddy 
		(exasperated)
	oh, shut up, rose, eat your
	cornflakes!

			rose 
		(piteously)
	i'm not hungry.

the word is hongry, not hungry.

			daddy 
	now you listen to me, rose --

			mother 
		(with fire in her eyes)
	just a moment! you are not going to
	fire this girl for an innocent
	thing like having boy friends, not
	while there is breath in my body!

			daddy 
	i don't intend to fire her,
	darlin'.

			mother 
	it isn't her fault if she's
	popular... what?

			daddy 
	i said i don't intend to fire her.
	i just want to ask her to keep her
	boy friends away from my home and
	hearth, that's all.

			mother 
		(simmers down at once, now
		 calmly)
	well, that's very reasonable. howe
	i hate to bring it up, but she's
	got an awful toothache, we've got
	to carry her to the dentist.

			rose 
	i don't want to go to the dentist.

			mother 
	be quiet, rose.

			daddy 
	darlin', i'll take a taxi to the
	hotel. you and brother can handle
	the girl's epizootics. i'll just
	say one more thing. 
		(turns to rose and, in a
		 grave tone)
	rose, i told you you had a friend
	in mrs. hillyer, didn't i, that she
	would fight for you like a tiger?

			rose 
		(meekly)
	yes, sir.

			daddy 
	all right, thanks to her, and
	thanks to this case of epizootics,
	you are getting another chance. 
		(points a finger at her,
		 and sternly)
	but don't try my patience again. we
	have growing children in this
	house. do you understand me?

			rose 
	yes, sir.
