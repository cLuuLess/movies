ext. street - bus stop - day

cut to a shot of rose as she walks up to a bus stop. a fairly
well-dressed man with a door-to-door salesman kit is standing
there. rose glances at him then sidles up alongside him as if
she's waiting for a bus. he glances at her for a moment with
interest, but doesn't want to stare, looks away. we see the
model a stop in the background of the shot.
