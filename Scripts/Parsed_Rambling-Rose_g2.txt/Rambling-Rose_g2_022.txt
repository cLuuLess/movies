int. hillyer home - kitchen - day

rose is washing the dishes while the children finish
breakfast. buddy looks up from this cornflakes with a
slightly sly expression.

			buddy 
	rose, who were those scoundrels in
	birmingham?

			rose 
	nobody.

			buddy 
	but who were they?

			rose 
	they were just bad men, that's all.

			buddy 
	in what sense were they bad?

			rose 
	bad is bad, buddy. there ain't no
	sense to it.

			buddy 
	did they try to induce you to
	become a prostitute?

rose turns around, lifts her eyebrows, tosses down the
dishcloth.

			rose 
	i don't answer talk like that,
	buddy. i just don't hear it, i turn
	my back and look away.

rose turns her back on him.

			buddy 
	was that what they tried to do? was
	that why daddy gave you the job, to
	save you from those scoundrels?

			rose 
	your daddy is a wonderful man, i'll
	say that. he's the best and most
	kind-hearted man in the world.

			buddy 
	hey, rose, did you hear about that
	terrible thing down in cave
	springs?

			rose 
	what terrible thing in cave
	springs?

			buddy 
	there was this old man that ate his
	niece.

rose stares emptily for a moment, then bites her lips
together.

			rose 
	i didn't hear you. i didn't hear
	that.

			buddy 
	he really did, he ate his little
	niece. he made pork chops out of
	her.

			rose 
	i don't hear you. i just turn my
	back on that kind of talk and look
	away.

			buddy 
	well, it's only the truth. there
	are horrible things in the world,
	rose.

			rose 
	buddy, you are in one of your evil
	moods, i don't want to talk to you.
	i'm going out and sweep the patio.

rose exits and the camera stays on buddy, doll and waski.

			buddy 
	rose is almost as sentimental as
	mother. if there's one thing i
	can't stand it's sentimentality. in
	chattanooga this man committed an
	almost perfect murder. he killed
	his wife with a black widow spider.

			doll 
	oh, shut up, buddy.

			waski 
	yeah, shut up.
