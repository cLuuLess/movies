int. hillyer home - kitchen - day

cut to a shot of the kitchen on mother and rose. mother is
helping a rather wan rose prepare dinner. enter daddy.

			daddy 
		(as if everyone will be
		 pleased)
	well, i have got news! i called
	long distance and spoke to cousin
	hop and you'll be glad to know,
	rose, i have found you a job!

			rose 
	tennessee?

			daddy 
	yes, tennessee, a lovely state!

			rose 
	well. what kinda job is it?

			daddy 
	ahh-hh, you'll like it. it's a
	fine, outdoor-type job.

			rose 
	you mean a farm?

			daddy 
	no, no, not exactly. it isn't a
	farm in the sense that it's a farm.
	not at all. it's a... dairy
	establishment. you'll 1ike it! i'm
	sure you'll like it because it's
	so... peaceful!

rose bows her head and begins crying.

			mother 
	honey, rose was born on a farm and
	has terrible memories of farm life.
	now i don't think --

			daddy 
	just a minute, rose, you don't
	understand. this isn't a dirt farm
	like the one you were born on, it's
	nice. a neighbor of cousin hop's, i
	talked to him on the phone, a fine
	man... it's not a farm, damn it,
	it's a beautiful dairy
	establishment! stop crying, rose!
	do you hear me? stop crying, it's
	ideal!

			mother 
	i don't know how you can call it
	ideal -- don't you know what the
	word "farm" means to her?

			daddy 
	i don't give a hoot in hell's
	hollow what it means to her! she
	can't stay in this house forever! i
	fired her, damn it!

			mother 
	it sounds like a farm to me.
	calling it a dairy establishment,
	that's just trickery and flummery.

			daddy 
	trickery and flummery or not, she's
	going there tomorrow on the bus!
	it's settled! and i must say we've
	been more than fair to you, rose,
	it's pretty selfish and mean
	hearted of you to sit there and cry
	like that!

rose sits head bowed at the kitchen table.

			rose 
	i'm not cryin' because of me, i'm
	cryin' because of somebody else.

			daddy 
		(stops in mid-air, so to
		 speak)
	what?
