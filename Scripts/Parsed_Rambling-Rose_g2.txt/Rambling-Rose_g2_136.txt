int. hotel - day

cut to a shot of buddy going down the hotel stairs. he holds
onto the banister, sliding with his hands far ahead in order
to take four and even five steps at a time -- it is a
childish trick, the point of the game is to touch as few
stairs as possible.

another angle, on buddy as he jumps down the last remaining
five steps and walks into the lobby. daddy comes from behind
the desk, grim.

			daddy 
	rose is in jail. she bit a
	policeman's thumb. come on, son,
	shadrach can run the hotel.
