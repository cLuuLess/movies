cut to a shot on willcox hillyer close on his face in the
car. he is lost in reflection. a look of bitter sweet emotion
is on his face, an expression of sadness mixed with
amusement. as the camera holds on his face, we hear again on
the track louis armstrong's great version of "dixie," or
music of comparable power, beauty and nostalgic evocation.
now the music is stronger, much stronger than behind the
titles, we are beginning to hear it full force.
