int. local jail - day

cut to a shot in the local jail. the shot is on daddy as he
stands before jail bars staring sternly into a cell. his
hands are on his hips, his straw hat is on the back of his
head and a bit to one side. buddy stands beside him, a little
bit behind, a worried look on his face. the chief of police,
a fat man, is on the other side of daddy.

cut to a pov shot of rose in the cell. her hair is mussed,
her dress is torn. a little innocent, frightened smile is on
her face. the camera pans to include daddy and the chief of
police.

			chief of police 
	that was a awful brawl down at the
	busy beaver, mr. hillyer. you know
	that fat horton, the bootlegger?

			daddy 
	yes, i know the son of a bitch.

			chief of police 
	son of a bitch is right, he dern
	near killed a man. and this girl
	was the cause of it all. what's
	more, she bit a police officer's
	thumb right to the bone.

			daddy 
	well, rose, what have you got to
	say for yourself?

			rose 
		(coughs, then feebly)
	i got an awful bad cold.

			daddy 
		(nods slowly, then with
		 aloof politeness)
	that's all you've got to say,
	you've got a bad cold?

			rose 
		(coughs again)
	well, i don't know what happened.
	they were arguin' about baseball,
	then all of 'em started fightin'.
	as for that policeman, i didn't
	bite him, i don't think i bit him.

in dour silence, daddy and the chief of police stare at rose.
she gives them a little smile, as if to say, "see how
innocent i am?" the chief turns to daddy and asks with dry
irony:

			chief of police 
	well, she's your girl, mr. hillyer.
	you want me to release her in your
	custody?

			daddy 
	no, not really. but i guess we'll
	have to do that, john. let her out.
	let the crazy creature out and i'll
	take her home.
