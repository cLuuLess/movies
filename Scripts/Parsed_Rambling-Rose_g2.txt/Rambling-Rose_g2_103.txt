ext. street - late afternoon

on rose as she walks down a sidewalk in late afternoon with
buster and still another man, a tall fellow in a coca-cola
delivery man's uniform or shirt. rose seems to be innocently
happy, but the men appear to be having a mild dispute.

on rose getting into busters car as buster holds the door for
her, smiling. the coca-cola delivery man is left on the
sidewalk, disappointed.
