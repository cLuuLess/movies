ext. church - day

a shot of rose, dave, buddy, doll and waski at a picnic
celebration outside the church by a running brook.

the scene should be beautiful in summertime. we see a
barbecue pit, homemade ice cream in the metal can, other
picnic things. a happy rose is kissing first buddy, then
doll, then waski. dave smiles fondly, but rather stiffly at
her.

			rose 
	and now waski, are you and buddy
	and dolly ready for some ice cream,
	huh? do you like picnics or don't
	you?

			waski 
	we like 'em! we love 'em!

			dave 
	well, it isn't a picnic, honey.
	it's a barbecue.

			rose
		(a little smile)
	okay.

			dave 
	a picnic doesn't involve roast
	meat, hon. at a barbecue you have a
	lot of roast meat.

cut to a shot close on buddy as he stares pensively at dave.
the camera stays on him as we hear voices over. rose is
happy, dave phlegmatic.

			rose (v.o.) 
	well, all i know is there's ice
	cream. and i'm gonna have me a
	plate right now!

			dave (v.o.)
	better wait, hon. it'll spoil your
	appetite. have some barbecue first.

the camera stays on buddy, as he stares pensively at dave. he
has no expression on his face at all.
