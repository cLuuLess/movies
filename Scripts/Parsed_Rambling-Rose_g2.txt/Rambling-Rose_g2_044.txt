int. hillyer home - dining room - night

down low, we can see under the dining room table now. daddy
has his hands on rose's shoulders and is firmly pushing her
away.

			daddy
	all right, that is enough of this
	nonsense, and i mean enough! get up
	off this floor, rose, and put your
	damned tit back in your dress! do
	you hear me, girl, get up off of
	that floor!

rose, on all fours, blonde hair over her face, making little
whimpering noises of dismay:

			rose
	ohh-hhh... ohh...
