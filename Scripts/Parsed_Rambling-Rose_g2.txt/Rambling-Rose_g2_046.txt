int. hillyer home - dining room - night

cut to a pov shot of rose and daddy. rose stands sheepishly
by the dining room table, half-crying as she adjusts her
dress. daddy sits in his dining room chair. daddy is glaring
at her.

			daddy 
	goddamn you, girl! you've made me
	make a fool out of myself, damn
	your hide, but let me tell you i am
	standing at the pass of thermopylae
	and i won't budge! the very idea,
	my own home with children in the
	house, to say nothing of my wife --
	oh-h, you had better believe i am
	standing at thermopylae, you little
	nut, you had better believe it!
	what are you, crazy? a man is
	supposed to be a fool like this,
	but a woman is supposed to have
	some control and sense! are you a
	nitwit? what's the matter with you?

			rose 
		(weeping)
	oh-h, i'm sorry. i'm sorry, mr.
	hillyer... i just... couldn't help
	myself. i'm sorry...
