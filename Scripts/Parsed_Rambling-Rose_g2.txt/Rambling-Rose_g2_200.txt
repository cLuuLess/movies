ext. hillyer home - driveway

cut to a shot of a 1930's automobile in the hillyer driveway
at night as it drives up and stops before the front steps.

another angle, close on rose and dave wilkie in the car. here
dave is much younger, of course, and a rather handsome man in
a stolid way. even though he is younger than when we saw him
on the plane, he is quite a bit older than rose. rose's eyes
are opened wide, she is a bit breathless, obviously something
important has happened. dave stares at her as if fascinated,
almost as if awed.

			dave 
		(rather stiffly)
	i want to thank you for a wonderful
	afternoon and evenin'. can i see
	you in the mornin'?

			rose 
		(a bit breathless)
	yes. year you can, you sure can.
