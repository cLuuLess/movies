int. hillyer home - back hall - night

cut to a shot of buddy and doll as they slow down and creep
cautiously down the back hall to the back porch. we hear the
men yelling somewhere out in the dark bushes.

			first man's voice 
	you'll swallow teeth yourself if
	you don't leave her alone, you ugly
	bastard! go on, throw one, throw
	one!

			second man's voice 
	i'll throw one, you son of a bitch!

we hear a great crashing in the bushes, a smack of a fist, a
groan of shock, an oath, a shout, more crashing.
