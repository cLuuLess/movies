int. hillyer home bedroom study - day

cut to a shot of buddy's mother, mrs. hillyer, in a morris
chair in her bedroom study.

mother is a sensitive, kind and rather appealing if slightly
eccentric lady of about 37 or 38. she wears glasses, has a
victorian hairdo and a 1930ish style dress. at the moment
mother is absorbed in her studies -- notebooks and history
books are littered and piled everywhere around her chair. she
is drinking a coca-cola and smoking a cigarette held by a
bobbie pin. calmly, she glances up as buddy enters the room.
the camera pulls back to include him.

			buddy 
	the new girl is here.

			mother 
	wonderful. what's she like,
	brother? what is your impression of
	her?

			buddy 
	she talks a great deal and smiles a
	lot. she's very pretty, she has a
	real good figure. she's very
	girlish or womanish, if you know
	what i mean. she wouldn't hurt
	anybody, this girl. she couldn't.

mother accepts her son's precocious pronouncement as
perfectly normal; talks to him as if he's an adult.

			mother 
	your impression is very reassuring,
	brother. of course she's had
	troubles, poor thing, but i sensed
	that was that the girl was like and
	i'm glad to have it reconfirmed.

			buddy 
	you mean confirmed, mother. i
	didn't confirm it before. i would
	have had to confirm it previously,
	in order for it to be reconfirmed.

			mother 
	all right, all right. doll and
	waski are upstairs taking their
	nap, you go get them and bring them
	down to the living room. where is
	the girl?

			buddy 
	in the kitchen drinking all the ice
	water in glenville. she walked out
	here, she didn't go by the hotel.

			mother 
	walked, in all that heat? it's a
	wonder she hasn't got sunstroke.
	i'll phone daddy and you go get
	doll baby and waski.
