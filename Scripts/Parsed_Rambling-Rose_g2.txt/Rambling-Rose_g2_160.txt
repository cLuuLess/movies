int. hillyer home - front door - night

cut to a shot of mother opening the front door. dr. martinson
is there-with his black bag, an icy polite look on his face.;

			mother 
	oh, good evening, doctor. rose is a
	lot better, i just gave her her
	supper. she's almost all well now.

			dr. martinson 
	let me be the judge of that, madam.

			mother 
	yes. well. she's upstairs.
