int. hillyer home - rose's bedroom - dawn

on daddy, as he turns from the window to rose.

			daddy 
	and who, rose, may i ask, is that?

			rose 
	well, it's billy.

			daddy 
	and what, may i ask, was billy
	doing here?

			rose 
		(a straight answer)
	well, mr. hillyer, billy's very
	poor, he don't have no money and
	there wasn't no place else to go.

			daddy 
	well, it was a silly question.

			rose 
	he's a nice boy, you'd like him. he
	wants to be a fireman.

			daddy 
	ye gods and little fishes, a
	fireman. put on some clothes, rose,
	you're naked as a jay bird. when
	you're dressed, come on downstairs.
	i'm afraid your friend billy is
	injured, where are his clothes?

			rose 
		(begins weeping, both
		 breasts now are exposed)
	under the mattress. i hid 'em so
	you wouldn't be mad. he wants to
	marry me, he loves me. i can't
	marry him, he's too young and
	hasn't got no job, but he loves
	me... now you wouldn't hurt him,
	would you?

daddy gently pulls the sheet around her to cover her breasts.

			daddy 
	i won't hurt him, honey.
