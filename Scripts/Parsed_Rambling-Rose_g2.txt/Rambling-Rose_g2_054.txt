int. hillyer home - buddy's bedroom - night

cut back to buddy and rose in bed. he has evidently sweet
talked her into letting him fiddle with her; his hand is- in
her nightgown. there is no indication of lewd interest on
rose's part, a peeved and exasperated look is on her face.
buddy seems quite fascinated, however.

			rose 
	well, are you satisfied now? can we
	just lie and talk, huh?

			buddy 
	hmmph. it has a nipple, all right.

			rose 
	'course it does.

			buddy 
	first i couldn't feel it, but now i
	feel it easily, it's like a little
	acorn.

			rose 
		(moistens her lips,
		 swallows; it is affecting
		 her; she frowns)
	all right, that's enough. 
		(firmly pushes his hand
		 away)
	you're just a child and wouldn't
	understand it, but that type of
	thing can stir a girl up. now lie
	back and we'll talk.

			buddy 
	that was very interesting. thank
	you, rose.

			rose 
		(lighting cigarette)
	don't mention it.

			buddy
		(pensively, with the
		 solemn pedanticness of a
		 precocious child)
	it was softer'n i thought, that was
	my main impression. you know, if
	you hit a girl there it would hurt
	her a lot.

			rose 
	who would want to do such a thing
	as that?

			buddy 
	well, some fiend might.

			rose 
		(stares wonderingly at
		 him)
	you know, buddy, sometimes i can't
	figure you out at all. you can be
	very nice, but like your mother
	said there's an evil streak in you.

			buddy 
	there's an evil streak in
	everybody, rose.

			rose 
	there ain't none in your daddy. you
	know, what happened has just made
	me love him all the more. i not
	only love him, i respect him, i
	admire him.

			buddy 
	rose, i have a serious favor to ask
	you.

			rose 
	most men wouldn't do what he done.
	if they can get a girl they go
	right ahead and get her -- i guess
	to hell they do, just like a dern
	rabbit. 'course later they'll tell
	her she's no good when they done
	the same thing their selves.
	they're a bunch of monkeys. i like
	'em, but they're a bunch of
	monkeys.

			buddy 
		(trying to be casual)
	rose, since you're here in bed with
	me and everything and i've already
	touched your titty...

can't quite say it; leans over and whispers in her ear and we
don't hear what he says.

			rose 
		(her eyes open wide as he
		 whispers)
	why, buddy, shut your mouth! what
	an awful thing to say, and where
	did you get any such idea as that,
	anyhow?

			buddy 
	i'm curious to see what it's like.
	i'm very curious, rose.

			rose 
	well, now that is just too bad!
	curiosity killed the cat.

			buddy 
	yeah, but satisfaction brought him
	back. can i?

			rose 
	no! you ought to be ashamed of
	yourself astin' such a nasty things
	a child your age!

			buddy
	can't i touch it a little, rose --
	not a lot, just a little?

			rose 
	of course you can't! i'm... i'm
	shocked at you, buddy, real
	shocked! now you be quiet or i'm
	going back to my own bed!

			buddy
	please, rose. i'm curious, that's
	all, i have a natural curiosity,
	it's only human. you're my friend,
	aren't you? don't you like me? 
		(again sweetly, almost
		 sugarily)
	i like you, rose, a lot -- in fact,
	i love you.

			rose 
		(softens despite herself)
	well, you're sweet, but you don't
	really love me.

			buddy 
	yes, i do. please, rose, be a good
	sport.

			rose 
	buddy, you're just a child.

			buddy 
	i'm thirteen. and i have a natural
	curiosity. it's only nature, rose,
	that's all. now what's wrong with
	nature, huh?

			rose 
	well, nothin'.
