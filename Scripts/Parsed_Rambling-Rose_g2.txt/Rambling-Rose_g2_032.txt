int. hillyer home - dining room - night (later)

another angle, on the family as they eat dinner. rose is
seated at the table now. she is picking lifelessly at her
food and glancing from time to time with a lovesick
expression at daddy, who is busy eating and seems wholly
unaware of it. mother also is wholly unaware, but all the
children know what is happening. rose takes a gravy for a
biscuit and spills a little, her hand is trembling.

			mother
		(gently, suspects
		 absolutely nothing)
	rose, you're in an awful dither
	tonight. what's the matter with
	you, honey, are you sick or
	something?

			rose
		(in a feeble voice)
	no, ma'am, i'm just fine.

			mother 
	you look sick if you ask me. i hate
	to leave you with the dishes and
	all, but i'm supposed to go to a
	meeting of the garden club this
	evening.
		(to daddy)
	i'll need the car keys.

			daddy 
	i'll drive you, darlin'. you've got
	no business behind the wheel of an
	automobile. you don't think about
	what you're doing and you'll run
	into a telephone pole.

			mother 
	i think about what i'm doing all
	the time, and i've got as much
	business behind the wheel of an
	automobile as anybody. besides, i
	want you to stay and help rose with
	the dishes, the poor girl isn't
	feeling well.

			daddy 
	all right, darlin'.
