int. hillyer home - front hall - night

cut to a shot of buddy as he goes down the hall, eyes
narrowed.

on buddy posted in the doorway of the living room. he has his
hands on his hips daddy-style and is staring sternly up the
stairs.

cut to a pov shot of dr. martinson with his black bag in hand
and shoulders hunched coming down the stairs. the man is
slinking, has quilt written all over him. as he goes down the
stairs he glances to one side, sees buddy and frowns. the man
gives a sudden nervous start of fright as we hear daddy's
voice loud on the track.

			daddy (o.s.)
	everything all right, doctor?

cut to a pov shot of daddy at the rear of the downstairs
hall, napkin in hand and hands on hips. he is staring sternly
at the doctor.

cut back to the doctor. he glances nervously again toward
buddy.

another pov shot of buddy. looks just like daddy, hands on
hips.

on dr. martinson, as he looks back at daddy.

			dr. martinson 
	oh, yes. yes. just fine. a few more
	days... a little more rest...
	she'll be perfectly healthy.

another angle on daddy as he walks forward down the hall
toward buddy. the camera picks up buddy and both of them
grimly stare after the fleeing doctor.

			daddy 
		(in a low, conspiratorial
		 tone)
	what do you think, brother?

			buddy 
	i don't know. but you better watch
	him like a hawk, if he comes back
	again.

			daddy 
	he's not coming back again. we
	scared the rascal off, son.
		(puts a hand on buddy's
		 shoulder)
	come on back to supper. your mother
	has a theory about how to educate
	rose.
