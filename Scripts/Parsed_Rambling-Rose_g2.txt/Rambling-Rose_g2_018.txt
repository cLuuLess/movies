ext. hillyer home porch - day

cut to a pov shot of rose at the foot of the porch steps. a
tentative little smile is on her face. it is very plain she
is nervous and frightened.

			rose 
	hello. i'm rose, and i've come to
	live with you and your family.

silence. the damn boy says nothing. a trifle crestfallen,
rose moistens his lips and swallows. she ventures another
little smile and the camera follows her as she walks up the
steps. the at-times-insufferable buddy comes into the shot.
he still has his hands on his hips daddy-style and his
expression is inscrutable, neither friendly nor hostile.

			rose (cont'd)
	what's your name? what do they call
	you?

finally, the boy speaks -- and he is not so bad. he's a child
after all.

			buddy 
	lots of things. buddy, mostly.

			rose 
		(greatly reassured, a real
		 smile now)
	buddy. well, now, that's a nice
	name, i like it. i am real pleased
	to meet you. 
		(solemnly holds out her
		 hand, they shake)
	hey, look, do you think you got a
	cold drink of ice water somewhere?

			buddy
	sure. let me take your suitcase.

a warm and beautiful smile comes on rose's face and a little
twinkle comes into her eyes. the innocence and sweetness are
not lost, that is never lost, but this is a girl who likes
boys and men.

			rose 
	you're sweet.
