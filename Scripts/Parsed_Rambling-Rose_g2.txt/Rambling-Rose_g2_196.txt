ext. street by hospital - day

a shot of the model a parked on the street outside a hospital
in a small southern town. we see daddy slowly pacing back and
forth in front of the hospital entrance, his head bowed and
his hands clasped behind him.

another angle, closer on the model a. buddy sits in the
middle on the front seat, mother is at the window. doll and
waski are on the back seat. they all are staring with pale
worry at the pacing daddy fifty feet away. all are
frightened, mother is very pale. doll has a tiny handkerchief
to her eyes and is half crying. even waski is very scared.

			waski 
		(seems on verge of tears)
	mother... is rose going to die?

			mother
		(in a trembly voice)
	no, waski, she won't die, because
	we are praying for her.

cut to a shot of daddy from the pov of the car. he looks at
his wristwatch, frowns and walks into the entrance of the
hospital.

another angle, on them all in the car. they wait, pale and
silent. doll sniffles in her handkerchief.

			doll 
	why is it taking so long?

			buddy 
	here comes daddy.

cut to a pov shot of daddy as he slowly walks up to the car,
his straw hat in his hand.

cut to a shot of mother close on her face as she stares at
her husband as if trying to read the news on his face. a tiny
frown comes on her forehead as icy fear comes in her eyes.

another angle, close on daddy as he walks up to the window of
the car, hat in hand. a trace of tears can be seen in his
eyes, but when he speaks his voice is calm.

			daddy
		(philosophically)
	well, i thought i'd seen the limit,
	but these are the most great, gaga
	epizootics she's ever had.

another angle on daddy and them all. in pale fear, mother
stares at him, uncertain what has happened.

			mother 
	how is she?

			daddy 
	fine.

as mother sighs in heartfelt relief...
