int. hillyer home - top of stairs - night

on buddy and doll at the top of the stairs. they pause to
talk and now they don't have to whisper. doll is happy,
pleased.

			doll 
	wasn't daddy wonderful? he wanted
	to kiss her some more and play with
	her, but he didn't, because he
	loves mother and all of us, and he
	loves rose, too. isn't he
	wonderful, isn't he great?

			buddy 
		(dryly, aloof; he doesn't
		 mean this really)
	wonderful? he kissed her and played
	with her titty, and i don't see
	anything so great about that. he
	was probably afraid mother would
	come back early and catch him.

			doll 
	you know, buddy, sometimes you make
	me sick.

doll gives him a venomous glance and walks away. the camera
stays on buddy as he stares after her with a thin little
smile. be seems wryly amused that he has made her angry.
after a moment, he turns and stares in the direction of
downstairs and his face changes. his smile fades, then slowly
returns as he thinks of what has happened.

			buddy 
		(quietly, to himself)
	thermopylae. the persians shall not
	pass.

it is obvious that secretly buddy admires very much his
father's behavior.
