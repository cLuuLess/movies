int./ext. model a - street - day

a shot of daddy and mother in the model a as daddy drives. we
see doll and waski solemn on the back seat, but buddy is not
visible.

			daddy 
	well, thank god we are rid of her
	at last. and the best thing of all
	is that she's happy. the little nut
	is happy, she found mr. right in
	the nick of time!

			mother 
	well, yes, she's happy. of course
	dave doesn't have her life force,
	not at all. there isn't much
	furniture in his house, just a
	table and one or two chairs,
	whereas rose has furniture coming
	out of the windows.

			daddy 
	honey, he is mr. right.

			mother 
		(slowly nods)
	yes, i think so. he adores her,
	it's almost pitiful the way he
	worships her. i just hope she isn't
	too much for him.

mother pauses, frowning, she has her doubts, looks over her
shoulder.

			mother (cont'd)
	what do you think, brother?

mother frowns in surprise.

cut to a pov shot of buddy on the back seat of the car. now
it is clear why we couldn't see him in the other shot. be is
lying down on the seat of the car with his sunday coat pulled
over his head.

another angle on mother and buddy, doll, waski. buddy lies on
the seat, motionless with his coat over his head.

			mother (cont'd)
	what's the matter with him?

			doll 
		(seems awed, staring down
		 at buddy)
	i don't know. i think he's cryin'!

cut to another angle on mother, from the front as she slowly
turns back and stares thoughtfully ahead. the shot is also on
daddy. they both stare ahead in pensive silence. finally
mother speaks.

			mother
		(rather sadly)
	maybe brother is right. maybe so.
