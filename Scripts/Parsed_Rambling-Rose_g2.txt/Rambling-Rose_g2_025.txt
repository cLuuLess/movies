ext. hillyer home - patio - day

another angle, on daddy as he gets out of the model-a. he has
his usual straw hat on the back of his head. the camera
follows him as he walks onto the patio.

			daddy 
	good morning, sweetheart. beautiful
	day.

			mother 
	yes, it's so nice i thought i'd
	work outside.

			daddy 
	how goes it, darlin'?

			mother 
	slow, hon. but at least i can
	concentrate now that rose is here.

			daddy 
	what do you think of her, honey?

mother doesn't answer, she writes on, head bowed over her
notebook. we see in this shot the hearing aid she wears and
hear from it a faint buzz.

			daddy (cont'd)
	turn up your hearing aid.

			mother 
	what?

			daddy 
	your hearing aid, it's buzzing at
	me like a snake.

			mother
		(adjusts hearing aid)
	oh. did you say something?

			daddy 
	i asked you what you think of
	rosebud, now that she's been here a
	while.

			mother 
	honey, she's perfect. she works all
	the time and she's wonderful with
	the children. and they love her,
	even brother likes her though he
	won't admit it. i think she's just
	perfect.

			daddy 
	um-hmm. almost too perfect.

			mother 
	and she's such a good-hearted
	thing, there isn't an ounce of harm
	or malice in her.

			daddy 
	well, i'll admit i don't see any
	flies on her yet.

			mother 
	there are no flies on rose, i don't
	know what you're talking about.

			daddy 
	well, she must have done something
	to encourage those scoundrels in
	birmingham, even if she did run
	away from them.
