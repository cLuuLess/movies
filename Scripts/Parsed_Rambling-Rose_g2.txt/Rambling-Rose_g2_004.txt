int. delta airplane - day

a shot of him as he smiles rather nicely at a very attractive
young stewardess as he walks down the aisle of the plane. he
is not a crass or lewd flirt, but life comes into his face
when he sees a pretty girl -- he seems to have a real
affection for girls: toward men he is polite but rather dry
and ironic, almost aloof, but girls he likes. we see him sit
in a seat, open his travel bag and take out long galley
sheets. he stares for a moment rather wearily at the galleys,
then sighs, puts on reading glasses and begins to make
corrections as boarding passengers walk by in the aisle.

something or someone disturbs him, he looks up with a slight
frown and cut to a pov shot of dave wilkie, all wonder and
enthusiasm. this over the titles and we do not hear the
dialogue they speak, what we heard is louis armstrong, but i
will put the dialogue in here so the actors can act it. we do
not want to hear it, the sense of what they are saying will
be obvious from the acting.

	buddd-dee! my god, if it ain't
	buddy! well, if this ain't the
	darnest thing!

another angle, on them both as dave blocks the aisle, an
idiot false-toothed grin on his face. hillyer has a pained
embarrassed smile.

	excuse me... your voice is familiar
	and i'm sure i know you from
	somewhere...

			dave wilkie 
		(not on track, with
		 delighted injury)
	awww-rr, buddy, come on, you know
	me!

			willcox hillyer 
		(not on track)
	well, i... i... ah-h, let's see...

			dave wilkie 
		(not on track)
	it's dave wilkie! i'm dave wilkie,
	don't you remember me?

			willcox hillyer 
		(not on track)
	oh. oh, god. of course, dave, how
	are you?

the men shake hands, dave enthusiastically, hillyer less so.
we see dave stow his suitcase and take the seat next to
hillyer.
