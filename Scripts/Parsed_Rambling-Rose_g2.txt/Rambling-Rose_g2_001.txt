ext. delta terminal - kennedy airport - day

on a taxi arriving at the delta terminal of kennedy airport.
a man in a well-tailored gray suit gets out of the taxi.

cut to a closer shot of the man as he pays the cabbie. he is
willcox hillyer, the middle-aged "buddy" of this story and
the observer through whose eyes it is seen. he has a dry,
ironic, rather agreeable manner and he should seem like
everyone's idea of a successful author, a slightly graying,
trim, still-youthful-looking fifty. the camera follows him as
he walks into the terminal carrying a small travel bag.
