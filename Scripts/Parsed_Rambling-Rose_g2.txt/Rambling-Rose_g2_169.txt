ext. hillyer home - rose garden - day

cut to a shot of daddy and buddy in a rose garden below the
windows of the house.

it is hawkshaw the detective and his unwilling assistant.
daddy solemnly points to dim marks in the flower bed.

			daddy 
	see that, son? now this is a heel,
	see, and there, that's the ball of
	a foot. someone has been walking
	here.

			buddy 
		(reluctantly)
	well, it's not very plain.

			daddy 
	that is because it rained recently,
	the rain has obscured the evidence.
	but you could still take plaster
	casts of these footprints, then
	match up the plaster casts with
	whosever shoes they are, and that
	way you could catch him --
	understand?

			buddy 
	but how would you find him?

			daddy 
	well. well, what i mean is, you
	could prove it was his shoes if you
	did catch him. but look this,
	brother, it is even more
	interesting. look at this mark
	here, and that mark over there. now
	wouldn't you say those marks are
	the marks of a ladder?

			buddy 
	well, i don't know. 
		(trying to sound like a
		 fellow detective, but
		 doesn't want rose to get
		 caught)
	no, i don't know, daddy, i think
	the rain has obscured it.

			daddy 
	true, but if you look sharply you
	can see that those marks are the
	marks of a ladder. now let's go
	back to the garage and see if the
	ladder has been tampered with.
