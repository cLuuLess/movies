a shot of buddy sound asleep in his bed in the early gray
dawn. as we dissolve in on the shot, we hear a loud banging
and daddy's voice. 

			daddy (o.s.)
	open that door! open it up, open it
	this instant! do you hear met open
	that door!

buddy sits quickly up in bed, at once pushes back the covers
and gets out of the bed, hurriedly reaches for his khaki
pants.
