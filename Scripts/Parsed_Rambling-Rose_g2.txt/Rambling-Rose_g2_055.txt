int. hillyer home - master bedroom - night

cut to a shot of daddy sitting on the edge of his bed in
pajamas. he looks frowzle-haired and glum. the camera follows
him as he wearily gets up and walks across the bedroom in the
moonlight and takes a package of cigarettes from a bureau. be
glances over his shoulder as we hear mother.

			mother 
	what's the matter, hon? is anything
	wrong?

			daddy 
	no, darlin'. just that damnable
	insomnia in reverse. i sleep like a
	baby for an hour then i'm wide
	awake. you go back to sleep.

daddy lights a cigarette and walks to the window and stares
out at the moonlit night.

the camera moves in closer on his face and we see a weariness
and strain he has not shown before.

			daddy 
	the depression has got me. that
	miserable hotel, no money anywhere,
	strong men out of work, children
	hungry. it's a great life if you
	don't weaken.
