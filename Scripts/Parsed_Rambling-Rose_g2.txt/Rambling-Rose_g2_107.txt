ext. hillyer home - patio - day

a shot of mother on the patio studying. it is a sunny
afternoon. mother looks up idly, looks back down at her
notebook, then looks up again with a frown.

cut to a pov shot of a scruffy-looking kan as he darts behind
one tree to another. the scruffy-looking man does not seem
sinister, but he definitely is scruffy.

on mother. frowning, she puts down her notebook and rises,
walks toward the door of the kitchen.
