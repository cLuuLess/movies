int. hillyer home - front hall - night

cut to a shot of buddy crouched at the keyhole. with great
alacrity, he jumps up and hurries across the hall and shuts
the living room door just as daddy whisks open the bedroom
door. daddy grimaces.

			daddy 
	could of sworn that boy was out
	here.

daddy shuts the door and at once almost like the movement of
a ballet buddy opens the living room door and tiptoes back to
the keyhole.
