cut to a shot of daddy and mother. it is another "keyhole
shot."

			mother 
	how could rose really be a bad
	influence on dolly? she has a
	loving nature, you ought to want
	someone like that around your
	children. why do you think those
	boys and men like her?

			daddy
	well, i have a pretty good idea.

			mother 
	if you mean sex, you couldn't be
	more wrong. rose likes those boys
	and men, she has love in her heart,
	and that is what they want. it's
	the most rare and beautiful thing
	in life and that is why they follow
	her.

			daddy 
	they follow her because she's a -- 
		(he is about to say "piece
		 of tail," but interrupts
		 himself)
	-- no, i won't say that.

			mother 
	what she doesn't understand is that
	her behavior is disturbing to other
	people. she's young, she's got to
	learn to restrain the life force
	that's in her. its creative, but in
	her case it's too creative.

			daddy 
	darlin', rose has got to go!

			mother 
		(rises)
	i'll talk to her, i'll reason with
	her.
