int. hillyer home - dining room - night

a shot of the family at dinner in the dining room at night.
daddy is at the head of the table, mother is at the other
end.

buddy, doll and waski are all seated in neat, nice clothes,
hands washed and hair combed. rose is serving, but a place is
set for her. she wears an attractive little apron and is
smiling, blushing, happy as daddy teases and jokes at her.

			daddy
	(in a good humor) 
	rosebaby blossom, these are the
	most delicious candied yams i ever
	ate! why, they just melt in my
	mouth. and this fried chicken is
	fit for a king. how do you do it,
	peachbird? what is the secret of
	your art, plum blossom, huh?

			rose
		(blushing, smiling)
	oh, i don't know, i... i...

			daddy 
	rosebird baby, you are the light of
	my life, darlin'. how did we ever
	get by without you?

			rose 
		(stares at him, stricken)
	i... i'll get the grits.

the camera follows rose as she exits, and stops on buddy and
doll. buddy slews his eyes toward his sister, who meets his
gaze for a moment then looks down at her plate. the camera
moves on to mother, who is utterly oblivious of anything
going on between rose and daddy.

			mother 
	rose does have a gift for cooking.
	she learns so fast, but mainly i
	think it's that she tries so hard.
