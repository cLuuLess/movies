int. hillyer home - dining room - night

a shot of the hillyer family minus rose eating dinner in the
dining room. the meal is almost finished, daddy cutting apple
pie.

			daddy 
	is that doctor still up there,
	brother.

			buddy 
	yeah, he's still up there.

			daddy 
	what's taking the rascal so long?

			mother 
	honey, dr. martinson isn't a
	rascal, he's one of the finest
	physicians in glenville. he studied
	at johns hopkins university.

			daddy 
	i don't care where the polecat
	studied.

			mother 
	sometimes the negativism and
	cynicism in you makes me want to
	vomit. 
		(shakes her head sadly as
		 buddy surreptitiously
		 puts his napkin on table)
	your real trouble is that you're
	anti-intellectual. the irony is
	women are supposed to be emotional,
	but i never saw anybody who
	depended more on emotion and
	prejudice than you do.

			buddy 
		(a half audible murmur)
	excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.

			mother 
	now i have a plan about rose, an
	educational plan. she's getting
	better and we don't want any more
	trouble --
		(notices buddy slipping
		 out)
	brother, you ought to hear this.

			buddy 
	i'll be right back.

the camera follows buddy as he slips out during following
speech.

			mother 
	first, those clothes she wears.
	they're too provocative. i've
	talked to her a lot about it and i
	think she understands...
