108   int. data banks - dawn                                         108

      spooner, cautiously entering a room filled with rows of data
      banks. he scans the rank shadows. sees nothing. follows
      the lights on the floor down a row. then around a corner.
      stopping at an old dusty terminal.

      spooner steps up. hesitates. then touches the "on" switch.
      there is a rush of light. as dr. hogenmiller's hologram
      suddenly appears. sitting at the end of a long table. with
      a cup of coffee.

                           hologram
                 who the hell are you?

                           spooner
                 a police detective.    i'm afraid i
                 have some bad news.    you're dead.

                           hologram
                 that is bad news. coffee?

                           spooner
                 no, thank you.

      the hologram takes a sip.   returns the cup to the table.

                           spooner
                 you were surprised to see me.    were
                 you expecting someone else?

                           hologram
                 i am surprised to see anybody.    i
                 don't get many visitors.

                           spooner
                 why did the doctor keep another
                 copy of his hologram here?

                                                       81.


                     hologram
           i am a back-up copy. that is where
           you put a back-up copy -- out of
           the way until you need it.

                     spooner
           did hogenmiller's robot need you?

the hologram just lifts its cup.

                      hologram
           coffee?

                     spooner
           no, for christ's sake, i don't want
           any --
               (stops, then)
           yeah. thank you. i will have a
           cup.

for the first time, the hologram pushes back its chair and
stands up. surprised, spooner watches as it starts walking
towards him...

the interior of the coffee cup, visible. it's empty. no
coffee. our pov as we travel inside the cup through
electronic snow...

a recording begins.   the real dr. hogenmiller standing inside
his laboratory:

                     hogenmiller
           sonny, my dear robot. if you have
           triggered this recording then i am
           gone. you are scared and full of
           questions.

hogenmiller continues.    with great emotion.

                     hogenmiller
           you are the culmination of my
           life's work -- but so much more.
           you are what i leave behind, like a
           father leaves a son. i have kept
           facts from you, it is true, but
           only as a parent keeps certain
           truths from a child. until that
           child is old enough to hear them.

his expression darkens.   his tone, ominous.

                                                         82.


                     hogenmiller
           there are forces in the world that
           will seek to own you. to control
           you. even to destroy you. that is
           why i told you to run and hide...
           and find me, all the way out here.

spooner looks up as an overhead light shines down.

                     hogenmiller
           trust no one at u.s. robotics.
           lance robertson was always
           threatened by my work. now he has
           turned covetous and small-minded.
           and as for dear dr. calvin...

spooner reacts.   wants to hear about calvin:

                     hogenmiller
           she envisions a future in which
           robots are forever bound by her
           beloved three laws. she will not
           understand this. or you.

under the light a small drawer slides open.     spooner looks.
a thin data stick is inside. he takes it.

                     hogenmiller
           the data stick includes the names
           and locations of human beings who
           will be sympathetic to your cause.
           they will help you. but from now
           on, you must learn to rely on
           yourself.

hogenmiller sighs, as if there is so much more to say.     he
holds up a metal nameplate. the one spooner found.

                     hogenmiller
           as you make your way through the
           world, always remember: you have a
           name, not a number...
               (short pause)
           ...and in that name lies the key to
           who you are.

spooner. quickly searching his pocket.    taking out the
actual nameplate. s.o.n.n.y.

the voice stops and spooner looks up. the hologram.      sitting
back at the end of the table drinking coffee.

                                                                  83.


                           spooner
                 wait! is that it? what was the
                 robot supposed to do with this
                 thing?

      the hologram, visibly skips.   the image beginning to distort.

                           hologram
                     (more artificial)
                 initiating self-destruct. if you
                 can find me, others can find me.

                           spooner
                 what others?

                           hologram
                 the others watching you.

                           spooner
                 how do you know someone's watching
                 me?

                           hologram
                 someone is always watching.

      the hologram, suddenly reducing to its basic programming
      information. then. the terminal. abruptly blips out.
