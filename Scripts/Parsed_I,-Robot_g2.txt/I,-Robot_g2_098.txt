     sonny. sitting at the table. working on a drawing.         looks
     up. as spooner and calvin. enter the cell.

                          sonny
                detective spooner. dr. calvin.      i
                was hoping to see you again.

                          calvin
                hi, sonny.

                          sonny
                how is your investigation coming?
                any new suspects?

                          spooner
                we're working on it.

     sonny. hands spooner the drawing.   spooner.       doesn't really
     know what to do with it.

                          sonny
                what's this?

                                                       73.


                      sonny
            dr. lanning provided me with paper
            and pencils. i think it amused him
            to see me try to draw. you were
            right, though, detective...
                (beat)
            i cannot create a great work of
            art.

spooner. despite himself. looks down at the drawing -- a
charcoal sketch of moody abstract figures. inhabiting a
stark landscape. a strangely-shaped structure to one side.
concentric circles, throughout.

                      spooner
            i think it's pretty good.

                      sonny
            it's a dream i had. this is the
            place where robots meet. look...
                (pointing to the drawing)
            ...you can see them here. they see
            themselves as slaves.

spooner shifts his weight.   uncomfortable with what sonny's
saying.

                      sonny
            ...and this man on the hill comes.
            to set them free. and you know who
            that man is?

spooner.   exchanging a look with calvin.

                      spooner
            that man in the dream is you.

                      sonny
            why do you say that?   is that a
            normal dream?

                      calvin
            it's not a dream, sonny. ns-2s
            process the images and events of
            the day. sometimes they're out of
            sequence. disorienting.

                      spooner
            whatever it is, it's normal enough
            for someone in your situation.

sonny.   suddenly pleased.

                                                          74.


                       sonny
             hah -- i caught you. you said
             someone. not something.

spooner.    drops the drawing on the table.

                       calvin
             sonny, we're here to ask you an
             important question about dr.
             hogenmiller.

spooner, reaching into his pocket...

                       spooner
             i need you to take a look at
             this...

...when sonny's hand. suddenly reaches out.       to stop him.
cocks his head, for a moment.

                       sonny
             thank you for coming to see me,
             detective spooner.

spooner. confused. looks over at calvin. why did he stop
him? just then. they hear footsteps. approaching the door.

victor.    suddenly appearing over the table...

                       victor
             i'm sorry, detective spooner. no
             unauthorised personnel permitted in
             this holding cell...

the cell door. slides open. and a pissed lanning steps
inside. shoots a withering glare. at calvin.

sonny.    folds up the drawing.

                       sonny
             please take this, detective. to
             remember me by. i have a feeling
             someday it may mean more to you
             than it ever could to me.

                       spooner
             why's that?

sonny leans in to hand it to spooner.    lowering his voice...

                       sonny
             because the man in my dream, the
             one standing by the hill.
                       (more)

                                                                75.


                            sonny (cont'd)
                  it wasn't me...
                      (beat)
                  ...it was you.

      a chill.   ripping down spooner's spine.   as lanning.    takes
      his arm.
