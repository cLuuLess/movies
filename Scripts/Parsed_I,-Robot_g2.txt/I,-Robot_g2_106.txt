107   int. front office - continuous                                107

      ...it gives way. he spills into some sort of front office.
      the place, a mess. some sort of crude robot. sits frozen at
      the counter.

      spooner approaches it. hits the counter with his fist and
      the robot suddenly jerks to life.

                                                               80.

      spooner.   thinks for a second.   following a hunch...

                 dr. hogenmiller sent me.

      nothing happens. then. a door. springs open in the back.
      a row of lights, illuminating the path to follow.
