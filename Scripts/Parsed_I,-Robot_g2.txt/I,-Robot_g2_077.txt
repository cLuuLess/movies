78   ext. platform - continuous                                      78

     the express train.   speeding along.   then with a whoosh it's
     gone.

     the track. empty. no spooner. anywhere. human commuters.
     stunned. horrified. start calling. for help.

     the maintenance robot.    turns, disappearing into the crowd.
