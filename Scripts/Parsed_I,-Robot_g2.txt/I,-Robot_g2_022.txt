22   int. mainframe - day                                        22

     spooner and calvin enter the mainframe of u.s. robotics.
     this is the nerve center of the whole operation. walls lined
     with computers, screens, and thousands of controls.

                                                       17.


                     calvin
           this is victor's home.

victor appears on a wall-sized screen broken up into beehive-
like components.

                     victor
           i will now play you the last thirty-
           two seconds of dr. hogenmiller's
           life.

as we watch the screens. the elevator opens and doctor
hogenmiller steps into the metal corridor. in countless
angles. high, low, close-up, wide. hogenmiller's face
composed but tight.

spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him.   hogenmiller
steps in. the doors slide closed behind him.

nothing for a few moments. then a muffled gunshot. calvin
jumps, startled. that's it. the cameras, still trained on
the corridor.

                     spooner
           where's the tape from inside?

                     victor
           dr. hogenmiller did not permit
           cameras to observe him while
           working.

                     calvin
           that was only within the last year.

                     spooner
           so we can throw paranoia into the
           mix.
               (to victor)
           fast-forward.

a hundred-plus screens all fast-forward. police officers
appear and force open the doors. now technicians appear
and rush through in a blur...

                      calvin
           um.   i hate to be a stickler...

on screen, we see spooner and calvin enter the lab.

                     calvin
           but don't killers usually have to
           enter and exit the scene of a
           crime?

                                                            18.


                          spooner
                stop the recording.

     spooner turns away from the footage.   stares at calvin.

                          spooner
                they do, doctor. unless they've
                always been there -- and never
                left.

     calvin looks at him.   trying to understand.

                          calvin
                you think the murderer was in the
                lab the entire time?

                          spooner
                if i'm right, it's still there...

     spooner turns back to the screens. the image paused at the
     exact moment the mechanical guard rolled in front of the lab
     door.

                          spooner
                we just locked it in.
