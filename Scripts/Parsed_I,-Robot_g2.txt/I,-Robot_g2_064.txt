64   int. calvin's condo - continuous                              64

     ...her condo.   spartan.    unadorned.

                         calvin
                what? that's impossible.      you
                know...

                          spooner
                what i know is a demolition crew
                started tearing down hogenmiller's
                house while i was still inside it.

                          calvin
                maybe they didn't realise...

                                                         54.


                      spooner
            i scanned my badge before i went
            in. they realised.

                      calvin
            then you must have done it wrong...

                      spooner
            i don't think you're hearing what
            i'm saying -- they tried to kill
            me.

spooner moves deeper into the apartment.   everything.
automated. computerised. cold...

                      spooner
            there's something going on, here.
            some kind of shift.

calvin laughs.   can't believe what she's hearing.

                      calvin
            do you know how paranoid you sound?

                      spooner
            great. now i'm being analysed by a
            robo-psychologist.

                      calvin
            you just want to find the flaws in
            the system. you're obsessed with
            it. you'll twist anything to fit
            your agenda.

                      spooner
            like you did in court today? how'd
            that fit your agenda, doctor?

he pulls out the photo of calvin and hogenmiller. calvin.
blanching at the sight of it. spooner tosses it down.

                      spooner
            you told me you hardly knew him.
            want to try the truth this time?

                      calvin
            well, detective, when you see
            someone you know well put a bullet
            through their brain, it makes you
            wonder if you ever really knew them
            at all.

calvin.   looking down at the photo.   swallows.

                                                         55.

                       calvin
                 (difficult for her)
             he was my mentor. no, more than
             that. a genius with an insight far
             beyond anyone in his field.

                       spooner
             doesn't sound like the washed-up
             old fool robertson described.

                       calvin
             but he was starting to withdraw
             from everyone. even me.
             maybe...if i'd tried harder to
             reach him...
                 (shakes her head)
             the doctor was reckless when he
             created a robot potentially not
             bound by the three laws. he could
             have ruined everything we'd been
             working for.

spooner.    locking eyes with her.

                       spooner
             sounds like a motive for murder to
             me. just not for the suspect we
             have in custody.

calvin. blinks. trying, to stick to her resolve. heads
over to the door. spooner. looking around the condo.

                       spooner
             you know there's not one thing in
             this apartment that looks like a
             human being lives here. no
             evidence of a life outside your
             work. almost seems like you're
             afraid of people.

calvin.    opening the door.

                       calvin
             i'm not afraid of people,
             detective. i just don't like them.

spooner. looks at her.     then heads out the door.   calvin
slams it behind him...

the sound...of the slam...reverberating...and we...

                                           fade into:

                                                             56.
