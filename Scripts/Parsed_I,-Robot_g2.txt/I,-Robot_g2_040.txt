41   int. control booth - continuous                                41

     ...the control booth. overlooking the pristine factory
     floor. the foreman starts working the controls of a central
     computer.

                          calvin
                all nestors accounted for?

                                                                32.


     the screen scrolls with inventory figures.

                           night foreman
                     (gesturing)
                 as you can see, all properly
                 catalogued. your robot just isn't
                 here.

     calvin turns to say something to spooner. but he isn't
     there. she looks around. then sees the foreman reacting.
     looks out the window at...

     spooner.   walking out onto the factory floor.
