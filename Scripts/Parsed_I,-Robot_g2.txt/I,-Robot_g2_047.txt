48   int. cell observation booth - early morning                     48

     spooner stares at his reflection in a large mirror.     touches
     a control and the mirror becomes a window onto...

     a holding cell. the robot suspect sits at the table.
     shackled to the chair. staring at the table top.

     bergin steps up beside spooner.   looks through the glass.

                          lt. bergin
                i can't tell if it's not moving
                because it's trying to psych us
                out, or because it's just a
                machine. or both.

                          spooner
                i want to go in.

                          lt. bergin
                orders are nobody steps into that
                room `til lanning and his attorneys
                get here.

     spooner.   throws him a look.   bergin, his loyalties torn.

                          lt. bergin
                five minutes.
