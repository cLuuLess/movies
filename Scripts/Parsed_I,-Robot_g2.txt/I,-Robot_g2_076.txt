     spooner stepping out onto the platform, pulling the homeless
     man along with him. commuters pour out around them.

     as the train pulls off with a whoosh. the homeless man.
     backs away from spooner. grinning insanely. pointing.

                           homeless man
                 why are you protecting them, man?
                     (short pause)
                 they were talking about you!

     a chill. ripping up spooner's spine. as he watches the
     homeless man. wander down the platform.

     tries. to shake off the feeling. as he turns. to wait for
     the next train. suddenly realising. that he's alone on the
     platform. watches. a huge digital clock. ticking off
     seconds. sees. cameras in every corner.

     then that feeling. at the back of his neck. he turns and
     spots. a couple maintenance robots. carrying luggage. onto
     the platform. then more commuters show up. waiting. for
     the next train. more maintenance robots. following them.

     spooner. steps up to the platform's edge.       craning to see.
     the approaching train...

     when suddenly. he feels a sharp shove. at the back of his
     knee. his shoe, slipping. arms. flailing as he...

                                                             61.


     pitches over the edge onto the track. people crying out as
     the train gets closer. spooner. whips his head around.
     seeing...

     a maintenance robot. looking down at him from the platform.
     suitcase in hand.

     the magnetic-levitating train. right on him. spooner.
     flips onto his back. flattening himself. as much as he can.
     clenching his fists. bracing himself as...

     the train screams over him. the sound, deafening. the force
     of the wind. whipping his tie. his coat. there's nothing,
     for him to hold on to. as his legs start to rise off the
     track. caught up. in the vortex. spooner starts sliding.
     along the track...

     gritting his teeth...there's nothing he can do. getting
     sucked towards...the air downtake...at the center of the
     track. the city...yawning hundreds of feet...below...
