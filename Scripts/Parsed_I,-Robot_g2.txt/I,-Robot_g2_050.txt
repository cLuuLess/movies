51   int. homicide unit hearing room - morning                     51

     spooner and bergin, head into a small courtroom off the main
     squad room. lanning is huddled with aronson and a half-dozen
     other company lawyers.

     spooner's jaw tenses. as he watches toller emerge from the
     clutch. shaking hands. slapping backs. strolls over to
     them.

                            toller
                  we got judge drexel...

                            robot bailiff
                  this hearing is called to order!

     as a large screen. blips on behind them. the two opposing
     sides, assemble before it. judge drexel, still in his
     pajamas and robe. an ns-2 robot. leaning in to serve him a
     cup of tea.

                            judge drexel
                  statements, gentlemen.

     aronson.    standing at a glass podium.

                            aronson
                  your honor, the state is treating
                  the robot as a defendant. but in
                  fact it is a piece of property.
                  property belonging to u.s.
                  robotics.

     toller.    arm resting on his podium.

                            toller
                  this robot has been implicated in
                  the death of a human being, your
                  honor.

                            aronson
                  which places the incident firmly
                  within the realm of an industrial
                  accident. or is the state going to
                  argue this case s a homicide?

                            judge drexel
                  that's a good question.

                             toller
                  no, sir.   of course not.

     spooner.    pointing a finger at the u.s. robotics group.

                                                           44.


                       spooner
             their machine shot and killed a
             man!

toller.    shoots him a look.     just as lanning speaks up.

                       lanning
             there's actually no concrete
             evidence that points to that
             conclusion, your honor...

spooner.    throws up his arms...

                        spooner
             what?...

                       lanning
             but we recognise that this robot is
             an aberration. and in the interest
             of public safety, u.s. robotics
             proposes that it be destroyed
             immediately.

no one expected this.    least of all spooner.    he turns to
toller.

                       spooner
             you can't let them destroy evidence
             in an ongoing investigation!

                       toller
             i'm not sure you even have an
             investigation any more.

just then the door opens.    everyone turns as calvin enters.
spooner looks surprised.

                       aronson
             your honor, i'd like to call our
             company robo-psychologist to the
             stand.

                       judge drexel
             very well.

calvin crosses to the podium. a speaker asking:
doyousweartotellthetruththewholetruthandnothingbutthetruth?

                        calvin
             i do.

                                                               45.


                            aronson
                  dr. calvin, please tell us what
                  conclusions you've reached after
                  having observed the robot in
                  action.

                            calvin
                  there is a design flaw in the
                  robot. its programming is
                  advanced, but unstable, leaving the
                  three laws in a grave imbalance.

                            aronson
                  in your expert opinion, what
                  measures should be taken regarding
                  the device?

     calvin.    staring straight ahead.   avoiding spooner's eye.

                            calvin
                  the robot must be destroyed.

     spooner can't believe what he's just heard. about to speak
     up when toller grabs his arm. squeezing it. hard.

     judge drexel has heard enough.    decides.

                            judge drexel
                  the robot in question will be
                  transferred to a u.s. robotics
                  facility where it can be properly
                  examined to ensure an imbalance of
                  this sort never occurs again. no
                  one goes near it except qualified
                  u.s.r. personnel. when the
                  examination is complete, the robot
                  is to be destroyed.

     starts getting up from his chair.    already done with this.

                            robot bailiff
                  this hearing is adjourned!

     a burst of conversation as the screen blips off. the u.s.r.
     camp, looking especially pleased. spooner. catching
     calvin's eye briefly. as lanning leads her towards the exit,
     his hand on her back.
