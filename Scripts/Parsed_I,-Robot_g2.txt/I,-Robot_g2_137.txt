138   int. low-traffic hallway - u.s. robotics - night               138

      spooner heading down a hallway.    his gun, still pressed to
      the door robot's side...

                                                               90.


      calvin. suddenly appearing at the end of the hallway. stops
      dead in her tracks. completely surprised to see him there.

                           calvin
                 detective! what are you doing?!...
                     (to door robot)
                 de-activate.

      the door robot, goes rigid.   spooner, hurries over to her.
      they start moving.

                           calvin
                 you're making a mistake...

                           spooner
                 just got another visit from u.s.
                 robotics. that was the mistake.
                 this was murder, no doubt about it -
                 - and the killer wants
                 hogenmiller's robot to take the
                 fall. that's why the call came
                 directly to me. someone wanted me
                 on this case.

                           calvin
                 it's too late. you can't stop the
                 execution.

                           spooner
                 sorry. i'm not "programmed" to
                 take no for an answer.

      they reach another door.   calvin.   looking around.   scans her
      i.d.

                           calvin
                 this way...

      she leads them across. to another door.    quickly opens it.
      spooner. charges through...
