81   ext. platform - continuous                                      81

     ...the platform. commuters. screaming at the sight of him.
     a couple security guards. rushing towards him...

     spooner. getting to his feet. shoving them out of the way
     as he starts running. towards...

     those same circular stairs.    looks over the edge and spots...

     the maintenance robot.   down at street level.   getting away.

     spooner. looks around. spots a light pole.       paralleling the
     stairs. takes a step back and...

     leaps out onto the pole. hooking his arm around it. sliding
     down like a fireman's pole. gaining speed when thump! his
     shoes hit pavement...
