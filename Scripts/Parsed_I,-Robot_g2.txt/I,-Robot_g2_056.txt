57   ext. hogenmiller's house - day                                57

     dr. hogenmiller's house. small. simple. built on a huge
     rock promontory overlooking the city. three demolition
     robots rolling towards it. huge, mashing, sporting massive
     hydraulic pounders.

     spooner's car. screeches to a stop. he jumps out. races
     over to the nearest machine. looking around -- no people.

                          spooner
                    (to robot)
                what are you doing?!

     a screen. blinks to life on the hulking chassis.    a
     disembodied voice...

                          demolition robot
                demolition ordered...

                          spooner
                who authorised this?

                          demolition robot
                demolition ordered...

     spooner reaches into his coat.    pulling out his police badge.
     scans it over the screen.

                                                                51.


                          spooner
                override. this is police business.
                vacate the premises immediately.

                          demolition robot
                    (beat)
                affirmative.

     the screen. blinks off.     spooner.   eyeing it.   turns and
     heads for the house.
