37   int./ext. spooner's car (moving) - city underpass - night   37

     spooner's car races down a ramp and the roadway becomes a 16-
     lane underground tunnel system. a river of headlights
     stretches forever in either direction.

     a control beam locks onto the car, guiding it to a merge with
     traffic. spooner hits the override button -- and switches to
     manual. calvin watches him take the wheel. shakes her head.

                          calvin
                that should be outlawed once and
                for all.

                          spooner
                that'll be the day i stop driving.

     spooner jams the gas pedal and the tunnel becomes a blur.
     calvin holds onto the dashboard. looking a little pale.

                          calvin
                i can recommend a behavior
                modification program, you know --
                if you want to overcome your robo-
                phobia.

                          spooner
                i'm not afraid of robots.   i just
                don't like them.

                          calvin
                why? because they make every
                aspect of our lives more
                convenient?

                          spooner
                exactly. they do our dirty work.
                ever do hard labor, doctor? gets
                pretty old, pretty fast. nobody
                can do someone else's dirty work
                without coming to hate them. i
                don't want to be around when your
                robots decide they've taken their
                last order.

                                                              31.


                          calvin
                that day will never come,
                detective. robots aren't like
                human beings -- they don't question
                their existence.

     spooner cranks the gear shift.    throwing her a look.

                          spooner
                spoken like a true robo-phile.
