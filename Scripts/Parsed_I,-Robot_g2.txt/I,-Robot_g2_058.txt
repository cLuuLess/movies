     inside, the main room is spare, untidy. cups of cold coffee,
     littering surfaces. a cot, in the corner.

     on the walls, crooked certificates. heinrich hogenmiller's
     name written out in academic script. advanced degrees in the
     study of robotics, physics, chemistry, neurology, ethics. an
     award on the mantelpiece. a silver ns-2. tarnished.

     spooner. opening up a couple drawers of a side table.
     jumbles of papers. clippings. old text books. then a

     spooner furrows his brow.

     when something suddenly rubs against his leg. he startles.
     looks down: a cat. lonely. standing next to its automatic
     feeder. spooner pockets the picture. starts heading down...
