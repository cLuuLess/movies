11   int. police h.q. - homicide unit - morning                    11

     a vast open plan situation room lined on one side by a series
     of glass-enclosed rooms. on the other side a giant screen
     with real time video of various streets and buildings.

     spooner arrives at his desk. unlike the others, it's a mess.
     a slender computer screen curving along the front of it.
     several electronic messages say the same thing:

                             see me!

                          lt. bergin (o.s.)
                ever heard the phrase "lead by
                example?"

     spooner looks up. lieutenant john bergin stands in front of
     his desk, holding up a citation with a photo of spooner
     giving that traffic signal the finger.

                          spooner
                doesn't ring a bell.

                          lt. bergin
                    (pointing to spooner's
                     badge)
                it's on your badge.

     spooner takes the citation.   drops it into a drawer filled
     with about fifty others.

                          lt. bergin
                the traffic division filed an
                official complaint this morning.

                          spooner
                the traffic division is a machine.

                          lt. bergin
                look, i know there's going to be an
                adjustment period, del...

                          spooner
                    (interrupting)
                i'll send them a letter of apology.
                maybe some flowers. a box of
                chocolates...

                                                               5.


     just then spooner's phone rings.   he throws bergin a look.
     then snatches up the receiver.

                          spooner
                spooner, homicide.

                                                 cut to:
