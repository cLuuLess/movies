129   int./ext. spooner's car - continuous                             129

      spooner. watching the ball of fire in his rearview mirror.
      his car. badly battered. metal crunching. tires
      screeching...

      spooner.     holding on. as his car. continues to break up.
      listing.     rocking. bits and pieces. flying off. when it
      finally.     comes to a stop.

      spooner's shoulders, slump.    then.   he hears a rumbling
      sound. turns around...

      the second u.s.r. truck.    barreling towards him...

      spooner. trapped. like a nightmare.      desperately.     starts
      kicking at the windshield. no go...

      the truck.    racing towards him...

      spooner lunges his weight.    into the side door.   giving it.
      everything he's got...

      the truck...getting closer...closer...its engine...roaring...

      the side door.    finally gives.   spooner pours out...
