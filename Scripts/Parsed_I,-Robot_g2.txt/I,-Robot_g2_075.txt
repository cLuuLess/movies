     a soft whirring.   as sonny turns to calvin.

                          sonny
                i didn't pay much attention. he
                would spend hours looking for his
                eyeglasses and they would be...

                          calvin
                    (finishing for him)
                ...right on top of his head.

     sonny nods. she knows him well, too. calvin swallows.

                           calvin
                     (getting to her feet)
                 but, sir, i was just...

                           robertson
                     (interrupting)
                 i said i think we're done.

     calvin.   not misreading.   the threatening undertone.

                                               cut back to:
