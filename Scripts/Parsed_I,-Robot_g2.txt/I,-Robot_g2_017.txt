18   int. hogenmiller's lab - day                                   18

     ...enter hogenmiller's lab. alive with activity. crime
     scene technicians, mobile analysis units. light scans,
     running across...

     hogenmiller's lifeless face.   black gun powder.   fanning out
     around his contorted lips.

     spooner. throws a look around the lab: robots. everywhere.
     mostly incomplete. torsos. arms. legs. dangling from the
     ceiling. a sergeant. passes them by...

                          sergeant
                they say the price's gonna come
                down a lot next year. kinda cool,
                huh?

                          spooner
                how cool will it be when one takes
                your job?

     spooner.   pushing past him.   his eyes.   darting around.

                          calvin
                is everything alright, detective?

                          spooner
                yeah. this is just how i like my
                robots -- in pieces.

     as they approach hogenmiller's body, the lead crime scene
     investigator, baldez, gets up to meet them.

                          baldez
                    (to spooner)
                can you believe it, man? u.s.
                robotics. i didn't think i'd ever
                see the inside of this building.

     hands spooner, a plasma clipboard.   spooner signs it,
     awkwardly. with his left hand...

                          spooner
                what's the run-down?

                          baldez
                heinrich hogenmiller, sixty-four
                years old. weapon a small caliber
                .22, registered in his name. looks
                like he walked in, locked the door,
                and snuffed himself.

                                                       12.


spooner.   cocking his head to look at hogenmiller's face.

                      spooner
            i know someone who disagrees with
            you.

                       baldez
            who?

spooner.   stands.   pointing down at hogenmiller.

                       spooner
            him.

and steps over the body, leaving a confused baldez.
stepping deeper, into the lab. calvin. following.

                      spooner
            i spoke to a dead man today.   want
            to tell me about that?

                      calvin
            dr. hogenmiller's hologram took his
            appointments. attended staff
            meetings. he hated corporate life.
            the hologram enabled him to focus
            on his work. it's just a device,
            detective.

                      spooner
            a device that called the police.

                      calvin
            the sound of the gunshot would've
            triggered a 911.

                      spooner
            but the call came directly to me.

                      calvin
            we're talking about a mechanism
            designed by hogenmiller to say
            provocative things. to irritate
            and confound his colleagues.

                      spooner
            and that's what you think it is?

                      calvin
            i'm sorry, but this whole
            investigation is the result of a
            dead man's toy messing with your
            head.

                                                       13.


they pass half a robot, hanging from a hook. spooner curls
his lip. swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at
him.

                      spooner
            when's the last time any of you
            actually spoke to hogenmiller? i
            mean human to human?

                      calvin
            i couldn't say.

                      spooner
            take a guess.

                      calvin
            i don't guess, detective. but if
            pressed, i would reason it had been
            a considerable length of time.

                      spooner
            how well did you know him?

calvin.   gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had
been.

                      calvin
            not well. but i admired his work
            tremendously.

spooner. studies her for a beat. then turns back to the
body. two coroners entering with a high-tech body box.

                      spooner
            i get the whole "mad scientist"
            thing. hogenmiller was past his
            prime. isolated. eccentric. he
            enters a room. locks the door and
            is found minutes later with a
            bullet fired through his mouth into
            his brain. everything about this
            case says suicide.

                      calvin
            you don't sound convinced.

the coroners.   start loading the body into the box.

                      spooner
            even people who live a life of
            logic and precision rarely arrange
            their deaths so perfectly.
                (turning to her)
                      (more)

                                                             14.


                          spooner (cont'd)
                what all this is missing -- is
                personality...

     as he starts for the door...

                          spooner
                you have 24 hour surveillance?...
