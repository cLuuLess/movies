     the robot suspect takes its chance.     runs full out.   stops.

     bergin is standing in front of a solid wall of police cars.
     uniformed officers are aiming specialised rifles at the
     robot. flashing lights reflecting off its metal surface.

     the robot turns to spooner.     extends its hands.   palms out.

                          robot
                what am i?

     spooner is surprised. a police officer fires, rubberised
     netting shooting out at sonny. a second officer fires and a
     second net covers him. then a third...

     ...and the robot falls to the ground, struggling.

     calvin glares at spooner.    furious.   hurt.   betrayed.

                          calvin
                we had a deal.

     but spooner doesn't look at her.    his eyes are locked on that
     robot.
