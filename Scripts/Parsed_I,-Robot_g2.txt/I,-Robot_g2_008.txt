9   ext. city scape/monorail - continuous                           9

    the train hurtling toward downtown. soaring, gravity-defying
    office buildings dominate the skyline. older buildings
    wedged among the new. all protected by huge glass and steel
    shields.

    as we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to
    disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels.
    the "old" streets have become huge, spacious plazas.

                                                             4.
