33   int. police h.q. - homicide unit - day                         33

     spooner, standing in front of an assemblage of cops. behind
     him, an image of the robot suspect plays on the screen...

                            spooner
                  ...junkyard, scrapyard, and salvage
                  yard, anywhere it could hide.

     behind him, flashing images of the city streets and dumps...

                            spooner
                  it's got a bullet hole above the
                  right knee, so be on the look-out
                  for any malfunctioning ns-2...

     lieutenant bergin enters the back of the room.     next to him,
     assistant d.a. toller. not looking happy.

                            spooner
                  check out all retail outlets and
                  repair shops, especially the
                  underground ones...

     the screen behind him compartmentalises, showing various
     dubious shop fronts...

                            spooner
                  i don't care who you have to get
                  past to get this done. just get it
                  done.

     the cops, begin dispersing. as bergin catches spooner's eye.
     spooner, not pleased to see toller. heads over...

                                                         26.


                     toller
           looking like shit, spooner.

                     spooner
           well i'm not the one always giving
           press conferences...

bergin puts a hand on spooner's arm.   knows he's not going to
like this.

                     lt. bergin
           del, we're going to have to
           reclassify the search. d.a.'s
           office is seeing this ns-2 as
           "missing evidence" -- not a
           homicide suspect.

                      spooner
           what?

                     toller
           homicide is the murder of a human
           being by another human being.
           therefore, a robot cannot be
           charged with "homicide."

                     spooner
           this isn't just any robot...

                     toller
           it's malfunctioning.

                     spooner
           it killed someone. that
           registering with you?

spooner.   shakes off bergin's arm.   eyeballs toller.

                     spooner
           how many shares of u.s.r. you
           holding in your portfolio, toller?

                     toller
           this is a public safety issue.

                     spooner
           that's convenient.

                     toller
           you have any idea what would happen
           to this city if we went running
           around screaming "killer robot?"
           it would collapse in on itself.
                     (more)

                                                                 27.


                            toller (cont'd)
                  wide-spread panic. until that ns-
                  2's found we're cooperating with
                  u.s. robotics and keeping this
                  investigation under wraps.

                            lt. bergin
                  maybe this isn't the case for you,
                  del.

     incensed, spooner replies a little louder than he intended.

                              spooner
                  i'm fine!

     rakes his hand through his hair. turns to see the other
     cops, looking over at him. toller smirks. looks to bergin.

                            toller
                  i want updated reports every half
                  hour.

     heads off.    spooner.   watching him.

                            spooner
                  this is it, you know. from now on
                  we're going to miss the good old
                  days.

                            lt. bergin
                  good old days?

                            spooner
                  when people were killed by other
                  people.
