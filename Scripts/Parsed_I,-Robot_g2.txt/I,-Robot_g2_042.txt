43   int. factory floor - night                                       43

     a storage compartment opens and 101 ns-2s march out in tight
     formation. every step and swing of the arm in unison. the
     sound of metal footsteps reverberating through the plant as
     101 robots organise themselves into long straight lines.

     spooner and calvin look up and down the formation. they all
     look alike. spooner. throws up his hands.

                           spooner
                     (to calvin)
                 you're the robot shrink.

     the robots stand motionless.     a strange tableau.   calvin.
     takes a step forward.

                                                          33.


                     calvin
           there is a robot in this formation
           that does not belong. identify it.

101 robots answer in unison.    their mechanical voices
resounding:

                     101 robots
           one of us.

                     calvin
           which one?

                     101 robots
           one of us.

                     calvin
           that is not a satisfactory answer!

                     101 robots
           one of us.

                     spooner
           that's helpful.

                     calvin
           i could always interview each one
           individually and cross-reference
           their responses to detect any
           anomalies.

                     spooner
           how long would that take?

                     calvin
           about three weeks.

they share a look. clearly not an option.      then.   calvin.
gets an idea. turns to spooner...

                      calvin
           or...

...and grabs his gun from his holster.   he jumps back.

                     calvin
           we have one hundred robots here
           that cannot allow a human being to
           come to harm...

their eyes lock.   spooner, getting what she's doing.

                                                           34.


                       spooner
             and one that can.

she raises the gun to spooner's head.    hand, unsteady.

                       calvin
             am i holding this right?

                       spooner
             more or less.

calvin.    swallows.   looks over at the robots.   then cocks the
gun...

and the robots come thundering towards them. like a row of
linebackers. arms straight out. their footsteps deafening.
coming closer and closer...

when calvin. lowers the gun. the robots. all stop in
unison. immediately returning to their resting positions.

spooner and calvin stare out. every one of the robots moved.
standing right in front of them, like metal statues.

spooner.    has had enough.   takes the gun back from calvin...

                       spooner
             enough game-playing.

...and bam! blows the head off of the nearest robot.       its
body crumples to the ground.

                       spooner
             guess that wasn't it.

calvin. cannot believe what he just did.     rushes over to the
destroyed robot.

                       calvin
             what are you doing?!

spooner walks down the row, holding his gun in plain view.

                       spooner
                 (calling out)
             this is a self-preservation field
             test! do not attempt to save
             yourselves. any of you. that's an
             order!

from the control booth the night foreman screams over the
p.a.:

                                                             35.


                          night foreman
                are you crazy? those are eight
                hundred thousand dollar machines!

     spooner randomly stops at another robot.    raises his gun.

                          spooner
                you hear that? you're worth more
                than i'll make in my entire life...

     his finger tightening on the trigger when calvin suddenly
     grabs his arm.

                          calvin
                you can't just destroy them!

     spooner. looking down at her. when suddenly something
     catches his eye. a movement. down the line. almost.
     imperceptible.

     he jerks his head.   locking eyes with a robot.   a couple feet
     away. it's him!

                          spooner
                gotcha.

     the robot suspect leaps forward. grabbing onto the railing
     of an overhead catwalk. his movements almost balletic as he
     swings himself up...

     spooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the
     robot launches himself through the control booth window with
     a terrific crash...
