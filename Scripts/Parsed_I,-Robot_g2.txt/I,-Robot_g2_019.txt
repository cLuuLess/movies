20   int. elevator - day                                              20

     spooner and calvin descend. victor floats on the wall and
     smiles wide. spooner looks back at it. with a frown.

     the elevator stops, the doors open.    a robot steps on.

                          robot
                good day, dr. calvin.   good day,
                sir.

     spooner's jaw. clenches. staring at the robot.       it senses
     the stare. turns back to him.

                          robot
                may i be of service to you, sir?

     spooner. breaks the stare.     ignoring the robot.   calvin.
     looks over at him.

                          calvin
                aren't you going to answer him?

                          spooner
                i don't talk to my refrigerator,
                either.

     calvin folds her arms.

                          calvin
                i get the distinct feeling you're
                one of those people, detective.

                          spooner
                what people?

                          calvin
                those who don't appreciate the work
                we do here at u.s.r.

                          spooner
                you people do what you do. then
                it's up to the rest of us to make
                sense out of the world we wake up
                in.

     as the elevator doors open on to...

                                                           16.
