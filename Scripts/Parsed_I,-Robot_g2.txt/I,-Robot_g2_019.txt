     ...they head out into the hallway.    a mechanical door guard
     rolling into place behind them.

     calvin. hurrying to keep up with him. this is hardly how
     she wanted to spend her morning. calls out into the air...

                          calvin
                victor!

     at the end of the corridor, near the elevator, a bright
     circle appears. hovering just in front of the wall. two
     small slits grow into round black eyes...and a thin mouth
     expands into an enormous smile.

                          calvin
                detective, meet victor. our
                building's supercomputer. he's the
                checks and balances of u.s.r.
                    (to victor)
                victor, detective spooner's heading
                up the investigation into the death
                of dr. hogenmiller.

     victor smiles big.   spooner, furrows his brow.

                          spooner
                you look like a very...happy
                computer.

     victor responds in a gentle male voice:

                          victor
                thank you. that's very kind.

                          calvin
                the detective needs to see our
                security tapes.

                                                                15.


     the elevator doors immediately open.   they step inside.
