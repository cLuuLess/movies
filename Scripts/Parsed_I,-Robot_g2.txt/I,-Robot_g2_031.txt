31   int. subterranean level 5 - continuous                          31

     ...subterranean level 5. a labyrinth of metal and concrete.
     in the distance. a troupe of security personnel swarms
     around a closed elevator door...

                                                          24.


                     victor
           the suspect is about to be
           apprehended, detective.

                     spooner
           i'll believe it when i see it.

spooner. cocking his gun.   a soft ding!    announcing the
elevator car's arrival.

security, all crouching down in unison.    weapons brought
round to position.

spooner. weaving through them.   gun pointed at the metal
doors as...

whoosh. they slide open. revealing a robot. standing
under the light. holding a gun. it steps out as security
takes aim and...

                     spooner
           wait!

spooner pushes past them to the robot.    looks down at its
leg. unscathed.

                     spooner
           this is not the same robot!

looking wildly around. goddammit. bounds towards an exit as
calvin steps forward to question the robot.

                     calvin
               (to robot)
           what happened to the robot that
           ordered you to hold this firearm?

                     elevator robot
           this unit is not programmed to obey
           an order given by a robot...

                     calvin
           but who gave you this gun?

spooner. running towards the exit.    hears the answer.
echoing behind him...

                     elevator robot
           a metal man.

                                                              25.
