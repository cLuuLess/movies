     bam! he bursts out into the plaza in front of u.s. robotics.
     squinting into the light. then plunging into the crowd...

     human...robot...human...robot...they all look the same from
     behind. spooner running. through the sea of man and
     machine. when someone. starts to scream. at the sight of
     his gun. the crowd begins scattering. chaos. spooner
     stops. near a fountain. turning 360. looking everywhere...

     the robot.   gone.

                            spooner (v.o.)
                  ...i want a homicide unit on every
                  street, sidewalk, alley...
