     spooner and calvin rush in to find the night foreman hiding
     under his desk. glass everywhere. an alarm screaming. the
     door on the other side, barely hanging off a hinge.

     spooner hurries forward. then stops. turning to calvin.
     reaches down for his back-up gun and presses it into her
     hand.

                          spooner
                you don't know what's going to
                happen in there.

     as if admitting defeat. calvin's fingers, wrapping around
     the gun. as spooner leads them to the door and down into...

                                                             36.
