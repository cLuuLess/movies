      spooner. bursting through the entry doors. hurtling over a
      turnstile banner. coming face to face with a u.s. robotics
      door robot.

                                                              89.


                           door robot
                 good evening, sir. may i see your
                 identification card?

                           spooner
                     (out of breath)
                 sure.

      spooner whips out his gun.   presses it into the robot's
      chest.

                 blow a hole through your mechanical
                 guts, do you?

                            door robot
                 no, sir.

                           spooner
