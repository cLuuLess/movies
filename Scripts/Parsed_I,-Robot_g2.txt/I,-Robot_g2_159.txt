160   int. plush conference room - u.s. robotics - night             160

      spooner sits down at that same long table with hogenmiller's
      hologram. it casually takes a sip of coffee.

                            hologram
                 so.   you found out who killed me.

                           spooner
                 i started to wonder about victor
                 the second i met him.

                           hologram
                 why is that, detective?

                           spooner
                 too much access. too much
                 knowledge. plus -- he smiled
                 whenever your death was mentioned.
                 those models are programmed to
                 frown at bad news.

                           hologram
                 hah! then even in this day and
                 age, catching the killer all comes
                 down to pure instinct!

      spooner smiles. but his eyes are troubled.      he gets up.
      walks over to the window. stares out...
