83   ext. public plaza - continuous                                  83

     ...back out onto the public plaza.    sees the robot heading
     towards a set of...

                                                                63.


     escalated stairs. the robot. judging the height. lunges
     into the air and lands on a stair. denting it. reaches the
     bottom. disappearing. into a crowd of even more people...

     spooner. racing down the stairs. taking them. four at a
     time. hits the ground running. looking. everywhere.
     suddenly losing track. of where the robot went...

     then. catching sight. just ahead. of a robot.         staring
     back at him. holding something. in its hand...

     spooner.   plunges into the crowd.    waving his gun.

                          spooner
                everyone out of the way!

     screaming. people scattering. as bam! bam! spooner fires.
     hitting the robot in its head and back. it drops to the
     ground. spooner. racing over to it. sees. it's not the
     same robot. in its hand, a specialised screwdriver...

                          owner
                what the hell do you think you're
                doing?!...

     its owner. rushing over. shoving spooner aside. but
     spooner's. not listening. spotting. a drop of hydraulic
     fluid nearby...

     lunges forward.   following.    the drops.   running faster.     and
     faster...

                           owner
                hey!

     ...through the crowd. police sirens. in the background.          as
     spooner. shoves through. tracking those drops. like a
     bloodhound. turns...
