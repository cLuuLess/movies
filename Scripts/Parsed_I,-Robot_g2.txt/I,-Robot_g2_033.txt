34   int./ext. spooner's car - city street - dusk                      34

     spooner. rolling along in his car.       eyes, bloodshot.
     peering out the window:

     an ns-2 model robot laden with shopping bags, following its
     owner down the sidewalk...

     another robot, opening the door at a hotel for guests...

     a couple hauling robots, loading heavy boxes onto the back of
     a truck...

     spooner.     rubs his eyes.   turns a corner and spots:

     a robot repair shop.

                                                           28.


     the latest models in the window. shiny. streamlined.
     spooner watches as a woman leads her faulty ns-2 to the
     service entrance.

     he stops the car.
