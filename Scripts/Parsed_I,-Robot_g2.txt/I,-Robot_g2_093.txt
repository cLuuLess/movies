94   int. spooner's apartment - continuous                           94

     the sound of his agonised scream. follows us back into the
     present. spooner. clenching. his artificial arm.

                            spooner
                  the robot pulled me out of the
                  wreck. but left my arm behind.
                      (holds up arm)
                  i woke up four weeks later with
                  this.

     calvin.    taking in the story.

                            calvin
                  and that's why robots terrify you?

                            spooner
                  let's just say they make me
                  uncomfortable.
                      (pulls out pills)
                  i take these if i get too
                  uncomfortable. doesn't exactly
                  lend me a lot of credibility on the
                  force.

                            calvin
                  but it doesn't mean you're wrong
                  about this case.

     calvin. sits down on the couch.     pulling her hands through
     her hair.

                                                            71.


                       calvin
             i don't believe sonny did it
             either.

                       spooner
             what?

                       calvin
             i think about what hogenmiller must
             have wanted. robots with the same
             cognitive and emotional abilities
             as humans. but not just
             simulations. i don't know. when i
             was talking to sonny i was forced
             to put away all the things i've
             ever known -- the three laws, the
             rules of programming, basic science
             and engineering.
                 (beat)
             sonny's the most advanced robot
             i've ever encountered, detective.
             it's almost as if...he cared for
             dr. hogenmiller. i just don't
             believe he's capable of murder.

spooner.    looking down at her.   can hardly believe it.

                       spooner
             you mean the great dr. calvin is
             basing all this on a feeling?

calvin.    smiling ironically.

                       calvin
             that and the fact that robertson
             didn't want me interviewing sonny
             for any more than five minutes.

spooner. suddenly rejuvenated by having an ally. strides
over to his coat. pulling out the metal nameplate:
s.o.n.n.y.

                       spooner
             ever seen this before?

                       calvin
             no.

                       spooner
             i found it at hogenmiller's house.
             right before the demolition crew
             tried to make me part of the
             foundation.

                                                                72.


     calvin takes a deep breath.   making a decision...

                          calvin
                come on -- there's someone who
                might be able to tell us...
