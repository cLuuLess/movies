     spooner sitting up in his bed. rubbing his wrists. the
     metal clams, released. lt. bergin. standing next to him.

                                                      66.


                     spooner
           don't people go to medical school
           any more?

                     lt. bergin
           this is one of the best units in
           the city, del.

one of the medical robots turns to spooner with some pills.
spooner. stares it down. grabs his clothes.

                     spooner
               (sotto)
           there's some real shit going on
           here, john.

he looks around.    jumping off the bed.

                     spooner
           i went to hogenmiller's house --
           there was a u.s.r. demolition crew
           there. they overrode my police
           i.d. tried to tear down the house
           with me in it...

                       lt. bergin
           del...

spooner pulls on his pants.

                     spooner
           ...then when i went to the monorail
           a maintenance 10 pushed me onto the
           tracks...

                       lt. bergin
           del...

                     spooner
           i had to chase it all across the
           plaza...

                       lt. bergin
           del.

spooner.   stops talking.   looks at bergin.

                     lt. bergin
           hogenmiller scheduled that
           demolition crew, it was apparently
           a proviso in his will. and they
           showed no police i.d. on their
           scanner...

                                                              67.


     spooner.   trying to look away...

                          lt. bergin
                witnesses at the monorail said you
                fell onto the tracks. that you
                shot at a fix-it robot on the plaza
                and that you were found alone in
                the alley. there was no
                maintenance 10.

                          spooner
                what?! john -- that's what they
                want you to believe!
                    (remembering)
                a robot clean-up crew was there --
                it must have cleared away the
                maintenance 10! and there was
                another robot that tried to drug
                me!

                          lt. bergin
                that was an emt model.

     spooner.   sees the look on bergin's face.

                          spooner
                you're giving me that look. that
                treat-him-delicately-he's-coming-
                unhinged-look. i don't need that
                look, john. i need you to hear
                what i'm saying.

     lt. bergin.   embarrassed for him.   has about had it.

                          lt. bergin
                you came back too soon, del.
                you're back on leave. effective
                immediately.

     spooner.   staring at him.   betrayed.   turns and grabs his
     coat.
