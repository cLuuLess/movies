14   int. u.s. robotics - plush conference room - continuous        14

     a warm, mahogany-paneled room. in sharp contrast to the cold
     metal space outside. spooner steps inside. at the end of a
     long conference table sits an old man. sparkling blue eyes.
     old-fashioned suit.

                          old man
                hello, there. please come in.

     spooner hesitates.

                          old man
                it's alright. you can sit.     sit.

     spooner doesn't.   looks around the room. the old man lifts
     up a coffee pot.   pours some coffee into a single cup.

                          old man
                coffee?

                          spooner
                    (interested)
                you're offering me a cup of coffee?

                          old man
                yes. but you are to say, "no,
                thank you."

     spooner nods a little. the old man raises the coffee to his
     lips, but doesn't take a sip.

                                                       6.


                       old man
           coffee?

                       spooner
           no.    thank you.

                     old man
           as you wish.

the old man takes a sip. he doesn't move. there is no
movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee
pot.

                     spooner
           you want to tell me something about
           dr. hogenmiller? about his death?

the old man smiles.

                     old man
           i want to tell you that his death
           was not a suicide.

                     spooner
           and why do you say that?

                      old man
           why?   because i want you to know
           it.

                     spooner
           i understand that. but what
           specifically leads you to believe
           that he didn't commit suicide?

                     old man
               (considers)
           nothing specifically.

spooner shifts his weight.   agitated.

                     spooner
           under normal circumstances that
           wouldn't be enough to get you a
           homicide investigation.

                     old man
           but this is not "normal
           circumstances," is it, detective
           spooner?

                       spooner
           no.    it isn't.

                                                               7.


                          old man
                then you will find out who killed
                dr. hogenmiller, yes? and then you
                will tell me.

     spooner's losing his patience.

                          spooner
                if you were murdered, doctor, i'll
                find out. and you'll be the first
                to know.....

     just then the hologram of dr. hogenmiller vanishes in a burst
     of light, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the
     conference room. spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in
     front of a large view screen inside a small metal chamber.
