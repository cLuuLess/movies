16   int. u.s. robotics - corporate boardroom - day                  16

     two large doors emblazoned with the u.s. robotics logo open
     automatically. inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom
     looking out over the entire complex.

     spooner walks through the doorway. his escort robot trailing
     behind him. an army of corporate types sit around a
     conference table. young. energetic. you can practically
     feel the brains and ambition.

                          spooner
                usually i ask who's in charge...

     spooner's eyes lock with a man sitting at the head of the
     table. 60s, handsome, charismatic. dr. lance robertson,
     founder and ceo of u.s. robotics.

                                                         8.


                      spooner
            but everyone knows you, dr.
            robertson.

robertson smiles.   pretends to instruct his people.

                      robertson
            remind me to cut back on my talk
            show appearances.

laughter.

                      robertson
            welcome to u.s. robotics,
            detective. i regret you're not
            visiting us under more pleasant
            circumstances. allow me to
            introduce mr. aronson, our head of
            legal affairs.

a prematurely graying man leaning against the wall.    nods
hello.

                      robertson
            and the gentleman to my right is
            dr. alfred lanning, director of
            research.

alfred lanning, only one there in a tie.   nods.

                      robertson
            they'll be available to answer any
            questions you might have during
            your investigation. you'll
            understand how anxious we are to
            resolve this matter -- especially
            before the press gets wind of it.
            there are some anti-robot
            sentiments out there as you know,
            detective, and we're not eager to
            stir them up. so. where would you
            like to begin?

                      spooner
            we can begin with whether or not
            the old man put a gun to his head
            and pulled the trigger.

a palpable wave of tension shoots through the group.

                      aronson
            you don't have to answer that, dr.
            robertson...

                                                          9.


robertson waves him off.

                      robertson
           susan?   perhaps you can assist us
           here?

everyone looks down at the other end of the table. a beat.
then an attractive young woman gets to her feet. susan
calvin. hair tucked behind her ears. looking at everyone
but spooner.

                     calvin
           dr. hogenmiller was a schizoid
           personality who generally eschewed
           social relationships. rejecting
           people in favor of solitary
           activities involving machines. he
           spent almost all his time at the
           lab here or at his lab at home. as
           a result he was highly susceptible
           to depression.

                     robertson
           dr. calvin is our chief
           psychologist.

                     spooner
           if that was your diagnosis, why
           didn't you see this coming?

calvin turns. finally meeting spooner's eye.      as if the
answer's obvious.

                     calvin
           this is u.s. robotics, detective.
           seventy-five percent of our
           employees fit that description.

                     lanning
               (interceding)
           you'll have to excuse the doctor.
           we're all a little on edge. this
           has been a difficult and emotional
           morning.

spooner throws a look around the room.   then back at calvin.

                       spooner
           yeah.    i can see you're all broken
           up.

robertson responds to spooner's skepticism.

                                                           10.


                          robertson
                dr. hogenmiller was at my side from
                the very beginnings of this
                company. we developed the "three
                laws of robotics" together. but
                these days science is a young man's
                game. by the time you hit thirty
                your best years are behind you.
                some of us are kicked upstairs.
                others i'm afraid aren't so lucky.

     robertson stands.   meeting over.

                          robertson
                dr. hogenmiller took his own life.
                i trust you will come to the same
                swift conclusion, detective. dr.
                lanning will make himself available
                if you have any further questions.

     spooner looks over at calvin.

                          spooner
                i want her to help me.

     calvin, unhappy with this arrangement.

                          calvin
                that's not really my department...

                          robertson
                    (pointed)
                susan would be happy to assist you.

     and with a gesture, robertson dismisses everyone. people
     start getting up, gathering up, filing out. susan calvin.
     the last one to get up.
