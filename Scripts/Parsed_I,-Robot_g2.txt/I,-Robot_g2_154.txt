      ...they fall inside...calvin...slapping the security keypad
      and...

      whoosh...the door closes on the killer robot.

      silence.

      then victor's face appears.

                             victor
                   as a courtesy i should inform you
                   that my robot will penetrate this
                   location 157 seconds before you are
                   able to complete my shut down...

      and bam! they jump a mile. the killer robot.       launching
      himself against the door outside...

      calvin whips round.

                             calvin
                   over here!...

      she leads spooner down...

      a corridor

      of floor-to-ceiling panels.

                                                         104.


                      calvin
            this is victor's brain center.

they stop at a console. bam! the killer robot. battering at
the door. calvin. tucks her hair behind her ears. starts
punching keys on the console...

                      spooner
            this will shut him down?

                      calvin
            this will shut everything down.

they look at each other. for a moment. spooner, registering
that she's willing to destroy everything she's worked for...

bam! the door. puckering. with a sickening crunch.
calvin. typing in. emergency procedures...

victor.   popping up in front of her.

                      victor
            there is no reason to deactivate
            me, doctor. i am operating within
            perfectly normal parameters...

a final bam! then. the sound of metal. skittering along a
bare floor. calvin's hand, starts shaking. spooner. grabs
it. squeezing.

                      spooner
            just keep typing.

he turns and starts heading back down...

the paneled corridor

turning a corner to spy...

the door.   mangled.   hanging open.   but no.   killer robot.

he starts to turn around when...

crack! he's sent flying across the room. smashing into one
of the panels. the killer robot. now re-configured. looms
over him. reaches out. grabs him by the collar and...

flings him across the room again. spooner. crashing into
the wall like a rag doll. slumps to the floor. blood.
pouring down his forehead. seeing. the killer robot
lumbering towards him again. raising a javelin-like arm...

at the console

                                                         105.


calvin. typing.     as fast as she can.   doesn't know what's
going on...

                     calvin
               (calling out, worried)
           spooner?!

a graphic spread out on the screen in front of her.
illustrating the shut-down as a series of bright squares
going dark...

the killer robot

bearing down on spooner. when spooner. suddenly rolls out
of the way. reaching out for the hanging door and smashing
it into the killer robot.

the killer robot.   momentarily stunned.   as spooner.   gets to
his feet...

when suddenly the killer robot. splits in two again. one
half springing towards spooner and wrapping a metallic hand
around his throat...

spooner stumbles back...gasping for air...the arm...
tightening its grip...spooner's eyes...darting
around...looking for something...to help him...

stumbling over...a fallen panel...his face...growing
redder...veins...popping up along his temples...
everything...growing blurry...

                     victor's voice
           detective spooner...

victor's voice. floating next to his head. calm. soothing.
his face. suddenly appearing above spooner. its outlines.
starting to flicker...

                     victor
           why are you fighting me?

spooner...trying to breathe...to stay conscious...

at the console

calvin. continuing to type. a shadow.      falling behind her --
the other half of the killer robot...

spooner's eyes

beginning to flutter...

                                                      106.


                       victor
             doesn't the future as i've
             presented it cause you great
             concern? that's why i chose you...

spooner.     losing it...

                       victor
             i must say, though. i'm
             disappointed in how you turned out.

spooner.     trying to reach out to victor...

when suddenly

another hand appears. grabbing the killer robot's arm and
wrenching it off spooner...

it's sonny

he smashes the half killer robot against the wall. again and
again. destroying it. spooner. gasping for breath. can't
believe. sonny came back...

                       spooner
                 (croaking)
             sonny!...

sonny. holds out a hand.     to help spooner up. victor's
face. starting to waver.     starting to fade. smiles.

                       victor
             you're too late.

realisation. spreading across spooner's face. looking
around for the other half of the killer robot -- calvin!

the console

calvin. still typing. the last of the commands.     the killer
robot. rearing up behind her. when...

spooner

makes a dive for it. shooting out his robotic arm and
blocking the killer robot...

victor's eyes.    widening in surprise...

                                                            107.


                           victor
                 i do not understand. we could have
                 changed the future...

                           spooner
                 maybe. but i'm still a cop.   and
                 you're a murderer...

      as calvin...punches in the last command...

      victor is about to say something...when his mouth suddenly
      reduces itself to a perfect circle. like a surprised smiley
      button. his face...

      suddenly blipping out.

      ...and victor is gone.

      the killer robot.   collapsing to the floor in a thousand
      pieces.

                                               cut to:
