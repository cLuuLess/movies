101   ext. plaza - night                                             101

      spooner. walking across the plaza. throwing a look over his
      shoulder. at the looming u.s.r. facade.

      pulls sonny's drawing. out of his pocket. looks down at it.
      shaking his head. passes a trash can. and drops it in.
      continues on. hands in his pockets. when...

      he stops. something.     occurring to him.   turns back to the
      trash can just as...

      a robotic clean-up crew's about to up-end it into a bin...

                            spooner
                  no!...

      he trots back. plucking the drawing. out of the can.       turns
      it upside down. seeing it. from a new perspective.

                            spooner
                      (echoing sonny)
                  "the place where robots meet."

      looks just like a map.
