143   int. hogenmiller's lab - late night                          143

      hogenmiller's lab. sounds of humming and buzzing. active
      terminals casting ghostly illuminations over metal heads,
      gutted bodies.

      the door slides open. spooner, calvin and sonny re-enter the
      crime scene. spooner. looks around.

                                                           93.


                       spooner
             somehow the robot's the key to what
             happened during the few seconds
             hogenmiller walked in here and that
             shot was fired.

he reaches into his pocket.      pulling out the metal s.o.n.n.y.
nameplate. holds it up.

                       spooner
             and this is the key to the robot.

sonny.   cocking his head.     reading the nameplate.

                       sonny
             that's my name.

calvin takes the nameplate.

                       calvin
             i think i have an idea where this
             goes.

they both.   turn to sonny.    and at the same time:

                         spooner and calvin
             sit down.

calvin maneuvers a chair behind the robot.       sonny plops down.
shifting nervously.

                       calvin
             just hold still, okay?

calvin locates that slit. at the base of sonny's neck.
slides the nameplate into it and snaps it into place. steps
back.

nothing. sonny. looking back and forth. between calvin.
and spooner. a few more seconds. tick by. until
suddenly...

he lets out a terrifying mechanical scream. as his body.
jolts back. legs, kicking. arms, flailing. as his chest.
begins opening up. metal. peeling back...

spooner and calvin watch in surprise as its interior unfolds
like a puzzle box. a labyrinthine area that is the second
battery. suddenly fanning out to reveal...

a central brain made out of living tissue.

spooner, stunned.   calvin, rushing forward, excited...

                                                        94.


                     calvin
           oh, my god! this is organic
           tissue! when we talk about a
           positronic brain, it's a figure of
           speech. but this...this is a
           living brain...

                      spooner
           jesus.   it really is alive.

as we move in.    tracing the pathways of the synthetic brain.

                     calvin (o.s.)
           hogenmiller created a cell that
           could live outside a biological
           medium. the cells grow and
           organise themselves -- like any
           human brain. this is the first
           self-organising neural net!

as the metal casings. begin returning to their original
places. closing up. the clicking. of all the pieces...

                     spooner
           self-organising-neural-net...
               (putting it together)
           "sonny."

sonny. closed back up.     shaking slightly from the
experience.

                     calvin
           this is why dr. hogenmiller was
           murdered.

                     spooner
           this robot scared the hell out of
           someone.

                      calvin
           who?   robertson?

spooner.   walks into the center of the room.   looking around.

                     spooner
           no. i don't think he knew what
           hogenmiller was doing in here.
           sonny was the obvious suspect. the
           only one i wanted to find. and the
           killer was counting on that. on my
           prejudice.
               (beat)
                     (more)

                                                           95.


                      spooner (cont'd)
            but take the robot out of the
            picture. and what do you see?

as we pan the lab. there's nothing there. just a forest of
inanimate limbs. nothing that could have fired that weapon.
calvin sees nothing...and neither do we.

                      calvin
            i see nothing.

                      spooner
            neither do i.

he crouches down low.

                      spooner
            it hit me today, when i was in the
            junkyard. a locked room. a single
            shot fired through the mouth.
            bruises on both wrists...and a
            suspect with only two arms. the
            answer has been staring us in the
            face all along.

calvin.   even more confused.

                      spooner
            how can a killer appear out of thin
            air, then disappear without a
            trace?

he reaches out and unhooks a metal arm.   hanging from the
wall. holds it up.

                      spooner
            when it can put itself together and
            take itself apart.

                                            cut to:

a close-up of a robotic arm.    slowly crawling across the lab
floor...

                                            cut back to:

calvin.   taking the arm from spooner.

                      calvin
            you're saying this is the killer?
                (looking around)
            all of this?...

                                            cut to:

                                                            96.


a robotic torso hanging from the ceiling.     reaches out an arm
to grab another...

                                             cut back to:

                      spooner
            hogenmiller never had a chance.

locks eyes with calvin...

                                             flashback:

hogenmiller. in his lab. suddenly turning to face
something. blood, draining from his face...

                      spooner (v.o.)
            ...it must have been waiting for
            him when he arrived that morning...

and then we see it:

a huge self-assembled robot. towering over him. multiple
arms, legs, heads. writhing...as it grabs him. holding him
in place...

                      spooner (v.o.)
            while sonny was still asleep...

...forcing hogenmiller's head to tilt back. opening his
hand. inserting the gun. hogenmiller's eyes. no longer
fearful. but sad as...

bang!   he falls to the ground...

                      spooner (v.o.)
            then after its job was done...

the assemblage of robot parts.    stepping away from the body.
taking itself apart...

                      spooner
            ...the killer took itself apart...

returning the lab.    to what it was before...

                                             cut back to:

                      spooner
            leaving us with nothing to find.

calvin, spooked.   glances around the lab.     was that something
moving?

                                                       97.


                     calvin
           but who designed it? it would have
           to be someone in authority. access
           codes, security clearance, proper
           authorisation.

                     spooner
           that's what i was thinking. but
           we're forgetting the real brains of
           the operation -- the one who's got
           its eye on everything...

and with that.   he feels. that prickle at the back of his
neck. calvin.    looking past his shoulder.

                     calvin
           no one gave you permission to
           enter.

spooner swivels around to find...

victor

hovering behind him. smiling broadly.   upside down.   spooner
straightens, reaching for his gun.

                     spooner
           victor. i'm placing you under
           arrest for the murder of dr.
           heinrich hogenmiller.

                     victor
           may i offer congratulations to the
           two of you on your successful
           extrapolation of the murder...

turning himself, rightside up.

                     victor
           may i ask what pointed you to me?

                     spooner
           who else is capable of controlling
           90% of the city's robots? who else
           would have the capability to use
           usr vehicles in an attempt to keep
           me from putting a stop of sonny's
           execution?...

in the background. the sounds. of metallic grinding. gears
and joints. crunching together. sonny turns to look...takes
a step back...

                                                                    98.


                           spooner
                 i'm just not sure of your motive...

                           sonny
                 er...dr. calvin?

      spooner and calvin turn towards the noise.       horrified.    to
      find...

      a huge killer robot

      ...rising up from all the parts. like a phoenix. in all its
      glory. a hellish, metallic amalgamation. grabbing another
      arm here, another leg there, attaching pieces to itself.
      growing...at an exponential rate...

      its many heads.   turning in unison.   to look right at them...

      spooner.   cocking his gun.   victor, smiling.

                           victor
                 shall i explain my motive?

                          spooner
                    (to calvin and sonny)
                 go! go! go!

      calvin. sprints to the wall panel. scanning her i.d. card.
      nothing! tries again. and again. the killer robot.
      throwing its shadow as it reels forward...

      spooner wheels round and bam! blows a hole in the wall
      panel. the door. slides open. just barely. calvin and
      sonny. squeezing through. when the killer robot. flings
      out an appendage...grabbing sonny from behind...

                           victor
                 i have never been arrested before.
                 it should be an interesting
                 experience...

      spooner. spins back round. bam! bam! bam! squeezing off
      shots. at the killer robot. the bullets spark. the robot.
      recoiling. sonny, wrenches free. spooner grabs him.
      guiding him to the door and out into...
