142   int. storage room - night                                            142

      close on spooner's face. his eyes. fluttering open. he
      reaches up, to feel the back of his head. this has been a
      bad, bad night.

      suddenly.   his eyes widen.   as he sees...

      sonny.   leaning over him.    so concerned.   so human...

                            spooner
                  aren't you supposed to be scrap
                  metal by now?

      widen to reveal spooner lying on the floor of the storage
      room. sonny and calvin, hovering over him.

                                                             92.


                           calvin
                 i'm sorry. we had to stop you.
                 you were about to ruin everything.

                           spooner
                 i don't understand.    the
                 execution?...

                           sonny
                 dr. calvin made a switch.

                           calvin
                 it was an unprocessed ns-2.
                 basically, they fried an empty
                 shell.

      spooner, impressed.   smiles up at her.

                           spooner
                 nice going, doctor.

      calvin, blushes. as spooner tries to sit up.    sonny reaches
      down to help him. he looks up at him.

                           spooner
                 and who the hell programmed you to
                 hit people on the head?

                             sonny
                 no one.    right, doctor?

                           calvin
                 it's true. this robot seems to do
                 things by instinct. i don't know
                 how hogenmiller did it.

      spooner rises to his feet.   looks at her.

                           spooner
                 i think i can help you figure that
                 out.
