      ext. city outskirts - deserted roads - dawn

      sonny walking along deserted streets.   looking over his
      shoulder. keeping in the shadows.

                                                             110.


                           spooner (v.o.)
                 victor thought that by letting your
                 robot exist, i'd be condemning the
                 human race as we know it to
                 extinction.

                           hologram (v.o.)
                 bah. sounds like nonsense. but
                 why are you so worried? we will
                 both be dead long before then --
