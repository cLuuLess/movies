                 when you've spent as much time with
                 robots as i have, it's hard to
                 accept the unpredictability of
                 humans. i was wrong to call you
                 paranoid, detective. you're
                 traumatized. and it makes perfect
                 sense why.

     spooner.   unsure.   looks at her.

                           spooner
                 what do you mean?

     calvin. reaches out. takes his right hand. spooner. tries
     to pull it away. but calvin. stays firm. her eyes. never
     leaving his. pulls the sleeve up from his arm. turns it
     over. feeling for something. then finds. a flap. peels it
     back. to reveal:

     metal and wiring...

     under the skin.   silence.   then spooner:

                                                             69.


                          spooner
                how did you?...

                          calvin
                i noticed almost right away. the
                way you forced yourself to use your
                left hand. even though it was
                unnatural to you.

     spooner.   pulls his arm away.   pushing down the sleeve.

                          calvin
                how did it happen?

     not something spooner wants to re-live.   looks down.   at his
     robotic arm. flexing. the fingers.

                          spooner
                i was in a high-speed chase.   six
                months ago...
