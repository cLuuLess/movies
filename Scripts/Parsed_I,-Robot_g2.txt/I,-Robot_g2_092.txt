93   ext. accident site - city street_- night (flashback)          93

     the sound of a tremendous crash. as we survey a trail of
     twisted metal and debris. only vaguely suggesting the
     remains of two cars...

     close on one of the wrecks. spooner lies trapped at the
     center of a distorted mass of metal. no room to move. his
     right arm, trapped...

                          spooner (v.o.)
                my right arm was trapped. but i
                could hear an ambulance in the
                distance. i knew they'd have the
                jaws of life...

     we hear sirens in the distance. spooner. trying to remain
     calm. as he spots. an electrical fire. licking up from the
     crumpled hood...

                          spooner (v.o.)
                then i heard it...

                          voice (o.s.)
                you are in danger...

     that voice. we've heard it before. from his nightmare.
     spooner. craning to see, through the jagged opening that
     used to be his windshield. the outline of a robot appearing.
     eye lenses glowing...

                                                               70.


                            robot
                  you are in danger...

     spooner stares up at the robot. not sure how to react.      the
     sound of sirens. rushing closer...

     the robot.    starts smashing away at the glass...

                             spooner
                  no!   halt! halt!

     spooner.     trying frantically to pull his arm free. twisting.
     tugging.     as the robot's metal hands reach in for him...

                            robot
                  you are in danger...

                                                cut back to:
