61   int. hallway - continuous                                      61

     ...into the hallway. sideways. trammeled plaster. boom!
     another pounder...crashing down from above. spooner. timing
     it...rolling...boom!...just under the next pounding...

                                                           53.


     scampering up...towards some light...boom!...the
     pounder...right on his heels...he clambers...closer...
     closer...when...he hears...meowing...looks back...the
     cat...scared out of its wits...boom!...the pounder crashing
     in...spooner...just manages...to scoop up the cat...just as
     boom!...
