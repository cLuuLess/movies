103   int./ext. spooner's car (moving) - unpaved road - night        103

      spooner's car bounces along, leaving a cloud of dust behind
      him. he slows down. driving cautiously. the landscape
      around him, desolate. like the drawing.

      the gps screen shows his car, a white spot.     entering a red
      zone. his destination.

      spooner brakes.   pulls out his gun.   and...

                                                               78.
