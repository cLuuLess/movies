     baldez. standing in his crime lab. behind him, three-
     dimensional projections of dead bodies. hovering in the
     precise positions they were found.

                           spooner's voice
                 welcome to the great american cover-
                 up.

                           baldez
                 i wanted to tell you something i
                 found before they suck it all up
                 into their computer.

     walks over to the projection of hogenmiller's body.

                                               intercut with:

     spooner. crossing the plaza. sees lanning, aronson, and
     calvin walking ahead of him...

                           baldez' voice
                 there are bruises on hogenmiller's
                 wrists...

                           spooner
                 that's natural. there was a
                 struggle.

                           baldez' voice
                 you're not getting me...

                                               intercut with:

     baldez.   studying the projection's wrists.

                           baldez
                 both wrists. i 14-ed them -- they
                 were inflicted at the same time the
                 shot was fired...

                                               intercut with:

                                                                47.


     spooner's pace.    slows.

                            baldez' voice
                  how's that possible?

     just then.    a faint blip.   on the line.   spooner.   reacts.

                             spooner
                  baldez?

                            baldez' voice
                  i'm here, man...

                            spooner
                  who else is on the line?
                      (nothing)
                  i said who's there?...

     nothing. he looks up. aronson, lanning and calvin. heading
     down a plaza exit. aronson. throwing a look over his
     shoulder.

     spooner.     hangs up his phone.
