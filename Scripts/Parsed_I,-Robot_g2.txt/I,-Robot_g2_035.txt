36   ext. calvin's condo estate - night                          36

     elegant condos set on prime real estate. calvin heads down a
     tree-lined walk towards her condo entrance.

                           spooner (o.s.)
                 one of my bullets hit your robot...

     startled. she drops her key card. as spooner steps out from
     behind a tree. the tail of his coat, whipping in the wind.

                           calvin
                 detective!...

                           spooner
                 and i think it's smart enough to
                 repair itself -- don't you?

                           calvin
                     (studying him)
                 yes. i think so.

                           spooner
                 where?

                           calvin
                 any repair shop...

                           spooner
                 no. it's always the owner who
                 brings the robot in for repair.
                 where would a robot without an
                 owner go?

                                                          29.


                      calvin
            i'm not sure what you're getting
            at.

                      spooner
                (stepping closer)
            does u.s. robotics have a factory
            in the city limits?

calvin.   tucking her hair behind her ears.

                      calvin
            the locations of our factories are
            classified.

                      spooner
            i don't care.

calvin.   looks up at him.   a mexican stand-off.

                      calvin
            i have several conditions if i show
            you.

                      spooner
            i expected that.

                      calvin
            first. i want it brought in
            unharmed.

                      spooner
                (doesn't like it, but)
            agreed.

                       calvin
            second.   i want to talk to it,
            alone.

                      spooner
            too dangerous.

                      calvin
            this model violated the three laws.
            it also moved and reacted
            differently than any robot i've
            ever seen. there must be some sort
            of logical explanation. i want to
            find out what that is. no police.
            no prosecutors. no you. just me
            and the robot.

spooner, looks down at this small woman.      narrows his eyes.

                                                           30.


                          spooner
                when they told me you were a
                psychologist, that wasn't the whole
                truth, was it?

                          calvin
                i never said i treated human
                beings.
