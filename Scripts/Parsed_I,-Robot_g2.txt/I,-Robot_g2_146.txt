146   int. stairwell - night                                           146

      crash! the stairwell door bursts open. spooner, calvin, and
      sonny pour in. start racing down the stairs. the sound of
      the killer robot behind them...gnashing...crunching...

      victor's smiling face.   greeting them at the landing.

                 dr. hogenmiller used to allow me
                 into his lab late at night.
                 together we started studying
                 evolutionary trends...

      they thunder past him. heading down to the next floor.
      victor's face. waiting for them once again.

                 maintenance and repair -- such as
                 detective spooner's robotic limb...

      spooner.   shooting him a look.   as they reach the next
      level...

                           victor
                 with sonny, the doctor created a
                 mechanism that incorporates organic
                 matter. thus we find an
                 evolutionary movement of the human
                 being toward the robot and the
                 robot toward the human being...

      spooner smashes into another door.   leading them out into...
