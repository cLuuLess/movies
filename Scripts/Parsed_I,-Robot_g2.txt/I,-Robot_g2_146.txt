147   int. glass-sided hallway - atrium - continuous                   147

      ...a glass-sided hallway. looking down onto the atrium
      below. eye-to-eye with the giant ns-2 statue. victor,
      waiting for them...

                                                       100.


                     victor
           in approximately four hundred years
           man and machine will become one.
           man as we know it will no longer
           exist.

calvin, slowing.   shocked...

                     calvin
           you killed a man because of
           something that will happen in four
           hundred years!?

crack! something slaps into the glass wall. right behind
her. calvin. jumps a mile. an ns-2, trying to break
through the glass...

spooner.   trains his gun on it when suddenly...

the rest of the killer robot appears.    the ns-2, just an
appendage...

all around them. slam! slam! slam! as security doors.
begin crashing down. blocking off the exits...

spooner, calvin and sonny, stumbling back. as the killer
robot hurls itself against the glass...the thick glass...
spidering with a sickening crackle...

spooner.   suddenly turning sonny...

                     spooner
           get out of here!

crash! the killer robot. breaking through.      its mechanical
tendrils. reaching out. sonny. confused.

                     sonny
           i don't...

                     spooner
           i said get out of here! don't you
           understand? it wants you! get out
           of here any way you can!

a security door. coming down. on a nearby exit.     just
feet...from slamming shut...as...

the killer robot...leaps into the hallway...sonny...
hesitates...looks over at calvin...as the killer robot comes
hurtling towards them...

the nearest exit...almost closed up...

                                                           101.


      the killer robot...swinging out when...

      sonny suddenly...takes a dive...just making it...under the
      security door...

      and the killer robot...splits in two...half of it shooting
      under the security door after sonny as...boom! it closes.

      spooner.   turning to calvin...

                            spooner
                  how do we stop this thing once and
                  for all?

      calvin reaches out for his hand...

                            calvin
                  the mainframe...

      they start running. the remaining half of the killer robot
      wheeling around after them...
