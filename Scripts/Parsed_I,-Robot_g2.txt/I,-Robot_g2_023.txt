24   int. hogenmiller's lab - day                                 24

     spooner and calvin step inside. it's dark. quiet. police
     and technicians long gone. silhouettes of hanging limbs.
     eyeless heads. clumps of wire and metal.

     the lights, flicker on. calvin sees spooner reaching into
     his coat with his left hand. pulling out a gun. reacts.

                          calvin
                a robot cannot harm a human being,
                detective. the first law of
                robotics forbids it. and we hard-
                wire the three laws into every
                model. without exception.

                          spooner
                yeah, i saw the commercial.

     spooner steps deeper into the lab. eyes scanning. twisting.
     to avoid touching any robot parts. passes a maze holding a
     metal insect. suddenly. the bug whirs to life.

                                                         19.


spooner startles. as the metal bug scurries through the
corridors. clamps his hand down on it.

                     spooner
           and if a robot was given a direct
           order to kill?

                     calvin
           the second law of robotics would
           prevent it. a robot must obey an
           order only if it does not conflict
           with the first law.

spooner approaches a mound of robot parts. arms and legs.
half torsos. all tossed haphazardly onto the pile.

                     spooner
           but a robot can defend itself.

                     calvin
           only when that action doesn't
           conflict with the first or second
           laws. this is the third law of
           robotics.

                     spooner
           yeah, well, you know what they say
           -- laws are made to be broken.

                     calvin
           not these laws.

spooner. starts nudging the pile with his shoe.   calvin,
growing impatient...

                     calvin
           you're not hearing me, detective.
           there's nothing here...

when suddenly

the pile erupts in front of spooner...parts flying...as a
robot leaps up from beneath it!...

spooner...knocked back...his gun...skittering across the
floor...right to...

calvin's feet.

                     spooner
           dr. calvin!

calvin. stunned.    speechless. the robot. fixing his
illuminated eyes.   right on her. she steps forward...

                                                           20.


                     spooner
           goddammit! stay back!

spooner. scrambling towards his gun.     calvin.    reaching out
towards the robot...

                     calvin
           calm down, detective.     there is no
           danger here...

spooner.   grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as...

                     calvin
               (to robot)
           de-activate.

and the robot.   suddenly freezes.

spooner. heart pounding. gets to his feet.         training the
gun on the robot. calvin turns to him.

                     calvin
           how did you know it was under
           there?

                     spooner
           if i was metal and didn't want
           anyone to find me, i'd hide under a
           pile of junk.

                     calvin
           this robot wasn't hiding. what
           you're looking at is the result of
           clever programming. the illusion
           of self-interest and free will.
           nothing more.

spooner. steeping closer to the robot. cautiously.
holstering his gun. as calvin turns for the door.

                     calvin
           i'm going to go get dr. lanning...

...the robot's hand suddenly shoots out...grabbing spooner's
gun...from his holster...lightening fast...pointing it...
right back at him...

close on calvin.   cannot believe this is happening...

                     calvin
           i said de-activate!

                                                         21.


                     spooner
           move away from the door, doctor.

calvin's voice.   cracking from desperation.    confusion.

                     calvin
           commence emergency shut-down!

                      spooner
           now!

spooner. staring into the robot's eyes. a thin bead of
sweat. trickling down his temple. calvin. moving away from
the door...

                     calvin
           i...i gave you an order...

the robot. starts backing towards the door. the gun.
shaking in its hand. as if he's desperate. conflicted. he
touches the wall panel. the doors slide open. the robot
steps out into the metal corridor. turning to run as the
doors begin to shut...

spooner. reaching down to whip out a back-up gun.     from an
ankle holster. slapping in a large cartridge.

                     calvin
           this is impossible.   a robot...

                     spooner
           ...can't do that.    yeah, yeah, i
           know.

                     calvin
           my god -- did you see how it moved?
           i've never seen an ns-2 move that
           way...

starts running for the door.

                    calvin
           wait! please, you can't destroy
           it. we have to study it...

                     spooner
           that thing took my gun. you'll be
           lucky if you get a handful of bolts
           back!

slams the wall panel and...

                                                               22.
