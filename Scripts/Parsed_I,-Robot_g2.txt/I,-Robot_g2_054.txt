55   int. underground car park - day                                   55

     sonny and his police entourage emerge from the elevator into
     an underground car park. spooner. waiting for them. heads
     over. toller. holds out his hand.

                            toller
                  case is closed, spooner.

                            spooner
                  apparently...

     he pushes past him.     falling into step beside sonny.

                            sonny
                  i didn't expect to see you again,
                  detective...

                            spooner
                  i need you to help me clear
                  something up.

                                                        48.


                     sonny
           i'll do my best.

                     spooner
           a scientist builds a robot that
           acts like a man. more like a man
           than any robot ever before. it
           shoots him and u.s. robotics calls
           it a failure.

                     sonny
           what would you call it?

                     spooner
           a stunning success.
               (beat)
           you were there, robot.    what am i
           missing?

                     sonny
           i don't know.

                     spooner
           don't start simulating ignorance.

                     sonny
           i'm not simulating ignorance,
           detective. i'm experiencing it.       i
           was asleep.

                     spooner
           you mean you were shut down.

                     sonny
           no, i was asleep.

                     spooner
           robots don't sleep. human beings
           sleep. understand? dogs sleep.
           you're a machine. an imitation.
           an illusion of life. can a robot
           write a symphony? can a robot take
           a blank canvas and paint a
           masterpiece?

a pause.   then the muted whir as sonny turns to him.

                     sonny
           can you do either of those things?

spooner. momentarily stumped. as a van from u.s. robotics
pulls up. the back door dropping open. an engineer motions
to the robot.

                                                       49.


                     engineer
           step forward. enter.

                     sonny
           they're going to destroy me, aren't
           they?

spooner.   watching him step into the van.

                      spooner
           yes.

sonny sits down. with an almost human melancholy.   the
engineers, securing him in place.

                     sonny
           the doctor was right. he told me
           everything was going to change....

the engineers start to close the doors. but spooner reaches
out to stop them. sonny. looks over at him.

                     sonny
           it's changing already...
               (beat)
           can't you feel it?

as clang! the van door closes. spooner, stepping back.
something. just not right. lieutenant bergin comes up
beside him.

                     lt. bergin
           you should be happy. that's one
           less robot in the world.

                     spooner
           they're going to destroy the most
           advanced robot in the world, john.
           that doesn't strike you as odd?

                     lt. bergin
           killer robots are bad for business.
           even your friend dr. calvin said
           so.
               (slaps him on the back)
           come on. you solved the case.
           give yourself a break.

spooner looks at him.   there's no way he's giving himself a
break.

                                                             50.
