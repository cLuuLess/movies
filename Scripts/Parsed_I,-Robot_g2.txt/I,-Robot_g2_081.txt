     the maintenance robot.   turning a corner.   down a quiet
     street...

                          spooner (o.s.)
                stop!

     swivels round. spooner. running up behind it. whipping out
     his gun. aiming it at the robot's head. the robot. takes a
     step backwards...

                          spooner
                i said stop!

     the robot. suddenly swinging the suitcase around. smashing
     it against spooner's head. spooner. buckles. falling to
     the ground. managing to squeeze off a shot...

     the robot. deflecting the bullet. with the case.      raising
     it as if to club spooner with it when...

     bam! spooner fires a second shot. piercing the robot's
     breastplate. hydraulic fluid. starting to leak. the robot.
     doesn't hesitate. slams the case into spooner's face...

     blood. spurting from spooner's nose. as he fires the gun.
     at the fleeing robot. gets to his feet. unsteady. taking
     chase...
