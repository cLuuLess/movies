    fade in:

1   on a deep...deep...darkness.                                       1

    a flicker. of light. off to the side. just barely.
    noticeable. orange...yellow...as we realise...it's fire...

    a sound.   something shattering...

    then. a disembodied voice. muted. we can't quite make out
    what it's saying. as it gets louder. and louder. when we
    finally. understand...

                         disembodied voice
               you are in danger...

                                               cut to:
