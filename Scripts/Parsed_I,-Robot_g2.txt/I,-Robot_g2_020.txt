21   int. atrium lobby - continuous                              21

     a soaring lobby. the centerpiece is a five-story statue of a
     robot, arms outstretched in approximation of da vinci's study
     of man. robot workers more numerous than humans. they are
     sleeker. finer. more advanced than those in the outside
     world.

                when this company started we were
                manufacturing three robots a week.
                now look at us. today's children
                will never know a world without
                robots.

                          spooner
                the streets are filled with
                unemployed humans who aren't
                exactly thrilled with that idea.

                          calvin
                our robotic systems maintain
                factory inventories, regulate
                street traffic -- even run the
                family home.

                          spooner
                leaving people to do what, doctor?

                          calvin
                leaving people to engage in higher
                pursuits that make life worth
                living.

                          spooner
                and what happens when something
                goes wrong?

                          calvin
                our system's never wrong.

     as they walk through the crowd, we hear the quiet whir of
     robot heads as they turn in succession to watch spooner pass.
