     ...sprints out into the hallway.     the robot suspect.   about
     to turn to corner...

     victor.   suddenly appearing.

                           victor
                 the suspect is nearing the end of
                 the hallway, detective.

                           spooner
                 gee, thanks.

     spooner raises his gun and fires...pegging the robot in the
     leg...it starts jerking wildly...he takes aim again when...

     calvin.   races out into the hallway.

     and he dives for calvin. forcing her to the floor as the
     robot fires. again and again. bullets. ricochetting around
     them. sparking against the walls...

     the elevator opens.   the robot, leaping inside.

     spooner. on top of calvin. looks down at her.        her hands.
     clutching his coat. trembling.

                           spooner

                                                cut to:
