66   int. spooner's bedroom - morning                               66

     spooner's eyes.   spring open.

     lying, in bed. heart pounding. sweat. covering his body.
     light. pouring in through the slats of his blinds.

     he sits up. rubbing his face. trying. to calm his
     breathing. takes a look at his watch...
