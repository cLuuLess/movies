88   ext. plaza - day                                                88

     spooner walking across the plaza.    the sun.   burgeoning on
     the horizon. comes to...

     the escalator the maintenance 10 jumped down. stares down.
     at the steps. waiting. to see the dented one. nothing.

                                                                  68.
