2   int. spooner's apartment - close on                                2

    del spooner's face.    his eyes, snapping open.   his face,
    covered in sweat.

    pull back to reveal him lying in bed. sheets, tangled around
    his legs. alarm clock, playing something relentlessly
    cheerful.

    spooner slaps it off. sits up. wincing. bends his right
    arm. stiff. he reaches for a bottle of pills. shakes out a
    couple and swallows them. trying to forget. that dream.

    you are in danger...

    he rubs his hands over his face. gets out of bed. his
    apartment, basic. unremarkable. bearing the signs of
    someone who lives alone. shades drawn. a little messy.
