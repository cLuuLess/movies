             jesus, he was a cop. he's dead
             because of you, because you made

a t intersection ahead.

                            costa

                           asher

             left.

                           asher

             you're dead, john costa. you
             fucked with the wrong man,
             shitsmear.
costa is shaking, looks in the rearview.      asher rips the
rearview off the windshield.

                           asher

             faster, asshole.

                           costa

                            asher

             shut up.   faster.
costa pulls onto the highway, buckles his safety belt.
asher scoffs at the gesture, then does likewise.

                           asher

             give me your wallet.   give it
             over. right now.
costa does. asher looks through it, pockets it.      costa
tries to focus on driving.

                           costa

             are you going to kill me?

                           asher

             been dreaming about it, john.
