int. conference room - day

the long table is crowded. inspectors laval and reynaud.
three more police officials. a pair of city councilmen.
grace sits next to gillet.

                           councilman #1

             you found the skull. incredible.

                           grace

             i had a case once where wild dogs
             had removed remains.

                           councilman #2

             so i can tell my people there
             isn't a headhunter running around
             the wilds of quebec?

                           grace

             no headhunters, sir.   however, a
             killer is out there.

                                                 (continued)





                                                       15.





continued:





                           councilman #1

             director gillet. do you have the
             victim identified?




                           director gillet

             no name yet, sir. we have someone
             from the university recreating his
             face from the skull.

                           councilman #1

             why, after two years, has nobody
             reported him missing?

                           grace

             he wasn't missed. he had no
             family, or moved often. he had
             the musculature of a serious
             outdoorsman. he spent a lot of
             time in his kayak.

                           councilman #1

             the big question is who killed
             him.

                           grace

             always is, sir. i can give you a
             rough profile; white male, thirty
             to thirty-four. has some college
             but no degree. neat in
             appearance. at least six feet
             tall. very intelligent. charming
             when necessary. he uses murder as
             a tool, probably in furtherance of
             a criminal endeavor. he's killed
             before and will again unless
             caught.
laval and reynaud write furiously.     gillet is impressed.
as are the councilmen.

                           councilman #1

             we really appreciate the fbi
             sending you. when can we expect
             your report?

                           grace

             a couple days, sir.
