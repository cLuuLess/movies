int. art gallery office - night

wooden painting crates everywhere. a table saw for
making frames. costa is distressed. grace looking at a
message typed onto his computer screen.

                           costa

             i do all my calls to europe and
             shipping stuff at night. my
             address book was on the screen
             when i went out for coffee. i
             came back and this was on the
             screen.

                           grace

             how long were you gone?

                           costa

             ten minutes. maybe. when i
             returned, that was on the screen.

insert computer screen: mr. costa: meet me tonight @ les


frers on rue chaucer. cu @ the bar 1:30 a.m.

reynaud takes a picture of the screen. laval checking
the door's lock. finds no marks. gives costa a look.

                           costa

             is this about the strangling?   is
             that guy after me?

                           grace

             please relax, mr. costa. we don't
             know if there's a connection yet.

                           inspector laval

             is anything missing.

                           costa

             no.  everything's here.
                     (a beat)
             shit. he took my organizer and my
             business checkbook.
grace nods for laval to step outside with her.
