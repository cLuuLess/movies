             i'm glad they finally sent
             someone, those hang-up calls have
             me terrified. they started right
             after i saw him.
                     (a beat)
             i looked him directly in the eye.
             there was a moment of mutual
             recognition.

                           grace

             do you think it's martin calling
             and hanging up?

                           mrs. asher

             it couldn't sound crazier, but who
             else?

                           grace

             were you ever asked to identify
             his body?

                                                (continued)

             the body? yes, they showed me
             some remains that had been hit by
             a pickup truck. the upper body
             was crushed. there was no face.
             i got physically ill.
mrs. asher studies grace.

                           mrs. asher

             you're not canadian, are you?

                            grace

             no.   i'm with the fbi.
grace shows her creds.

                           mrs. asher

             there was three. about two weeks
             ago. i began turning off my
             telephone when i go to bed.

                           grace

             you have some very nice things,
             mrs. asher.

                           mrs. asher

             thank you. some of them have been
             in my family for several generations.
             please call me rebecca.

athletic kid. they stop at age fourteen.

                           grace

             is that martin?

                          mrs. asher

             no. that's reese. martin's older
             brother. he drowned in a terrible
             accident.
grace notes a photo of a smiling young reese receiving a
long distance swimming trophy.

                           grace

             i'm so sorry, rebecca.    how did he
             drown?

                           mrs. asher

             the san michel river. martin fell
             out of their raft and reese jumped
             in to save him.

                           mrs. asher (cont'd)

             there was a lot of snowmelt that
             year. martin reached the bank.
             reese didn't. it was their
             fourteenth birthday.

                           grace

             their fourteenth birthday?

                           mrs. asher

             they were twins. identical twins.

                           grace

             you said reese was older.

                           mrs. asher

             by three minutes. they were very
             different boys.

                           grace

             to lose one son so young, then to
             lose the other two years later; to
             think you've lost him. that must
             have been devastating.
mrs. asher lights a cigarette. crosses to the window, so
poised, so tragic. grace studies her with a critical
eye.

                           mrs. asher

             reese was very charismatic and
             outgoing. martin was introverted.
             he never thrived like reese. he
             was a very disturbed young man.
             reese was martin's world. martin
             never recovered his equilibrium
             after we lost him. he changed.
             martin began to intimidate me. he
             could be very menacing. he began
             imitating reese at school and that
             lead to fights with other
             students. at sixteen he stole
             some jewelry that was very
             precious to me and ran away. a
             few days later the thunder bay
             police called and said my son had
             been killed changing a tire.

                           grace

             the police want you to sign this
             so they can exhume the body in
             martin's grave and verify
             identity.

                                                (continued)





                                                       44.

mrs. asher takes the paper.

                           mrs. asher

             i'll sign it. i already know
             somebody else's son is in that
             casket.
the phone rings.

                          mrs. asher

             excuse me.
mrs. asher crosses to the kitchen and answers.
grace looking around, takes a look down a hallway.
laughter o.s. as mrs. asher chats with a friend.
