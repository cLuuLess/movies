ext. dirt road in the forest - night




laval and reynaud, and the two uniforms smoke and joke.
a quiet beat as the wind picks up. their cars up the
road in the b.g.



something moves in the woods.   inspector reynaud draws
his glock. shushes the men.
a beat. movement. laval signals for the men to spread
out. holsters are unsnapped. reynaud is all eyes and
ears as he picks his way toward the trees.
grace emerges from the trees, a laser-aiming dot on her
forehead. she reacts to reynaud, raises her hands.

                        grace

          don't shoot, i'm on your team.
reynaud holsters his gun.   the men relax.   grace takes
inspector laval aside.

                        grace

          call who you have to call.   i
          found his head.
laval reacts.
