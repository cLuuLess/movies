ext. festival street - night

asher running. gun in his pocket. elbowing his way
through the crowd. asher reacts. he sees the gauntlet
of uniforms and patrol cars blocking the intersection
ahead.
asher shoves his hand in his pocket...

boom!   boom-boom!     pop-pop-pop!

thunderous gunfire. grace hits the deck. the uniforms
hit the deck. the crowd screams, claps and whistles.
it's not gunfire...

tilt up.

fireworks unfold in the night sky like giant flowers of
fire. rivers of sparks.
grace recovers her feet with palpable relief, she thought
she was dead for a second. grace looking around for
asher. laval reaches her.

                            grace

           shit.     you see him?
pop-pop-boom! more fireworks.         laval gestures for some
uniforms to spread out.

                                                (continued)





                                                        69.





continued:





a shrill scream o.s.

from an apartment building. grace runs into the
building. laval follows her.
