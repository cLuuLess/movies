          how'd she finagle a room there?

                        inspector laval

          she's a very slick woman.

             she didn't have one picture of
             martin. not one. even cut him
             out of the old yearbooks. and she
             had a basement door like a vault.
             she's hiding something. in the
             basement of her house. what is
             it, ten minutes away from here?
             her house.
a beat.   laval looks at grace, decides he can trust her.

                           inspector laval

             if she's under our protection and
             something happens to her house,
             her belongings, the department
             could be liable. there could be a
             lawsuit.

                           grace

             you're right. we should make sure
             her front door is locked.
laval makes a u-turn.
