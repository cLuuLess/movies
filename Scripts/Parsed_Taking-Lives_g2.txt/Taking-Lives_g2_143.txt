int. hospital - hallway - day

grace leans against a wall.

                            grace

             vanderholt.

                           medical examiner (v.o.)

             grace. i ran mrs. asher's dna
             against the suspect down here. no
             way it's her son.
a beat.

                            grace

             not her son?   you're sure?

                           medical examiner (v.o.)

             lab ran the test twice.

                           grace

             that's weird. was he adopted,
             switched at birth?

                           medical examiner (v.o.)

             listen for a minute. there was a
             match. john costa is mrs. asher's
             biological son.
grace laughs.     it's a joke.

                           grace

             so john costa is really martin
             asher?

                           medical examiner (v.o.)

             dear god, i wish i was joking.
grace turns and reacts.

                                               (continued)





                                                               95.





continued:




costa has been standing there. listening. he tries to
read grace's expression, worry etching his face.
grace is looking at costa, her mind racing a million
miles an hour.
grace's world crumbles as she puts it together.

                           grace

             are you martin?
costa gasps.        the very thought is painful.

                           costa

             grace, i'm john. okay?      i'm john.
costa hoping against hope everything is okay.          but it's
not okay. grace has a calamitous expression.

                             grace

             holy shit.
costa takes a step toward her. the street cop motions
for costa to stay back. costa reacts.
