int. hotel room - night (hours later)




the lights are still on, grace has fallen asleep on her
bed, still in her clothes, paperwork everywhere. case
photos now fill the picture frames, cover the walls, even
on the ceiling. knocking at the door. grace stirs.



crosses to the door, groggy. she checks the peephole.
cracks the door. it's inspector laval.

                        inspector laval

          you are a heavy sleeper.

                        grace

          you're everywhere. what's up,
          laval?

                        inspector laval

          a man was killed tonight.
          attacked from behind. asphyxiated
          with a nylon cord with handles.
          and there's a witness. or a
          suspect. we're not sure yet. we
          should go.
