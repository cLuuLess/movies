int. hotel room - night

a very nice bed and breakfast. grace enters and finds
her luggage waiting. she loves the room. antiques, art.
grace finds a bottle of wine and a note from gillet. she
smiles. grace checks the mini fridge; bingo. cracks a
moosehead. her cell rings.

             we named the victim; curtis
             kohler. the forensic dentist just
             verified the id.

                           grace

             with a c?

             no. k-o-h-l-e-r. the initials
             are for the montreal river
             company. kohler worked there as a
             guide three years ago. the owner
             remembers him because he stole the
             wetsuit.

             can you do a full records search?
             criminal, credit, commercial
             history. transcripts.
             everything.

             you're an awesome investigator,
             inspector. run his name on every
             database you can. i'll see you in
             the morning.
grace hangs up. makes notes on the sketch.       slips it
into a picture frame.
