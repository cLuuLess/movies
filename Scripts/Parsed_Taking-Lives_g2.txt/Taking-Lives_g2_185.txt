ext. old farmhouse - night




grace exits the kitchen door, running with her hands
cuffed behind her. running for her life.
she runs for the nearby woods. her shoes crunching
through a layer of fresh ice over old snow. fighting for
balance.
pop-pop-pop! asher opens fire on her from the house.
bullets hit the ice around her.
grace runs into the woods.   branches sheathed in ice.
smacking her face.
asher exits the house, firing -- pop-pop-pop-pop!
bullets explode the ice around grace. she dives to the
ground. she takes the opportunity to move her handcuffs
from behind to in front.
she unties and removes the heavy prosthetic belly she
wears. grace is not pregnant. she pulls the knife out.
grace runs deeper into the woods.
asher running in the woods behind her. the gun in his
hand at the ready. asher is hunting. he intends to kill
her.

                         asher

           keep fucking running, grace,
           you're only going to die tired!




on grace

running. batting away ice-covered branches.     drenched
with sleet. hypothermic conditions.
