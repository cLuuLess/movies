int. interrogation room - night

john costa smiles at grace as she enters.        sets her bag
on the floor. the case file on the desk.

                            costa

             i hope you guys are playing bad
             cop smart cop.

                          grace

             sorry. i'm the dumb one. agent
             vanderholt. call me grace.
they shake.    she slides typing paper and a pencil over to
costa.

                           costa

             thank you. he had these real
             intense eyes.

                                                 (continued)





                                                        24.





continued:




costa about to start drawing.

                           grace

             hold on. before you do that, i
             need some personal information
             from you. can you write down the
             name of the elementary school you
             attended? and your elementary
             school teachers, as many as you
             can remember.
costa looking at grace a beat.

                           costa

             are you kidding me? lady, i saw
             someone get killed tonight and
             you're asking me about grade
             school?

                           grace

             i apologize, i know it's random,
             but it's the best way you can help
             me.

                           costa

             i don't remember any of that.

                           grace

             please, mr. costa. you'd be
             surprised.

                           costa

                     (writing)
             i attended two. holy trinity and
             mother of good counsel. i
             remember sister bernard. and. i
             don't know, father jeffrey. mr.
             johansen. oh, and mrs. sebastien,
             she had a glass eye.

                            grace

             may i?
she takes the list of names. she tips over her briefcase
with her foot, the evidence bag spills out. costa
glances at the garrote, reacts.

                            costa

             omigod.   that's it, isn't it?

                            grace

             that's what?

                                               (continued)





                                                         25.





continued:





                           costa

             the thing around his neck.
costa looking at grace, realizes it's a mind game.




                           costa

             i told the other guy, i'll tell
             you. i did not do this. grace.
             i saw who did this and i can show
             you what he looks like and you can
             go catch him.
costa is unambiguously sincere. grace's attitude softens
a bit. she tucks the garrote back in her bag.

                           grace

             go ahead and draw the face of the
             man you saw.
costa draws a simple smiley face.     he shows her.

                           grace

             we'll get an artist to help you.

                           costa

             i can draw him, thank you.
grace crosses to the door.     costa begins drawing in
earnest.
