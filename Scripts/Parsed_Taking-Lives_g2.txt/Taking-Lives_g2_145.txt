int. hospital - hallway - day

costa takes the gun from her purse, pockets it, along
with her fbi credentials and car keys.
costa backs away from grace.
costa's physicality transforms from hip art dealer to
something much more menacing. the monster martin asher.
grace looks him dead in the eye, more angry than scared.
(note:   costa will now be called asher.)

                           asher

             she screwed it up, didn't she?

                             grace

             who?

                                                   (continued)





                                                          96.

                           asher

             i should have cut her throat when
             i saw her on the ferry. that's
             the least she deserves. please
             don't do anything, grace. it
             would hurt me so much if i had to
             hurt you.

                            grace

             good idea.   don't hurt me.
costa shakes his head, his brow set with a grim
determination. he turns, enters a stairwell and exits
the building. grace's heart is breaking.

                           grace

             shit!
she kicks the wall and gives chase, runs into the
stairwell.
