int. art gallery - night

a few minutes later costa finds grace at the turntables
looking through the dj's records.

                           grace

             don't you miss wax?

                           costa

             you helped me close the biggest
             sale of the night.

                             grace

             what's my cut?

                           costa

             what do you want?
grace smiles coyly.

                             grace

             i don't know.
costa looks at grace for a long beat.      not sure what her
game is, or if he wants to play.

                           costa

             let me know when you do.   excuse
             me.
costa walks away.     grace reacts; she didn't want that.
