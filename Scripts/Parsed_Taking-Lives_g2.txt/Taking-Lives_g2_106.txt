ext. river park - night




grace and reynaud trade looks, tenacious street cops at
heart, they holster their guns and jump into the crowd.

find asher --




a dozen yards away. he stalks a dancing raver who wears
a huge bundle of glowing necklaces.
asher snatches necklaces.   disappears into a wall of

dancers.


find grace --

she and reynaud scan the moving bodies for asher. grace
glimpses the back of asher's head. grace and reynaud
tear through the crowd like bulls, working together, a
bonding moment.
asher is an arm's length ahead of grace. she reaches
out, her fingers snag the cloth of his shirt. asher
turns...

it's not asher.

grace shoves him aside and moves on. she sees a
disturbance up ahead. grace shoulders her way through
the crowd.
grace and reynaud converge on the disturbance.    they
cleave through onlookers to reveal...




a fight

two drunk college jocks slug it out. grace looks around;
no asher. angry, frustrated, grace grabs one of the
jocks, hurls him to the ground. six uniforms swarm in
and arrest the two jocks.
reynaud throws up his arms in frustration.    he looks at
grace, they know they've been beaten.
