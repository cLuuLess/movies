int. art gallery - night

it's late. costa has a beer, his nose bandaged.
inspectors finish up questioning patrons. grace enters,
crosses to costa. she's tense, wound tight.

                           grace (o.s.)

             need a ride home?
costa looks at her. despite everything, his face shows
he is glad to see grace.
