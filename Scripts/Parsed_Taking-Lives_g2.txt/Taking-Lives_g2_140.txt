int. hotel room - day

grace shakes costa.     tears well in her eyes.

                           grace

          john.    john.
costa stirs.

                         costa

          mmmmm.   morning.
he sees the blood.    doesn't really react.

                        costa

          my stitches must have ripped.
grace hands him a towel.      presses it against his
shoulder.

                        grace

          i thought you were scared of
          blood?

                        costa

          you better take a shower.
