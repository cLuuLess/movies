ext. parking lot crime scene (downtown montreal) -


night (4:00 am)

cop cars everywhere. crime scene tape. the coroner's
van. a couple news cameramen. grace crossing with
laval.
reynaud places a handcuffed man in workout gear in the
back of a cop car.

                         inspector laval

          that's him.   he says he saw the
          killer.
reynaud slaps the cop car, it quickly drives away. grace
and laval arrive at a body dressed in sweats. a gym bag
nearby. a pair of uniforms stand guard as a criminalist
processes the body. thirty-ish, healthy, his generic
looks marred by bulging, bruised eyes. face bruised.

                        inspector laval

          meet mr. todd ford.
grace squats by the body. clicks on her mag-lite and
inspects the victim. bruises on his neck.

                        grace

          he's still warm.

                                             (continued)





                                                        20.





continued:




grace shines her flashlight along the corpse.      a couple
hairs glow in the strong light beam.

                           grace

             want to get those?
the criminalist takes a lint roller, collects the hairs.

                            grace

             where is it?

                            inspector laval

             there.   under his car.
grace shines her light under a car. a garrote is there,
made of broomsticks and knotted nylon cord.

                            grace

             holy shit.   has le directeur been
             notified?

                           inspector laval

             i'm letting the poor man sleep a
             couple more minutes.
                     (pointing things
                      out)
             twenty-four hour gym is there,
             next door. he has a membership
             card in his wallet. that's his
             car. car keys.
grace looks around the garage.      taking it all in.
getting a feel for the scene.
she carefully examines the victim's car with her
flashlight. the door has been brushed with black print
dust.
