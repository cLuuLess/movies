             a fist. my stepdad socked me. i
             flew across the room and dented
             the sheetrock in the kitchen. my
             mom saw everything and still took
             his side.

                           martin

             you got cracked good.

                           dan

             i hate that guy. two hundred
             pounds of worthless grease.

                           martin

             why'd he hit you?

                           dan

             i wrecked his sixty-five mustang
             and his boat in the same week.
             his babies. i totaled them.

                           martin

             i would have popped you too.

                           dan

             it was worth it. but i didn't
             deserve the tour in hell.
dan rubs his close-cropped hair.

                           dan

             don't ever go to military school
             if you can help it. it sucks.
                     (a beat)
             i jumped the wall two days ago.

                           martin

             you going back?

                           dan

             i'm done with that racket. i'm
             going to seattle and playing
             music.
martin tries the guitar, he's not that good.

                           martin

             i know some chords.

                           dan

             think you can learn drums?
