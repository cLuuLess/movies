int. conference room - close on a tv screen - day

surprisingly clear video shot with a long night-vision
lens. todd ford exits the 24 hour gym, gets in his car.

widen to:

the director, grace, reynaud and laval watch the video on
the tv. director gillet turns it off. he is not in a
good mood and that has laval and reynaud on edge.

                           director gillet

             we could have had him this
             morning.

                           inspector laval

             director, please. we are getting
             close. the hairs recovered from
             the apartment match the hairs
             recovered at the crime scene on
             ford's body. we found hours of
             video like that of the victim. he
             has been following him, filming
             him for weeks. he tapped his
             phone and has recordings of ford's
             calls. even a cd with copies of
             mr. ford's e-mail folders.

                            grace

             with that much detail, you could
             become anyone.

                           director gillet

             so he hunts people and wears their
             lives as a kind of trophy.

                           grace

             more like a kind of camouflage.

                           director gillet

             what's his real name?

                                                (continued)





                                                        34.





continued:





                           inspector laval

             we know what he looks like, we
             have his fingerprints, we know
             what he had for breakfast. but
             his name eludes us still.

                           director gillet

                     (angry)
             find it, laval. find him.

                          inspector laval

             yes, sir.
laval and reynaud quickly exit.     grace stays.
