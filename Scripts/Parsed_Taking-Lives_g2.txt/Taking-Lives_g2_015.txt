ext. riverbank - night

grace stands there alone, the wolf is long gone. she
stoops, pushes aside brush. she finds a hollow under
some roots. grace clicks on her flashlight.




what she sees

a human skull stares up from the hollow.     picked clean,
weathered.




                                                     10.
