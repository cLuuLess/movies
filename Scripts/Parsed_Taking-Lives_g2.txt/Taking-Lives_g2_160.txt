int. director's gillet's office - day

gillet sits at her desk across from grace.     his eyes are
harder than normal.

                        director gillet

          they're on their way from the
          airport.
grace nods, chews a nail.

                         director gillet

          your old life is over. there is
          no going back.

             i know.

                            director gillet

             you're still young. whatever
             happens, be strong.
                     (beat)
             where is he, grace? how do we
             find him?

                            grace

             director, i'm the last person you
             should be discussing the case with
             at this point.

                             director gillet

             grace.    you know his mind, and his
             heart.    where is he?
a beat.

                           grace

             not here. this city no longer has
             the psychic gravity to hold him
             here. try mexico, getting a
             facelift.

                           director gillet

             we id'd the remains in the morgue.
             the real id.
he hands her a picture of the man whom we thought was
asher.

                           grace

flashback - int. hart's apartment - day

hart rolls painting canvases into a tight cylinder.
inserts it into a fancy lamp. a hypodermic stands by to
reward his work.

                           director gillet (v.o.)

             he was an addict. and a thief.
             an art thief. he hits galleries
             in europe and north america.
             traveled back and forth smuggling
             and selling stolen canvasses.
