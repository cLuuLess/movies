int. director gillet's office - day

director gillet leans against a wall, smoking a pipe.
grace, laval, reynaud sit on the tired couches.

                           director gillet

             so who was in asher's grave?

                           inspector laval

             dan soulsby. he went missing from
             the alberta military institute two
             days before the accident.

                                               (continued)





                                                         59.

                           grace

             i'm sure soulsby's death was a
             homicide, asher saw the
             opportunity and took it. he
             became soulsby and bummed around
             seattle for a couple years.

                           director gillet

             why is asher after costa? why
             isn't he in mexico getting a new
             face?

                           grace

             costa saw him. costa caught him
             in the act, caught him being
             martin asher. seen first by his
             mother, then by costa. for the
             first time he's failed at taking a
             life, and since we found the
             apartment, he can't be edwards.
             to be seen, to be recognized, is a
             horrifying thing to asher. he has
             no identity and wants it that way.

                           director gillet

             where is the real mr. edwards?

                            grace

             likely dead and buried south of
             the border somewhere.
                     (beat)
             south of the american border
             somewhere. visa records put
             asher, using kohler's id and
             edwards at a mexican surf resort.
             edwards' last charge was sixteen
             hundred dollars at a 'no questions
             asked' facelift clinic in
             guadalajara.
director gillet taps out his pipe.     looks at a new, more
detailed portrait of asher.

                           director gillet

             have you contacted the clinic?

                           inspector laval

             yes. they are also 'no questions
             answered.' mr. kohler suddenly
             paid off his credit card bills,
             thanks to money from edwards.

                                                (continued)





                                                        60.





continued:





                           director gillet

             keep's the collection agencies off
             the trail. how do we flush mr.
             asher?




                           grace

             he's focused on costa. who fits
             the profile of asher's victims.
             he went on costa's computer and e-
             mailed copies of costa's files to
             an e-mail account in denmark.
             constant threat of discovery,
             asher will become more
             disorganized.
laval and reynaud agree.

                           director gillet

             okay. my office will arrange a
             press conference. i will tell a
             room full of correspondents we
             have a suspect who is dead and
             murder victims who are alive. and
             i'll sound like a madman.

                           grace

             it does sound crazy. that's what
             the press likes, sir.
