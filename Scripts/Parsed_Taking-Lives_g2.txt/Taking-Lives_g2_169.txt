grace chasing hart.

                           senior agent (v.o.)

             mr. hart, not asher, murdered the
             montreal inspector, correct?

                           grace (v.o.)

             yes. hart thought costa was
             systematically destroying his
             life. hart's violent explosion
             was inevitable.

                           senior agent (v.o.)

             how could asher plan on hart
             snapping like that?

                           grace (v.o.)

             he couldn't. my guess is asher
             intended to kill hart and make it
             look like suicide. the
             authorities would find the body
             and close the martin asher file.
