int. les frers - night (1:29 am)




ultra-hip. the dance floor throbs with clubgoers.      the
dj thumps a eurobeat.
costa sits at the bar. people all around him, jostling
to buy drinks. two busy bartenders sling booze.
costa finds the noise and crowd absolutely nerve-
wracking. he twirls the ice in his scotch with a finger.
staring at the clock. 1:31 am. he's nervous, sweat
beads his forehead. a big bartender, an undercover cop,
pours costa a scotch.

                         bartender

          don't worry.   you're doing fine.

                        costa

          could you look any more like a
          cop?

                         bartender

          what?

                        costa

          could i have some water?    i'm
          cooking in this thing.
costa scratches around the neck of the hot body armor.
the bartender gives him a dasani.
various angles: a half-dozen undercovers are mixed in
with the clubgoers.
camera finds reynaud sitting at the bar near costa, gives
costa a reassuring nod through the crowd.
