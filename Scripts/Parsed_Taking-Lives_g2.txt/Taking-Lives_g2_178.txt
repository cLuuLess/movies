ext. warehouse store parking lot - night




wintertime. it's an ice storm. freezing rain
accumulates on existing snow and ice. grace loading her
supplies into her truck. it's miserable out and getting
worse.



honking. grace turns to watch a car slowly sliding
helpless across the ice. it stops just short of hitting
a parked car.
