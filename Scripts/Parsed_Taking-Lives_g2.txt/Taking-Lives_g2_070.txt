int. martin's cell - night

grace moves aside cobwebs with her big flashlight. the
room is tiny. exposed joists overhead. grace sits on
the cold concrete. a sleeping bag rolled in the corner.
one wall is just chicken wire. her flashlight beam stabs
at the yawning darkness beneath the house.
there is a public school desk chair combo. the name
martin neatly carved into it, then scratched out. a
broken light bulb overhead, its wires running to a corner
of the house.
grace cautiously unrolls the sleeping bag. a pair of
socks, underwear, t-shirt neatly folded inside. she
rolls it back up. finds a large jar, picks it up. very
old feces inside, a makeshift toilet. she sets it down.
grace pulls the door shut.   and turns off her flashlight.
pitch black. so quiet.
she sits there, in the musty little cage. listening to
her breathing, to her heart beat. so lonely, so
frightening. a tear rolls down her cheek. she sniffles,
wipes away the tear. a beat. grace hears scratching.
she clicks on her light.







grace's flashback - int. martin's cell - night

young martin asher is huddled in the corner, shivering,
crying and whimpering. martin looks at us with haunted
eyes.
