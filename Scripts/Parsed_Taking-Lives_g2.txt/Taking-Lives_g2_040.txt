int. apartment building - hallway - day




an upper floor. grace, reynaud and the manager cross to
a door. the manager studies costa's sketch of the
attacker.




                        super

          i never met him. we conducted our
          business by phone.
they arrive at a door. reynaud about to knock.   grace
stops him, listening at the door.

                        grace

          i smell smoke. back where i'm
          from anyone can kick a door if
          there's a fire. it's the
          'citizen's arrest' of search
          warrants.
then: the smoke alarm inside the apartment buzzes o.s.
reynaud and laval trade looks. reynaud cocks a leg...
the manager unlocks the door a beat before reynaud kicks
it. laval is no danger junkie, he's a little hesitant to
enter. grace gets down low, enters carefully, she knows
what she's doing.
