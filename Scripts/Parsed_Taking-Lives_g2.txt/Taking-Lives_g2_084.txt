ext. alley outside club - night

costa bursts from the fire exit, fed up. he rips off the
wire, he struggles out of the body armor. grace and
laval watching.

                           costa

             i have a life. i can't play
             superhero for you. i don't handle
             stress very well. i have an art
             show to open tomorrow and i don't
             know what i'm putting on the walls
             yet.

                           grace

             i know you have a life. so did
             the people who have lost theirs.
             someone else might die if you do
             not help us. every time someone
             dies it affects forty, fifty
             lives.
costa looks at her, arms on his hips.

                           costa

             grace, i've been cooperating. i
             even drew you a picture. you
             can't put your responsibility on
             me. you have a badge, not me.

                           grace

             if somebody else dies, and you
             know you could have done more to
             stop it, you're going to feel like
             shit for a very long time, mr.
             costa.
a beat.   that resonates with costa.

                           costa

             i want to help you guys but i
             don't have time to hang out and
             listen to bad techno.



a beat.

                           grace

             it's okay to be scared.

                           costa

             scared? i'm off-the-charts
             terrified. there's a pissed-off
             serial killer after me. i mean,
             what did i do to him?

                           grace

             you saw him and that's enough.
             don't stop living your life.
             you'll be protected by armed
             officers twenty-four seven.

                           costa

             until he's caught?

                           grace

                     (softly)
             i can't promise you that.
costa is torn, grace empathizes with him.

                           costa

             i have a lot of work to do.

                           grace

             a car is watching the gallery.
             you'll be okay.
costa looking at grace.     he decides to trust her.
