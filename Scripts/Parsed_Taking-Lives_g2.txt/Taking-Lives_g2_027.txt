john costa, 33, sits at the small table. glasses,
moppish hair. laval sits across from him. costa is
sincere, and frightened.




                        costa

          i walk out of the gym. walk to my
          car. i'm unlocking it and i hear
          a scuffle, a fight. over by this
          car i see this guy getting choked
          from behind and i shouted.

                        inspector laval

          what did you shout?

                        costa

          'stop.' i ran towards them. then
          the person doing the choking lets
          go and pointed a gun at me and
          ran. i'm so stupid. i could of
          been shot. i called the police
          gave him cpr until the paramedics
          came.

                        inspector laval

          you touched him?

                         costa

          of course.   i was giving him cpr.

                        inspector laval

          you removed the garrote?

                        costa

          the thing around his neck? yes.
          i took it off, it was choking him.

                        inspector laval

          did you see where the attacker
          went?

                          costa

          away from me.

                        inspector laval

          what kind of gun did he have?

                        costa

                  (frustrated)
          the kind that puts really big
          holes in people.

                          inspector laval

          was it black?    was it silver?

                                            (continued)





                                                         22.





continued:





                           costa

             black.

                           inspector laval

             okay, see? i am getting information.
             he had a large black handgun.

                           costa

             listen to me. i can draw a
             picture of his face. i saw him.

                           inspector laval

             you want to draw a picture?

                          costa

             a sketch. i can sketch him.     i'm
             very good.

                           inspector laval

             how could you see his face in the
             dark?
a beat. costa realizing he is under suspicion.        he leans
forward, looks inspector laval in the eye.

                           costa

             i did not do this. i saw two guys
             fighting and should of ran the
             other way but i didn't.
                     (as if to a child)
             you need to find the person who
             killed this man.
                     (in french)
             you need to find the guy who did
             this.
