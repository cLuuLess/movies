int. unmarked #2 - moving - day

grace watches costa's unmarked scrape past the truck.        a
side mirror is knocked off.
the oncoming buick swerves back onto the asphalt.
overcompensates, now heading right for grace...
grace reacts, swerves.
bam!   the cars hit.   grace gets a face full of airbag.
