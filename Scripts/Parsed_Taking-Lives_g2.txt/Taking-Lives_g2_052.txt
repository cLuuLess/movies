int. task force room - day (6:03 a.m.)

the place is gearing up for a new day. grace crosses to
where laval and reynaud struggle awake with coffee and
the morning paper. grace takes a seat, grabs the sports
section. a young detective eats a grapefruit.

                           grace

             morning. can you run this name?
             she got twenty hang-up calls from
             edward's phone.
the young detective takes a post-it from grace and
crosses.

                           grace

             what happened to that beautiful
             thumbprint on the orange juice
             glass, you get an id?

                            inspector laval

             no hits. he's never been
             fingerprinted.

                          grace

             shit. any activity on edward's
             accounts?

                                               (continued)





                                                    40.





continued:





                           inspector laval

             nothing. i think he became
             edwards a year ago. he was a
             software engineer. did everything
             by the internet, he never met
             anyone face to face.
grace trades reynaud for the front page.

                           grace

             why a year ago.

                           inspector laval

             edwards went on a river trip.
             kohler was a guide.
grace reacts.     laval tosses her some papers.

                           inspector laval

             those are e-mails between kohler
             and edwards discussing the trip
             one year ago.

                           grace

             you connected edwards and kohler?
             somebody was working all night.

                           inspector laval

             i couldn't sleep.

                           grace

             our suspect kills kohler on the
             river, lives his life a year,
             kills edwards and assumes his id
             for a year. then he stalks ford,
             kills him but is interrupted by
             costa. think he's pissed at
             costa?

                           inspector laval

             of course.
the young detective returns with a report, hands it to
grace.

                           young detective

             agent vanderholt, a report came
             back on the name.
