int. post office - night

ten minutes later grace checks her p.o. box. finds some
baby catalogs. a local pregnant woman enters.

                        pregnant woman

          wow, you know the question?

                           grace

          six months.

wider to reveal:

grace is very pregnant.

                           pregnant woman

          that's it?

                           grace

          twins.

                        pregnant woman

          good luck, sweetheart. get
          yourself home, it's miserable out.
grace smiles, exits.
