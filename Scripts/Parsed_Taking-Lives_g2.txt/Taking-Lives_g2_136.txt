int. superkool lounge - night




ultra mellow. grace and costa chill on throw-pillows and
tapestries. persian trip-hop and hookahs.
grace and costa have melted into a corner where they sip
tea. nobody has been more comfortable. costa pours beer
from a pitcher.

                        costa

          i'm happy to be alive but it's
          like this door has been opened.      i
          don't think i was naive. but
          everything is different now.

                        grace

          you'll fold this experience into
          your life and be stronger for it.

                        costa

          how do you deal with it? all the
          misery and pain and violence.

                        grace

          i can stop monsters, john.     and
          because i can, i have to.

                        costa

          so is it a calling or a curse?

                         grace

          neither.   it's just my job.

                        costa

          when i was in med school i saw a
          guy on a harley get t-boned by a
          daihatsu. he was screaming in
          pain and needed help and i knew
          what to do, i had all my certs,
          but i saw all this blood and
          froze. i failed the big test.
          bye-bye, med school. hello,
          graphic design.

                         grace

          roy wilson.

                        costa

          the man on the harley.
costa reacts.   sighs.

                        costa

          so you knew about that. no wonder
          you knew what to say to keep me
          cooperating.

                                          (continued)





                                                         88.





continued:





                           grace

             you're a sharp one, john costa.

                           costa

             you threw me in a tiger cage like
             a piece of meat.

                           grace

             that's right. you were the cheese
             in the trap. we stopped a monster.
             that's what matters.
grace is utterly unapologetic.      it makes costa like her
even more.
