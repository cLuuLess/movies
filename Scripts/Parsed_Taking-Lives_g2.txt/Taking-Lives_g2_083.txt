int. men's room - continuous action

costa cautiously pushes open the door. stepping inside.
dingy tiles. dripping faucet. several stalls.
the room seems empty. costa swallows, bends down.
checks under the stalls. nothing. nothing. nothing...
then. something. at the far stall. a pair of men's
shoes. black. polished. facing the stall door.
waiting...
costa freezes.     backs away as...
the stall door slowly swings open. hinges creak.        a
foot, a trouser cuff. a leg stepping out...

                                                (continued)





                                                         57.





continued:




a black man emerges.       one of the guys at the end of the
bar. costa exhales.        a bundle of nerves.

                            black man

             go outside.
costa eyes him.

                            costa

             what?

                           black man

             we're calling it off.
