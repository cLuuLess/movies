int. upset woman's apartment - night

the sliding glass door to the balcony has been shattered.
below and beyond is a long rooftop.
madly lit by a swirl of bright lights. a huge outdoor
dance floor throbs with energy in a park along the st.
lawrence river.

grace sees --

asher jump from the far end of the roof.
