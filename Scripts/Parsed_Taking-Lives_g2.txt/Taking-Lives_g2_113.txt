ext. costa's apartment - day

laval ringing the bell.
a white plumber's van pulls up behind laval's unmarked.
a plumber gets out.    coveralls, clipboard.    crosses to
another apartment.
costa opens the door. with two packed bags.       laval takes
one. costa takes one last look at his home.       locks the
door.
laval watches the plumber knocking a couple doors down.
costa and laval cross to unmarked #1.
the plumber approaches them.     costa looking at him,

reacts.

the plumber is martin asher. a gun in his hand.       laval
drops costa's bag, reaches for his holster...
pop-pop-pop!    asher drops laval with three to the face.

                                               (continued)

continued:




costa stares in disbelief at the mortally wounded cop.
asher shoves costa into the driver's seat of unmarked #1.




                           asher

             you're driving.
