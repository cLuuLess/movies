int. art gallery - night

asher bursts from the bathroom, running right over
reynaud, who draws his pistol.
grace pulls a pistol, laval too. asher running through
the patrons. grace takes a knee and aims. she doesn't
have a clear shot. asher aims his gun straight ahead as
he runs. people hit the deck.

                           asher

          out of my way!
pop! asher shoots a window, shattering it. he shoulders
his way through the safety glass. grace and laval
follow.
