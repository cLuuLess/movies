an inspector pours the woman tea. she has calmed down.
he takes his pen, looking at her statement.

                        woman

          you need to open that grave.   it
          can't be my son in there.
a beat.

                        inspector

          i lost my mother two years ago.
          every day i think i see her.
          driving to work in the car next to
          me. at mass. shopping, i see
          her, but this is someone else's
          mother. you see?
the woman lays a hand on his arm, looks him in the eye.
there is something formidable about her.

                           woman

             inspector, i'm saddened by your
             loss and touched by loyalty. but
             let's focus on the matter at hand.
             he walked right past me. we made
             eye contact. i know he recognized
             me. it was my son. a mother
             knows these things. i will sign
             anything, i will swear before a
             judge. and thank you, i do have
             all my faculties and friends who
             can vouch for my character.

                           inspector

             did you talk to this man, he is a
             man now?

                           woman

             yes. of course he's a man. he'd
             be thirty-two. and no, i did not
             speak with him. i ran.
                     (low, serious)
             inspector, my son was very, very
             disturbed. he had serious
             emotional problems. i assure you
             he was.
                     (a beat)
             is. is a dangerous person.
he hands her some forms.

                           inspector

             madame. the police department
             cannot resolve your problem. you
             need to get permits from the
             coroner and health and safety
             department. you pay for an
             exhumation. you have someone
             qualified examine the remains. if
             it is the wrong body, the forensic
             examiner will confirm there is a
             problem and call us. then we open
             an investigation.
                     (a beat)
             no, quebec city police will
             investigate. he is buried there,
             no?
the woman bristles.     stands, takes the forms.

                            woman

             no.   inspector. he is not.




                                                      7.
