int. costa's apartment - night (3:33 a.m.)

spacious, lofty.     costa and grace enter.

                           costa

             careful.
costa scoots aside a pile of clothing.       the newspapers.
cool art, sketches, images all over the walls.
reminiscent of grace's hotel room. and a very cool view
of downtown.
grace taking everything in. art books, sketch pads.
piled high on the desk. she looks at the ceiling. sees
notes and sketches taped up. grace laughs to herself.

                           costa

             i'm sorry. it's a sty.    must be a
             profiling mother lode.

                           grace

             i'm done profiling you.   i got you
             figured out.

                           costa

             a failed healer, a failed artist.
grace looking at a drawing on the wall.       costa winces, he
didn't want her to notice it.

                           grace

             is that how you see yourself?

                          costa

             no. that's you. i did it last
             night.

                           grace

             this is how you see me?

                          costa

             no. it's how i think you see
             yourself.

                                               (continued)





                                                         74.





continued:





                           grace

             and how do you see me?
costa licks his lips.




                           costa

             that would be out of bounds.
grace looking at him. costa looking at her. a staring
match. costa and grace try not to laugh. they end up
giggling.

                           costa

             what was that?

                           grace

             i don't know. john, games are
             fun. but head games are
             dangerous.

                           costa

             then keep your head out of it.
a beat.   grace shrugs, back to business.

                           grace

             the justice minister is going to
             relocate you to another city until
             mr. asher is in custody.

                           costa

             i don't know what your deal is.
             one second you're so there, then
             all i get is the badge.

                           grace

             i apologize if you've been getting
             the wrong signal.

                            costa

             yeah.   relocate where?

                           grace

             another province. they want you
             on a flight tomorrow morning.

                           costa

             this monster comes into my life
             and i have to leave?
a uniform sergeant enters.

                                                (continued)





                                                       75.





continued:





                           sergeant

             my people are in place.

                           grace

             thank you, sergeant.
the sergeant exits.

                           costa

             this is surreal. what do i pack?

                            grace

             what you need.   movers can get the
             rest.

                           costa

             i need tomorrow morning to finish
             up my business here.

                           grace

             i'll let them know.
this is goodbye.     neither of them feels very good about
it.

                           costa

             i thought you were going to check
             under my bed.
grace smiles, plays along, crosses, looks under the bed,
stretching for costa. driving him nuts.

                            grace

             no monsters.

                            costa

             thank you.
grace holds out her hand.      they shake.

                           grace

             i probably won't see you again
             until the trial. if there is a
             trial.

                            costa

             goodbye, then.
costa leans across her, braces himself against the wall.
a bold move. now they are eye to eye. grace kisses
costa for a long beat.
grace breaks the kiss. holds a finger to her lips; shhh.
she turns and exits. the door shuts behind her. costa
is going to miss grace.




                                                         76.
