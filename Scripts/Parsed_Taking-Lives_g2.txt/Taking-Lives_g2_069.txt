int. basement - night




grace descends creaking stops. shining her light around.
old boxes. furniture. forgotten things. dust.
grace is looking for something and she's not sure what.
she spots a door chain. she moves some boxes. finds a
leather razor strop hanging next to a small door.
grace's hand undoes the chain. lifts the latch and opens
the door as rusted hinges squeal.
