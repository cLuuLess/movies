ext. rooftop - night

laval will go no further. grace gets a running start,
jumps from the apartment window, tucks and rolls. on her
feet again, grace sprints along the roof.
fireworks boom and pop overhead.   thumping techno.
grace reaches the edge of the roof.     reacts.   reynaud has
caught up with her.
