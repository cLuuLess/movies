screech! reynaud slides to a stop. leaps from the
still-moving car and checks his friend laval. who is no
more. grace wants to get asher.

                           grace

             you staying or going?

                           inspector reynaud

             i'm not leaving.
grace slides behind the wheel.          and takes off in the
muscular cop car.
