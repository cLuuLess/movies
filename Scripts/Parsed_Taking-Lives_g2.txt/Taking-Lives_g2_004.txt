int. rental car - moving - day




the land rolls endlessly. martin drives.      dan plays his
guitar. he's really good.

                        dan

          i'm the next billy squire. krokus
          will be opening for me one day.
pow! the car hits a bottle. a front tire deflates.
martin guides the crippled vehicle to the curb.
