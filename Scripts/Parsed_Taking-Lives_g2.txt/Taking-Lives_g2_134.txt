int. hospital - day

reynaud sits by himself, his head between his knees.
mourning laval, dead on a nearby gurney. director gillet
crosses to him. lays a comforting hand on reynaud's
shoulder. reynaud sees who it is, stands crisply, wipes
his tears, embarrassed.

                           inspector reynaud

             i am sorry, sir.

                                               (continued)





                                                        85.





continued:





                           director gillet

             please, jean. i called your wife.
             i'm having someone take you home
             to her. there is nothing left to
             do here.
reynaud doesn't want to leave his dead comrade.

                           director gillet

             i'm ordering you home.
reynaud acquiesces.     a uniform escorts him out of there.
director gillet crosses to grace, who was watching him.
she sips coffee, an icepack on her ankle.

                           grace

             you're really good with people.
gillet shrugs.

                           director gillet

             how's mr. costa?

                           grace

             he got off light. with a broken
             wrist and fifty stitches. lucky
             man.

                           director gillet

             my luck has run out. until today
             i have never had to bury a friend.
grace squeezes his arm.

                           grace

             i'm sorry, director.

                           director gillet

             thankfully it's over. we have our
             man. asher's dna matched the
             hairs recovered on ford's body and
             in the apartment.
