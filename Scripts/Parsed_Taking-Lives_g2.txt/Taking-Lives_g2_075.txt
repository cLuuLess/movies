grace and laval.

                        grace

          how do we know costa didn't stage
          this? for attention or something.

                        inspector laval

          he's happy to see you. but the
          alarm was jumpered. do you think
          costa knows how to jumper an
          alarm?

                        grace

          we should take the computer.
costa who has followed them out, overheard.

                        costa

          don't take the computer.    that's
          my brain.
costa turns to grace.

                        costa

          i'm not making this up.     believe
          me.
grace shrugs, sees an atm facing the alley.

                        grace

          should i believe you?
grace crosses to the atm.   peers into its security
camera.

                        grace

          or should i believe this.

                        costa

          believe what you want.
he's cocky, grace likes that.
