int. police car - moving - day

the cop backs up fast.     boom!   another tire.   now the
tree has caught fire.
grace examines costa, running her hands over costa's
battered body.

                        grace

          nothing broken?

                        costa

          i think my hand is broken.

                                               (continued)





                                                        84.





continued:




grace looks at it.      there is no doubt.

                           grace

             don't move, okay.



presses his split scalp.

                           grace

             this hurt?

                            costa

             god yes.   stop that.

                           grace

             you're going to the hospital.
             you'll be fine.

                           costa

             is he dead?

                           grace

             very dead.
costa relaxes significantly. he realizes grace is
holding him in his arms. so does grace. it feels good.
a fire engine heading to the crash passes them.
