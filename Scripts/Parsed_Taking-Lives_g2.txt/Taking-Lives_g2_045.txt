int. bistro - night

grace, reynaud and laval have mussels and beer.      laval
watches the guitarist, a little melancholy.

                           inspector laval

             i'm fair and i keep my promises.
             my informants trust me. i have
             eyes on the trains, on the buses.
             if they see him, they will tell
             me.

                                              (continued)





                                                          35.

                           inspector reynaud

                     (subtitled french)
             maybe they will tell you. why do
             you trust junkies?




                           inspector laval

                     (makes a fist)
             i trust their fear of this.

                           inspector reynaud

                     (subtitled french)
             don't say that in front of her.

                           grace

                     (subtitled french)
             it's okay. i was a street cop in
             philadelphia for three years
             before i joined the fbi.
grace speaks french.      reynaud reacts.    as does laval.

                            inspector reynaud

             very nice.   you like to play
             games.
grace smiles.

                           inspector laval

             mr. ford worked as a cruise-ship
             musician. he would walk around
             and play his guitar on the decks
             at night.

                           grace

             life is pretty cold sometimes.
             man's just trying to spread a
             little music and gets murdered.

                           inspector laval

             he targeted mr. ford the night
             before he was supposed to get on a
             plane and meet a ship in aruba.

                           grace

             only the new improved mr. ford was
             going to meet he ship.

                           inspector reynaud

             think he has a plan b?

                                                (continued)





                                                       36.

                           grace

             i doubt it. he's been so
             meticulous and effective in the
             past, i bet he's never needed one.
             we can assume he has all sorts of
             fake ids and passports.
             disguises. but that's not enough
             for him, he has to be someone
             else. he gets off impersonating
             people. and he knows his current
             persona is compromised.
laval and reynaud have stopped eating, are looking at
her.

                           grace

             what?

                           inspector laval

             you're always thinking. save
             something for tomorrow. we have
             three boxes of evidence to go
             through.

                           grace

             pretty cavalier attitude for a man
             who just got his ass chewed by his
             boss.

                           inspector laval

             my papa dropped dead of a heart
             attack in front of a drill press
             at work. not me.
grace understands.     laval clinks her beer, reynaud too.

                           grace

             i'm dropping by costa's, i still
             have a couple questions.
                     (off laval's look)
             i can't turn it off.
