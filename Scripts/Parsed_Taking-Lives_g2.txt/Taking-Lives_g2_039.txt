int. unmarked car - moving - day

grace and laval get in, reynaud guns it.       grace belts in.

                           inspector reynaud

             i found a current address here in
             montreal.
reynaud leans on the horn, aggressively maneuvering
through traffic.

                           grace

             you guys have an extra weapon? i
             didn't want to cross the border
             armed.

                           inspector reynaud

             the glove box.
grace opens it and finds a compact glock.       she checks it,
shoves it into her pocket.
reynaud swerves into the wrong lane. stops cold in front
of an apartment building. and gets out. great driving.
a mere two blocks away from the crime scene.       laval gets
out. then grace.
