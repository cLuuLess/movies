dan produces a couple beers from his pockets.     offers
martin one.

                            martin

             pisswater.

                           dan

             at least it's cold pisswater.
             here's to getting away.
they clink cans. the driver enters the bus. unlocks the
airbrakes. puts the bus in reverse, gives it gas.
boom! the engine throws a rod. horrible grinding.
smoke wafts into the windows. the driver kills the
engine. silence. martin and dan trade looks.

                           dan

             that was bad.
                     (bummed)
             it's gonna take all day to get
             another bus here.
martin sighs, looks out the window.




what martin sees

a car rental place.







back to scene

martin fingers the envelope of cash in his pocket.

                           martin

             you have a license?

                             dan

             had one.    they took it away.

                            martin
