int. asher house - night

the front door opens. revealing grace, and laval as he
pockets a lockpick gun.

                            inspector laval

             i'll stay outside. kill him if
             he's in there.

                           grace

             yeah, i'll get 'em.
grace enters with a flashlight and a pistol. she
cautiously clears each room until she is sure she is
alone.
grace crosses to the hallway. the little dog is there.
growling. grace tosses it a hamburger patty.

                           grace

             let's be friends.
the dog happily attacks its treat as grace opens the
deadbolts on the door the little dog was guarding.




                                                     49.
