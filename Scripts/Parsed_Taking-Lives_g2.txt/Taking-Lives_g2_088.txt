on costa




lost in thought. he studies a series of vivid paintings
leaning against the wall. he crosses. changes the
order. steps back. something isn't right.




                         carpenter

           mr. costa, some men in that car
           have been watching this place all
           morning.
the carpenters looking out the window.

                         costa

           they're protecting the art. go
           ahead and hang those. be very
           careful.

                         carpenter

           yessir.
costa hears a police radio. spins around. grace and
reynaud have entered. costa is apprehensive. what now?
grace gives him a reassuring smile.

                         grace

           security is going to be very solid
           tonight.
she waves him out of earshot of the carpenters.     their
faces are close. grace gets butterflies.

                         costa

           is he going to show up tonight?
           what do i do, offer him a drink?

                         grace

           he won't show. but we want to be
           here in case he does. four
           plainclothes officers will form a
           perimeter watching the four
           corners.

                         costa

           a perimeter, excellent.

                         grace

           yes. and four plainclothes
           officers will be in here.

                         costa

           mingling? i don't need four
           bruisers crashing through my
           clientele.

                           grace

             the officers will be very
             discreet. we won't interfere with
             your thing.




                             costa

             mingling?

                              grace

             sure.     if you feel safer.

                             costa
