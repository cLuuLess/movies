costa gives grace a look as reynaud tapes a microphone to
the body armor he is wearing.

                           costa

             what if he shoots me in the head?

                           inspector reynaud

             i will take the bullet for you
             like the secret service. okay,
             friend?
reynaud is serious.     grace helps costa with his shirt.

                           costa

             you're good. you could move a lot
             of art if you wanted to.
their eyes meet for a beat.

                           costa

             and inspire some too, i'm sure.
right then something very rare happens; grace blushes.
