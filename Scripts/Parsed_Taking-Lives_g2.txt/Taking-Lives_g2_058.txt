int. the boys' room - day

grace opens the door. bingo. more laughter o.s. a bed,
still made. old toys. sports equipment. an "r" on the
headboard.
on the other side; shadows on the wall where pictures
used to hang. indents in the carpet. where a bed used
to be.
grace's brow furrows.     martin has been erased.
