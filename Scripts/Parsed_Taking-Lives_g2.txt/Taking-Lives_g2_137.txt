int. hotel room - night

grace is in manic cleaning mode. she pulls papers off
the walls. shoves a pile of clothing in the closet.
sweeps coffee cups into a wastebasket.
she opens the door for costa. he enters.        the room is
still a mess, but it feels safe, cozy.

                            grace

             i'm sorry.   i'm a pig.

                           costa

             i don't trust anyone who's too
             organized.
grace puts some music on the clock radio.

                            grace

             want a beer?

                            costa

             please.
she grabs a couple cold ones from the mini-fridge.

                           costa

             which is it, are you a runner or
             chaser?

                           grace

             what's that mean?

                           costa

             people like you --

                           grace

             people like me?

                                                (continued)





                                                            89.





continued:





                           costa

             yeah, people like you. hardcore.
             gung-ho people like you. and you
             know what i mean. people like you
             are either runners or chasers.
grace looks at costa.

                           grace

             you are a trip, john costa.
he's not letting her off the hook.       she plays along.

                          grace

             okay. i guess i'm running and
             chasing.
costa reacts.

                            costa

             i'm sorry.   i didn't know.

                           grace

             growing up i quit speaking after
             that. i didn't say a word for
             three years. when you're not in
             the conversation, you get
             forgotten real quick. so i'd
             watch people. study them. the
             mouth can say anything, but the
             body doesn't lie. the tilt of the
             head, the way the hands move.
grace draws closer.       costa watching her mouth.

                           costa

             how'd you get your voice back?

                           grace

             the day my uncle died. the truth
             exploded out of me like a vision.
             my uncle and father had been
             arguing, there was a gunshot and
             my father was dead.

                           costa

             you are very intense, you know
             that?

                           grace

             i remember my uncle telling me not
             to say anything. and i didn't.

                           (more)


                                               (continued)





                                                         90.





continued:





                            grace (cont'd)

             i made myself forget why. the day
             he died my voice and my memory
             came back. i screamed for an
             hour. very primal. i haven't
             shut up since.

                           costa

             why did your uncle do it?

                           grace

             land. great-grandpa owned half of
             pennsylvania. my uncle wanted
             control and sold it all. all
             that's left is an old farmhouse
             and a horse pasture.
                     (sadly)
             my father's murderer got away with
             it because i couldn't open my
             mouth.

                           costa

             that's a hell of a lot of
             responsibility for you to put on
             the shoulders of an eight-year-old
             girl.
grace blinks, looks at costa.     that's exactly what she
needed to hear.

                           grace

             something good game out of it.
             the dead can't speak. now i'm
             their voice.
costa cups her face and kisses her. grace breaks away, a
little hesitant. something is bothering her.

                           grace

             martin asher is dead, right?
costa reacts.

                           costa

             can we please forget about him?

                            grace

             that's the point. he's dead, so
             there won't be a trial where you
             or i would have to admit under
             oath that we did anything
             inappropriate.

                                                (continued)





                                                          91.





continued:





                           costa

             we haven't done anything.
that's about to change. grace stands, pulls him off the
couch. begins undressing him.
she finds horrible dog-bite scars.

                           grace

             jesus.

                           costa

             in college we tried to make my
             friend's german shepherd take a
             bong hit.

                            grace

             how mean.   serves you right.
costa pulls grace to her feet.
grace retreating. step by step across the room. costa.
pursuing. slowly. determined. the heat. the immediacy
building.
costa grabs her. pushing her. up against the wall.            the
phone clatters to the floor. grace's eyes widen.
two mouths. inches apart. costa's hand reaches up her
skirt. exploring. grace swallows. his hand reaching
into her panties.
grace's eyes looking away. as she grabs his arm.
pulling. pushing. wanting. her mouth. avoiding his.
their breath mingling. until. costa's lips crush down
on hers. the kiss devouring. knocking pictures off the
walls. grace's hands pulling him closer.
costa picks her up. throws her on the bed. he tears at
her blouse. her white lace bra. grace's back arching.
her legs wrapping around him. as her eyes flutter open.
looking up at the ceiling, she gasps.
costa stops. turns. to see what she's looking at.
surprised to see pictures of asher's victims, the crime
scenes. staring down at them.
costa turns to grace, whispers.

                           costa

             let them watch.
grace looking deep into costa's eyes.        nods her head.
costa flips her onto her stomach...




                                                          92.
