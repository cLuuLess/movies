int. unmarked #1 - moving - day

costa is driving towards the mountains.        driving through
the pine forest.

                            asher

             there.   turn there.
a hard-to-see side road. costa jams the brakes to make
the turn. asher slaps him.

                            asher

             careful.

                           costa

             okay. sorry. sorry.      you don't
             want to do this.

                           asher

             yes i do. john, do you have any
             idea how many people i have
             killed? it's always been
             business. this time is personal.

                           costa

             please be cool. c'mon, we don't
             even know each other.

                                                  (continued)





                                                         81.





continued:





                           asher

             shut up. art man. you are stupid
             or crazy or both. will you drive
             faster? i'll shoot you in the
             thigh. will that get your
             attention.
costa speeds up.

                           costa

             don't, man. i got money. you
             want money, i'll give you money.
             i got paintings. what do you
             want? talk to me, martin.

                           asher

             i am not martin. there is no
             martin.

                          costa

             of course. no martin. what do
             you want? what's my life worth to
             you?

                           asher

             nothing. and everything. this is
             deeper than money. shut up. talk
             is done. talk is over.
             understand that. you are over.
             just shut the fuck up.
asher lights a cigarette.     a sharp turn ahead.    costa
speeding up.

                           costa

             okay, please, martin.   martin.   be
             cool.
asher aims his pistol at costa's head.

                           asher

                     (really pissed)
             who the fuck is martin?
costa sets his brow in determination; he is driving
straight at a large tree...
asher reacts.
costa jams his thumb into the release button of asher's
seatbelt...
asher angrily pulls the trigger of his pistol.

                                                (continued)





                                                         82.





continued:




the unmarked car hits the tree...
pow!   airbags deploy.



costa's body is slammed by crash forces but stays put...
asher goes over his airbag.     asher's head goes through
the windshield.
