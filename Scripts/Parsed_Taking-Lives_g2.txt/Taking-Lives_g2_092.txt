int. art gallery - bathroom - night

costa takes a leak.     he's in a good mood.

                                                 (continued)





                                                            66.





continued:




the window above the stalls is open. the noise of the
partying crowd on the sidewalks outside.
costa finishes, washes his hands.        pauses.    smoothes his
hair.




someone behind him

costa looks in the mirror and reacts.
martin asher stares at him from the mirror. no doubt who
it is. asher is wound tight, not at all happy.

                           asher

             put your hands on the wall.
asher jams a gun in costa's back.        costa is very scared.

                           asher

             feel that?

                           costa

             please be cool with that.    i don't
             wanna get hurt.

                           asher

             i should blow your spine out. my
             face is everywhere. i have to
             hide in the shadows like a fucking
             animal because of you.

                           costa

             yessir. i apologize for
             everything you think i may have
             done.

                           asher

             we're moved past sorry. you
             ruined everything. john, soon to
             be dead, costa.
asher's eyes flash. wham! asher slams costa's face into
the mirror. costa's nose bleeds.

                           costa

             stop it!
