int. bistro - day

locals only. the inspector's favorite spot, they are
like family here. grace, laval and reynaud at a table in
back. covered with reports and plates. grace stops
reading. tosses aside a printout.

                           grace

             mr. kohler has been dead two
             years. no doubt about that.
             right?

                           inspector laval

             very solid time of death. two
             years ago.




                           grace

             so before he died he got his
             paychecks, paid his taxes.
             patronized sporting goods stores.
             and had long spending gaps where
             he was enjoying the great
             outdoors. that pattern continues
             a year after his death. he gets
             some paychecks. rents an
             apartment. buys a three thousand
             dollar kayak. pays his taxes.
             dead and buried and still paying
             his taxes. then everything stops.
             last visa charge was to
             travelocity for a plane ticket to
             mexico city.

                           inspector laval

             dead men don't pay their bills.
             it's identity theft.

                           grace

             this isn't someone renting limos
             and fancy dinners on someone
             else's credit. lifestyle and
             habits don't change.

                           inspector laval

             computer error?

                           grace

             too many independent systems.

                            inspector laval

                     (beat)
             we work organized crime sometimes,
             maybe a hit man wanted to lay low.
             he assumed the life of a civilian
             until things cooled off.

                           grace

             you really think a gangster is
             going to break his stride and
             become a long hair groovy river
             guide? inspector, this guy's
             whole life has been stolen.
             someone killed him and became him.
             down to profession and taste in
             clothing.
laval and reynaud trade looks.




                                                     19.
