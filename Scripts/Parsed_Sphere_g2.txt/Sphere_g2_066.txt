     int.  cafeteria

     harry is eating at a table, seems more relaxed.  the team members
     around him, eating too.  beth, cold.  harry sprinkles salt on the dish
     of food in the middle.

                         ted
               hey, go easy on the salt, will ya?
               we're not a bunch of icy streets
               here.

                         harry
               salt's good for you, ted.  helps you
               from getting impotent.

                         ted
               impotent?  i'm not impotent.

               these aren't half bad, fletcher.  you

                         fletcher
               squid... 

     harry stops mid-chew.  frightened.

                         fletcher
               ... there was a whole flock of them
               out there earlier.  it's strange.
               it's dead down here, and then all of
               a sudden --

     harry drops his fork.  he begins coughing.  hacking.  choking loudly.
     gagging.  he hacks out the squid from his mouth... 

                                                            cut to:
