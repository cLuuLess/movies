     int.  video feed room

     on the sonar impulse monitor -- lines jumping higher.  pong.  pong.  pong.

     barnes, norman, beth, and ted watching it.

                         norman
               jerry?

     no response.

                         norman
               jerry?

     the monitor flashes: "i'm not listening" -- blinks back.

     an outside camera feed -- infra-red -- a large image streaks by.

                         barnes
               direction's east coming!

                         beth
               what was that?

     barnes flips a switch... 

                         barnes
               going active.

                         norman
               jerry?

     no response.

                         beth
               it looked like a tentacle.  of a
               squid.

     the monitors -- beeping now.

                         barnes
               a squid?  the size of a whale?  i
               don't think so.
                    (beat)
               target acquired.  sixty yards.

     pong.  pong.  pong.

                         beth
               what if it attacks?

                         barnes
               fifty yards and closing.

                         beth
               what do we use for defense?

                         barnes
               we're a habitat.  not a castle.  the
               only defense we have is high
               voltage.

                         beth
               high voltage?

                         barnes
               it sends 200 volts throughout the
               cylinder surface.  but we've never
               used it underwater before.

     pong.  pong.  pong.

                         barnes
               forty yards.

                         beth
               but you've tested it?

                         barnes
               sure.  each time it started fires
               inside the habitat.

     pong.  pong.  pong.

                         barnes
               thirty yards.

                         beth
               what are you saying -- we can't stop
               what's out there?

     the monitors blink: "i am coming".  the monitor blinks to blank.

                         barnes
               what the hell?
                    (bangs on the monitors)
               it shut us down.

                         norman
               jerry?  please.  stop this.

                         barnes
               ted, go into the control room.
               listen for my instructions.

     ted goes out the door.

     all the monitors -- blank.

                         beth
               where is it?

                         barnes
               why can't i -- ?  what the hell is
               going on here?

     they hear a metallic clanking.

                         beth
               what was that?

                         barnes
               he's right beneath us.

     the monitors blink: "i am here".
