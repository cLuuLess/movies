     int.  labratory

     close on a microscopic image of a jellyfish.

     on norman -- in the corner of the lab, inspecting a medical kit.

                         norman
               what is this, beth?  you taking
               valium?

     beth, looking into the microscope.

                         beth
               sedatives.  whatever my mood calls
               for.

     norman picks up a book, next to the kit: 20,000 leagues under the sea.

                         norman
               where'd this come from?

                         beth
               the library.

                         norman
               we have a library?

                         beth
               a bad one.  it was the only book in
               there.  norman, come here, look at
               this.

                         norman
               no, thank you.  i hate jellyfish.

     walking toward her... 

                         norman
               ... when i was six, my younger
               brother and i -- we went swimming in
               the pacific.  at my mother's beach
               house.  we both felt stinging, and
               when we came out of the water, he
               was wearing jellyfish head to toe.
               killed him.

                         beth
               my gosh, norman.

                         norman
               yeah, it was awful.

                         beth
               what about you?  what happened to
               you?

                         norman
               me?  well, i was wrapped in seaweed.
               it itched for a while, but i
               survived.
                    (beat)
               beth, do you find it... curious that
               we're seeing all this life down
               here.  nothing, and then these
               enormous flocks of squid.  then
               jellyfish?

                         beth
               normally, i'd say no.  everything's
               quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no
               electricity.  makes sense.  but what's
               curious is -- these aren't normal
               jellyfish.

                         norman
               what do you mean -- not normal?

                         beth
               they have six tentacles.  a new
               species.  and the squid too.  they had
               no stomach.

                         norman
               wait a minute.

                         beth
               what?

                         norman
               you knew about the squid not being
               normal.  before fletcher went out
               there?

                         beth
               yeah, why?

                         norman
               and you didn't tell anyone?

     beth, nervous... 

                         beth
               what?  why... 

                         norman
               beth --

                         beth
               i mean, i'm not... i wasn't
               absolutely sure if... they --

                         norman
               they are or they aren't.  which is
               it?

                         beth
               what?...  wait.  don't... why are
               you --

                         norman
               beth.

                         beth
               nobody said... norman...  what?  why
               are you looking at me like that?

                         norman
               beth --

     she backs away from norman, knocking off a speciman jar, it shatters
     on the floor.  she starts breaking down.

     norman watching her, falling to the ground, picking up the glass,
     hurriedly... 

                         beth
               i didn't do anything wrong.  i didn't
               mean... 

                         norman
               beth.

     she's crying, glass in her hands.  she looks up at norman, frightened,
     nervous... 

                         beth
               you wouldn't go and tell the others,
               would you?

     norman hesitates, goes to her, tries to hold her, but she pushes him
     away.

                         beth
               i hate this place, norman.  i want
               out.

                                                            cut to:
