     ext.  street in georgetown -- middle of the night

     fog hangs above the street, amongst the streetlamps.  apartment
     buildings line the curb, it is very quiet.  in one building, six floors
     up, a bedroom light is on.  we see the silhouette of norman's wife
     looking out the window.

                         wife (o.s.)
               what kind of a crash was it?

                         norman (o.s.)
               you seen my suitcase?

                         wife (o.s.)
               there's nothing on the news about a
               crash.  did he say what airline?

                         norman (o.s.)
               he didn't say much at all.  honey --

                         wife (o.s.)
               in the closet.  i don't understand,
               norman -- why would they call you?

                         norman (o.s.)
               don't be so supportive, honey.

                         wife (o.s.)
               well, i can't imagine five years of
               unemployment --

                         norman (o.s.)
               four.  four years --

                         wife (o.s.)
               four years of unemployment would
               look too good on a resume.

                         norman (o.s.)
               keep watching the news.  are you
               watching the news?

                         wife (o.s.)
               how are you getting to the airport?
               you need money for the bus?

     a tinted-window black sedan travels down the street, pulls up in front
     of the apartment building.  a u.s.  navy decal is on the door.

                         wife (o.s.)
               there's a u.s.  navy car outside,
               norman.

                         norman (o.s.)
               what?

                         wife (o.s.)
               was it a military crash?

                         norman (o.s.)
               i don't know.

                         wife (o.s.)
               they never used to send a navy car.

                                                            cut to:

     the loud, hard chopping of a helicopter propeller
