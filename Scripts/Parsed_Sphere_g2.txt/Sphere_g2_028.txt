     int.  cargo bay

     angle on our six team members' boots, in the distance.  as we pan up
     and around we see a curved surface appear: a surface of slowly
     swirling green and blue fluids.  like mercury.  mesmerizlng.

     as we come around, the team stands looking at the sphere, 30 feet in
     dlameter, held by a giant claw gripping it from the top.

     they walk around it, circling it, looking up at it.

                         harry	
               this answers one of our questions.

                         norman
               which one?  let me get the list out.

                         harry
               this spacecraft was designed to pick
               things up.  they see things they want
               -- these claws go out and bring it
               in.  they come across this.  this... 
               sphere.  find it interesting,
               curious.  they draw it inside to take
               back home.

                         norman
               but on the way home, they miss their
               turn, go too far, into the past.

                         harry
               our present.

                         barnes
               but what does it do?  this... sphere.

                         ted
               maybe it's a message of some sort,
               you know?  see this red here.

     angle on the sphere -- some dark red markings on it's surface... 

                         ted
                    (continuing)
               looks like a design, some writing,
               maybe.  maybe it was sent to meet the
               spacecraft with a message.

                         harry
               look closely.  that isn't writing.
               those are grooves.

     on the red grooves -- engraved into the surface.

                         harry
               no.  they don't represent a message.
               they aren't decorative at all.  they
               have another purpose entirely.

                         barnes
               what?

                         harry
               to conceal a small break in the
               surface of the sphere.

                         barnes
               a break for what?
