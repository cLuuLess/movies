     int.  hallway

     barnes walks briskly down the hall, norman with him... 

                         barnes
               he translated it wrong.  "my name is
               jerry"?  it's like "see spot run."

                         norman
               the message doesn't show a lack of
               intelligence.  it's smart.  it's
               approaching us in a simple way.  like
               you would a dog.  holding out your
               hand, letting it sniff, get used to
               you.

                         barnes
               what am i -- a dog, now?

     barnes ducks his head into the video feed room... 

                         barnes
               edmunds, get in here.  i need you for
               this.

                         edmunds
               in a minute, sir.

     back in communications room -

     barnes storming through the room, the others (minus edmunds) around
     the monitor.

                         barnes
               i want a name.  a real name.  this
               thing's full name, rank and serial
               number.

                         ted
               captain, i personally feel we should
               ask much more substantive
               questions --

                         barnes
               i am not gonna explain in some damn
               report that one person died in a
               deepsat expedition so we could meet
               an alien named jerry.

                         harry
                    (on the keyboard,
                    typing)
               first, we have to see if he'll talk
               at all.

     on the monitor -- "0032125252632"

     the monitor blinks, reply:

     "0032125252632"

                         harry
               okay, jerry's talking.

     harry types -- "0002921 301321 0613182108142232"

                         ted
               what'd you say?

                         harry
               "we are friends".

                         barnes
               cut the friends crap, get a name.

     "004212232"

                         harry
               "yes".  good.  now let's see if it'll
               switch over to english letters.

     "0032125252632 = hello"

     reply:

     "0032125252632 = hello"

                         barnes
               it's not talking, it's mimicking.

                         ted
               give him a chance.  he's speaking our
               language, not the other way around.

                         harry
                    (typing)
               good idea, ted.

                         ted
                    (confused)
               thank you.

                         barnes
               what's he doing?

     reply:

     "hello = 0032125252632.  0032125252632 = hello."

                         barnes
               ignorant.  the thing's ignorant.

                         harry
               it's not ignorant.

                         ted
               maybe it's pretending to be
               ignorant.

               are you enjoying yourself, harry,
               because i don't know what the hell
               you're doing.

                         harry
               he understands me fine.

     a long beat.  reply:

     "i am delighted to make your acquaintance.  the pleasure is entirely
     mine i assure you."

     they stare, stunned, at the screen.

                         norman
               well, he's polite.

                         ted
               unless it's an act.

                         beth
               why should it be an act?

     "are you the entity hecho in mexico?"

                         barnes
               mexico?  where'd he get mexico?

     "are you the entity made in the u.s.a.?"

                         ted
               he doesn't wait for an answer.

                         beth
               who says it's a he?

                         barnes
               not now, beth.  please.  i want to
               know who we're talking to before we
               start talking.  where's edmunds?

                         harry
               she's not gonna know, sir.

                         ted
                    (to harry)
               ask him.  c'mon.  say something.

     harry types: "we are.  who are you?"

     reply:

     "we are"

                         barnes
               hell's that mean?  "we are" what?

     harry types: "we are the entities from the u.s.a.  who are you?"

     "entities = entity?"

                         ted
               we have to teach him plurals?

     harry: "no"

     "you are a many entity?"

     "no.  we are many separate entities."

     "i understand.  is there one control entity?"

                         barnes
               what?

                         harry
               he's saying, "take me to your
               leader." he wants to know who's in
               charge.

                         barnes
               i'm in charge.

     "yes.  the control entity is captain harald barnes"

                         barnes
               with an "o".  harold with an "o".

                         harry
               what -- you want me to retype it?

     harry: "who are you?"

     "i am one"

     "where are you from?"

     "i am here"

     "where is the location from where you began?"

                         ted
               "from where you began?" that's not
               even good english.

     "i am from awareness"

                         barnes
               what is that, a planet?

     "where is awareness?"

     "awareness is"

     "did you make a journey?"

     "yes.  did you make a journey?"

     "yes"

     "i make a journey.  you make a journey.  we make a journey together.  i
     am happy."

                         barnes
               great, okay.  ask him about his
               weapons.

                         norman
               that's smart.  let's talk about guns
               and violence.

                         barnes
               you don't think weapons are
               important?

                         norman
               i think we should be careful.
               consider his emotional response.

                         ted
               you want to put him on your couch,
               norman.  grill him about his
               childhood?

                         norman
               when he uses a phrase like "i am
               happy", i think we should think
               twice about what we ask him.

     "do not be afraid"

     the all stare at the screen, stunned.

                         norman
               jerry, can you understand what we're
               saying?

     "every word"

     norman walks up to the screen, close to it.

                         norman
               jerry, can you read our minds?

     "yes norman"

     barnes goes to the intercom... 

                         barnes
               edmunds, i want you in here.  now.

     norman focuses on the screen, staring.

     on the screen -- blank.

     norman concentrating, on the screen.

     the screen -- blank.

                         norman
               jerry, are you there?

     "yes, norman"

                         barnes
               we shouldn't talk here.  shut it off.

     "i do not wish to intrude"

                         norman
               we would like to talk alone.

     "i do not agree.  that is not possible.  i enjoy to talk with you."

                         norman
               and we enjoy talking with you.

     "let us talk now"

                         norman
               we'd like to talk with you more.  we
               admire your talents and your great
               power and understanding.

     "thank you"

                         norman
               and in your great understanding, you
               know that we are entities who must
               talk in private -- with each other.

     "do not be afraid"

                         norman
               we're not afraid, we are
               uncomfortable.

     "am i offended you?"

                         norman
               not at all, we enjoy you very much,
               but we need to talk alone, without
               you listening.

     "i shall oblige"

                         norman
               thank you.

     "but i am not happy"

                         norman
               jerry?... 

     "we'll be right back after a short break for these messages from our
     sponsor"

                         norman
               jerry?  are you still there?

     screen -- blank.

                         norman
               jerry?

                         barnes
                    (into intercom)
               edmunds?  get in here.  i want to know
               exactly how this is being
               transmitted.

                         harry
               she's not gonna know.

                         barnes
               she wired this system.

                         harry
               if the technology of that sphere is
               advanced enough -- the way it
               functions is gonna appear to us like
               magic.

     on ted and norman -

                         ted
               don't gimme that psychology
               bullshit, norman.  psychology isn't a
               science, it's superstition.  it's a
               bunch of soft, subjective theories
               without any hard data to back it up.
               with an intellect like this,
               emotions don't mean shit.

     on harry and barnes -

                         harry
               it's like showing leonardo da vinci
               a laptop computer.  he'd run
               screaming "witchcraft".  and you
               couldn't explain it to him, either.
               modems, microchips, particle
               physics.

                         barnes
                    (into intercom)
               edmunds?

     on ted and norman -

                         ted
               don't make stuff up, these emotional
               theories, just so you can feel
               important here.

                         norman
               frankly, ted, i'd be much happier if
               jerry was just a cold, emotionless
               intellect.

                         ted
               why's that?

                         barnes
                    (into intercom)
               edmunds?

                         norman
               because if jerry is powerful and
               also emotional... 

                         barnes
               damn it, edmunds?

                         norman
               ... it raises a very serious
               question: what happens if jerry
               gets mad?
