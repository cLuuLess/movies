     on a monitor -- fletcher outside, with the jellyfish.

                         barnes
                    (into the mic)
               fletcher?  what are you doing out
               there?

                         fletcher (o.s.)
               they're like pink snow, sir.  sticky.

                         ted
               she says jellyfish are a delicacy.
               you know, i never knew that.

                         barnes
               get out of there.  i don't want anyone
               going anywhere outside, understood?

                         fletcher (o.s.)
               they're warm.  i can feel the heat on
               my legs.

                         barnes
               fletcher, i want you back here.

               what happened to you inside that
               sphere, harry?

                         harry
               why?  does someone else want to go
               inside?
