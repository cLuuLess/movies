     ext.  ship -- late at night

     the sky -- clouds looming on the horizon.

     angle on arthur levine, leaning against the railing, looking out at
     the water.

     on norman, approaching him.  arthur never looks at norman, he just
     stares out at the water.

                         arthur
               i don't know you, but i'll be honest
               with you.  i don't like this.  i don't
               like any of this.  especially, the
               water.

                         norman
               seasick?  a marine biologist?

                         arthur
               i don't belong here.  none of us
               belong here.  look at that.

     angle on the water, an ocean of seemingly endless, choppy waves.

                         norman
               makes you feel pretty small, doesn't
               it?

                         arthur
               it scares the shit out of me.

     close on norman, lying on a cot.  it is dark.  his eyes are open.  he
     stares at the ceiling.
