     int.  tech room

     barnes leads norman through the room, crammed with video monitors,
     screens, and grids.  officers talk into radios.  technicians work on
     computers.

                         barnes
               we're moving fast considering the
               storm.

                         norman
               storm?  what storm?

                         barnes
               a cyclone's on it's way in.  i
               thought they would have told you on
               the phone.

                         norman
               they didn't tell me anything.

     norman tries to keep pace...

                         barnes
               we've had divers working around the
               clock.  take a look at this...

     angle on a large video screen -- shows a diver walking on the ocean
     floor, holding a bright artificial flashlight.

                         norman
               how deep is he?

                         barnes
               a thousand feet.

                         norman
               a thousand?  an airplane crashes into
               a thousand feet of water -- i don't
               want to sound pessimistic here, but
               i assume there are no survivors.

                         barnes
               survivors?  no, i wouldn't think so.

                         norman
               then why am i here?

                         barnes
               what?

                         norman
               what do you need me for?

     on the video screen -- the diver shines his light on a large, metallic
     object.

                         barnes
               what crashed wasn't an airplane, dr.
               johnson.  it's a bit larger than
               that.

     barnes walks toward a technician, sitting at a keyboard.

                         barnes
                    (to technician)
               bring up the grid, would you?

     angle on the monitor as an image of the craft begins to form.

                         norman
               what is it?  a military spacecraft?
               like a shuttle or satellite?

                         barnes
               something like that.
                    (beat)
               that doesn't surprise you?

                         norman
               not really, no.  something of the
               military crashes in the ocean -- it
               explains why there was nothing on
               the news, why you've kept everything
               a secret...  when did it crash?

                         barnes
               as best we can estimate, it crashed
               four hundred years ago.

     a beat.

                         norman
               four hundred?  you're kidding, right?

     angle on the monitor -- showing a grid depicting an image of the craft
     and a small layer of rock above it.

                         barnes
               see this?  coral.  geologists measured
               the coral growth on top of the craft
               to be over five meters thick.

                         norman
               geologists?

                         barnes
               coral grows at a rate of two and a
               half centimeters a year --

                         norman
               -- wait a second --

                         barnes
               -- dating the crash at least that
               old.

                         norman
               hold on --

                         barnes
               maybe older --

                         norman
               -- there's got to be some mistake
               here -- a four hundred year old
               military spacecraft?  there's no such
               thing... our space program isn't even
               forty years old.

                         barnes
               extraordinary, isn't it?

                         norman
               it's impossible.

                         barnes
               i'm afraid it is dr. johnson...
               because it's sitting on the bottom
               of our ocean floor.
