     int.  labratory

     close on an egg

     beth, scalpel in hand, is making an incision into the shell.

                         beth
               looking at the coating here, it's
               definitely marine invertebrate.

     barnes, norman, harry and ted stand around the table.

                         barnes
               well, until we know exactly what it
               is, nobody goes outside, understood?

                         ted
               what was edmunds doing outside?

                         barnes
               resetting the sub.

                         ted
               what sub?

                         barnes
               in the dome hanger.  all our tapes
               are transferred to the sub.  it's on
               a 12 hour timer.  if someone doesn't
               reset the "delay" button, the sub
               ascends to the surface with the
               tapes.

                         norman
               what for?

                         barnes
               if something should happen to us,
               the navy will at least have partial
               records of what happened.

                         norman
               at least our obituaries will be
               accurate.  that's reassuring.

     on the egg -- splitting open.  a slimy pinkish-brown fluid oozes out.  a
     fetus underneath.

     they cover their mouths from the smell.

                         barnes
               what is it?

     beth picks at it with forceps... 

                         beth
               i'm not sure.  i've never seen
               anything like it.

                         barnes
               you're a fucking biochemist, aren't
               you?  can't you tell us something.

     beth glares at barnes...
