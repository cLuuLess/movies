     ext.  decompression chamber

     two navy crewmen stand outside the door, looking in.

                         crewman #1
               has anyone spoken to them yet?

                         crewman #2
                    (shakes his head)
               the admiral's going over the tapes
               they brought up now.

                         crewman #1
               does he know yet what really
               happened down there?

     looking inside -- norman, harry, and beth sit at a table.
