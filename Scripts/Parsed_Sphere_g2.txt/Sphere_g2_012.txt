     int.  briefing room

     on a video screen -- sonar video of the spacecraft.

                         beth (o.s.)
               how big is this spacecraft?

                         barnes (o.s.)
               of what we're able to measure,
               roughly twenty-six hundred feet.

                         ted (o.s.)
               a half a mile long?

                         barnes
               the wing dimension alone is larger
               that any aircraft we've seen.

     the team members sit around the conference table:

     ted fielding, 41, geologist, boyish and happy to be here.  beth
     halperin, 36, biochemist, mother of three who's never worn an apron.
     arthur levine, 54, marine biologist, pudgy and quiet.  harry adams, 32,
     mathamatician, african-american, wire-glasses, no bullshit.

                         harry
               how much damage?

                         barnes
               to the craft?  none.  not a scratch.

                         harry
               right.  so you're saying it survived
               a high speed impact with water
               without a scratch?

                         barnes
               i'm not saying anything, harry, i'm
               just stating the facts.
                    (continuing)
               the outer metal is made of a
               titanium alloy, built into an epoxy-
               resin honeycomb.  the necessary
               technology to bond this type of
               metal has never been invented.

                         ted
               never invented?

     on norman, watching the team...

                         beth
               in basic english, what does all this
               mean?

                         barnes
               basic english?  there's no way this
               spacecraft was constructed on our
               planet.

     a loud mechanical whirr
