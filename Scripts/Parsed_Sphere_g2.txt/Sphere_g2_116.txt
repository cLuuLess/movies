     int.  hallway

     norman and the navy seaman walk down the hall.

                         norman
               how are the others?

                         navy seaman
               the others, sir?

                         norman
               beth and harry?

                         navy seaman
               they're in the sub, sir.  waiting.

     norman sighs, smiling.  the relief, the jubilation.

                         norman
               that whole time -- i couldn't stop
               thinking of what harry was saying
               earlier... 

                         navy seaman
               what was that, sir?

                         norman
               about the time paradox.
                    (the seaman nodding)
               how we were all going to die --
               that there was no way we would make
               it out of here alive --

     as norman looks up, the navy seaman, still walking and nodding, begins
     to slowly disappear.  disintigrating.  vanishing before his eyes.

     norman stops, looks around him.  he's gone.
