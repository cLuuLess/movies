     beth yelling... 

                         beth
               don't do it, norman!

                         barnes (o.s.)
               do you see it?

     on norman -- turning from beth, to the lever.

                         norman
               i see it.

                         barnes (o.s.)
               pull it.

                         beth
               don't pull it, norman.  it'll start a
               fire we can't stop.  norman?

                         barnes (o.s.)
               do it, norman, it's the only choice
               we have.  this thing is gonna crush
               us.

                         beth
               norman, don't do it!

     bang!  the walls creaking and screeching.
