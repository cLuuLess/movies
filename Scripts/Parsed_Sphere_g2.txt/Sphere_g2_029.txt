     int.  habitat -- hallway

     down a long corridor -- we see barnes, through a half-closed door,
     pacing, talking on the phone... 

                         barnes
               ... it's definitely something alien
               ... another civilization, yes, sir... 
               well, we don't know yet, but we
               think we've found a door...
