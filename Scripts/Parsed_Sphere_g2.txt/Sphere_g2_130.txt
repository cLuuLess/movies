     int.  corridor

     harry is walking towards the living quarters... 

                         norman (o.s.)
               remember when we first spoke to
               jerry, barnes kept asking for
               jerry's real name?  but harry never
               would?  he didn't because he was
               afraid the screen would say "harry",
               instead of jerry.  we weren't talking
               to an alien intelligence when we
               talked to jerry, we were talking to
               harry... or a part of harry.

                         beth (o.s.)
               what do you mean, a part of harry?

     back in -- control room

                         norman
               when did the messages start?  the
               animals outside start showing up?
               after harry came out of the sphere.

                         beth
               you think, in the sphere --

                         norman
               he acquired some sort of power.  a
               power to manifest things.

                         beth
               but how?

                         norman
               i don't know.

                         beth
               how can the sphere do that?

                         norman
               i don't know, beth.  i'm not the
               fucking alien that built the thing.
               but it can.  when harry came out of
               the sphere, he mumbled something
               about page 87.  how he would never
               read that far -- he was too scared
               to.  then you found the book,
               remember in your lab.  then in the
               cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about
               a giant squid... 

                         beth
               which i told barnes was attacking --

                         norman
               it's his fear.  the squid.  he's
               manifesting his fears.  making them
               real.

                         beth
               but why is he doing it?

                         norman
               he must not realize he is.  like the
               navy crewman -- harry was sleeping
               then.  he must've manifested his
               dream.

                         beth
               his dream?  you can't control your
               dreams.  and you can't control your
               fears, can you?

                         norman
                    (shaking his head)
               no.  i mean, we've always believed we
               can think anything we want without
               consequences.  you ever read the
               bible?
                    (off her look)
               it talks about our sinful nature,
               you know?  i mean, we can think, and
               believe, and desire whatever we
               want, but there's a part of us -- a
               shadow side, as jung called it --
               that can't be controlled.  it's evil.
               it's inside us.  it's what we are.

                                                            cut to:

     in -- the living quarters

     it's dark.  harry lies on his bunk, asleep.

                         beth (o.s.)
               and that's the part of harry that's
               being manifested.

                         norman (o.s.)
               must be.  and if it is -- it's a part
               of him not even he can control.

     harry opens his eyes, stares at us.

     we begin to hear a low insistent beeping...
