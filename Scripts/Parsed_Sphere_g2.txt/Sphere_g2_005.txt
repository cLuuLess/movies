     she leads norman down a flight of stairs.

                         officer
               captain barnes wants to see you
               right away, sir.

                         norman
               captain who?

                         officer
               barnes.  he's very eager to meet you.
               been calling us every half hour to
               see if you're arrived.

                         norman
               really?

     as they march down a hallway, norman looks down at his wrinkled suit,
     tries to smooth it out.

                         officer
               by the way sir, i've read your
               report.  i think it's brilliant.

                         norman
               what report?

                         officer
               you mean they haven't told you yet?

                         norman
               told me what?

     she staightens up, like she might have said too much.

                         officer
               this way, sir.
