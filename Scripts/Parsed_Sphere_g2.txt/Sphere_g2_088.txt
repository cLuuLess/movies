     barnes, norman, beth, and ted are gathered around the monitors.  barnes
     addresses norman... 

                         barnes
               i don't want you talking to jerry.

                         norman
               but sir, i think it's imperative.  i
               think the messages, the animals
               we've seen, what killed edmunds, the
               reading you got earlier -- i think
               they're all related.

                         ted
               jerry isn't hostile, norman.  he said
               earlier -- we were his friends --

                         norman
               of course he did.  he's been isloated
               for 400 years.  he wants someone to
               talk to.  look, you put a human being
               in isolation for four days, they can
               become neurotic, sometimes
               psychotic.  we're talking about 400
               years here.  an alien that shows
               emotional responses.  i think we need
               to address him, before he reacts
               further.

                         barnes
               you think he killed edmunds?

                         norman
               yes, i do.  whatever's out there, i
               think is his response to us refusing
               to talk to him earlier.

                         barnes
               bullshit.  what's out there isn't
               alien.  it's an animal.

                         norman
               maybe so.  but i think we need to ask
               jerry about it.

                         barnes
               no.  i think we should shut down the
               communication lines inside the
               habitat.  he might be listening now.

                         beth
               i think he already is.

     they turn to the monitors:

     on the monitor: "do not ignore me"

                         beth
               nice work, captain sir.

                         barnes
               shut up, beth.  i don't want to hear
               it.

                         norman
               jerry, we don't want to ignore you.

     "don't underestimate my power"

                         norman
               we don't.

     "yes you do"

                         norman
               jerry --

     the monitor blinks back -- we see the sphere.  it is closed.  still.

     we hear the sensor: pong.  pong.  pong.

                                                            cut to:
