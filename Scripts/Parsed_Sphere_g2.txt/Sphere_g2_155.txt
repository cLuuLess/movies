     ext.  ocean -- underwater

     his body upside down, his hand holding onto the frame.  he grabs a pipe
     next to it, pulls himself hand over hand, along the pipe.

     his face -- straining from the freezing chill.

     moving along the pipe, hand over hand.  he loses grip.  his body thrusts
     upwards.

     close on his right hand -- purple, frozen, holding onto the pipe.
     barely gripping.

     his face -- his eyes fluttering.  he blows air from his mouth, bubbles
     burst from his lips.

     his body slightly descending.

     his left hand -- grips the pipe.  he continues on.

     hand over hand.  pulling himself... 

     under the habitat

     he scoots along, but slower, now.  he stops.  can't continue.  he clasps
     his hand to his chest, it's burning.  he sees the airlock.  his eyes
     fluttering, he's losing consciousness.  he can't do it.  and he lets go
     of the pipe.

     floating upwards -- is he gone?

     his head -- bangs into the habitat floor.  his body flat underneath it.
     being sucked upwards against it.

     he pushes forward... trying to grab the floor with his hands.  he's
     inches from the airlock.

     plants his feet against the wall -- and pushes forward.  his body
     sucked up and away...
