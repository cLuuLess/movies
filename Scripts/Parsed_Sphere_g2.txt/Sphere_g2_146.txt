     int.  video feed room

     harry lying on the stretcher, still.

     norman watching him from above, sipping his coffee.

     hears a soft beeping

     norman goes to the console, sits.  checks the monitors.  looks around
     the console, not knowing what it is.

     a flashing light on the sensor board.  norman still doesn't know what
     it means.

     the monitors go blank.

                         norman
               beth --

     the monitors flash up: "i am coming."

     norman spins around, goes to harry -- lying still.  norman grabs
     harry's wrist.  checking pulse.

     norman returns to the console, slips on the headset... 

                         norman
               beth?  beth?  can you hear me?  get the
               hell out of there.

     the monitors boot up again.  norman looks at the sub video monitor --
     the sub is gone from under the dome.

                         norman
               beth?
                    (beat)
               beth?  shit.

     no reply.  more beeping.  panicking.  bangs on the headset.

                         norman
               beth?  i'm getting some sort of
               reading.  there's something --

     he scans the monitors, looking for movement.  anything.  they are all
     still.

     norman turns to looks at harry... 

     close on harry's face -- still.

     back on -- norman, sweating... 

                         norman
               and whatever it is, it's not coming
               from harry.

     norman looks at the monitors:

     on an outside camera feed -- a bright light blinds the screen.  it's
     beth in the sub, moving along the habitat.

     the sub's claw arms carry large red boxes.  the lettering on the boxes
     isn't in focus.

     norman squints at the monitor -- can't make it out.

                         norman
               beth?  what is that?  what are you
               doing?

     the sub's claw arms drops one of the boxes, plumping it softly on the
     muddy floor.

                         norman
               can you hear me?  beth?  can you copy?
               get inside, there's something out
               there.

     on another monitor -- the sub moves forward.  churning up the sediment.
     it stops again, and releases another box.

     norman bangs on the headset.

                         norman
               damn it, beth, i know you hear me.

     the monitors blink: "i am coming for you"

     on norman -- breathing heavy.

                         norman
               what the hell?

     another monitor -- the sub in view -- a closer view.  it releases it's
     last box.  norman can read the lettering now: "caution: tevac
     explosives"

                         norman
               beth?  c'mon.  what are you -- ?

     the monitors flash: "i will kill you"

                         norman
               oh shit.

     norman whips off his headset, bursts out of his seat, opens a cabinet.
     searching for tapes.  another cabinet.  then another.

     a shelf labled: "sphere" -- all the tapes are gone.

                         norman
               it's her.

     the monitors flash: "i will kill you"

     on the headset -- resting on the console.  we hear faintly... 

                         beth (o.s.)
               norman?  norman?
