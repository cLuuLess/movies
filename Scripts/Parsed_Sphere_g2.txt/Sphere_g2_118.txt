     int.  airlock

     reflected in the pool of water -- we see beth, slipping on her boots.

                         norman (o.s.)
               where are you going in such a hurry?

                         beth
               i have to reset the sub.

     norman stands in the doorway... 

                         norman
               forget the sub.

                         beth
               don't bother me, norman.

                         norman
               it's not worth the risk.

                         beth
               it's also our only way out of here!
               it holds three people.  and there's
               only three of us left now.

                         norman
               you, me and harry?

                         beth
               you, me and harry.  he's asleep.

                         norman
               wake him, then.  let's go.  get
               outta --

                         beth
               we can't.  the storm.  the waves would
               toss us around worse than we got
               down here.  and we have four days of
               decompression when we get up top.

                         norman
               four days?

                         beth
               get the helium out of our
               bloodstream.  we go to the surface
               now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.

     she begins to put on her helmet, when she stops.

                         beth
               maybe you should go.  to the sub.

                         norman
               why should i go?

                         beth
               you should know how it works.  just
               in case.

                         norman
               in case you die, too?

                         beth
               i don't trust harry to do it.

                         norman
               i would.  but my suit --

                         beth
               i fixed your suit.

     she goes to it.  brings it to him.

                         norman
                    (watching her closely)
               you fixed my suit?

                         beth
               you don't trust me?

                         norman
               but i don't know how --

                         beth
               you press a button, norman.  it's not
               brain surgery.  here, go ahead.  you
               only have 15 minutes to reset it.  go
               on, norman... 

     she hands him a briefcase, the tapes inside.

                         beth
               ... i'll watch the sensors for you.
