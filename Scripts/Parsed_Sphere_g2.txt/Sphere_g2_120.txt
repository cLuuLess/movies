     int.  sub

     norman sits in the small seat.

                         norman
               i'm in.
                    (beat)
               hello?

     no answer.  he bangs at his helmet... 

                         norman
               beth?

     he searches the sub's control panel.  gadgets, switches, buttons.  up
     top -- a flashing red-lit button: "timer hold".  punches it.  it stops
     flashing, and a small screen glows: "timer reset -- count: 12:00:00".
     it begins counting backwards.

                         norman
               beth?  hello?

     no answer.  he looks at the control panel:

     a video screen with the choices: "descend, ascend, secure,
     shutdown... "

     thump!

     the sub slightly sways.

     norman sits still, nervous.

     thump!  harder this time.

     norman looks through the glass windshield.  sweating.  can't see
     anything in here.

     bang!  it sways faster, harder, back and forth.  he grips the seat.

                         norman
               beth!  beth!  there's something -- !

     thump!  bang!  he's thrown around in the sub.  he can't see anything,
     tosses around.  he reaches for the doorhandle.

     bang!  he looses grip, his legs fly up in the air.  the sub almost turns
     over on it's side.

                         norman
               beth!  shit!

     his helmet bangs into the glass, we see his look of terror.  water
     splashing up from below.

     then, everything stops.

     the sub sways to a still.  he sits quietly.  waiting.  listening.

     reaches for the doorhandle, cautiously climbs out.

     stands on top of the sub.  keeping balance.  he looks around, finds a
     door inside the dome.  tries to open it.  locked.

     looks around.  nothing else.  looks down at the water.  can he risk it?
     his breathing short.

                         norman
               beth?  can you hear me?

     no reply.  he dips his leg slowly, quietly into the water.  grimacing.
     then, cautiously slips down into the water...
