               sir, if the subs haven't left by
               now... 

                         barnes (o.s.)
               they've left, keep watching!

                         edmunds
               sir!  sir, the door -- it's opening.

     on the monitor -- the sphere door, slowly opening.  revealing:
     blackness.

                         barnes (o.s.)
               where is he?  damn it!  can you see
               him?

     a still moment and then harry tumbles out the sphere, and falls to the
     ground.
