     int.  video feed room

     close on monitor: video of the sphere.  rapidly rewinding.

               what caused it?

                         edmunds
               nothing.  i don't know.  everything
               was normal.  no changes at all.

                         harry
               when did it happen?

                         edmunds
               seconds ago.  here!

     playback: we see the sphere -- idle.  nothing around it.  then it's door
     slowly opens, revealing blackness inside.  a beat.  and then it closes.

                         barnes
               let me see that again.

     edmunds plays it again.  this time... 

     we move in on harry, staring at the monitor.

                         harry
                    (to himself)
               i'd sure like to open it and see.

     on harry -- those cold, intelligent eyes.
