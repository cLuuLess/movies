     int.  living quarters

     harry on his bunk, staring at the wall, flicking his middle finger at
     his cheek: thwap... thwap.

                         harry
               you realize, norman, that we are all
               going to die.

     norman is lying in his own bunk, below harry.

                         norman
               don't be so optomistic, harry.

                         harry
               i'm completely serious.  there is
               something very important missing
               from that spacecraft.  you know what
               that is?

                         norman
               not a clue.

                         harry
               a sign that the builders knew time
               travel through a black hole was
               possible.

                         norman
               i don't follow you.

                         harry
               on that flight recorder, they called
               the black hole an "unknown entry
               event." they didn't know what a
               black hole was.  fifty years from
               now, men are going to build that
               ship in a very tentative,
               experimental way, with no knowledge
               that time travel through a black
               hole is possible.

                         norman
               so what?

     harry leans his head over his bunk.

                         harry
               so, we know.
                    (beat)
               we know it went through a black
               hole.  we saw it.  norman -- when we'd
               get to the surface, we'd tell
               someone about the black hole,
               wouldn't we?  it'd go in some report
               like some big discovery.  so in fifty
               years when they build that ship,
               they'd make precautions for a black
               hole.
                    (beat)
               but they didn't.  the called it an
               unknown entry event.

                         norman
               meaning we're never gonna get the
               chance to tell anyone.

                         harry
               meaning we're never gonna get to the
               surface alive... to tell anyone.

     norman gets out of his bed.

                         norman
               i can't believe that, harry.

                         harry
               gimme another explanation.

     norman pacing.

                         norman
               i can't.  if i had a minute to think,
               maybe, but i know you're wrong.

                         harry
               am i?

                         norman
               look -- we're under a lot of
               pressure, we're tired, you're not
               thinking straight.

                         harry
               you mean, you think i'm cracking?

                         norman
               no.  i didn't say that.

                         harry
               then what, norman?

     norman stops pacing, a beat.

                         norman
               it's what's in that sphere, isn't
               it, harry?  whatever you think is in
               that thing -- you think it's going
               to kill you.

                         harry
               curious, isn't it?  what's inside?
               before i die, i'd sure like to open
               it and see.
