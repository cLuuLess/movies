     int.  living quarters

     harry, on his bunk with decoding papers in his hands, turns to norman,
     entering the room.

                         norman
               getting anywhere with those?

                         harry
               there's some sort of pattern here.
               it'll take a minute.

                         norman
               have you looked outside?  jellyfish.
               everywhere.  i hate jellyfish.
                    (sits on the table)
               harry, what happened in the
               cafeteria?

                         harry
               don't do this.  don't psychoanalyze
               me.  i hate squid.  period.  just like
               you hate jellyfish.

                         norman
               you said something to me, before --
               about how we were all going to die.

                         harry
               did i?

                         norman
               you don't remember that?

                         harry
               i don't remember much.  it's like my
               memory is on the tip of my tongue --
               but i can't taste any of it.  funny,
               my senses are much keener though.
               purer.  hearing, seeing, smelling.
               like, i can smell your sheets,
               norman.  you tried to wash it out
               earlier, but i can still smell the
               urine.
                    (beat)
               don't worry, i'm not going to tell
               the others.  it's normal, really,
               isn't it?  in a crisis.  the stress.
               the panic.
