               after the attack, a navy guy woke me
               up -- i don't know -- i thought he
               was an illusion.  but i checked the
               tape, and jerry said he manifested
               him.

                         beth
               manifested?

                         norman
               created.  brought to life.  i don't
               know.  but at the end, jerry said,
               "stop calling me jerry".  and --

     norman stops, staring at the pad.

                         norman
               he translated it wrong.

                         beth
               what?

     norman picks up the pad of paper, reads... 

                         norman
               hello.  how are you?  i am fine.  what
               is your name?...  my name is harry.
