     int.  labratory

     close on the medical cabinet -- whipping open.

     norman quickly digs through the medicines... 

                         norman
               diphenyl parlene.

                         beth (o.s.)
               something for burns.

                         norman
               ephedrine hydrochloride.

     beth at the computer, looking up the names... 

                         beth
               it's for motion sickness.

                         norman
               valdomet.

                         beth
               ulcers.

                         norman
               sintag.

                         beth
               a synthetic opium analogue.

                         norman
               does it cause drowsiness?  that's all
               we need.  to get him unconscious --
               put him under.

                         beth
               nothing about drowsiness.

                         norman
               tarazine?

                         beth
               tranquilizer.  causes drowsiness.

                         norman
               bingo.

                         beth
               "... and may also cause bizarre
               halucinations".

     norman throws it on the floor.  picks another... 

                         norman
               riordan?

                         beth
               antihistamine.  for bites.

                         norman
               damn it!  chloramphenicol?

                         beth
               antibiotic.

                         norman
               parasolutrine?

                         beth
               how do you spell it?

                         norman
               p-a-r-a-s-o... 

                         beth
               it's a soporific.

                         norman
               what's that?

                         beth
               causes sleep.

                         norman
               it's like a sleeping pill?

                         beth
               "... used as an anesthetic if given
               in combination with paracin
               trichloride... "

     norman digs, finds paracin trichloride... 

                         norman
               here we go.

                                                            cut to:

     beth -- mixing the medicines... 

                         norman (o.s.)
                    (reading from the
                    computer)
               "20 cc's of parasolutrine in
               combination with 6 cc's of paracin
               given iv produces deep sleep
               suitable for emergency surgical
               procedures... no cardiac side effects
               ... rem activity is surpressed... "

                         beth
               how long does it last?

                         norman
               three to six hours.

                         beth
               i'll just boost the doses.

                         norman
               what?  wait -- isn't that dangerous?

                         beth
               how fast does it take effect?

                         norman
               doesn't say.

                         beth
               what if it takes 20 minutes, norman?
               what if it takes an hour?  and he can
               fight it off?  we can't afford that.

     beth goes to the cabinet, grabs another medicine.  norman comes over as
     she adds it to the mix... 

                         norman
               what is that?  what are you doing?
               what do you want to do -- kill him?

     a beat... 

                         beth
               it's an idea.

                         norman
               beth --

                         beth
               to be on the safe side.  i mean --

                         norman
               you want to kill him?

                         beth
               look, it's either him or us, norman.
               another attack, and we go down with
               this place.

     she fills the large syringe with the clear liquid mix.

                         beth
               you ever given an injection before.

                         norman
               thirty years ago.  in residency.  i
               passed out.  you?

                         beth
               only lab rats.  here.

     she hands him the syringe... 

                         beth
               give him the whole thing.  hurry,
               before he wakes up.

     norman looks at the syringe, like it's an assault rifle.

                         norman
               where do i stick it?
