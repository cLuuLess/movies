     fletcher leads barnes and the team members down the hallway.  each of
     them wears the "talkers" around their necks.

                         barnes
               they pressurize us with helium.

               what's wrong with oxygen?

                         barnes
               it's a corrosive gas.  on earth, it
               makes a half-eaten apple turn brown
               and puts the ugly, iron rust on an
               oldsmobile.  at a pressure this low,
               oxygen becomes toxic.  breathe it
               down here, and it'll do to your dick
               what it does to the oldsmobile.

               important safety tip.  thanks
               captain.

     fletcher listens through her radio earpiece, turns to barnes...

               captain, the divers have the airlock
               mounted at the door.  the robot is
               now in position to enter the
               spacecraft.

                         ted
               robot?  what robot?
