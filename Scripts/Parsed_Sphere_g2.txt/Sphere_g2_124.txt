     norman and harry at the mic... 

                         beth (o.s.)
               ... what do you mean?  i'm in the
               ship.

                         norman
               what are you doing in the ship?
                    (beat)
               beth?

                         beth (o.s.)
               getting food.  we were out of food.
               what's wrong?  you sound mad.

                         norman
               yeah, well, i get that way when i'm
               facing death and someone deserts me.

                         beth (o.s.)
               deserts you?  harry said he'd take
               over for me.

                         norman
               he what?

     harry shakes his head: "no way".

                         beth (o.s.)
               when he woke up, he said we were out
               of food.  he told me to get some from
               the ship.

                         harry
               i never said that.

                         beth (o.s.)
               yes you did.  norman, i wouldn't
               leave you out there.  you know that.

                         harry
               we never even had a conversation,
               norman.

                         beth (o.s.)
               harry?  that's bullshit.  we stood
               right there --

     harry covers the mic... 

                         harry
               she's cracking, norman.

                         norman
               you didn't say that about the food?

                         harry
               i was just in the cafeteria, there's
               plenty of food in there.  take a look
               for yourself.

                         norman
               but why would she -- ?

                         harry
               she's lying, norman.  just like she
               lied about fixing your suit.

     harry uncovers the mic... 

                         beth (o.s.)
               you get it straightened out?

                         norman
               i think so, beth.  yes.
