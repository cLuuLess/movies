     int.  barnes' office

     as the door opens, barnes is putting down the phone, rises from his
     desk, as norman steps inside.

                         barnes
               dr. norman johnson.  welcome aboard.

     they shake hands.

                         norman
               thank you, colonel.

                         barnes
               captain.

                         norman
               captain.  right, forgive me.

     barnes looks at norman, sizing him up.  an akward silence.

                         norman
               well, thanks for the opportuninty
               here -- my wife appreciates it.

                         barnes
               don't thank me, dr. johnson.  you
               weren't my choice.  the pentagon made
               me take you.

                         norman
                    (smiling)
               the pentagon?  i didn't know i had
               friends in washington.

     norman tries to laugh as barnes ushers him to the door...

                         barnes
               come with me.  the team's already
               waiting.

                         norman
               what team?
