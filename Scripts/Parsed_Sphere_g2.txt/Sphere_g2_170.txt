     norman in the seat.  beth's leg hangs over his right shoulder.  harry
     looks at norman who assesses the flight controls.

                         harry
               you know how to work this thing?

                         norman
               no idea.

                         harry
               well, press something!

                         norman
               wait!

                         man (o.s.)
               two minutes and counting.

                         harry
               how long did you say --

                         norman
               shut up.  let me think.

     norman presses a button.

     the screen -- blinks: "descend, ascend, secure, shutdown... "

     norman hits "ascend".  the sub whirrs, rumbles and drops down below.

     norman works the steering wheel, gliding it upwards.
