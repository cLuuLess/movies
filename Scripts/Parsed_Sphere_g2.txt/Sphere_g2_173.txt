     int.  sub

     harry looking down below him... 

                         man (o.s.)
               thirty seconds to detonation.

                         harry
               the shock wave's gonna crush us,
               norman.

                         norman
               maybe.  brace yourself.

     harry just stares at norman.  norman grabs beth, trying to stablilize
     her.

                         harry
                    (off norman's suit)
               how's that working out, by the way?

                         norman
               good.  thank you.  now that i have it
               on.
                    (harry laughs)
               why are you laughing?  you don't even
               know what that means.

                         harry
               no.  i don't.  but i always said to
               myself, when i die, i want to die
               laughing.

     harry laughs.

     ascending... waiting... and then... 

     a thunderous explosion below them... 

     rocking the sub, spinning it up and around, surging it upwards to the
     surface.

     through the windshield -- racing toward the surface, toward the
     sunlight -- it's blinding -- and the screen goes white.

                                                            cut to:
