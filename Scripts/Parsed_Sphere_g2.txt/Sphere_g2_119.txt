     ext.  underwater

     norman drops to the bottom with the briefcase.  lands on the ground.
     breathing.  checks his life support badge.  she must've fixed it.

                         beth
               you're clear, norman.

     he walks along, out from under the habitat.  carefully, looking around.

                         beth (o.s.)
               the sub's a 100 feet in front of
               you.  you see it?

                         norman
               i can't see anything.  how does it
               look?  still clear?

                         beth (o.s.)
               still clear.

     norman, hesitantly, ventures out.  the dark water.  looking around.
     anything could be out here.  walking.  we hear him breathing.  his
     breathing gets shorter.  he looks at his life support badge.

                         beth (o.s.)
               what's the matter?

                         norman
               you fixed this suit?
                    (no reply)
               beth?

                         beth (o.s.)
               yes, norman.  i did.  you're just
               nervous.

                         norman
               my air isn't... i'm coming back.

                         beth (o.s.)
               you can't.  counter's at 10 minutes.
               you don't have time.

     his breathing is short, but managable.  he continues on.

     ahead of him -- the dome hanger attached to a large, gray cylinder,
     forty feet high.

                         norman
               still clear?

                         beth (o.s.)
               still clear.

     underneath the dome hanger -- norman climbs up to the hatch door.  looks
     below him.  nothing around him.  he spins the wheel, and pushes the
     hatch open.  lifts himself up, awkwardly.  grabs handholds, and pulls
     himself up into the pocket of air trapped inside the dome.

     the sub -- in front of him.  he finds the hatch, opens it, climbs inside
     the sub.
