               don't get hysterical, norman.

                         norman
               i'm telling you, harry's lost it.
               he's saying there's a deathwish out
               for each of us.

                         barnes
               look, the ships are clearing out.
               they're taking us topside in a
               matter of minutes.  someone can check
               him out there, if it's that imprtant.

                         norman
               all i'm saying is, someone should
               keep an eye on him.

                         barnes
               just worry about yourself.
