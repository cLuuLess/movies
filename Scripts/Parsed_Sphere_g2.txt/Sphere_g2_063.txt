     int.  living quarters

     close on harry's face

     harry lies on his bunk.  he begins to slowly awake.

     we begin to hear a scratching noise, like nails on a chalkboard.  it
     gets louder as harry comes to.  he puts his fingers to his temples.

     norman stands beside, him writing in his notebook.

                         harry
               what is that?  that noise?

                         norman
               what noise?

                         harry
               it's like... 

     angle on norman's pen -- as he stops writing, the noise stops.

     harry sighs.  norman looks down at his pen.

                         norman
               harry, can you tell me about the
               sphere?

                         harry
               what are you still doing here?

                         norman
               you remember opening the door?

                         harry
               you were all supposed to leave.  you
               weren't supposed to stay down here.

                         norman
               tell me about the door.  do you
               remember how you opened the door to
               the sphere?... harry?

                         harry
               you don't understand about the
               sphere.

                         norman
               then explain it to me.

     harry pauses, staring almost like a frightened little boy.

                         harry
               norman?

                         norman
               what is it, harry?

                         harry
               what happens on page 87?  have you
               ever read page 87?

                         norman
               page 87 of what, harry?

                         harry
               i could never read that far.  i never
               wanted to.

                         norman
               that far in what, harry?

     harry doesn't say anything.  norman waiting... 

                         harry
               you shouldn't be here, norman.  it's
               too dangerous for you and the others
               to be down here.
