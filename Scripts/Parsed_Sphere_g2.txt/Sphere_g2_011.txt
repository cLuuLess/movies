     int.  stairwell

     barnes and norman shuffle down the stairs.

                         barnes
               off the record, i don't mind telling
               you, this thing scares the shit out
               of me.

                         norman
               it doesn't make any sense.

                         barnes
               we think it might.  that's why we
               brought you here.  we've assembled
               your team -- they're waiting for us
               now.

                         norman
               what team?

                         barnes
               the one you recommended.  in the ulf
               report you wrote for the bush
               administration.

                         norman
               ulf report?  nobody's mentioned that
               in years.  you mean someone actually
               read it?

     as they head down a hallway, barnes pulls the ulf report out from
     under his arm, hands it to norman.

     norman looks at it, almost embarrassed to be holding it.

                         barnes
               your report's become our bible down
               here, dr. johnson.  we've been
               carrying out each of your
               recommendations -- one by one -- to
               the smallest detail.

                         norman
               but sir, i don't understand.  this
               report -- these recommendations...
               they're for an encounter with extra-
               terrestrial life.
