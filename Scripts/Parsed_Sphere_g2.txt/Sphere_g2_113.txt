     int.  corridor

     close on fire extinguisher case -- beth whips it open, grabs it.

     on norman -- picking up ted, lugging him awkwardly over his shoulder.

     on barnes -- running down the corridor towards them.

     bang!  barnes falls to the floor, taken away by the water.

                                                            cut to:

     another case on the wall -- whips open -- beth grabs gas masks.  she
     hears... 

                         barnes (o.s.)
               help!

     she looks down the corridor at... 

     barnes -- on the floor, flailing in the water, screaming, as his legs
     are caught in a crack in the wall.  desperate... 

                         barnes
               beth!  help, i can't -- !

     on beth -- staring at him.  just watching him.  not moving.

                         barnes
               beth!

     barnes -- his body falling through the crack, his head bangs into the
     wall, stuck in the crack, water choking him... 

                         barnes
               be--

     ... trying to scream, his neck ripping, snaps, and his body vanishes
     into the ocean.

     on beth -- cold, turns away.
