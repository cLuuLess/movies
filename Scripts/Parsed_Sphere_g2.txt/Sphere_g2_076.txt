     barnes sits, norman in front of him, worked up... 

                         norman
               i'm not paranoid.  i know beth.  she
               can be drastic.

                         barnes
               how drastic?

                         norman
               you don't want to know.

                         barnes
               i think i do.

                         norman
               a while back, beth and i -- we
               worked at the same university.  she
               was assisting a chemist there -- i
               forget his name -- doing research,
               experiments.  she was also living
               with him.
                    (off barnes' look)
               yeah, i know.  and when she finished
               her work, he kicked her out, broke
               off the relationship, and published
               five papers -- all her work --
               without any thank you or
               acknowledgement.

                         barnes
               she should've known better.

                         norman
               she put a razor to her wrists a day
               later.

                         barnes
                    (a beat)
               when was this?

                         norman
               '81, i think.  she tried again five
               years ago.
                    (beat)
               i thought you should know.

                         barnes
               so you knew this when you wrote your
               report?

                         norman
               at the time, i don't know, i thought
               putting her on the list -- it might
               help her career -- catch her a
               break.

                         barnes
               you knowingly recommended a woman
               with suicidal tendencies for a
               government operation --

                         norman
               wait a second --

                         barnes
               -- and then brought her down here --

                         norman
               -- i didn't know it would come to
               this --

                         barnes
               -- without a cautionary word to
               anyone.
                    (beat)
               you know, ted said something to me
               earlier.  i think he's right.  he
               said, "when you got a guy who -- if
               he wasn't here -- he'd be standing
               in the unemployment line, you gotta
               question if you got the right guy."

     on norman -- sweating.

                                                            cut to:

     on the monitor -- a series of numbers:

                         harry
               it's the same as before, but the
               spacing's different now.  it's
               definitely nonrandom.  see... 

     harry sitting at the monitor, shows ted, barnes, norman, and edmunds a
     printout of the screan -- indicating a pattern.

                         harry
               it's a single sequence repeated over
               and over.

                         barnes
               we're all very proud of you, harry,
               but what the hell is it?

                         ted
               maybe it's a message?

                         edmunds
               from what?

                         ted
               the sphere.  maybe the sphere --

                         edmunds
               we're not hooked up to the sphere.

                         harry
               well, if it's a discharge --

                         ted
               it's not a discharge.  right,
               edmunds?  you said before, right?  so
               it's gotta be a message.

                         barnes
               from the sphere?

                         ted
               what's inside the sphere.

                         harry
               if it is a message, it's probably a
               substitution code.  i'll work on it.

                         ted
               yeah, i'll work on it, too.

                         barnes
                    (to ted, flat)
               you do that.
