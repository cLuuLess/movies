     int.  labratory

     norman, huddled on the floor.

                         beth (o.s.)
               of course you're going to deny it.
               you want to blame someone else.  you
               want to blame beth.  because you
               hate beth.

                         norman
               don't fuck with me, beth.

                         beth (o.s.)
               i'm not fucking with you, norman.
               you've fucked yourself.

     norman jumps up, looks at the ground -- water on the floor.  rising in
     level.

                         norman
               turn off the water, beth.

     the entire floor is covered in water, rising higher, and rising fast.

                         norman
               beth!

                         beth (o.s.)
               you're frightened, aren't you,
               norman?

     norman, wading through the water, searching... 

                         norman
               where is it coming from, beth?

                         beth (o.s.)
               don't you know?

     rising higher... 

                         norman
               beth, stop it!

                         beth
               stop what?  don't blame me.  it's not
               me.

     norman frantically checking for a crack, a leak.

                         norman
               then where's it coming from?

                         beth (o.s.)
               from you, norman.  from your mind.
               you're doing it.

     it's up to his waist.  he climbs on top a lab bench.  puts his hands to
     his temples, straining.  we hear beth laughing.

     a specimen bottle -- explodes right next to him.

                         beth (o.s.)
               there's no ventalation in the room,
               norman.  the pressure's going to kill
               you.

     another bottle shatters, shooting fragments of glass across the room.

                         norman
               stop it!

                         beth (o.s.)
               it's you, norman.  your fear of
               drowning.  you have to face it.

     microscope lenses crack.  bottles, test tubes, dishes expolde.

                         beth (o.s.)
               c'mon, norman.  let me put you under.
               before you kill yourself!

     shatter!  crack!

     bottles floating in the water pop!  the water too high -- norman
     swimming in it now, keeping afloat.  his face strains from the
     pressure.  he looks at the camera in the corner... 

                         beth (o.s.)
               it's over, norman.

     next to the camera, he sees the hatch door in the ceiling.

                         beth (o.s.)
               don't even think it.  you don't have
               your suit, norman.  the water will
               freeze you.

     he reaches up at the door.  can't get it.  the water rising.  he dives
     down in the water... 

     underwater

     he swims to a cabinet near the floor, opens it, searches, things
     floating out -- an oxygen cylinder and mask -- he grabs it.

                                                            cut to:

     norman's face -- bursts above water level, slips on the mask, breathes.

                         beth (o.s.)
               it won't help, norman.  your body is
               boyant.  you're gonna shoot right to
               the surface and explode, norman.
               don't you get it?  it's over.

     he breathes a last breath, reaches up to the ceiling hatch door, spins
     it.

                         beth (o.s.)
               norman, what are you doing!  you're
               insa--

     the door opens and water gushes inside.  he grabs the frame of the
     door, and his body shoots up through the hole... 

                                                            cut to:
