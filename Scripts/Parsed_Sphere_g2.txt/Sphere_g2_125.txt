     int.  cafeteria

     norman, sitting at a table, eating a couple pieces of cold chicken.

     a salad, some fruit, and boxes of crackers on the table.

     beth walks in, carrying a bag of food.

                         beth
               what's harry doing with your suit in
               there?

                         norman
               fixing it.

                         beth
               fixing it?  but i fixed --
                    (notices the food)
               where'd you get all that?

                         norman
               the refridgerator.

                         beth
               the refridgerator.

                         norman	
               it's a pretty common place to look
               for food when you don't think you
               have any.

                         beth
               that wasn't in there before.

                         norman
               we must've had it delivered then.

                         beth
               wait a second --

                         norman
               1-800-deepsea delivery.  i hear
               they're good.

                         beth
               none of this was here before.

                         norman
               did you look?  it was on the top
               shelf.

                         beth
               no, it wasn't.  i swear none of this
               was here.  none of it.
                    (beat)
               you think he hid it?  earlier.  he
               must've hid it.

                         norman
               you think?

                         beth
               you don't believe me.

                         norman
               all i know is i opened that
               refridgerator --

                         beth
               damn it, norman.  i swear.  i had a
               whole conversation with the man when
               he woke up.

                         norman
               this being after you so carefully
               fixed my suit.

                         beth
               you think it's me?  you think i'm
               saying there was a conversation when
               there wasn't?

                         norman
               i don't know, beth.  i wasn't there.

                         beth
               damn it, norman!  he's lying.  don't
               you get it?  there is something
               seriously fucked up going on here --
               and he's causing it.  why can't you
               believe me?

     to her left -- she looks -- harry is standing in a doorway, cold,
     holding norman's jumpsuit.  he turns away.

     on beth -- looking back at norman, tears rolling down her eyes.

                                                            cut to:
