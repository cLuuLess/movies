     int.  video feed room

     on screen -- a transmission comes across... 

     "cqx vdx mop lki... "

     beth and norman watch... 

                         norman
               looks like some sort of code.

                         beth
               why would harry go back to using a
               code?

                         harry (o.s.)
               you mean jerry, don't you?

     harry leaning against the doorframe, enters the room.

                         beth
               jerry.  right.  i said jerry, didn't
               i?

                         harry
               that's a hell of a mistake to make,
               beth.

                         beth
               i'm sorry.  slip of the tongue.

                         harry
               yeah, i don't know how you could
               make that confusion.

     norman watching them... 

                         harry
               wisconsin's your answer.

                         norman
               wisconsin?

                         harry
                    (off screen)
               navy transmission.  they're sent from
               wisconsin.

                         norman
               how do we decode it?

                         harry
               don't have to.  watch.  it'll do it
               for you.

     the screen -- jumbling it's letters until finally... 

     "surface support vessels to your location eta: 1600 hours.  end."

     norman and beth smile... 

                         norman
               the cavalry is on it's way.

     the screen -- "16:00:00"... it begins decending in count.

                         beth
               just in time, too.

                         harry
               in time for what?

                         beth
               what?

                         harry
               just in time for what?

     beth, nervous, tries to cover... 

                         beth
               our habitat, i mean.  this place
               can't handle another attack.

                         harry
               another attack?

     a long beat, as beth stares at harry.

                         harry
               why are you looking at me like that?

                         beth
               like what?  i'm not --

                         harry
               you're staring at me.

                         beth
               no i'm not.  i'm not star--

                         harry
               yes you are... 

     harry looks at both of them, suspiciously... 

                         harry
               did i miss something?  you two seemed
               to patch things up awfully fast.

     a tense beat.

                         norman
               we just figured, you know, the three
               of us -- we need to... work together
               through this.

                         harry
               the three of us.

                         norman
               that's right.

                         harry
                    (beat)
               is that why the two of you went
               through my dufflebag?

     norman glances at the screen behind harry: "i will kill you all."
