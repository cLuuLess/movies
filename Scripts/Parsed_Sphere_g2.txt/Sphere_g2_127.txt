     int.  cafeteria

     on beth -- sitting at a table, her face in her hands.

     on norman -- looking at her, as he closes a box of crackers.  wraps
     cellophane over the chicken.  walks with it over to the refridgerator.
     opens it, placing the chicken inside... but he can't.

     inside the refridgerator

     are books -- neatly lined up on each of the shelves.

     norman -- backs away.  what the hell?

     norman now looks at the cupboards.  goes to them.

     inside the cupboard

     books, neatly stacked.

     norman, panicking, opens each of the cupboards, all of them with
     books.

     all of the books are the same.  entitled: "20,000 leagues under the sea
     by jules verne."

     norman looks over at beth.

                         beth
               what is it, norman?  norman?

     she comes to him.  he stands there, bewildered, scared, mind racing.

                         beth
               norman?

     norman paces, frantic almost, running his hands through his hair,
     trying to think.  stops.  turns to beth.

                         norman
               page 87.

                         beth
               what?

                         norman
               page 87.  "i could never read that
               far."

     norman quickly plucks a book from a shelf, turns pages, gets to page
     87.  reads... 

                         norman
               "our fisherman frequently see some
               that are more than four feet long.
               some skeletons of squids... 

                         beth
               squids?

                         norman
               "... according to calculations of
               some naturalists, one of these
               animals, only six feet long, would
               have tentacles 27 feet long.  that
               would make a formidable monster."

     he looks up from the book, realizing something... 

                         beth
               norman?

     snaps the book closed.
