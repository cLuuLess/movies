     int.  airlock -- pressurizing room

     close on the hatch door closing tightly, locking.

                         officer (o.s.)
               one moment for pressurizing.

     a soft whirr.

     angle on -- barnes and the four remaining team members standing in the
     small, claustrophobic pressurizing room.  like sardines.  nobody says
     anything.  a long beat.

     the door

     in front of them, opens.  teeny fletcher, 30s, a big-boned female
     officer, stands before them.  she wears a black plastic pad, a
     "talker", around her neck.

     she hands each member their own "talker".  norman takes his.
