                         beth (o.s.)
               what is it, norman?

                         norman
               where are you?

                         beth (o.s.)
               in the sub.  resetting the timer.
               why?

     on the monitor -- beth sitting in the sub.

                         norman
               the sphere looks different.

                         beth (o.s.)
               what do you mean, different?

                         norman
               the grooves around the door --
               they've shifted.  and the pattern --
               the fluids -- they look darker now.

               how's harry?

     on harry -- the iv in his arm.

                         norman
               he's fine.
