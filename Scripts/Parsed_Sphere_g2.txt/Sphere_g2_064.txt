     int.  bathroom/shower facilities

     beth comes out from behind a vinyl shower curtain.  a towel wrapped
     around her.

                         barnes (o.s.)
               beth -- i wanted to have a word with
               you... 

     barnes washes his hands at the sink, looking at her in the mirror in
     front of him.

                         barnes
               back at the door -- i asked you to
               back away.

                         beth
               yeah.  i heard you.

                         barnes
               there are procedures, beth, that i
               want followed.  my procedures.  and
               considering what's going on, i want
               you to follow them very closely.

                         beth
                    (a beat)
               forgive me.  i've never read the navy
               manual.  i wonder what it says about
               bathroom and shower procedures.

     he walks to the door, then turns.

                         barnes
               and beth, one other thing.  i'd like
               from now on for you to address me as
               captain or sir in front of the men.
