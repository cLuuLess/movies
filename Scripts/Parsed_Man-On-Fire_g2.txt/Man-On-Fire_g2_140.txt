int.    12' x 6' cell - guardia de seguidad - night

the white tiled room we saw pinta held in.    the door
opens and guardian three leads creasy in.

                           female guardian
              he was screaming about the money and his
              dead nephew. he threw the little girl
              against the wall.

the female guardian points. creasy steps over.       there's
a smear of blood against the wall.

                           female guardian
              she fell. she wasn't moving. they threw
              her body in the trunk of the car and
              drove away.

flashback: guardian's pov through window. we glimpse
through a dirty window, pinta's body being put into a car
trunk.

                            creasy
              who?   who's they?

                           female guardian
              the boss's brother, i recognize his
              voice. it's high pitched. we call him
              woody woodpecker.

work in progress 2/10/03                                          94.


                            creasy
               now listen to me. if you tell me where
               to find the boss. i will let you live.

                              female guardian
               please.    i don't know.

and creasy stands there a moment. realizes she is
telling the truth. lost. and the sound that snaps him
out of it... a girl crying. and creasy is suddenly
moving down...

the hallway

after the sound.    he kicks open a door.       there!

in a 8' x 4' room.       a 12-year-old girl.    bound and
blindfolded.

flashcut:   we think it's pinta for a heartbeat, but it's
not.

                                                     cut to:
