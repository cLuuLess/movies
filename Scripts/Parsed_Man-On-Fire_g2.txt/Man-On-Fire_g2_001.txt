ext.   mexico city - day

high over the city on a bright sunday morning, the sun
pounding its way through the orange haze of smog. as we
descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets:
the sounds of a mass being sung.

a catholic church

the big wooden doors open to release the parishioners
inside. feature a tall, lanky 18-year-old. holding his
girlfriend's hand, anxious for sunday to really begin.
they don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a
faucet's been cranked down. they move toward a mercedes
500. as a chauffeur holds the back door open for them...

a grand marquis

squeals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside
the mercedes. four men get out flashing  badges. in a
moment they're hustling eighteen toward the car, stiff-
arming the chauffeur. as the girlfriend  cries and the
gossip among the parishioners begins...

the grand marquis pulls away.
