conference

rosanna, the woman we saw on t.v. earlier, stands
watching and listening. incredulous and angry.

miguel manzano the director of afi (also seen earlier
on tv), approaches with his two assistants and kisses
rosanna on the cheek.

                           rosanna
              a bodyguard was shot trying to protect a
              9 year old. the bodyguard's american.
              not only that he's black.

                           manzano
              is that good or bad?

                           rosanna
              that's good. really good. he shot and
              killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper
              died in the attack. they're saying he's
              responsible.

manzano looks bemused, as he eats a sugary pastry.
rosanna heads into the press conference.
