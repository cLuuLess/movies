ext.   bridge of the aztecs underpass- mexico city - night

there sits the canary yellow coupe deville. eyes and
mouth taped shut, hands and ankles bound by flex-cuffs.
tazinari stands there.

creasy steps up, pulls the tape off tazinari's eyes.     he
looks about, relatively calm considering.

                          creasy
             you know where you are?

as tazinari tries to process...

work in progress 2/10/03                                     104.


                         creasy
            under the bridge. where the deal went
            south. now why don't you tell me what
            went down?

creasy tears the tape off his mouth.

                         tazinari
            do you know who i am? i am the
            commandante of the judicial anti-
            kidnapping division.

                         creasy
            and one of the founding members of la
            hermanidad.

                           tazinari
            correct!

creasy pulls the buck knife from his pocket, flips  it
open. as tazinari reacts, creasy spins him round,   slits
his clothes up from ankle to neck. the cloth drops   away,
some hanging at tazinari's wrists. tazinari has a   sudden
loss of attitude.

                                                cut to:

close up: tazinari hands being cuff flexed and tied to
side view mirrors of the coupe deville.

cut back to see tazinari, naked other than his calvin
klein skivvies, spread-eagled across the grill of the
car, butt forward (reminiscent of 'the woods scene' in
deliverance)

creasy rips down his calvins. cu of tazinari's face
winces with either pain or extreme discomfort.

                         creasy
            that's not my dick. that's the barrel of
            your own gun. shoved up your own ass.

as tazinari reacts...

                         creasy (cont'd)
            .44 magnum. now, how's your hearing?

we hear the click of the trigger being cocked back.

                         tazinari
            please, don't...

work in progress 2/10/03                                  105.


                         creasy
            it's all up to you, commandante.    tell me
            about you and 'the dreamer'.

creasy puts a tape recorder on the hood and presses the
record button.

                         tazinari
            i don't know him. i saw the opportunity
            and got lucky.

                           creasy
            lucky how?

                         tazinari
            that he used policemen. that you killed
            them, it made it a police matter. the
            ramos family couldn't refuse our
            involvement.

                           creasy
            and?

                         tazinari
            and i had my men ready.

                         creasy
            you stole the drop.

more flashes: as we see this happen. pov from opposite
side of the bridge. pov from the drop car. see the
money drop get ambushed by unknown faces. 'the nephew'
gets shot. the kidnapper running the show sounds like
woody woodpecker, high pitched squeaky voice.

                         creasy (cont'd)
            you done it before?

tazinari doesn't answer.   creasy gives the magnum a
tweak.

                          tazinari
            yes.   many times.

                          creasy
            o.k.   so tell me more.

                         tazinari
            there was no ten million dollars.

                         creasy
            the ransom was ten.

work in progress 2/10/03                                    106.


                          tazinari
             two and a half. that's how much there
             was.

                          creasy
             don't lie to me!

                          tazinari
             two and a half! the rest was paper!
             strips of paper!

flashback:   tazinari, in his office, sifting through the
paper.

                          creasy
             maybe your men stole from you.

                           tazinari
             no. whoever took the rest took it before
             the exchange.

                          creasy
             who gave the bags to ramos?

                           tazinari
             his lawyer.   jordan kalfus.

flashback: ramos house. bags of cash being switched
from the mercedes with the flat tire to the 2nd mercedes
in the garage. see that jordan does the switch, four
bags on the floor.

                                               cut to:

as creasy thinks.   tazinari has been stretched to his
limit.

                          tazinari
             that's all i know! please. i'm sorry
             for the girl. but it was business! i'm
             a professional.

                          creasy
             that's what everybody keeps saying.

creasy switches off the tape recorder and pockets it.

relief for tazinari as the .44 is withdrawn. creasy
walks around the car tazinari now looking like a naked
hood ornament. butt first.

work in progress 2/10/03                                  107.
