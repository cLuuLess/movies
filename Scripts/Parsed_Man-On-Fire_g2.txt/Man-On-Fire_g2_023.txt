int.   sitting room - ramos villa - mexico city - night

where lisa is flipping through tv channels; sky news,
cnn, etc... each one showing some terrorist act - west
bank protest, madrid car bombing.

samuel and creasy, meanwhile, enter behind her.      she
clicks it off, looks back at them.

                          lisa
             the world of our children.   how dare
             they?

work in progress 2/10/03                                      15.


                         creasy
                   (shrugs)
            it's war. the weakest suffer the most.

                         lisa
            you're american.

                            creasy
            so are you.

                         samuel
                   (introducing)
            my wife, mr. creasy.

                         lisa
            lisa martin ramos, mr. creasy.

lisa steps over, shakes creasy's hand.    gives him a quick
once over.

                         lisa (cont'd)
            would you like a drink?

creasy doesn't hesitate, doesn't look at samuel and has
no irony in his answer.

                            creasy
            thank you.     scotch and a little water.

she steps to the bar to make it.

creasy - from someone's pov

slightly sinister.   watching from the frame of the door.

                         lisa
            you've done much of this work before?

                            creasy
            never.

samuel sells, covers for creasy's reticence.

                         samuel
            he has experience in related work.     a
            great deal of it.

                         lisa
            do you have any family, mr. creasy?

creasy hesitates for an imperceptible beat.

                          creasy
            no.   i do not have family.

work in progress 2/10/03                                          16.


and then, somehow, creasy is aware of being watched.        his
eyes flicker over, just in time to see...

pinta

crouched low. in the doorway. she stares back at him a
beat, then disappears around the corner.

sitting room

creasy frowns.    lisa steps over with creasy's drink.

                            creasy
               thank you.

she makes a point of looking into his eyes. creasy looks
back into hers with complete indifference, something she
has not experienced even from dying men.

she abruptly turns away.    confused for a moment.
finally:

                            lisa
               pinta!

a few moments and pinta arrives.       'cool hand pinta'.

                            pinta
               yes, mom?

                            lisa
               this is mr. creasy.

pinta walks over and very formally holds out her hand.
creasy shakes it. an odd beat.

                            lisa
               pinta, show him to his room.

samuel reacts.    creasy got the job.

                            pinta
               this way, mr. creasy.

what an actress. as he follows her out.        samuel sits at
his baby grand and begins to play.

                            lisa
               i think it's nice he's american.

                            samuel
               i think it's fantastic.

work in progress 2/10/03                                     17.


                         lisa
            you realize that you've brought a killer
            into the house.

samuel is stopped short by that one.    she steps over and
kisses her husband on the cheek.

                            lisa
            thank you.     i feel better now.
