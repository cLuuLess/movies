int.   creasy's room - hospital - day

creasy out of it still.    rayburn and manzano at the foot
of the bed.

                          rayburn
             he's not a cop killer.

                          manzano
             i'm sure he isn't. though he's certainly
             adept at killing.

                          rayburn
             he was doing his job, protecting the
             girl. if police were involved, you
             figure it out. i'm here for him.

                           manzano
             so am i.

and creasy stirs.   rayburn leans into his friend, manzano
just behind him.

                          rayburn
             you hear me, crease?

creasy's eyes slit open.

                          rayburn (cont'd)
                    (whispers)
             you got three of the fuckers.   all dead.

             pinta...

                          rayburn
             two days gone. they're negotiating a
             ransom.

                          manzano
             these things take time, mr. creasy.

creasy closes his eyes.
