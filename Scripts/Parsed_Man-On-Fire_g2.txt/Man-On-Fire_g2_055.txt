int.   creasy's room - night

creasy sits in his chair drinking scotch.     all alone
needless to say.

creasy takes the instructional vhs on bodyguards that
rayburn gave him and plugs it into the vcr. it's in
japanese. shakes his head. he switches off the vcr and
surfs the tv channels instead. sees talk show with the
editor of reforma newspaper, rosanna guerrero, talking
about organized crime in mexico.

from out the window, a caw, then again.     yet again.

finally, creasy stands goes to the window. he leans out,
sees pinta's window across the lawn from him.

pinta standing on the terrace. another caw.

creasy decides to play.    he caws in return.

pinta looks around.    creasy does a pretty good
impersonation.

hears pinta caw again.

                          creasy
             hey... pinta...

she looks up at him.

                          creasy
             what are you doing?

                          pinta
             calling for emilio's macaw.    i thought i
             heard him.

                          creasy
             do you think he'll come back?

                            pinta
             maybe.    did you hear him?

                            creasy
             no.

                          pinta
             how do you think he got out?

                          creasy
                    (a beat)
             well, i let him go.

work in progress 2/10/03                                     38.


                          pinta
             it's better to be free, right?

                           creasy
             yes.   actually, he was driving me crazy.

creasy disappears back inside. pinta smiles big before
letting the stick drop to the ground.

                          pinta
             i got you to talk, creasy bear.

blue bayou plays.   pinta now listens to creasy's sound.

                          ronstadt
             "...i'm so lonesome all the time, since i
             left my baby behind, on blue bayou."
