ext.    fiat 500 - day

the passenger side door opens and creasy stumbles out.
some of the pepper spray has gotten in his face as well.

creasy wipes his tearing eyes. and then he turns.
hefting the knife in his hand, he marches back toward the car.

                             jorge's voice
              no!   no!

and then a terrible scream. blood squirts against the
inside of the windshield. the car rocks on its shocks.
and then another terrible scream.

                                                  cut to:

jorge

stares at the stump of his right forefinger, smoke rising
up off it. creasy sticks the lighter back in its hole.

and creasy looking at him, devoid of emotion.

                           jorge
              wh- wh- what do you want to know?

it takes a moment for creasy to come back.    he picks up
the pen and notebook.

                           creasy
              the ramos kidnapping.   how did it work?

work in progress 2/10/03                                    87.


                         jorge
            i don't know. we were just given
            instructions to take her.

                         creasy
            ordered by who?

jorge hesitates.   as creasy sets the pen down...

                            jorge
            i don't know.

creasy jerks back jorge's middle finger, raises the
knife.

                         jorge
                   (a mile a minute)
            i don't know! we work in parts. a    voice
            calls in a kidnapping. we deliver   the
            target to the guardians. we don't   even
            know them. they might transfer to   other
            guardians. the negotiators and the
            bosses don't even see the target.   they
            just make the deal!

                         creasy
            who ordered it?

                         jorge
            the cops call him 'the dreamer'.

                         creasy
            where do i find him?

                         jorge
                   (shrugs; terrified)
            i don't know. no one knows.

close on creasy

scream, as the knife comes down. creasy tosses the finger
out the window, wipes some of jorge's blood off his
cheek.

                         jorge
            i don't know, i swear.

                         creasy
                   (after a beat)
            i believe you.

                         jorge
                   (crying)
            i'm professional. i just do my job.

work in progress 2/10/03                                    88.


                            creasy
             me, too.    tell me about the guardians.

                          jorge
             he called me on the cell phone to set a
             time and location for the switch.

                            creasy
             who's he?

                          jorge
             the one who transferred pinta to their
             car.

flashbacks: see pinta being manhandled from the white
fiat to the trunk of grand marquis. she has been bound
and taped around the mouth and eyes.

creasy looks like he'll kill him on the spot.     muzzles
his sig into the palm of jorge's right hand.

                            creasy
             who's he?

                          jorge
             i don't know, but i know his face.

creasy cocks the trigger.

                          jorge
             i see him sometimes at the handball court
             in chapultepec on a saturday afternoon.

                          creasy
             how do i recognize him.

                          jorge
             he has a tattoo covering two-thirds of
             his back. he is part of the brotherhood.

                          creasy
             in the next hour, where do i find your
             partner?

                          jorge
             one-one-three arco iris.    third floor.

creasy closes the notebook, caps the pen.    it's over.
