ext.   bridge of the aztecs - night

samuel's car is parked on the  south side of the bridge.
a shirtless samuel carries two  large duffle bags
containing ten million dollars  across the bridge. we see
tazinari again dialing up his  cell phone.

                          voice (v.o.)
             leave the money in the trunk of the car
             with white paper taped to the windshield,
             then return to your car and go home. do
             not look back.

samuel finds the car, leaves the bag in the trunk, he
turns and heads back over the bridge.

                          voice (v.o.)
             remember, i am a professional. if you
             keep your word, i will keep mine. if you
             do not, then god be with your child.

as samuel is walking back across the bridge. suddenly
gunfire from where he came, along with shouting and
yelling. samuel crouches and runs in the dark back to
his car with tazinari.
