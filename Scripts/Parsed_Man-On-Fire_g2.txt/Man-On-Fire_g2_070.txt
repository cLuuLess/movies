ext.   hairdressers - zona rosa - day

mexico city traffic is heavy. cars and people. creasy
stands by the car across the street. cooling his heels.
he can just catch a glimpse of lisa in the shop.

suddenly the traffic seems to finish, expending itself.
the street goes ominously quiet. creasy's antennae go
up.

a police car comes prowling down the empty street.
creasy makes eye contact with the guys up front.

then, creasy spots a businessman coming out of a doorway
with a bodyguard attached. the bodyguard is speaking
into a two-way radio.

work in progress 2/10/03                                    48.


creasy's sixth sense tweaks as a mercedes 500 pulls up to
collect the businessman.

and the cop car disappears around the corner even as two
men start toward the businessman.

lisa exits the hairdresser's.    looks stunning.

creasy starts across the street toward her.

a second car squeals around the corner behind the
mercedes and everything goes to hell.

gunfire erupts.

and then creasy is there.

his arm around lisa's waist, sweeping her off her feet.
the next thing she knows she flattened on the ground in a
shop doorway, creasy on top of her. shielding her.

the bodyguard beside the businessman is killed. the body
guard in the mercedes trades a full magazine before he's
shot.

a pedestrian is killed.

liza screams as the glass above and behind them shatters.

the businessman is hustled into the back of the second
car.

lisa sees the gun in creasy's hands.

she hears the slamming of the car door, the screeching of
tires. a parked van also hauling ass out of there. but
then she's aware of something else.

creasy on top of her.   she feels his weight, his heat...

                            creasy
             don't move.

she watches as he rises, goes to the curb. one bodyguard
is sprawled dead across the ground. red blood on the
sidewalk. as lisa closes her eyes.
