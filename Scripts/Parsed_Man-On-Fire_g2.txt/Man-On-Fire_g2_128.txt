int.   fiat 500 - day

still in the driver's seat, jorge wakes. the first thing
he sees is that his hands are taped to the steering wheel
with his pudgy white fingers exposed. he is naked,
reminiscent of the 18 year old in the opening sequence.

                          creasy
             can you hear me?

jorge nods, the pain in his head blinding.

                          creasy
             i am going to ask questions. if you
             don't answer, fully and truthfully, you
             will suffer much more than you have to.

creasy opens pinta's notebook to a blank page near the
end. he clicks open a pen.

creasy presses in the car's cigarette lighter.

then he opens a buck knife.    jorge winces at the sound of
the blade locking.

                          creasy (cont'd)
             i'm going to cut your fingers off.     one
             by one. if i have to.

the cigarette lighter pops back out.

                          creasy
             that's to cauterize the stubs.

work in progress 2/10/03                                    86.


holy sweet jesus... sweat drips down jorge's forehead.
he tries to master his fear. swallows dry.

                           jorge
              do you know who i am?

                             creasy
              who are you?

                           jorge
              i am the president of la hermanidad.

without warning creasy reaches up with the buck knife, a
flash of steel.

the big man howls, his left ear suddenly missing, starts
an epic struggle, practically breaking the wheel off the
steering column. he is like a bucking rhinoceros.

he howls as creasy sprays his face with pepper spray.
