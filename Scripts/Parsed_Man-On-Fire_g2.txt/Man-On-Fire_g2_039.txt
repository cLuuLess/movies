int.   pinta's bedroom - night

pinta, blankets up, teddy bear beside her, says her
prayer.

                          pinta
             give me god what you still have.    give me
             what no one else asks for.

then, she listens as linda ronstadt's "blue bayou" starts
to drift through the open window, down from the room
above.

                          ronstadt
             "i'm going back someday, come what may,
             to blue bayou..."
