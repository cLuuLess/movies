int.   mercedes - convent school gates - day

creasy pulls out, starts down the street. he's only gone
a hundred meters when sirens kick up. a police car
behind him. creasy shakes his head.

                          creasy
             here we go again.

creasy pulls over, digs around the front seat as two
sloppy cops head over.

                          sloppy cop one
             do you speak english, senor?

                           creasy
             yeah.   and spanish.

                          sloppy cop one
             you have an identification?

work in progress 2/10/03                                   25.


creasy hands them his passport and a printed letter. a
legitimate firearms license for bodyguard work witnessed
by rayburn.

creasy deliberately puts one hand on the steering wheel,
then the other. minimizing the confrontation.

                          creasy
             it's a temporary license for the gun i'm
             carrying. i just went through all of
             this at the airport.
