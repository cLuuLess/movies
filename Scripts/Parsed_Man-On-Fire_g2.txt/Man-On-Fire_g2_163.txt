ext.   mexico city - night

life moves on with its brutal inevitability.    this is a
river whose course cannot be altered.

                          pinta's voice
             from the backseat i can see   creasy's eyes
             in the mirror. he watches    and thinks.
             he never smiles. i wish i    was back in
             the front seat with him. i    wish he would
             smile.

creasy looks up from the notebook and out at the city.
and a smile comes. but it's bitter and hopeless.

it's half grief, half not knowing where to go next, what
to do. and he's dying. he knows that too. creasy dials
a number on a cell phone.

                             creasy
             hola...
