int. customs area - a back office
rayburn has 5k u.s. dollars laid out on      the desk between
him, the customs official, and creasy.       the remains of
the suitcase are spread around the room.       the main
offender, the gun being front and center      next to the
cash. looks like the official is going       to fold.
