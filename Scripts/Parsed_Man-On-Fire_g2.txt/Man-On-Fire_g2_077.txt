ext.   courtyard - ramos house - day

as the mercedes pulls in, another car is ahead of it.
samuel is home, a driver pulls his luggage from the
trunk.

pinta gets out of the mercedes.

                           pinta
             hi, dad.

he gives her a pat on the head. simultaneously, samuel
fixes creasy with a look, strides purposefully over. he
thrusts out his hand, shakes creasy's.

                          samuel
             i want to thank you, creasy.   for what
             you did for my wife.

creasy wants to choke, but he just nods, looks past
samuel to pinta who looks bemused. he doesn't even want
to know exactly what she knows.

the car wash guy, - pedro, ingratiates himself with
samuel.
