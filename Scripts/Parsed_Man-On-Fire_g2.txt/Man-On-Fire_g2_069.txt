int.   3rd floor hallway - ramos villa - night

lisa walking toward creasy's room. as she moves to
knock, she sees the door is ajar, hears voices. she
peeks in.

work in progress 2/10/03                                     47.


creasy and pinta sit on the floor, pencils, papers and a
book spread out before them. doing her history homework.

lisa's pov - of creasy

he's charming and great with pinta.     and sexy... evelyn
was right.

                          pinta
             do you have a girlfriend, creasy?

                           creasy
             no.

                          pinta
             did you used to?

                           creasy
             yeah.   two or three.

lisa continues to watch the little play. she smiles,
knocks on the door as she opens it. pinta and creasy
both look back over their shoulders.

                          lisa
             creasy, tomorrow, after you drop off
             pinta, could you come back to take me to
             get my hair done?

creasy nods. they both continue to look at her.      she
gets the feeling she's interrupting.

                          lisa
             alright, i'll leave you two to your
             history.

as she goes...
