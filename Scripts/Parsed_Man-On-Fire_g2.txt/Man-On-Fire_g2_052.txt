ext.   ago's - mexico city - day

creasy waits in the street, stands by the mercedes. he
checks his watch, looks around. the minutes do not pass
quickly. he looks over as the restaurant door opens and
lisa exits with jordan kalfus and his latin wife evelyn.

                               lisa
                         (sees him)
               creasy!
                      (stepping over)
               meet jordan and evelyn.

creasy nods.    they study him with interest.

                            jordan
               so you're the bodyguard?
                      (creasy nods again)
               you used to be, what did they used to
               call it, a soldier of fortune?

work in progress 2/10/03                                 35.


jordan doesn't quite hide his disdain. creasy nods a
final time, lets his eyes drift to a 1000 yard stare.

                          evelyn
                   (giggles)
            does he talk?

as lisa gives her a dirty look, evelyn whispers...

                           evelyn
            he's sexy...

jordan looks in the direction creasy looks.

                         jordan
            you see any danger out there?
                   (laughs)
            the fear's worse than the reality.

just a blankness from creasy.

                         jordan
            i always wanted to ask a bodyguard, would
            you take a bullet for your employer, for
            samuel?

a condescending smile as jordan awaits his answer.

                         creasy
            i wasn't hired to guard mr. ramos.

                         jordan
            for pinta then?

                           lisa
            jordan!

                         creasy
            if something happened, my reaction would
            be to fight to protect her. i have
            skills in that respect. pinta would
            benefit by the fact that... i'm a
            soldier.

                         jordan
            what kind of an answer is that?

                         creasy
            the answer is the truth.   the question is
            foolish.

lisa smiles at the answer, kisses jordan on the cheek.

work in progress 2/10/03                                     36.


                          lisa
             jordan, thank you for the lovely lunch.
             i promise not to let evelyn spend too
             much.

evelyn doesn't see it, but creasy does. jordan just lets
his fingers trace the top of lisa's ass.

as she and evelyn head for the car, creasy is there to
open the door.

mercedes

creasy gets behind the wheel. pulls into traffic. as he
goes, he checks the rear view mirror. jordan remains
standing on the curb watching the car pull away.
something odd about it all.
