int.   ground floor apartment - day

creasy has just finished taping the old couple to two
chairs.

                          creasy
             if you promise to speak softly and not to
             shout, i won't have to tape your mouths.

the old man looks to his wife, then back to creasy.
nods.

the old man watches as creasy opens he canvas bag, pulls
out two metal tubes that he screws together. it's a
rocket launcher. next he pulls out a cone-shaped
missile. the old man is starting to look curious.

                          creasy
             did you know you have a dishonest
             policeman living in your neighborhood?

creasy depresses the fins on the missile and slides it
back into the tube.

                          old man
             i know of you. you're the american. the
             bodyguard who's killing the kidnapper.

creasy doesn't answer, steps into the center of the room.

                          old man
             in the church, they say to forgive.

                          creasy
             forgiveness is between them and god.
             it's my job to arrange the meeting.

creasy looks back and forth between two shuttered windows
and in a line to the wall with a household catholic
alter. christ on the cross sits front and center.

                          creasy
             do you have an old blanket you don't care
             about? i don't want to burn that wall.
