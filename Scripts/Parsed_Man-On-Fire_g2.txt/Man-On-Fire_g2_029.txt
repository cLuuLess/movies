ext.   convent school gates - mexico city - day

creasy pulls the mercedes up out front.   he notes the
high walls, the heavy gates.

                          pinta
             beep the horn.

creasy hits it. a beat and then a   shutter opens at eye
level. pinta waves from the car.    a moment later the
gate is being slowly pushed open by  an old watchman.
creasy drives in toward a rambling,  ivy-clad building set
in spacious grounds.

courtyard

creasy parks, get out of the car.   he looks around,
appraising the lay of the land.

                          pinta
             isn't it beautiful?

pinta's name is called. an elderly gray-haired nun walks
over from the entrance. pinta runs over, kiss her
warmly on both cheeks, then leads her toward creasy.

                          pinta
             sister anna, the headmistress.
                    (to nun; proudly)
             this is creasy, my bodyguard.

sister anna shakes his hand.

                           sister anna
             mr. creasy.

                          pinta
             no, sister, he told me just to call him
             creasy. he's american. from no state in
             particular.

                          sister anna

             happy to have her back in school. run
             along now, pinta.

pinta waves goodbye, bounds away.   they watch her go.

                          sister anna
             no offense, but i'm sorry that your
             profession needs to exist.

                          sister anna
             do you ever see the hand of god in what
             you do?

                          creasy
             not for a long time, sister.

                          sister anna
