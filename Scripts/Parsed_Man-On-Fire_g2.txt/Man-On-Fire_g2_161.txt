int.   dining room - evening

samuel eats dinner silently. lisa just stares into
space, nursing a vodka. even great marriages cannot
survive the trauma of kidnapping and subsequent death.

the door opens and they expect to see maria with the
deserts. creasy enters and sits at the table like a
dinner guest.

                          creasy
                    (to samuel)
             i'm going to talk to your wife. if you
             move or say one word, i'll kill you.

he takes a colt officer model .45 semi-automatic pistol
out of his waistband and lays it on the table in
preparation for something, we don't know what. he turns
to lisa.

                          creasy
             i'm going to tell you a story. your
             lawyer is dead. someone didn't want him
             talking. last week he wired $2.5 million
             into his u.s. bank account. colonel
             ernesto tazinari is also dead. he
             hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5
             million. if my arithmetic is correct it
             means $5 million remains.

creasy looks to samuel.

                          creasy
             your husband magically had five million
             deposited in a u.s. bank account last
             friday.

lisa's eyes never leave creasy's...trying to discern
whether this is true or not.

                          creasy
             they planned it, samuel and kalfus.

                             lisa
             planned what?

work in progress 2/10/03                                     109.


                         creasy
            an autosequestra. kalfus arranged for
            pinta to be taken to a safehouse. i'm
            sure he thought she'd sit there for three
            days eating pizza and watching tv. it
            didn't work out that way. everything got
            fucked up when i killed the cops and
            tazinari saw an opportunity.

lisa screams.   creasy gestures with a finger to his lips.

                         creasy
            on the surface it was low risk and high
            return. this was the third autosequestra
            jordan had organized for clients. the
            other two succeeded.

samuel looks to lisa.

                          samuel
            our lifestyle was in jeopardy. my pain
            and weakness only fueled your anger and
            determination. i wasn't sure about
            whether to go through with it or not.
            then i woke up one day and it was done.
                   (beat)
            jordan was supposed to take care of it.

through all of the above, creasy removes the special
bullet held in the seam of his wallet. the misfire.     he
empties the other cartridges from his gun.

lisa suddenly attacks samuel in a violent, emotional
outburst of tears, screaming, and rage. drawing blood
from his nose and upper lip. samuel smothers lisa's arms
beneath his. he appears strong and decisive for the
first time.

creasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the
magazine and chambers the round. he looks into samuel's
eyes.

                         creasy
            a bullet does not lie. a bullet tells
            the truth. and the truth will set you
            free.

creasy hands samuel the gun.

                         creasy
            in many ways i think this bullet should
            be shared between you and lisa.

work in progress 2/10/03                                    110.


creasy exits the room. samuel kisses lisa on the
forehead and exits onto the terrace.

a gunshot.
