int.   pinta's bedroom - night

a battered teddy bear watches as lisa sits on the foot of
the bed, tucks pinta in.

                          lisa
             school tomorrow, baby.

pinta smiles, happy at the thought.

                          pinta
             i like him, mom.

                           lisa
             you do?

                          pinta
             he's like a great big bear.
                    (a secret smile)
             'creasy bear'...

lisa smiles, kisses her goodnight.    as she starts out...

                          pinta
             there's something about him.

lisa turns, looks back at her daughter.

                          pinta
             i think he's been sick. he's alright
             now, but i think he's been very, very
             sick.

work in progress 2/10/03                                     20.


                           lisa
              well, think about going to sleep.   good
              night, baby.

lisa exits.   pinta looks over at the battered teddy bear.

                           pinta
              just like you, a big old bear.

                                                  cut to:

creasy

in his room. tests his mag spring with his thumb, begins
loading up. the full magazine joins with those already
loaded.

another glass of scotch is poured.

creasy's hands oil the holster. the sig sauer is slipped
in. the holster is hung over the corner post of the bed.

a map is flattened. creasy's finger traces various
routes, pencils them in. from the house to pinta's
school.

the macaw squawks again. creasy steps over, takes the
cage and carries it to the open window. he opens the
cage door.

                           creasy
              now's your chance.

the bird flies, disappears out the window.
