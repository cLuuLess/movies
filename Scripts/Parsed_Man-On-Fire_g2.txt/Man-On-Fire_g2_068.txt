on the way to school. pinta is stealing looks at
creasy's right hand. she knows the answer must be
serious, but she has to ask.

                          pinta
             creasy, what happened to your hand?

creasy looks at her a moment, deciding. pinta
practically holds her breath, watches him, knows the
answer may come. creasy checks the mirror, watches the
road.

                          creasy
             a man asked me questions once.   he smoked
             a lot. there was no ashtray.

that's it. end of explanation. creasy continues
watching the road. pinta watches him.

                          creasy
             remember you asked me what state i was
             from?

                            pinta
             yes.

                          creasy
             where you're from isn't so much about
             geography; it's about events. where
             you're from is what happened to you.

                          pinta
             good things happen, too, creasy.
                    (smiles big)
             like meeting me.

                          creasy
                    (after a beat)
             i guess that really does make me a hard
             case.

as the two of them share a laugh...
