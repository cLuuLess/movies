int. strip bar - rethink location

a stripper does a half hearted grind as rayburn and
creasy sit at the bar sharing a bottle of 'jack'.

                            rayburn
               you got a secondary search and you had a
               gun.

                            creasy
               listen it was a calculated risk. i've
               done it a million times and never got
               caught.

                            rayburn
               everything happens once if you live long
               enough.

                         creasy
            it doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags
            coming off the plane.

                         rayburn
            this is mexico, they do everything
            backwards.

creasy hits the 'jack'.

                         rayburn
            so what's wrong?

                         creasy
            nothing wrong.

                         rayburn
            don't give me that bullshit.

creasy changes subject.

                         creasy
            so how's business?

                         rayburn
            japanese are here in a big way. cheap
            labor. factory space. but they feel a
            lot safer living over the border in el
            paso. i ferry 'em back and forth. they
            think i'm john-fucking-wayne.

                         creasy
            but don't you stay in el paso?

                         rayburn
            fuck, i love mexico.   i live like a king
            down here.

creasy takes a look around the seedy bar.

                         creasy
            yeah, right...

                         rayburn
            oh, like you haven't been in worse
            places.

                         creasy
            and a level five shithole is better than
            a level six. your logic's inescapable.

rayburn laughs. creasy takes the bottle.     creasy's hand
is mottled by old burn marks.

work in progress 2/10/03                                    10.


                            rayburn
               you been working?

                            creasy
               not for eight months. i was in columbia
               looking around, but, nothing seemed
               interesting.

                            rayburn
               how long you staying, crease?

                            creasy
                      (shrugs)
               got no plans, rayburn, nothing on. just
               wanted to see you, how you were. came by
               on impulse.

rayburn studies his friend a beat, just seeing the cracks
that weren't there last time they met.

                            rayburn
               you did something on impulse?

                            creasy
               everything happens once if you live long
               enough.

creasy smiles.
