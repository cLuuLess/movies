ext./int. house - sunset

pinta leads the way. all enthusiasm, away from her
parents. a 150 pound black german shepherd greets them.
sniffs creasy's pant leg, unsure.

                         pinta
            do you like dogs, mr. creasy?

                         creasy
            if they like me.

                         pinta
            frank doesn't take to most people.       do
            you speak german?

                         creasy
                   (in german)
            ein klines bisschen.     [a tiny bit.]

                         pinta
            frank only responds to commands in
            german. he was trained in frankfurt.
            my dad loves the idea of having a dog
            around, but hates the fact he lives
            inside.

creasy follows her.   frank pads along after them.

creasy's room

not like downstairs, but comfortable enough.

                         pinta
            we fixed the room up two weeks ago.       mom
            and i. it's nicer than before.

creasy takes a stroll around it, ignoring her.

                         pinta
            you've got a cd player if you like music.
            i like music a lot.

work in progress 2/10/03                                    18.


caw! creasy looks over at a cage on a stand holding a
macaw. it tilts its head at the big man.

a tv and vhs machine in the corner.

                            pinta
               that's 'bird.' emilio forgot to take him
               with when he left.

                               creasy
               who's emilio?

                            pinta
               my last bodyguard. he drove me to school
               in the morning and picked me up in the
               afternoon.

finally creasy turns, looks at her hard.

                            creasy
               i'm here for you?

pinta smiles huge, nods.

                            pinta
               in between you can take mom shopping and
               to lunch. does that sound alright, mr.
               creasy?

                             creasy
               creasy.   just call me creasy.

                            pinta
                      (big grin)
               creasy...

frank's tail wags imperceptibly.

                            pinta
               looks like he approves of you.

and then, walking on air, she's out the door.

creasy sets up his room with meticulous precision that
comes from years in the military. front and center he
arranges his shrine: an almost empty bottle of scotch and
a glass (engraved from an earlier encounter) next to a
pack of marlboros and his weathered zippo. then, his
beaten up gun and holster. a well-travelled new
testament is placed in the drawer.

creasy's bag

work in progress 2/10/03                                     19.


he reaches in between the shirts, pulls out a fresh
bottle of scotch. he breaks the seal, unscrews the cap.

he pours a double... triple... wait, what do you call a
full glass of scotch?

caw!   the macaw squawks it's disapproval.

he ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, tries to
catch it on the back of his hand. an old game with
himself.

his hand is too shaky. the bullet bounces off, hits the
floor. creasy picks it up. ejecting the magazine, he
starts to oil the weapon.

caw! as the macaw squawks, creasy looks up. it doesn't
feel like this relationship is going to work.
