int.   airport - mexico city - day

samuel and lisa on the moving escalator. home from los
angeles. they look down through the glass, see creasy
waiting for them below. and finally, lisa frowns.

work in progress 2/10/03                                      58.


                         lisa
            he has to go, samuel.

                            samuel
            what?   who?

                            lisa
            creasy.

                           samuel
            why?    you were so pleased with him.

                         lisa
            pinta likes him too much.
                   (a beat)
            she thinks of him as a father.

                         samuel
            that's ridiculous.

                            lisa
            it's not.

samuel thinks about it, is almost apologetic.

                         samuel
            i've just been so busy, lisa.

                            lisa
            he has to go.

samuel looks at her, wonders at her adamancy.

                         samuel
            the three month trial ends in a week. i
            just won't confirm the position. that
            possibility was understood when i hired
            him.

lisa gives him a look. she wants it done today.     but for
once, samuel is stronger than his wife.

                         samuel
            i won't create bad feelings. and another
            week won't make a difference.

off the escalator, they turn toward creasy waiting
unaware.

                         samuel
            it will be a hard break.

                            lisa
            she's young.     she'll get over it.

work in progress 2/10/03                                    59.


                          samuel
             i wasn't thinking of pinta.

as lisa looks over at samuel, he's reaching out his hand,
smiling big.

                          samuel
             creasy, how are you?

as they shake hands...
