ext. barrio sunset

a small russian taurus crests a hill and descends into
hell. a frightening looking barrio. burnt out cars and
dead dogs line the sidewalks. creasy tails the guardian
on his moped into the center of a trash dump. the focal
point being a semi-derelict church within a gated
compound. our 'tattooed handball genius' exits the
taurus. reaches in back for the groceries.
