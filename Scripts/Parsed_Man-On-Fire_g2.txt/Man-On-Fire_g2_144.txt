ext.   ice cream stand - busy mexican city street - night

creasy hands the girl an ice cream cone. he looks over
as rosanna hurries over from across the street.

creasy puts the little girl's hand into rosanna's.

                          creasy
             i need something. do you have banking
             connections?

                          rosanna
                    (hesitates, then...)
             i have connections.

creasy hands her the atm card.

work in progress 2/10/03                                    96.


                          creasy
             the pin number is 4-7-4-7.    i need to
             know whose account it is.

rosanna notices the blood on creasy's shirt.    near his
stomach.

                          rosanna
             where do i find you?

                          creasy
             i'll call you tomorrow.

creasy looks at the girl and starts off, then looks back.

                          creasy
             what do you know about the cop?
             tazinari. the one who made the ransom
             drop with samuel ramos?

                          rosanna
             he's an old fashioned patrone with the
             worst reputation. he's high on my hit
             list.

                          creasy
             where does he live?

                          rosanna
             he lives in a judicial compound. he
             travels by motorcade. he has better
             protection than george bush. even more
             importantly he is part of la hermanidad.
             his reach is far and wide.

                          creasy
             give me the address.

note: the following scene should play at the burned out
safehouse with rosanna.
