ext.   parking lot - municipal pool - day

the big swim meet. race day. a lot of security, men
speaking into their wrists. for a public gathering the
mood almost seems ominous. creasy and pinta exit the
mercedes. pinta watches wistfully as her fellow students
stream toward the water with their parents.

                          pinta
             what's so important in los angeles?

                          creasy
             your father has business.

                            pinta
             why today?    and why'd she have to go with
             him?

creasy shrugs. no comforting answer for her.     he looks
around at some of the other bodyguards.

                          creasy
             good luck. i'll be waiting here when
             you're done.

but she's shaking her head adamantly.    determined.

                          pinta
             you're coming with me.
