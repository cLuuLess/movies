int.   pinta's bedroom - mexico city - night

nine-year-old pinta martin ramos stares out at the
garden, a bit like creasy, but only a ten yard stare.
pinta's eyes brim with life. she folds her hands, closes
her eyes, prays. 'chopin' drifts up from downstairs.
samuel on the baby grand.

                            pinta
               dear god. i do not ask for health. or
               wealth. people ask you so often that you
               can't have any left. give me god what
               you still have. give me what no one else
               asks for. amen.

pinta grabs a battered old teddy bear and climbs into
bed. she pulls the covers up, looks over as her door
opens.

lisa enters.    pinta is her daughter.

                            lisa
               you should be sleeping, baby.

                         pinta
            i'm trying, mom.

lisa strokes her head, smiles.

                            lisa
            good news.     you're going back to school.

                          pinta
                    (sits up; excited)
            when?

                         lisa
            samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard.
            it may take a few days, but you're going
            back.

pinta lets it sink in.   lisa kisses her goodnight.

                         pinta
            could he speak english?     emilio couldn't
            speak english.

                        lisa
            we'll see. and thank your father in the
            morning. a man always needs to be
            thanked.
