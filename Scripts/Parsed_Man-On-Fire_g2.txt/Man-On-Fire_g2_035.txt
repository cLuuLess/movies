ext.   courtyard - pinta's school - day

creasy waits, smoking a marlboro light, separate from the
other drivers and bodyguards. the bodyguards stand
together sharing cigarettes and stories. give him a
share of unfriendly looks. creasy could care less.

the doors open and the children pour out. pinta exits, a
huge grin as she spots creasy. creasy palms the
marlboro. the frown on his might as well be chiseled in
marble.
