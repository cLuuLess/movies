ext. garden / pool - ramos house

creasy exits the house and stands by the pool. frank
appears tail wagging and attempts to comfort creasy.

leaves blow across the surface of the water. underwater
slow motion, a wall turn. it looks remarkably like
pinta.

"blue bayou" drifts through the air. soft, in the ether
somewhere. creasy hears it, half raises his head.

                          pinta's voice
             why blue bayou, creasy? is that where
             you're from?

she's standing behind him. wearing the all too familiar
one piece swimsuit, she towels her wet hair.

                          creasy
             blue bayou is a dream, pinta.     like you.

             dreams are beautiful, creasy-bear, but
             life is better.

                    (smiles)
             why are you here?

                          pinta ghost
             i have to watch you now.

close on creasy

the words are a salve, a balm.     he turns, looks back over
his shoulder. he's all alone.
