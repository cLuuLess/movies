royal pain in the ass she is. manzano awaits his answer.

             i'm not sure.     all i know is they died
             bravely.

he turns, points out another reporter.

                          rosanna
             if they were off duty, why were they in a
             patrol car? what exactly were they doing
             at the scene of a kidnapping?

he stares back over at her, furious.     rosanna smiles.

                          rosanna
             were they known for their exceptional
             good luck?

             and integrity!
