creasy driving.   pinta looking noble and brave.

                          creasy
             that's strange. frank was a no-show.
             not like him to miss a ride.

work in progress 2/10/03                                   60.

             you should break all my fingers, creasy,
             then tape them back together. i won't be
             able to play the piano, but i could still
             swim.

                          creasy
             don't be a baby. you're tougher than
             that.

                          pinta
             there's no such thing as tough, creasy.
             just trained and untrained.

                          creasy
                    (smiles)
             then be trained.

                          pinta
             i'm going to keep people safe someday.
             just like you.

                             creasy
             be a swimmer.

                          pinta
             i could do it. remember the day   you
             wanted the pencil? i know why.    and i
             saw that car again. i wrote the   license
             number in my notebook. except i   missed
             the last number.

creasy checks his mirror, nothing back there now.     he
then looks at pinta. a bit amazed.

                          creasy
             you'll have to show me that number when
             we get home.
