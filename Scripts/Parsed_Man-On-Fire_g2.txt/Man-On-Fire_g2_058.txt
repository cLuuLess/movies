creasy eats.

               the food is excellent, maria.     you have a

maria beams with pleasure.

               my pleasure, creasy.

pinta enters  in a red satin devil's outfit. she looks a

from creasy.   as she stares at her plate, creasy starts
to laugh at  what an odd sight she is. all dressed up and
no place to  go.

maria and creasy exchange a look...
