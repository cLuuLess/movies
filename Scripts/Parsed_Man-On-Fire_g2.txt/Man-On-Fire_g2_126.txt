ext.   cliffside - mexican city - day

a car graveyard sitting on top of a 300 foot cliff
overlooking a real tough barrio. gravel crunches under
the fiat's tires as it drives to the edge of a cliff.

                            creasy's voice
             stop here.    turn off the ignition.
