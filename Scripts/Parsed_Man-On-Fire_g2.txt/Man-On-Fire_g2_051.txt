ext.   courtyard - convent school - day

they pull in through the gates. the mercedes parks;
creasy gets out. pinta kisses her mother on the cheek.

                               pinta
               bye, mom.

                            lisa
               don't forget your towel.

pinta gets out with book bag and her      towel. as she
starts to walk past creasy without a      word, he holds out
her pencil. she holds up, shows him       a second pencil,
continues on her way. doesn't need       him.

mercedes

creasy gets back in, starts away.

                            lisa
               she has swimming practice today.    you'll
               need to pick her up at the pool.

creasy just nods. he doesn't want anything to do with
lisa either. thoughtful, lisa looks out the window.

                            lisa
               i talked to her. she understands.     she
               won't bother you anymore.

as creasy just drives.
