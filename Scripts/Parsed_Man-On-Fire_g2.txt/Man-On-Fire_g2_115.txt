int.   creasy's room - dawn

bruno lets him in. nothings been touched.     creasy
retrieves his bullet from his shrine along   with the
'jack', marlboros, and new testament. puts    his few
possessions in a bag. move with him as he    silently
crosses out into the hall, heads toward...

pinta's room

he stands there a moment. his pain entirely his own.
and then he goes to pinta's little desk, finds her school
notebook buried in a pile. he flips through it until he
finds...

work in progress 2/10/03                                        79.


the license plate number pinta jotted for him. then he
notices the notebook is really a diary. every page
references her day to day relationship with creasy. "i
love you creasy bear." he hears soft footsteps. creasy
turns.

lisa stands in the doorway in her nightgown, her eyes
drilling through creasy.

                            lisa
                      (softly)
               you let them take her.     she loved you and
               you let them take her.

creasy just blinks at her as the words blast through him.

                            lisa
               why are you here?     why didn't you die?

                            creasy
               because...
                      (shrugs)
               i was already dead.

eyes brimming, lisa has no more words.       but creasy comes
bearing cold comfort.

                              creasy
               i want you   to know something.
                      (a   beat)
               i'm going   to kill them. anyone who opens
               their eyes   at me.

lisa doesn't answer, but the connection between them is
suddenly monumental. finally, creasy looks away. he
picks up pinta's battered, old teddy bear.

                              lisa
               creasy...

he turns, but she doesn't look back at him.

                            lisa
               kill them, creasy.

creasy nods.    he will.    as he continues away...

                            lisa (cont'd)
               kill them all.
