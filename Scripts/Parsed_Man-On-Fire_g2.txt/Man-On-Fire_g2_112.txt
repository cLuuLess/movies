int.   suv - rolling - night

rayburn constantly checking the rear view.   no pursuit in
sight. he looks over at creasy.

                          rayburn
             how do you feel?

creasy looks over at him, finally shrugs.

                          creasy
             stomach's gone. but... okay.

                          rayburn
             i'll get you up to the border. friend of
             mine'll take you in to san diego. drop
             you right at the hospital.

creasy's not really listening. he's been looking in the
passenger side view mirror. nothing back there. creasy
sits up. a bit of an effort.

                          creasy
             got a thing i gotta do first.
