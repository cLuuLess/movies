int.   mercedes - rolling - day

both of them up front. pinta is happy to be there and
creasy doesn't seem to mind.

                          creasy
             did you sleep alright?

                            pinta
             yes.

                          creasy
             how's the ankle? can you put your weight
             on it?

                            pinta
             it's   not too bad. will it take a long
             time   before it's better? our big swim
             meet   is in three weeks. interschools.
             i was   going to swim in the one hundred
             meter   freestyle.

                          creasy
             in a week you should be fine.

they drive on a few silent beats, until...

                          pinta
             doesn't matter. i always finish second.

                          creasy
             you need to practice.

pinta looks at him hopefully, but creasy catches himself.
he's not going to coach a little girl. finally...

                            pinta
             i will.
