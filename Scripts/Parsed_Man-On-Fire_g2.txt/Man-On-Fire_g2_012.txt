jordan smiles at his client, enjoys seeing him squirm.

                          samuel
             of course i care about pinta. she'll be
             as beautiful as her mother one day.

                           jordan
             yeah?   and if she was ugly?

samuel rolls his eyes. jordan laughs.       beheading two
cigars, he passes one to samuel.

                         jordan
            all my clients have kidnap and ransom
            insurance.

                         samuel
            i have a policy, aig. it covers me and
            my family and when it runs out in sixty
            days, without a bodyguard, i will not be
            able to renew it.

                         jordan
            i know you need to please lisa. an ass
            like that is hard to find. good
            bodyguards are even harder.

                         samuel
                   (interrupts)
            i know! i just had to let one go because
            i couldn't afford him!

jordan lights his cigar.

                         jordan
            you need a bodyguard of some description.
            it's a dangerous world we live in. but
            you will get what you pay for. he
            doesn't need to be superman, does he?
            can you go fifteen grand?

                           samuel
            for a year?

                         jordan
            for a few months. hire someone cheap.
            you have to have a bodyguard to keep the
            insurance. then fire him for
            incompetence. the important thing is
            lisa's daughter will return to school.

samuel finally follows the logic.

                         samuel
            and lisa will be able to save face.    we
            won't be the only family without a
            bodyguard.

                         jordan
            her beauty fucks with your mind.

                         samuel
            for an american she understands this
            country very well.

work in progress 2/10/03                                   6.


                           jordan
              she understands men.

as samuel puffs his cigar in satisfaction...
