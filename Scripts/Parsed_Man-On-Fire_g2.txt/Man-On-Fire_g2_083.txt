ext.   swimming meet - municipal pool - day

a big marquee has been set up alongside the pool.
coltish girls in swimsuits. parents socialize, drink
cocktails. richly dressed. bodyguards and security are
outside of it, on the perimeter.

creasy looks completely out of place.

                          pinta
             stand near the finish line.

pinta starts away.

                            creasy
             pinta.

she turns, looks back at him.

                            creasy
            the blocks.

                         pinta
                   (smiles; knows)
            i'm a prisoner in them.    until the
            gunshot sets me free.

creasy nods. he smiles. he's serious now. as he
watches her head off for the track, sister anna steps up.

                         sister anna
            mr. creasy, nice to see you.

and now creasy is completely out of place.

                         creasy
                   (apologetic)
            pinta's parents are in los angeles.      i
            was going to wait in the courtyard,
            but...

she takes his arm, pats his hand.

                         sister anna
            today you are her father.

as creasy lets this sink   in, looks out where pinta is
warming up. sister  anna   smiles, heads off to a group of
parents. we're left  with   creasy. confused creasy. but
clarity is creeping in.    as the sky opens up around
him...

                                                   cut to:

starter's pistol

pointed up at precisely 45 degrees.    baaaangg!

starting blocks

eyes closed serenely, pinta surges forward, leaving
everyone behind.

creasy

sees it. she hasn't even hit the water and he already
knows she's won.

pinta

splash! ten meters in before she breaks the surface.
her head sweeping left and then right.

work in progress 2/10/03                                   55.


wherever her competitors are, it's somewhere behind her.
and the future, everything ahead, is wide open.

turn wall - underwater

pinta somersaults, kicks off and is gone.

surface

and the finish line seems to come to her.

the crowd

cheers enthusiastically as she reaches the finish wall.

creasy

watches her, satisfied with what he's done.

pinta hauls herself out of the water and runs.

a beeline for creasy. and the poor fucker doesn't even
understand, until she's leaping the last few feet...

into his arms.

                          pinta
             i won, creasy! i won!

she loves him...   creasy hugs her.   he loves her back.
