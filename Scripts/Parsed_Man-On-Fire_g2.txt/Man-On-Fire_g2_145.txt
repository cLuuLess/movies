int.   manzano's office - afi hq - night

a beehive. cops. photos of dead kidnappers on the wall:
jorge and sandri. sandri emasculated, one hand missing.
jorge behind the wheel, fingers stubs and a missing ear.

                          adjutant
             two in one day. and they died very
             badly. sandri and jorge were prime
             suspects in twelve kidnappings in the
             last six months.

manzano studies the photo of jorge.

                         manzano
            whoever did this was methodical,
            unafraid. was jorge's mugshot in the
            photos we showed creasy?

                         adjutant
            no, i checked. but right   after sandri
            was shot, a girlfriend of  his was found
            naked, hysterical in the  street. she
            said it was a man fitting  creasy's
            description who shot him.

                         manzano
            mr. creasy was, and maybe is again, a
            very lethal human being.

                         adjutant
            you don't seem very surprised?

manzano looks at his adjutant, pleased with his
perception. but he isn't sharing.

                         manzano
            what's surprising these days?

an afi agent brings over a plate of red shredded chicken.
manzano takes a bite, moans in pleasure.

                           manzano
            your sister?    only a virgin cooks like
            this.

                         agent
                   (laughs)
            your man's here. interrogation room two.

                                                cut to:

surveillance room

seen through a two-way mirror.   manzano watches as...

rayburn sits at a steel chair, bolted to the floor.
rayburn's eyes are closed. in meditation. then, slowly,
his arms extend out to the sides. manzano is curious as,
slower still, rayburn extends both hands out in front of
him, palms up. must be a zen thing.

then, both middle fingers are extended. with eyes still
closed, rayburn mouths 'fuck you'. manzano bursts a
laugh.

                                                cut to:

work in progress 2/10/03                                    98.


interrogation room two

rayburn opens his eyes, looks over as manzano enters.
still eating, he hands rayburn a second plate of chicken.

                         manzano
            pollo pibil. chicken and chorizo
            sausage. hmmmh. they marinate it in
            lemon and orange juice. it's a stew
            really.

                         rayburn
                   (sets it down)
            i already ate.

manzano enjoys another bite, then...

                         manzano
            tell me about your friend creasy.

                         rayburn
            you just said it. he's my friend.
            nothing else to say.

                         manzano
            i read the file. you and creasy have
            seen quite a bit together.

                         rayburn
            two tourists who never went home.

                         manzano
            you helped him get this job.

                         rayburn
            that's what friends do.

                         manzano
            yes. but if i traced creasy to you,
            others will do it as well. their
            facilities are as good as my own, if not
            better.

                         rayburn
            i can take care of myself.

                         manzano
            you and creasy both. a two man army
            according to interpol. panama. lebanon
            with the druze. desert storm. where you
            were contracted by the u.s. army to hunt
            down elite iraqi military commanders.
                   (laughs)
            you two were a married couple.

work in progress 2/10/03                                    99.


                          rayburn
            the kind that gets divorced, but still
            stay friends.

                         manzano
            what happened to him?   what happened to
            creasy?

rayburn flinches at some bitter memory.

                         rayburn
            none of your business. or mine for that
            matter. i got nothing more to say.

                         manzano
            this is my jurisdiction. i want these
            men as much as creasy does.

                         rayburn
            he'll deliver more justice in a weekend,
            than ten years of your courts and
            tribunals. so stay out of his way.

                         manzano
            i plan to. i'll even help him if i can.
            he's going to lead me to the 'the
            dreamer'. someone i want very badly.
            but i'd like to understand him. give me
            that.

                         rayburn
            pinta martin ramos is just a number to
            you. tragic, a public outcry, but a
            number. one more dead.

                         manzano
            what was she to creasy then?

                         rayburn
            light. at the end of a long, dark
            tunnel. somehow, she showed him it was
            alright to live again.

                         manzano
            and they took that away.

                         rayburn
            a man can be an artist in anything.
            stone, paint, words. food. anything if
            his soul is true to it. creasy's art is
            death. and he's about to paint his
            masterpiece.

the words sink in.   manzano understands their magnitude.

work in progress 2/10/03                                   100.


                          rayburn
             me? i got jap businessmen to drive
             across the border. so, if you'll do me a
             favor and let me the fuck out of here...
