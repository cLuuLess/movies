ext.   mercedes - ramos house - day

pedro the 'car wash guy' puts the finishing touches to
the mercedes.

using crutches, pinta hobbles over. creasy opens the
back door for her. but when she gets there, she
hesitates.

                          pinta
             i think i'll sit in the front.     there's
             more room for my foot.

creasy makes no big deal of it. he takes her crutches,
opens the front. as she scoots inside... frank waits
and watches. creasy calls to him.

             he's only allowed to travel in the car on
             weekends. dad says the car will smell
             'doggie'.
