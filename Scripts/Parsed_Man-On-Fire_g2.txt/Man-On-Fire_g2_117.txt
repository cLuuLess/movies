rayburn looks over his shoulder, sees creasy walking down
the street. clutching a teddy bear.

creasy gets in the car.    rayburn drives.

                          rayburn
             you'll be stateside by suppertime.

no answer.   finally, as rayburn lights a cigarette...

                          creasy
             i'm going to need help, ray.

rayburn grinds out the cigarette he just lit, knows what
just was asked. creasy needs help unleashing a plague.

                         rayburn
            fuck. look at you; you won't last a day
            the shape you're in. unless you stop
            bleeding you should have your spleen
            removed.

                           creasy
            yes or no?

                         rayburn
                   (after a beat)
            i won't kill again. hunt people. i gave
            that up. anything else? it's yours.

creasy reaches into a pocket, hands rayburn a hand
written list. rayburn reads, his eyes widening.

                         rayburn
            jesus, creasy. you're talking war.
