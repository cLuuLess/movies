int.   mercedes - rolling - day

creasy clocks the corolla, frowns. he pulls a piece of
paper from his pocket. but nothing to write with.

                          creasy
             pinta, do you have a pencil?

                          pinta
             i go to school, don't i?

sarcasm. he stays calm, doesn't let on what he's
thinking.

                           creasy
             please?

her little hand comes over the top of the seat with a
pencil. creasy takes it, slows to let the corolla catch
up. he squints into the mirror to read the plate.

lisa is oblivious, but as pinta looks back over her
shoulder...

brake lights up ahead. creasy lurches to a stop.    the
corolla swerves around them disappears ahead.

                           creasy
             sorry.

                          lisa
             the traffic takes some getting used to.

as creasy cranes for a view, another white corolla comes
by headed the opposite way. they're everywhere. this
relaxes creasy's paranoia. as he laughs to himself.
