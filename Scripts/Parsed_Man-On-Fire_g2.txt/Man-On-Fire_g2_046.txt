ext.   ramos house - night

creasy stands at the edge of the drive, the house dark
behind him. on his cell phone.

work in progress 2/10/03                                     32.


                         creasy
            i said, have you ever had a nine
            millimeter round that just didn't go off?

                                        intercut the following:

rayburn pulling away, sitting on the edge of the bed.

                         rayburn
            you mean a misfire?

                         creasy
            i mean nothing. the hammer came down and
            nothing happened. dimple on the primer.

                         rayburn
            i've heard of it. never happened to me
            though. maybe the firing pin's off.

                            creasy
            maybe...

creasy is troubled about it all to say the least.

                         rayburn
            it's like we always used to say: a bullet
            always tells the truth. what were you
            shooting at?

creasy doesn't answer.    he holds the bullet up, looks at
it.

                            rayburn
                      (focusing; concerned)
            creasy?

                         creasy
            sorry i woke you, ray.

creasy clicks off the phone. he starts back toward the
house, but stops short again.

there she is. pinta. standing in the window of her
room. she's been watching him. it's like creasy seeing
her for the first time. and she's been watching him
forever. no easy answer for it. they're connected
somehow.
