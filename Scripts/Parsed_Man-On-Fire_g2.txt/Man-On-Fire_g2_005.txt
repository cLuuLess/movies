int.   video surveillance of an 8' x 4' cell - day

a wall smeared with god-knows-what. facing   it, eighteen
stands naked blindfolded and shivering. the   back of his
leg still bleeds. he shifts nervously as a   little jack
russell terrier eagerly licks the blood off  his calf.

a man ('the dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates
by cell phone. voice calm. as he runs numbers, he slaps
his thigh. jack russell trots over, gets an ear
scratched.

at a motion from the man, eighteen is taken down to the
ground. straddled by two men, his head is mummified in
tape leaving one ear exposed.

syndicates...growth of kidnapping in mexico over the last
two years."
