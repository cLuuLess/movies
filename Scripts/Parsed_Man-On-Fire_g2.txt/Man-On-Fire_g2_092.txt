int.   sitting room - ramos villa - mexico city - day

a bedraggled-looking samuel sits with jordan by the
phone. an insurance company lawyer is here as well.
maria cries softly in a doorway.

montage - of chaos and panic. judicial police are trying
to set up shop. tape recorders. listening devices.

             they usually ask for three times the
             amount they expect...

they react as two vehicles pull up outside. chaos as the
front door opens. men in suits, several policemen.
their very well-groomed leader is colonel tazinari.

             we do not need or want police
             involvement. i am the negotiator. we
             feel a better guarantee of getting pinta
             back without your involvement.

                           tazinari
             i have a written order from the public
             ministry. two police officers were
             killed.
                     (he holds up the phone)
             this is the attorney general navarro
             bernal diaz.

              the law requires an intervention by the
              authorities "de officio."

a ringing phone sounds like an bomb exploding in the
room. a technician answers. jordan takes the receiver.
we hear the conversation. the kidnapper only wants to
talk to the father. everybody is one headsets,
monitoring. samuel listens carefully. jordan prompts
him with hand-written replies on a notepad. samuel
negotiates the amount via notes from his lawyer.

quick cuts:

                           samuel
              it's impossible. i cannot afford thirty
              million. i will need to borrow the
              money.

samuel proposes five million.   kidnapper gets angry.
demands 20 million.

                                                cut to:

                           samuel
              the realities are i do not have access to
              this type of money.

they settle at ten million.   the kidnapper gives a list
of instructions.

              two and a half million in two different
              bags. the bags you can get from save-on.
              fifteen gallon, black canvas, divide the
              money equally.

samuel is on another phone talking to family friends
asking if they will front a hundred thousand dollars
each. which will be paid back by the k & r insurance in
45 days.
