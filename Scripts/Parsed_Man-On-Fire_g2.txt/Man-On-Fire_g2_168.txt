int.   closed restaurant - night

the owner watches nervously as   creasy approaches wearing
a wool cap. a pale attempt at    disguising his identity.
there's a newspaper folded on   his dais, more photos of
creasy, his dead targets, the   story of his vendetta.

                          creasy
             i'm looking for rosanna guerrero.

                            owner
             this way.

empty restaurant, chairs  on tables. an    exterior
streetlight illuminates  the darkness.    the owner leads
him down a row of empty  booths. creasy    slows, stops as
he sees the only person  waiting for him   is manzano. as
manzano smiles.

                          manzano
                    (holds up paper)
             hombre en fuego. man on fire. that's
             what the papers have named you.

                          creasy
             it's what you and rosanna named me.
             right?

work in progress 2/10/03                                  113.


                         manzano
            sit, creasy. everything that happens
            from now on does so with my permission.
                   (smiles)
            really. you won't find a better carne
            asada in all of mexico.

the table is covered in an arrangement of the best food
you will ever find in mexico. creasy sits.

                         manzano
                   (laughs at himself)
            the last few days may represent the best
            police work of my life.

                         creasy
            what do you want?

                         manzano
            the same thing as you. except, my reach
            isn't as long as yours. my father was a
            policemen, did you know that?

                         creasy
            i don't know shit about you.

                         manzano
            he was one of the original founders of
            'le hermanidad' in the days when it
            represented good not evil.

manzano smiles; he likes creasy.

                         manzano
            he was murdered. and now here i am.
            trying to honor his memory. hamstrung by
            bureaucracy and corruption. the
            organization that he began now protects
            criminals at the highest level where i
            would need a presidential finding in
            order to expose it...or you.

the waiter steps over; manzano waves him off.

                         manzano
            my family lives in miami.   because of the
            death threats.

                         creasy
            it's not worth it. be with them instead.

work in progress 2/10/03                                   114.


                         manzano
            it galls me to watch you. you can do as
            much in days as i can in years. men like
            the 'the dreamer' are protected. out of
            everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.

                         creasy
            are you going to arrest me or talk me to
            death?

manzano laughs again.   genuine.   creasy cracks him up.

                         manzano
            my country needs justice. proper
            justice. gunning men down in the street
            only feeds the violence. they need to
            be brought to trial. dealt with
            properly.
            then people will respect the law. when
            they see it works.

                         creasy
            so you are going to talk me to death.

                         manzano
            you walk out and deal justice. you're
            what i wish i could be.
                   (another laugh, then a beat)
            the policemen who kills you, his family
            will have all they want.

                         creasy
            then i hope the one who gets me has got
            lots of kids. what do you want?

                         manzano
            i want to arrest you for murder! i want
            to shake your hand and reload your gun!
            i want to kill my pride and give you my
            blessing.

                         creasy
            my deal is with rosanna. i knew you guys
            were up to something. are you two
            fucking?

                         manzano
            no, but i have to admit i thought about
            it.

                        creasy
            liar. just tell me who the bank card
            belongs to. name and address.

work in progress 2/10/03                                       115.


                             manzano
               you have no interest in making things
               easy, do you?

                            creasy
               i'm not... easy.

manzano reaches into his pocket. he pulls out a folded
piece of paper and a prescription bottle. he hands the
bottle out first.

                             manzano
               percodan.   i imagine you need handfuls by
               now.

creasy makes no move to take it. manzano sighs, sets it
down in front of him. regarding the paper...

                            manzano
               account belongs to a woman we think is
               the dreamer's girlfriend. reina rosas,
               who is 8 months pregnant.

creasy holds his hand out.     manzano hesitates.

                            manzano
               the plan is the girlfriend will lead you
               to the boss. you'll lead me, and i'll
               arrest him. agreed?

creasy doesn't respond. finally manzano gives him the
paper, a mimeographed mugshot, and address scrawled on it.
creasy stands. as he scoops up the pills. creasy starts
out.

                            manzano
               creasy...
                      (creasy turns)
               i'd have liked to have known you under
               different circumstances.

                            creasy
               off the top of my head, i don't know what
               they could've been.

as creasy departs...
