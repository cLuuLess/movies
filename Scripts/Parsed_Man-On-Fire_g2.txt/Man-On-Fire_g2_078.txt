int.   creasy's room - night

creasy's finger presses play. "blue bayou" begins.
plaintive, haunting. as he moves to sit in his chair, he
passes the scotch bottle. it has gone unopened.

he ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, smoothly
catches it on the back of his hand. rock steady.
frank's tail wags.
