tazinari's car slams into the debris of the lead car and
slides sideways against a wall wedging it in. real
tight.

                                               cut to:

creasy

a 'man on fire' strides through the smoke and dust. a
shotgun at his side and a molotov cocktail in his left
hand.

without missing  a stride he unloads both barrels into the
drivers window.   a scary prospect even though it's bullet-
proof. the lit   molotov explodes beneath the car.
silence. then a   dull impact explosion. 30 feet of
flames envelope  the car. the driver and tazinari both
prisoners inside  their own car.

the driver exits releasing a full clip from his uzi.
creasy nails him with a single shot to the head.

tazinari exits through the flames hands high in the air.
