int.   creasy's room - night

as the song repeats, creasy chambers yet another round.
feels like he misses a beat as he loads one shell into
the chamber. pinta sings along oblivious. suddenly the
barrel is at his forehead and the trigger has been
pulled. no gun shot. a click. hammer against shell.
creasy is confused. he ejects the shell and catches it
in the palm of his hand. macro photograph / a small dimple
on the back of the shell is the only evidence of his
actions. pinta still dances.
