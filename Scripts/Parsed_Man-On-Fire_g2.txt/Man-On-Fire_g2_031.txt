int.   big burly suv - driving toward the border - day

six japanese businessmen jabber on cellphones. rayburn's
daily routine. he sits up front an uzi cradled in his
lap. as his own cell phone rings, he answers.

                          rayburn
             rayburn here. creasy, what's up?
                    (listens; laughs)
             yeah?

                                                cut to:

police line-up wall - as creasy's mug shot is flashed.

creasy's hand - as he's fingerprinted.

                          creasy
             there's still ink on my fingers from last
             week.

rayburn's suv

                          rayburn
             you got tossed. don't trust the cops,
             especially the judicials.
