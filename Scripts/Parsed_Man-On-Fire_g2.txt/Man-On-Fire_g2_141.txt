ext.   guardia de seguidad - night

a window to the left explodes as the room is enveloped in
flames. the front door opens, a weird sight. creasy
exits holding both the 12-year-old's hand and the female
guardian who's bound and blindfolded in her underwear.

they walk straight at camera as flames shoot out of the
roof. creasy has set the place on fire. creasy is on
fire. and as they continue to walk towards us...

                                                     cut to:

black screen

                            creasy's voice
               roman chapter 13:7. therefore whoever
               resists authority will bring judgement on
               themselves. now it is time to awake out
               of sleep for our salvation is nearer than
               we first believed.
