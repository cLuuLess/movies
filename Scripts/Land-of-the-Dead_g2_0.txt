black. the sound of channels being turned on a tv. title up:    


"some time ago".

         it's hard for us here to believe
         what we're reporting to you, but it                    
         does seem to be a fact.                                
click! in a corner of the black screen, a small tv appears.     
on it, in black & white, a newscaster sits at an anchor desk.   

                   newscaster (o.s.)                            

         bodies of the recently dead are
         returning to life and attacking the                    
         living.                                                
click! with each click, the tv disappears, then reappears in
a new position on screen. credits roll in the surrounding       

                                                                


black.


                                                                


                   newscaster (o.s.)

         murder victims have shown signs of
         having been partially devoured by                      
         their murderers.                                       
click! another newscaster is on the tv now, sitting in a more
modern studio. the broadcast remains in black & white.          

                   second newscaster                            

         because of the obvious threat to                       

                                                                

         untold numbers of citizens, due
         to the crisis that is now                              
         developing this radio station will                     

                                                                

         remain on the air day and night.

                                                                

click! the second newscaster looks more and more dishevelled.




                   second newscaster (o.s.)                     

         it has been established that persons                   
         who have recently died have been                       
         returning to life and eating the                       
         flesh of the living.                                   

click!





                   second newscaster (o.s.)

         we must not be lulled by the                           
         concept that these are our family
         members or our friends. they are not.                  
         they must be destroyed on sight.                       
click! a third newscaster, more haggard than the others, sits   
at an anchor desk on a barren set, still in black & white.      




                                                                     














                                                           2.











                       third newscaster (o.s.)                       

             every dead body that is not                             
             exterminated becomes one of them.                       
             it gets up and kills. the people it                     
             kills get up and kill. they kill                        
             for one reason. they kill for food.                     

    click!                                                           


                       third newscaster (o.s.)                       

             if this situation is allowed to                         
             continue, there will be nothing                         
             left. nothing.                                          

    click!





                       third newscaster (cont'd)                     


                                                                     

             it's over. finished. finished. it's
             their world now.                                        




                                                                     


    click! in absolute black, a single word fades up: "today". a

    sound fades in too. tchick! ka-tchick-tchicky-tchick! soft.      
    metallic. it makes us nervous.
