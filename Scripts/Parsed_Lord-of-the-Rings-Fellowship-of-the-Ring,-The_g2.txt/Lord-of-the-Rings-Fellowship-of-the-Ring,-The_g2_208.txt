int. caverns below isengard -- day

quick cuts: lurtz is quickly armored...breastplate...leg
guards, helmet...a sword is thrust in lurtz's hand. the uruk-
hai are smearing themselves in white paint...a creepy
ritualistic ceremony...the white hand of isengard is smeared
on bodies, faces, and armor. saruman address a crowd of 200
fully armed uruk-hai.

                    saruman
          hunt them down. do not stop until they
          are found. you do not know pain. you do
          not know fear. you will taste man-flesh.
          saruman turns to lurtz.

                    saruman (cont'd)
              (coldly)
          one of the halflings carries something of
          great value...bring him to me...alive and
          unspoiled...kill the others.
