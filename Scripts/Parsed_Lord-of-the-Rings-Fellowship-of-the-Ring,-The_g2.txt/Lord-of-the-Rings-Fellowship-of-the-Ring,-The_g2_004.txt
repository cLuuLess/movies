image: gladden field...isildur leads a small column of men
through darkening woods...the one ring glinting on a chain
around his neck.

                      galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
            but the hearts of men are easily
            corrupted. and the ring of power has a
            will of its own.

suddenly!    arrows fly!   they are ambushed by orcs...isildur
screams!

                                                     fade to black

fade up: isildur materializes under water...as the ring slips
slowly from his finger. ripples of light play across
isildur's pale face...he is dead.

                      galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
            it betrayed isildur to his death.

image: the ring falls through the murky waters of the river
anduin.

                      galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
            and some things that should not have been
            forgotten...were lost.

                                                     fade to black

                      galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
            history became legend...legend became
            myth.

fade up: the waters of the anduin river lie dark and
undisturbed.

                      galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
            and for two and a half thousand years the
            ring passed out of all knowledge.

image: silt swirls...a thin white hand reaches
down...grasping the ring...

                      galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
            until, when chance came, it ensnared a
            new bearer!

image: the thin white hand opens to reveal one ring.

                      gollum (v.o.)
            my precious...

                                                                5.



image: mist shrouded mountains...

                    galadriel (v.o.)
          the ring came to the creature gollum, who
          took it deep into the tunnels of the
          misty mountains.

image: the gloom of a mountain cavern..a murky pool of
water...in the darkness the shadowy outline of an emaciated
figure.

                    galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
          and there, it consumed him. a raspy voice
          mutters in the half light...

                    gollum
          it came to me. my own.     my love...
              (ecstatic whisper)
          my preciousness.

                    galadriel (v.o.)
          the ring brought to gollum unnatural long
          life. for five hundred years it poisoned
          his mind. and in the gloom of gollum's
          cave...

                                                     fade to black

                       galadriel (v.o.)   (cont'd)
          it waited.

fade up: bathed in cold moonlight, the world lies dark and
still...the unsettled quiet before the storm...

                    galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
          darkness crept back into the forests of
          the world. rumor grew of a shadow in the
          east...whispers of a nameless fear. and
          the ring of power perceived...its time
          had now come. it abandoned gollum.

slow motion: unseen by its keeper..the ring falls to the
muddy floor of a mountain tunnel...

                    galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
          but something happened then the ring did
          not intend...

                                                     fade to black

image: fumbling in the dark, a small hand closes over the

                                                                 6.



ring.

                      galadriel
            it was picked up by the most unlikely
            creature imaginable...

                      bilbo
                (to himself)
            what's this?

a youngish looking bilbo baggins peers down at what lies in
his hand...perplexed by what he has found.

                      galadriel (v.o.)
            a hobbit....bilbo baggins of the shire.

                      bilbo
                (surprised)
            a ring.

suddenly!   a voice screams...its anguish ringing through the

cold, dank tunnels...

                       gollum (v.o.)
            lost!   lost! my precious is lost!!

frightened bilbo quickly pockets the one ring and hurries on.

                                                      dissolve to:

wide on: the camera soars away from the mountains.      moving

faster and faster...their dark green forests and jagged

white peaks receding into the shroud of mist

                      galadriel (v.o.)
            for the time will soon come when hobbits
            will shape the fortunes of all.

                                                    fade to black
