          i did. it's just...we did what gandalf
          wanted, didn't we? we got the ring this
          far, to rivendell...and i thought...
          seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be
          off soon. off home.

                    frodo
          you're right, sam. frodo looks at sam...

                    frodo (cont'd)
          ...we did what we set out to do. frodo
          opens his hand, the ring sits in his
          palm.

                    frodo (cont'd)
          the ring will be safe in rivendell. i am
          ready to go home.
