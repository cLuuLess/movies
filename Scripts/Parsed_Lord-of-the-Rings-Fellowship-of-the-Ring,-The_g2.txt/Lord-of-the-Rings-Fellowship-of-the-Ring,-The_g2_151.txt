int. council chamber, rivendell -- day

elrond addresses the council...

                    elrond
          strangers from distant lands ... friends
          of old. you have been summoned here to
          answer the threat of mordor. middle-earth
          stands upon the brink of destruction.
          none can escape it. you will unite...or
          you will fall. each race is bound to this
          fate...this one doom...

frodo sits amongst a council of free-peoples of middle earth,
elrond stands before them, addressing gandalf, strider,
legolas, and 20 other elves, dwarves, and men.

                    elrond (cont'd)
          bring forth the ring, frodo.

frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone plinth. he
places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat.

              (shocked)
          so it is true!

                    legolas
              (disbelief)
          sauron's ring! the ring of power!

                                                    (continued)
