          i will be dead before i see the ring in
          the hands of an elf! a storm of argument
          erupts around the room. close on:
          frodo...sound disappears as he watches in
          slow

motion...the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory
fingers, his eyes move across to the ring...the hum grows
louder in his head.

                    gimli (cont'd)
              (shouting)
          never trust an elf!

close on: the ring fills the screen...streams of blood flow
across the surface... flames flicker within the gold band.

                    gandalf
          do you not understand? while we    bicker
          among ourselves, sauron's power   grows!
          no one will escape it. you will   all be
          destroyed, your homes burnt and   your
          families put to the sword!

close on: frodo...breathing rapidly, caught in the grip of
his hideous vision. with a huge effort or will, frodo tears
his gaze upon the ring. frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in
a strong, clear voice.

                    frodo
          i will take it...i will take it...i will
          take the ring to mordor.

sudden silence...frodo looks around the room at the astounded
faces.

                    frodo (cont'd)
              (quietly)
          though...i do not know the way. gandalf
          rises to his feet.

                    gandalf
          i will help you bear this burden, frodo
          baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.

                    aragorn
          if, by my life or death, i can protect
          you, i will.
              (kneels before frodo)
          ...you have my sword. aragorn steps
          forward...followed by legolas and gimli.


                                                      (continued)

                                                          77.
