int. strider's room -- night

wide on: sam, merry, and pippin have been sleeping on
strider's bed. frodo stands next to strider by the window,
peering out nervously as furious ringwraith screeches echo
across the courtyard from the hobbits room.

                    frodo
          where are they?

                    strider
          they were once men. strider glances
          quickly at frodo, then looks away...



                                                 (continued)

                                                           51.
