          might have known!

                                                        cut to:

merry and pippin

are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy
water...with gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and
sipping an ale. cries of "speech! speech" erupt from the
party.

                                                      angle on:

bilbo stepping on a stool...he bows in gratitude at the
applause.

                       frodo
          speech!

                    bilbo
              (clearing throat)
          my dear bagginses, and boffins, tooks and
          brandybucks...grubbs, chubbs,
          hornblowers, bolgers, bracegirdles and
          proudfoots...

angle on: a hobbit with particularly big feet

                       odo proudfoot
          proudfeet!

                    bilbo
          today is my one hundred and eleventh
          birthday. yes, and alas...eleventy- one
          years is far too short a time to live
          among such excellent and admirable
          hobbits! tremendous outburst of approval!

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          i don't know half of you half as well as
          i should like; and i like less than half
          of you as well as well as you deserve.

scattered clapping as the guests try to work out if that was
a compliment or not. close on: frodo and gandalf smiling to
themselves. close on: bilbo...a strange hum seems to fill his
head. a bead of sweat rolls down his brow.

bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and
holds it behind his back.
