ext. shore of nen hithoel -- day

angle on: the fellowship

as they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded
shore.

          we cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
          boats and continue on foot..we approach
          mordor from the north.

          oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
          our way through emyn muil, an impassable
          labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. and
          after that gets even better...a
          festering, stinking marshland, far as the
          eye can see.

                    aragorn
          that is our road...i suggest you take
          some rest and recover your strength,
          master dwarf.

          no. orcs patrol the eastern shore. we
          must wait for cover of darkness.

          me.

          a shadow and a threat has been growing in
          my mind. something draws near, i can
          feel it.
