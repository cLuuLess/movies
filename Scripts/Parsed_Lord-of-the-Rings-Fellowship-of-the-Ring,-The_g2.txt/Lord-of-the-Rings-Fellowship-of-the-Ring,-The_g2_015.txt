int. bag end living room -- day

bilbo leads gandalf into bag end...cozy and cluttered with
souvenirs of bilbo's travels. gandalf has to stoop to avoid
hitting his head on the low ceiling. bilbo hangs up gandalf's
hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.

                    bilbo
              (calling)
          tea? or maybe something stronger... i've
          a few bottles of the old winyard left,
          1296...a very good year, almost as old as
          i am. it was laid down by my father. what
          say we open one, eh?

bilbo disappears into the kitchen as gandalf looks
around..enjoying the familiarity of bag end...he turns,
knocking his head on the light and then walking into the
wooden beam. he groans.

                    bilbo (o.s.) (cont'd)
          i was expecting you some time last week.
          not that it matters, you come and go as
          you please, always have done, always
          will.
