          i meant to go back...wander the paths of
          mirkwood, visit laketown, see the lonely
          mountain again...but age, it seems, has
          finally caught up with me.

frodo turns a page...there before him, is a map of the shire.

                    frodo
              (quietly)
          i miss the shire...i spent all my
          childhood pretending i was off somewhere
          else...off with you, on one of your
          adventures...
              (looks at bilbo)
          but my own adventure, turned out to be
          quite different...i'm not like you,
          bilbo.

                    bilbo
          my dear boy...
