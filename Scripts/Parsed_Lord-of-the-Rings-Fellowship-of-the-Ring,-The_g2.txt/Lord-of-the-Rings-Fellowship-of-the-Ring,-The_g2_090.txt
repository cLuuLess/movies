          indeed? i can usually avoid being seen
          if i wish, but to disappear entirely...
          that is a rare gift.

                    frodo
          who are you?

                    strider
          are you frightened?

                    frodo
          yes.

                    strider
          not nearly frightened enough. i know
          what hunts you. frodo jumps at the sound
          of a noise in the corridor. strider
          deftly draws his sword.

the door bursts open and sam, merry and pippin appear on the
doorway. sam is squaring off with is fists, merry brandishes
a candlestick, and pippin a chair.

                    sam
              (angry)
          let him go or i'll have you, longshanks!

strider sheaths his sword, a slight smile playing on his
lips.

                    strider
          you have a stout heart, little hobbit,
          but that alone won't save you...you can
          no longer wait for the wizard, frodo.
          they're coming.
