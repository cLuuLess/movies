gandalf hauls a small figure into the room...sam gamgee
sprawls across the floor! he looks up in terror as gandalf
looms over him.

                    gandalf (cont'd)
              (angry)
          confound it all! samwise gamgee, have
          you been eavesdropping?

                    sam
          i ain't been dropping no eaves, sir!
          honest. i was just cutting the grass
          under the window there, if you follow
          me...

                    gandalf
          it's a little late for trimming the
          hedges, don't you think?

                    sam
          i heard raised voices...

                    gandalf
          what did you hear?   speak!

                     sam
              (panicked)
          nothing important...that is, i heard a
          good deal about a ring...and a dark lord.
          and something about the end of the world,
          but...please, mr. gandalf, sir, don't
          hurt me! don't turn me into anything
          unnatural!

                    gandalf
          no?

frodo smiles

                    gandalf
          perhaps not. i've thought of a better
          use for you.
