overgrown forest. sam follows at the read leading "bill", a
scrawny pony, who is laden with supplies.

                    frodo
          where are you taking us?

                    strider
          into the wild.

frodo watches uneasily as strider moves off into the cover of
the trees...

                    merry
              (whispered aside)
          how do, we know this strider is a friend
          of gandalf?

                    frodo

                    strider
          but where is he leading us?
