ext. seeing seat -- day

                                          in the twilight world:

frodo races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy
shapes of twisted trees. somewhere behind him, boromir's
distraught voice carries from another dimension:

                      boromir (o.s.)
            i'm sorry, frodo...frodo...

frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambers
up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone
pillars. frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the
throne of mountain kings. the world of mist swirls around
him. frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems to
shrink. in all directions, views of far off lands telescope
towards him through the mist. images: orcs spilling out of
holes in the misty mountains... flames rising from
mirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black ships
sailing into the south. all the power of the dark lord is in
motion. frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodes
against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills
frodo's vision. a mountain of iron, immeasurably strong,
tower of adamant: barad-dur, fortress of sauron!

suddenly!   sauron's eye leaps toward frodo like a finger of

light.

sauron (v.o.)

(in black speech)

they will fall! frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down
the stairs! the eye sweeps amon hen like a searchlight,
seeking its ring! with a huge effort, frodo wrenches the ring
off his finger...
