          half the shire's been invited...

                    gandalf
          good gracious, me.

                    frodo
          he's up to something.

                    gandalf
          oh, really?

frodo shoots a knowing look, as gandalf averts his eyes.

                    frodo
          alright then..keep your secrets. before
          you came along we bagginses were very
          well thought of.

                       gandalf

          never had any adventures or did anything

          i did was give your uncle a little nudge
          out the door.

                    frodo
          whatever you did...you've been officially
          labelled as a disturber of the peace.

                    gandalf
          oh, really?
