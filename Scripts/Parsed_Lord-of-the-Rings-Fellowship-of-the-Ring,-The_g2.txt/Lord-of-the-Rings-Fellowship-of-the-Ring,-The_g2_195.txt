he thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of
white flame springs up... the staff shatters...the bridge
breaks... right at balrog's feet. the stone bridge drops away
into the gulf...from under the balrog. for a moment, the
great beast remains poised in the air...then it plunges down:
in slow motion relief floods frodo's face..gandalf remains
trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. slow motion: as
the balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire... slow
motion: the thongs of the whip lash and curl around gandalf's
knees, dragging him over the brink! gandalf just manages to
hand on by his fingertips

          gandalf!

following the balrog into the bottomless abyss! frodo cries
out! boromir scoops him up and carries him away.

                     frodo
          no!

                     aragorn
          gandalf!

they rush towards an archway.
