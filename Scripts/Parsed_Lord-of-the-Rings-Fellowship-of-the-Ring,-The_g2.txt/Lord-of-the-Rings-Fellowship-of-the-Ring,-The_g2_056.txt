int. bag end living room -- night

frodo is preparing to leave.

                      gandalf
            you'll have to leave the name of baggins
            behind you...for that name is not safe
            outside the shire. gandalf helps frodo
            into his coat.

                      gandalf (cont'd)
            travel only by day and stay off the road.

                      frodo
                (thinking)
            i can cut across country easily enough.

gandalf looks at the young hobbit, moved by his courage.

                      gandalf
            my dear frodo, hobbits really are amazing
            creatures. you can learn all that there
            is to know about their ways in a month,
            and yet, after a hundred years, they can
            still surprise you.

suddenly!    a sound from outside.

                        gandalf (cont'd)
            get down!

gandalf freezes... he moves quietly towards the window, eyes
wide with tension. he raises his staff above the window, and
slams it down on the intruder. there is a yelp of pain!

                                                      (continued)

                                                             32.
