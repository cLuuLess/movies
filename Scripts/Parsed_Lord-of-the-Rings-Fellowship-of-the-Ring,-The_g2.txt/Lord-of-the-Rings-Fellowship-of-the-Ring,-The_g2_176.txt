ext. moria gate -- night

frodo is suddenly pulled to the ground. a long sinuous
tentacle is wrapped around frodo's ankle and is dragging him
towards the lake. frodo cries out as aragorn and boromir rush
forward! aragorn severs the tentacle holding frodo, and pulls
him to safety...boromir hacks at the other writhing limbs. 20
more tentacles ripple out of the lake! the dark water boils
as the hideous beast lashes out at the fellowship! again the
creature grabs frodo and pulls him to the lake, frodo is
flung in the air as the fellowship battle the creature.
aragorn hacks at a tentacle...frodo is released, falling into
boromir's arms.

                    gandalf
          into the mines!

                     boromir
          legolas!

legolas shoots an arrow into the creature's head, gaining a
few vital seconds for aragorn and boromir as they race out of
the water with frodo. the fellowship hurriedly back away from
the creature... retreating into the moria chamber as many
coiling arms seize the large doors.
