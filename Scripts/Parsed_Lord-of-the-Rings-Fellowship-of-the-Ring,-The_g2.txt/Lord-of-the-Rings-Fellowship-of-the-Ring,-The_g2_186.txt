                      gandalf
            "here lies balin, son of fudin, lord of
            moria." he is dead, then. it's as i had
            feared.

gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from
the white stone slab. it has been slashed and stabbed...and
appears to be covered in dried blood. the pages crack and
break as he opens it...

                      legolas
                (urgent whisper to argorn)
            we must move on, we cannot linger.

                      gandalf
                (reading)
            "they have taken the bridge and the
            second hall: we have barred the
            gates...but cannot hold them for
            long...the ground shakes...drums in the
            deep...we cannot get out. a shadow moves
            in the dark. will no- one save us? they
            are coming."

unnerved, pippin backs away nervously...he stumbles against
the well, sending a precariously balanced armored skeleton
tumbling in! merry reaches out, grabbing hold of pippin
before he falls. the fellowship freeze in stunned silence as
the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing
loudly!
