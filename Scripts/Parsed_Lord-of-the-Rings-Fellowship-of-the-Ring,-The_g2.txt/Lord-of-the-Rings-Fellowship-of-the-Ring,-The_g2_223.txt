ext. summit of amon hen -- day

frodo lies gasping on the summit of amon hen...below the
ancient ruins of the seeing seat.

                                                            111.



at that moment: a black boot steps into shot!

frodo looks up as aragorn towers over him.

                       aragorn
          frodo?

                     frodo
              (numb)
          it has taken boromir. aragorn moves
          towards frodo...

                    aragorn
              (urgent)
          where is the ring?

frodo backs away from aragorn...aragorn is shocked by the
movement.

                       frodo
          stay away!

                    aragorn
          frodo...i swore to protect you.

                    frodo
          can you protect me from yourself?

frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring! it
glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...aragorn's
eyes are drawn to it.

                    frodo (cont'd)
          would you destroy it?

                    aragorn
              (kneeling to frodo)
          i would have gone with you to the end...
          into the very fires of mordor.

                    frodo
          i know...look after the others,
          especially sam...he will not understand.

aragorn freezes!   he draws his sword.

                     aragorn
              (urgent)
          go, frodo!

frodo hesitates.



                                                 (continued)

                                                           112.
