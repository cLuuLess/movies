ext. weathertop summit -- night

frodo, sam, merry, and pippin race into a ring of broken
stones on the summit or weathertop...the ruined base of an
ancient tower. the hobbits stand back-to-back in the centre
of the ring, waiting for the first assault... one by one, the
5 ringwraiths appear...brandishing gleaming swords, they move
slowly towards the hobbits. in the center is their
leader...the witch king!

                    sam
          back, you devils!

sam rushes forward with a cry. he swings his sword at the
witch king, who blocks the blow with his own sword. sam's
blade shatters...the witch king lashes out with his fist,
sending sam flying. merry and pippin, overcome with terror,
throw themselves flat on the ground. the ringwraiths close in
on frodo...a venomous whisper dances in his head...

frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting
the wraith's whisperings... slow motion as his hand goes into
his pocket and pulls out the ring. the 5 ringwraiths utter a
chilling screech of excitement. frodo is unable to resist any
longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. he
disappears.
