int. bag end living room -- night

frodo pulls the envelope out of an old chest. gandalf,
suspicious, alert. without a word, gandalf takes the envelope
and tosses it into the fireplace!

                    frodo
              (bewildered)
          what are you doing?

flames instantly consume the envelope...revealing the ring,
as it sinks into the red hot embers. gandalf reaches into the
fire with a pair of tongs...he lifts the ring out.

                    gandalf
          hold out your hand, frodo...it is quite
          cool.

gandalf drops the ring into frodo's hand...he reacts to its
weight.

                    gandalf (cont'd)
          what can you see? can you see anything?

                    frodo
          nothing...there's nothing.   wait...

                                                    (continued)

                                                            27.
