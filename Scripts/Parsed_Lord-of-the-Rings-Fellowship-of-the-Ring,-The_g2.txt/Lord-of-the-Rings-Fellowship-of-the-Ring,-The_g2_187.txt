int. moria caverns -- day

gandalf turns angrily on pippin.

                      gandalf
                (angry)
            fool of a took! throw yourself in next
            time and rid us of your stupidity!

angle on:    pippin, chastened.

they fall silent. a low rolling boom rises from the depths
below...growing louder...boom...boom...as if the caverns of
moria were turned into a vast drum. a great horn blasts
nearby...answering horns ... running feet...harsh cries...
sam's eyes glance at frodo's belt...

                       sam
                (worried)
            mr. frodo!



                                                     (continued)

                                                            93.
