ext. hobbit farmhouse -- evening

farmer maggot is chopping wood in his garden close on:
snorting horse nostrils...as the shadow of a black rider
looms over a hobbit house. terrified, farmer maggot cowers in
his doorway...fang, his dog, whimpers and backs away.

                    black rider
              (hissing)
          shire? baggins?

                    farmer maggot
              (terrified)
          there's no bagginses around here! they
          are all up in hobbiton...that way.

the black rider gallops away at speed
