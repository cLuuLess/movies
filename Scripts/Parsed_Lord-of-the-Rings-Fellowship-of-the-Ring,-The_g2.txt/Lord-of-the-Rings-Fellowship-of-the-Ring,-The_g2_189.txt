sam screams as frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip
and slammed against the wall.

                    aragorn
              (shocked yell)
          frodo!!

the hobbits go crazy. sam slashes at the cave troll's knee,
bringing him down...merry and pippin jump on him...legolas
fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. aragorn
rushes to frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...frodo
appears to be dead. close on: gandalf, aragorn, hobbits
looking horrified... suddenly frodo coughs...takes a huge
breath.

                    sam
          he's alive!

                    frodo
          i'm alright. i'm not hurt.

                    aragorn
          you should be dead. that spear would've
          skewered a wild boar!

                    gandalf
          i think there's more to this hobbit than
          meets the eye.

frodo open his shirt to reveal the mithril vest.   the troll
spear did not pierce the mithril."

                    gimli
          mithril! you are full of surprises,
          master baggins.

boom. boom. boom     the sound of the drums rings out again!
gandalf turns to the others.

                    gandalf
          to the bridge of khazad-dum!
