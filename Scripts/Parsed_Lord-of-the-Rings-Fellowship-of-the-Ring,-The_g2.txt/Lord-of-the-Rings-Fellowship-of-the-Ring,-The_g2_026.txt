          precious? it's been called that before,
          but not by you.

                    bilbo
          so? what business is it of yours what i
          do with my own things? bilbo's voice,
          shape and manner have suddenly changed.

                    gandalf
          i think you've had that ring quite long
          enough.

                    bilbo
          you want it for yourself!

gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow
suddenly seems to fill the room

                    gandalf
          bilbo baggins do not take me for some
          conjurer of cheap tricks! bilbo cowers
          from gandalf, disarmed by his power...a
          frightened hobbit. gandalf's expression
          softens.

                    gandalf (cont'd)
          i am not trying to rob you. i am trying
          to help you. sobbing, bilbo runs to
          gandalf and hugs him.

                    gandalf (cont'd)
          all you long years we've been
          friends...trust me as you once did. let
          it go!

                    bilbo
          you're right, gandalf...the ring must go
          to frodo.

bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door.

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          it's late, the road is long... yes, it is
          time.

                    gandalf
          bilbo?

                    bilbo
          hmmm?



                                                    (continued)
