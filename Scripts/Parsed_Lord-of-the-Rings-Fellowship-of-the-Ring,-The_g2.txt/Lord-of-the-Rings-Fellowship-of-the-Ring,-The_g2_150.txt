          and to that i hold. i would rather share
          one lifetime with you than face all the
          ages of this world alone. strider looks
          down. in his hand lies the evenstar.

                    arwen (cont'd)
          i choose a mortal live.

                    strider
          you cannot give me this.

                    arwen
          it is mine to give to whom i will, like
          my heart.

arwen closes strider's fingers around the jewel.

arwen leans towards strider, gently kissing him.
