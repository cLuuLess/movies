          the ring is yours now. but it somewhere
          out of sight. gandalf rises hurriedly and
          starts to gather his things.

                    frodo
          where are you going?

                    gandalf
          i have some things i must see to.

                    frodo
          what things?

                       gandalf
          questions.     questions that need
          answering.

                    frodo
          you've only just arrived!    i don't
          understand...

gandalf is already at the door, he turns to frodo.

                    gandalf
          neither do i. keep it secret, keep it
          safe.

gandalf hurries out the door...leaving frodo standing alone
in the bag end.

angle on: the envelope

the camera pushes in...the hum of the ring comes up on the
soundtrack. the camera pushes through the white paper to the
ring...beneath the hum the whispered murmur of black speech
can be heard.
