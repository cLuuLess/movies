                    boromir (cont'd)
          aragorn quickly tries to staunch the flow
          of blood from boromir's shoulder.

                    boromir (cont'd)
              (panicked)
          frodo...where is frodo?

                    aragorn
          i let frodo go.

boromir holds aragorn's gaze.

                    boromir
          then you did what i could not.   i tried
          to take the ring from him.

                    aragorn
          the ring is beyond our reach now.

                    boromir
          forgive me, i did not see..i have failed
          you all.

                    aragorn
          no, boromir. you fought bravely. you
          have kept your honor. aragorn tries to
          bind boromir's wound.

                    boromir
          leave it! it is over...the world of men
          will fall and all will come to darkness
          and my city to ruin..aragorn..

                    aragorn
          i do not know what strength is in my
          blood, but i swear to you... i will not
          let the white city fall, nor your people
          fail...

                    boromir
          our people...our people...

aragorn places boromir's sword in his hand.   boromir's
fingers tighten around the hilt.

                    boromir (cont'd)
          i would have followed you, my
          brother...my captain, my king. aragorn
          lays boromir down. he is dead.

                    aragorn
          be at peace, son of gondor. aragorn bends
          and kisses boromir's forehead.
