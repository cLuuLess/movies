int. prancing pony inn -- night

wide on: the noise, smokey inn. it is dimly lit, cheifly
from a blazing log fire...and crowded with a mixture of big
folk, local hobbits, and a couple of dwarfs. frodo, sam,
merry and pippin are sitting at a table against the wall...
clearly trying to remain quiet and inconspicuous... sam can't
help himself...he keeps casting nervous glances around.
