                    merry
          no. i don't think we are.   shhhh,
          gandalf's thinking.

          merry!

                    merry
          what?

                    pippin
          i'm hungry.

frodo's pov: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the
darkness. frodo is nervous...he approaches gandalf.

                    fro do
              (whispers)
          there's something down there.

                    gandalf
              (quietly)
          it's gollum.

                    frodo
          gollum!

                    gandalf
          he's been following us for three days.

teasing shot: and emaciated, leering creature.

                    frodo
              (disbelieving)
          he escaped the dungeons of barad- dur?

                    gandalf
          escaped...or was set loose. and now the
          ring has drawn him here...he will never
          be rid of his need for it. he hates and
          loves the ring, as he hates and loves
          himself. smeagol's life is a sad story.
          gandalf catches frodo's look of surprise.

                    gandalf (cont'd)
          yes...smeagol he was once called...before
          the ring came to him, before it drove him
          mad.

gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall...he is
large, luminous eyes blinking with malice.
