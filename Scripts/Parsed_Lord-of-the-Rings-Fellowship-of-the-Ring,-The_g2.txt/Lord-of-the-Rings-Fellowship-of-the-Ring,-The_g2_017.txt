                    bilbo
          yes, yes...it's all inhand.   all the
          arrangements are made.

                    gandalf
          frodo suspects something.

                    bilbo
          'course he does, he's a baggins...not
          some block headed bracegirdle from
          hardbottle!

                    gandalf
          you will tell him, won't you?

                      bilbo
          yes, yes.

                    gandalf
          he's very fond of you.

                    bilbo
          i know. he'd probably come with me if i
          asked him. i think, in his heart,
          frodo's still in love with the shire, the
          woods and the fields... little rivers.
          bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen
          window.

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          i am old, gandalf... bilbo looks at
          gandalf sadly...

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          i know i don't look it, but i'm beginning
          to feel it in my heart.

                                                      close on:

bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping
a small, unseen object.

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          i feel thin...sort of stretched, like
          butter scraped over too much bread. i
          need a holiday...a very long holiday and
          i don't expect i shall return...in fact,
          i mean not to.

                                                        cut to:

                                                          14.
