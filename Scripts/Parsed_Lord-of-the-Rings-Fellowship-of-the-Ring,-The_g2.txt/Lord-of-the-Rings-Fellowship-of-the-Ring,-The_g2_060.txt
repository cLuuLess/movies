ext. hobbiton woods -- day

gandalf leads frodo and sam under the cover of woods.

                    gandalf (v.o.)
          be careful, both of you. the enemy has
          many spies in his service, many ways of
          hearing...birds, beasts...

gandalf takes frodo to one side...

                    gandalf (cont'd)
              (low voice)
          is it safe?

frodo nods...he pats his pocket.

                    gandalf (cont'd)
          never put it on, for then the agents of
          the dark lord will be drawn to its
          power...always remember, frodo, the ring
          is trying to get back to its master...it
          wants to be found. gandalf wheels his
          horse and gallops away.
