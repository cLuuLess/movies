int. stairway of khasad-dum, moria -- day

the balrog, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great
40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! in one hand is a
blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a whip
of many thongs. aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a
dizzying stairway...gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his
staff. close on: aragorn looks at gandalf, concerned.

                    gandalf
          lead them on, aragorn.   the bridge is
          near.

aragorn hesitates...gandalf looks at him.

                    gandalf (cont'd)
          do as i say; swords are no more use here.

the fellowship race down the stairway, aragorn picks up
frodo..leaping across a gaping chasm. a narrow bridge,
spanning a bottomless pit...gandalf yells to the others:
aragorn makes to throw gimli across the chasm.

                    gimli
          nobody tosses a dwarf! the balrog smashes
          through the wall and spreads its vast
          wings.
