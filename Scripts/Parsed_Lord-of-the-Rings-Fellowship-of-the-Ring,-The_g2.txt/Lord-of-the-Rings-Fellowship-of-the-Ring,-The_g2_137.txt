frodo rushes forward to embrace him. bilbo has aged

                    bilbo
          hello, frodo, my lad!

                     frodo
          bilbo!

later... frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of
a red leather bound journal:

                    frodo (cont'd)
              (reading)
          "there and back again: a hobbit's tale"
          by bilbo baggins.

bilbo smiles proudly. he is sitting with frodo on a terrace
overlooking a waterfall. frodo looks at page after page of
beautiful handwriting, with intricate maps and drawings.
