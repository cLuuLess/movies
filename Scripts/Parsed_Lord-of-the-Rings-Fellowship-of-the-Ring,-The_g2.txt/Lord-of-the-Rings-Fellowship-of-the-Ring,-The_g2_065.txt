ext. isengard valley -- day

gandalf gallops through the gate, into the fortress of
isengard...a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to
rim, encloses beautiful trees and gardens, watered by streams
that flow down from the mountains.

                    saruman (v.o.)
          smoke rises once more from the mountain
          of doom...the shadow takes shape in the
          darkness of mordor; the hour grows
          late...and gandalf the grey rides to
          isengard seeking my counsel...

the strange tower of orthanc...hewn from a solid pillar of
black obsidian...rises up in the center of the isengard
circle. gandalf arrives at the foot of the orthanc stairs.

                                                            35.



angle on: saruman, the white wizard

he sweeps down the orthanc stairs.

                    saruman
          for that is why you have come, is it not,
          my old friend?

gandalf moves quickly towards him, grimy and weary from his
long ride.

                     gandalf
          saruman!
