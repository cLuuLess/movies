                    aragorn
              (ominous)
          do not disturb the water.

aragorn watches anxiously as the ripples appear to grow....he
exchanges a look with boromir.

aragorn's hand creeps towards his sword. gandalf gives up in
despair...he sits down beside frodo. close on: frodo peers at
the elvish inscription...his face breaks into a smile of
comprehension.

                    frodo
              (quietly)
          it's a riddle...

gandalf raises his eyebrows...

                    frodo (cont'd)
              (explaining)
          speak, friend, and enter.   what's the
          elvish for friend?

                    gandalf
          oh...mellon.

with that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and
two great doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness
deeper than the night. as the fellowship enter the blackness,
something in the water stirs....
