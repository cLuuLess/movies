ext. ferry lane -- night

frodo, sam, merry, and pippin hurry through the
trees...slipping and sliding on the muddy ground.

                      sam
          anything?

                      frodo
          nothing.

                    pippin
          what is going on?

merry moves past pippin, toward frodo, watching
intently...sam keeps looking around nervously.

                    merry
          the black rider was looking for
          something...or someone...frodo?

                      sam
          get down!

the silhouette of a black rider looms against the skyline.
the four hobbits... sprawled on the ground, holding their
breath. the black rider turns and departs.

                    frodo
          i have to leave the shire...sam and i
          must get to bree.

merry looks at his friend...realizing frodo is in deep
trouble.

                    merry
          right...buckleberry ferry...follow me !

the hobbits break cover. suddenly, a ringwraith bursts out of
the forest toward them!

                    merry (cont'd)
          there's another one!! frodo, this way! !

the hobbits run   the ringwraith shrieks!

                                                    quick cuts:

                                                    (continued)

                                                            43.
