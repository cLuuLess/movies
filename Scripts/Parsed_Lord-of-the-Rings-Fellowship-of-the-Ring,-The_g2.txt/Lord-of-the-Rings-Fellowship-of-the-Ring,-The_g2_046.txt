                    gandalf (cont'd)
          at that moment: a fleeting, low whisper
          of black speech

emanates from the ring.   frodo looks at gandalf, each knowing
the other has heard it.

                     frodo
          but he was destroyed...sauron was
          destroyed.

angle on: the ring

lies between them on the table.

                    gandalf
          no, frodo. the spirit of sauron has
          endured. his life force is bound to the
          ring and the ring survived. sauron has
          returned. his orcs have multiplied...his

          land of mordor. sauron needs only this
          ring to cover all the lands in the second
          darkness. he is seeking it, seeking it,
          all his thought is bent on it. for the
          ring yearns, above all else, to return to
          the hand of its master: they are one, the
          ring and the dark lord. frodo, he must
          never find out. suddenly frodo scoops up
          the ring.

                     frodo
          alright!
