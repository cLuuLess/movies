                    frodo (cont'd)
          go back,sam. i'm going to mordor alone.

sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat.

                    sam
          of course you are...and i'm coming with
          you!

                    frodo
          you can't swim.

sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...frodo
drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat...

                       frodo (cont'd)
                 (frightened)
          sam!

sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.
close on: frodo's hand grasping sam's... frodo pulls a
bedraggled and half drowned sam into the boat. frodo and sam
look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming
down both their faces.

                     sam
          i made a promise, mr. frodo...a promise.
              (fierce passion)
          "don't you leave him, samwise gamgee."
              (sobs)
          and i don't mean to...i don't mean to.

                    frodo
              (crying)
          oh, sam!

frodo starts to laugh through his tears...the two friends
hug.

                    frodo (cont'd)
          come on then..

the two hobbits row through the water...
