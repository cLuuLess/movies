          we are all afraid, frodo. but to let that
          fear drive us to destroy what hope we
          have...don't you see that is madness?

                    frodo
          there is no other way.

                    boromir
          i ask only for the strength to defend my
          people.
              (angrily drops the wood he has
               collected)
          if you would but lend me the ring...

                    frodo
          no. . .

frodo steps hurriedly away from boromir.

                    boromir
          why do you recoil?   i am no thief.

                     frodo
              (wary)
          you are not yourself.

                    boromir
          what chance do you think you have? they
          will find you, they will take the ring
          and you will beg for death before the
          end.

frodo turns to leave.

                    boromir (cont'd)
          you fool! it is not yours save by
          unhappy chance...it might have been mine.
          it should be mine. give it to me! give
          me the ring.

boromir leaps on top of frodo, grasping for the ring! frodo
has only moments to act. frodo rips the ring from around his
neck..and rams it on his finger.

                    frodo disappears
          boromir spins wildly around, yelling into
          thin air!

                    boromir
          i see your mind...you will take the ring
          to sauron. you will betray us! you go to
          your death and the death of us all.
