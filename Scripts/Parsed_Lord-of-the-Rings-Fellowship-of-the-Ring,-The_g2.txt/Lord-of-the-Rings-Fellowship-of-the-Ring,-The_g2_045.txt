          this is the one ring forged by the dark
          lord, sauron, in the fires of mt
          doom...taken by isildur from the hand of
          sauron himself.

close on: frodo...stunned

                    frodo
              (quiet realization)
          bilbo found it...in gollom's cave.

                    gandalf
          for sixty years the ring lay quiet in
          bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life,
          delaying old age...but no longer, frodo.
          evil is stirring in mordor. the ring has
          awoken. it has heard its master's call.
