          it reads, "the door of durin, lord of
          moria. speak, friend, and enter."

                    merry
          what do you suppose that means?

                    gandalf
              (confident)
          it's quite simple. if you are a friend,
          speak the password and the doors will
          open.

gandalf raises his arms...

                    gandalf (cont'd)
              (incanting)
          annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!

the cliff towers into the night, the wind blows cold, frodo
shivers... and the door stands fast!

                                                         later:

gandalf continues...

mumbling spells in his efforts to open the door. sam packs
pots and pans at his feet...watching sadly as aragorn un-
saddles bill the pony. close on: aragorn whispering to bill
the pony.

                    aragorn
              (whispering)
          mines are no place for a pony, even one
          so brave as bill.

                       sam
          bye, bill.

                    aragorn
          go on, bill, go on..don't worry, sam...he
          knows his way home. aragorn slaps bill on
          the rump...bill goes trotting off. close
          on: sam watching bill disappear into the
          darkness.

                    sam
          goodbye, bill.

splash! merry and pippin are tossing stones into the lake.
black rippling rings slowly fan out. pippin is about to
throw another stone, but aragorn grabs his arm.
