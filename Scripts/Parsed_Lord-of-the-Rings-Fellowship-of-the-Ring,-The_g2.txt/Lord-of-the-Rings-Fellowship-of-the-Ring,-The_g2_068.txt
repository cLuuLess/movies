          sauron has regained much of his former
          strength. he cannot yet take physical
          form...but his spirit has lost none of
          its potency. concealed within his
          fortress, the lord of mordor sees all.
          his gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth,
          and flesh. you know of what i speak,
          gandalf...a great eye, lidless, wreathed
          in flame.

                    gandalf
              (softly)
          the eye of sauron.

                    saruman
          he is gathering all evil to him.

                    saruman (cont'd)
          very soon he will have summoned an army
          great enough to launch an assault upon
          middle earth.

                    gandalf
          you know this? how?

                    saruman
          i have seen it.

gandalf and saruman stride through orthanc toward a stone
plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth...

                    gandalf
          a palantir is a dangerous tool, saruman.

saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the palantir.

                     saruman
          why?   why should we fear to use it?

                    gandalf
          they are not all accounted for, the lost
          seeing-stones...we do not know who else
          may be watching. gandalf throws the cloth
          back over the palantir.

flash image: a fiery eye!

saruman sits upon his throne.
