          run! run!!

frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 uruk-hai swarm onto
amon hen behind aragorn!

aragorn attacks the leading uruk-hai like a madman... he
brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as
others close in on him. frodo scrambles down the hillside,
away from the fight. aragorn battles the uruk-hai, amongst
the pillars and blocks of amon hen. despite his bravery, he
is quickly surrounded... suddenly: elven arrows smash into
the uruk-hai. legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow.
gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.
