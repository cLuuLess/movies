                    legolas
          and you have my bow.

                    gimli
          and my axe.

boromir looks at them all then walks towards frodo.

                    boromir
          you carry the fate of us all, little one.

boromir looks towards elrond and gandalf.

                    boromir (cont'd)
          if this is indeed the will of the
          council, then gondor will see it done.

frodo stares in wonder as the greatest fighters in all middle
earth stand at his side.

                    sam
              (unseen)
          here!

a sudden noise...sam pops up from behind a bush!

                    sam (cont'd)
          mr. frodo's not gong anywhere without me.

                    elrond
          no, indeed...it is hardly possible to
          separate you...even when he is summoned
          to a secret council and you are not.

merry and pippin jump up from behind another bush!

                    merry
          oi! we're coming too! you'll have to
          send us home tied up in a sack to stop
          us.

                    pippin
          anyway...you need people of intelligence
          on this sort of
          mission...quest...thing...

                    merry
          well, that rules you out, pip.

                                                             78.



elrond surveys the group

                    elrond
              (thoughtfully)
          nine companions ... so be it.
              (announcing)
          you shall be the "fellowship of the ring"

                     pippin
          great.   where are we going?
