ext. elrond's chamber, rivendell -- day

gandalf and elrond watch frodo and sam from elrond's balcony,

                    elrond
          his strength returns.

                    gandalf
          that wound will never fully heal. he will
          carry it the rest of his life.

                    elrond
          and yet to have come so far still bearing
          the ring...the hobbit has shown
          extraordinary resilience to its evil.

                    gandalf
          it is a burden he should never have to
          had to bear. we can ask no more of frodo.

                    elrond
          gandalf, the enemy is moving. sauron's
          forces are massing in the east. his eye
          is fixed on rivendell. and saruman, you
          tell me, has betrayed us. our list of
          allies grows thin.
