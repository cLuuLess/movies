int. bag end living room -- night

angle on: frodo

hurriedly entering the living room.

                    frodo
              (thinking fast)
          we put it away, we keep it hidden! we
          never speak of it again. no one know
          it's here, do they? gandalf shifts
          uncomfortably.

                    frodo (cont'd)
          do they, gandalf?

gandalf looks at frodo, sadly...
