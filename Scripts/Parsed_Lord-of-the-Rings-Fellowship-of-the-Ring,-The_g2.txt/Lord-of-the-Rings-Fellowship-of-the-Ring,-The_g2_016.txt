          you've caught me a bit unprepared, i'm
          afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit
          of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no,
          that might be a little risky...

gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one
corner...it is thorin's map of the lonely mountain, gandalf
smiles to himself.

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
          tart...got some custard somewhere. not
          much for afters, i'm afraid. oh
          no...we're alright...i've just found some
          sponge cake. nice little snack. hope
          it's enough.
              (comes into view)
          i could do you some eggs if you like?

bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as gandalf
mysteriously appears behind him.

                    gandalf
          just tea, thank you.

                       bilbo
          oh..right.     you don't mind if...?

                    gandalf
          no, not at all. go ahead. a sudden loud
          knock on the front door.

mrs. sackville baggins (o.s.)

bilbo baggins, you open this door..i know you're in there.

                    bilbo
          i'm not home.

gandalf watches, amused as bilbo tries to hide.

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          i've got to get away from these
          confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
          all day, never giving me a moment's
          peace. i want to see mountains
          again...mountains, gandalf... and then
          find somewhere quiet where i can finish
          my book...oh, tea!

                    gandalf
          so, you mean to go through with your
          plan, then?
