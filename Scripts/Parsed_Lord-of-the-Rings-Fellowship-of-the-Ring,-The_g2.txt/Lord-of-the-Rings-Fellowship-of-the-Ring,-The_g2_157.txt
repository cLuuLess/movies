suddenly! a shadow passes across bilbo...for a split second
he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony,
groping hands. frodo pulls away, shocked...the shadow passes.
bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. bilbo
falters...his eyes filling with tears.

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          oh!

                    bilbo (cont'd)
              (sad)
          i'm sorry, that i brought this upon you,
          my boy...i'm sorry that you must carry
          this burden. i'm sorry for everything.

bilbo sobs and frodo moves to comfort him.
