ext. farmer's fields -- day

wide on: frodo and sam walking along a country lane which
borders farmer maggot's fields. sam is looking up...frodo has
disappeared around a corner in the lane.

                     sam
               (panicked)
          mr. frodo. mr. frodo! frodo turns,
          surprised as sam comes running towards
          him.

                    sam (cont'd)
              (worried)
          i thought i lost you. frodo looks at sam
          suspiciously. sam glances down,
          embarrassed.

                    frodo
              (teasing)
          what are you talking about?

                    sam
              (mumbling)
          it's just something gandalf said...

                    frodo
          what did he say?

                    sam
          he said..."don't you leave him, samwise
          gamgee."
              (looks at frodo intently)
          and i don't mean to.

                    frodo
              (laughing)
          sam...we're still in the shire...what
          could possibly happen?


                                                    (continued)

                                                               39.
