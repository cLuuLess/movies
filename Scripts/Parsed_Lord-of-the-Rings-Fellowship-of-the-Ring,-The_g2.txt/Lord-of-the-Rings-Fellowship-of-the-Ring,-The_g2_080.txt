a thick hedge surrounds the village...a great gate bars the
western entrance.

                                                      close on:

frodo, sam, merry and pippin approaching the gatehouse...wild
eyes, ragged, and out of breath.

                     frodo
          come on.

a surly gatekeeper glances down at them.

                    gatekeeper
          what do you want?

                    frodo
          we're headed for the prancing pony.

the gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits, bathing
them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight.

                    gatekeeper

          gatekeeper unlocks the gate.

                    gatekeeper
          all right, young sir, i meant no offense.

the hobbits gratefully enter bree...the gatekeeper eyeing
them curiously in the lantern light.

                    gatekeeper (cont'd)
          it's my job to ask questions after
          nightfall. there's talk of strange fold
          abroad...can't be too careful.
