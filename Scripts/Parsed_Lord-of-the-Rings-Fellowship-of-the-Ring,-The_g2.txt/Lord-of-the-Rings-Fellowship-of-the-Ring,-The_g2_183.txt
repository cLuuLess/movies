             (grim)
         it's a pity bilbo didn't kill him when he
         had the chance.

                   gandalf
         pity? it was pity that stayed bilbo's
         hand. many that live deserve death, and
         some that die deserve life. can you give
         it to them, frodo? frodo frowns.

                   gandalf (cont'd)
         do not be too eager to deal out death in
         judgment...even the very wise cannot see
         all ends. my heart tells me that gollum
         has some part to play yet, for good or
         ill, before this is over. the pity of
         bilbo may rule the fate of many.

                   frodo
         i wish the ring had never come to me...i
         wish none of this had happened.

                   gandalf
         so do all who live to see such times, but
         that is not for them to decide. all we
         have to decide is what to do with the
         time that is given to us. there is a note
         of finality in gandalf's voice.

                   gandalf (cont'd)
         there are other forces at work in this
         world, frodo, besides the will of evil.
         bilbo was meant to find the ring. in
         which case, you also were meant to have
         it...and that is an encouraging thought,
             (sudden brightness)
         ah! that it's that way! gandalf points
         at the right hand tunnel...the fellowship
         scramble to their feet.

                   merry
             (relieved)
         he's remembered!

                   gandalf
         no, but the air doesn't smell so foul
         down there. if in doubt, meriadoc,
         always follow your nose!
             (laughs)
         ye s...

                                                               91.
