ext. ford of bruinen -- day

crane down: as the white horse races towards camera, to
reveal the wide river bruinen in the foreground.

without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow
water and thunders across the ford. the 9 ringwraiths pull up
short of the ford, clearly nervous of the water. the white
horse reaches the other side...arwen pulls up and turns to
defiantly face the ringwraiths from across the ford.

                    witch king
          give up the halfling, she-elf! she draws
          her sword and yells at the witch king.

                    arwen
              (yelling)
          if you want him, come and claim him.

the witch king screeches angrily, draws his sword, and leads
the ringwraiths across the ford. the water starts flowing
faster...a distant rumble can be heard. arwen waits until
they are halfway across: she suddenly stands in the saddle
arms raised!

                    arwen (cont'd)
              (elvish)
          non o chithaeglir, lasto beth daer: rimmo
          nin briunen dan in ulaer!
