int. isengard -- night

close on: gandalf...lying unconscious on a cold obsidian
floor. he wakes to the sound of ripping and tearing...rising
onto his knees...lifting his head... gandalf stands as the
camera pulls back to reveal him stranded on the summit of
orthanc. he is marooned on the tiny, flat peak, surrounded
on all sides by a sheer 500 foot drop. another whispering
wail rends the air. gandalf crosses quickly to the edge and
peers down: pov: one of the beautiful isengard trees is being
ripped from the ground by the orcs. gandalf looks on in
horror as orcs hack into the trunk with axes.
