ext. shire lane -- day

the cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped
figure in grey.

intercut with; shots of frodo running... careering down a

hill. . .jumping over logs... dodging tree branches.

                                                       angle on:

the shambling old pony snorts and rears as... suddenly frodo
appears on a bank above the cart.

                    frodo
          you're late.

close on: gandalf glowers at the young hobbit...

                    gandalf
          a wizard is never late, frodo baggins,
          nor is he early. he arrives precisely
          when he means to.

they look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as
frodo's face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front
seat of the cart.

                    frodo
          it's wonderful to see you, gandalf!

next to gandalf, we see how small hobbits are...frodo is 3
foot 6 inches tall.

                    gandalf
          you didn't think i'd miss your uncle
          bilbo's birthday?

                                                         cut to:

                                                              8.
