ext. edge of lothlorien--dusk

wide on: the fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with
yellow flowers..above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by
silver pillars...the trunks of huge, grey trees. gimli looks
nervously around...

                    gimli
          stay close, young hobbits..they say a
          sorceress lives in these woods. an elf-
          witch of terrible power. all who look
          upon her fall under her spell...

frodo hesitates...a strange voice whispers in his head...

          frodo...

                    gimli
          and are never seen again!

                    galadriel (v.o.)
          ...your coming to us is as the footsteps
          of doom. you bring great evil here,
          ringbearer.

          mr. frodo?

                    gimli
          well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare
          so easily. i have the eyes of a hawk and
          the ears of a fox!
