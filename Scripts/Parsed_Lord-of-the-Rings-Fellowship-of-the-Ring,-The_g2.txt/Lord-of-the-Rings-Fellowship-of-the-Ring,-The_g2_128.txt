          nin o chitaeglir, lasto beth daer: rimmo
          nin bruinen dan in ulaer!

the ground suddenly trembles...a mighty roar fills the air!

frodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of water
flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had
burst! the foaming water seems to form the shape of dancing
white horses with frothing manes! the ringwraiths scream in
terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. their piercing
cries are drowned in the roaring of the river as it carries
them away! close on: frodo as he loses consciousness...

                    arwen
              (upset)
          no, no...frodo, no!     frodo, don't give
          in...not now!

arwen gathers the small hobbit in her arms, feeling his life
slip away.
