               ext. zelazna brama square - day

               street traders with baskets full of wares, fruit, 
               vegetables, fish, tins of preserves. women bargain with 
               them, making purchases. lively, colourful. dealers in gold 
               and currency calling monotonously.

                                     dealers
                         gold, buy gold! dollars! roubles!

               later:

               szpilman, on top of a free-standing scaffold, benek and 
               the others demolishing a ghetto wall, wielding skdgehammers. 
               they work slowly. 

               a smartly dressed young couple are passing, but stop. 

               they stare. the young woman is extremely attractive and 
               knows it. the foremen, workers and the german policemen 
               ogle her.

                                     the young woman
                         look - oh, do look!

               her young man is puzzled; she points.

                                     the young woman
                         jews!

                                     the young man
                         can't be the first time you've 
                         ever seen jews.

               embarrassed, she giggles and they go. szpilman, benek and 
               the others continue to work.

               the foremen sit, sunning themselves, and the german 
               policemen stand, deep in conversation, ignoring the workers. 

               szpilman suddenly stops work. he has seen something in the 
               square that alerts him.

               at the furthest stall, he sees a woman, attractive, chic, 
               in her thirties, buying vegetables at a stall.  her name 
               is janina godlewska.

               surreptitiously, szpilman raises a hand, trying to catch 
               her attention. but he's frightened of alerting the german 
               policemen and the foremen. benek has noticed.

                                     benek
                         someone you know?

                                     szpilman
                         yes.

               again szpilman tries, but janina, her profile to him, 
               doesn't see.

                                     benek
                         a beauty. who is she?

                                     szpilman
                         a singer. her husband's an actor. 
                         i knew them well. good people. i'd 
                         like to talk to her.

                                     benek
                              (playful)
                         don't forget, mr. wladek, they 
                         hang them for helping jews.

               he goes back to work.

               the german policemen wander over to one of the stalls to 
               buy fruit. the moment they do so two jewish workers scamper 
               across to another stall to buy bread.

               szpilman glances across the square: janina is still at the 
               stall.

               he comes to a decision. he jumps down, is about to dash 
               towards janina, but stops dead.

               janina is no longer there.
