               int. under the platform, ghetto cafe - day

               thin slivers of light illuminate the two men on their backs 
               in the cramped space.

                                     benek
                              (looking at him, 
                              mystified)
                         why are you here, mr. wladek?

                                     szpilman
                         it's like this... i...we...all of 
                         them.

               he can't continue. benek nods.

                                     benek
                         perhaps they're lucky. the quicker 
                         the better.
                              (brief pause.)
                         it isn't over yet. we'll stay here 
                         for a couple of days. until things 
                         die down.
                              (another pause)
                         i've bribed a policeman. he'll 
                         come when it's over.
