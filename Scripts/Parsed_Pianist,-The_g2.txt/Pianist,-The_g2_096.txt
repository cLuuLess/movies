               int.  1st apartment, landing and door - dusk

               he slips out of the flat, goes to the stairs and stops 
               dead. kitty, young and fierce, stands on the stairs, 
               blocking his way.

                                     kitty
                         are you from the flat in there? 
                         you're not registered.

                                     szpilman
                         it belongs to a friend of mine. i 
                         came to visit but i must have just 
                         missed him.

                                     kitty
                              (shouting)
                         have you got your identity card? 
                         let me see your identity card!

               szpilman hesitates; she shouts more loudly.

                                     kitty
                         i want to see your identity card!

               on various floors, doors open, tenants put their heads out 
               to see what's going on.

               summoning all his strength, szpilman makes a dash for it, 
               pushing past kitty.

                                     kitty
                              (screeching)
                         he's a jew! he's a jew! stop the 
                         jew! don't let him out!

               szpilman clatters down the stairs, reaches the ground-floor 
               landing. another woman tries to bar his way but he pushes 
               past her and out of the house.
