               int. office and floor, schultz factory - day

               the name 'samuel szpilman' being written on a certificate. 
               the clatter of sewing machines.

               schultz, a fat, sweaty german is filling out the form at 
               his desk. majorek beside him, standing, chatting to him 
               and having a quiet laugh. in the doorway, szpilman and 
               father.

               the small office is on an upper level with a window looking 
               down on the factory floor where jewish men and women are 
               hard at work on sewing machines making the terrible clatter. 

               schultz stamps the certificate, hands it to majorek, who 
               gives it to father.

                                     father
                              (doffing his hat)
                         thank you.

                                     schultz
                              (beaming, german 
                              accent)
                         my pleasure. it won't help you 
                         anyway.
