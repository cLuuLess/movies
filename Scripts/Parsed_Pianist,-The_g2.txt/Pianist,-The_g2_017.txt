               ext. market area, ghetto - day

               winter. cold, freezing day. slush underfoot. great activity. 
               people selling shoes, clothes, carpets, curtains, food. a 
               woman offers cakes under a barbed-wire cover. noise, bustle, 
               restless wing and froing.  

               among the traders, henryk, slightly shabbier now, and at 
               his feet a basket with books. he holds a couple of volumes 
               in his hands, trying to interest passers-by. 

               szpilman, also a little shabbier, wends his way through 
               the setters and buyers, the beggars, the passers-by, and 
               reaches henryk.

               henryk drops the two volumes into the basket, takes a handle 
               one side of the basket, szpilman the other. they set off. 

               as they walk, carrying the basket between them, passing 
               beggars and children asking for food:

                                     szpilman
                         you sell anything?

                                     henryk
                         just one. dostoevsky. the idiot. 
                         three zlotys.

                                     szpilman
                         that's better than yesterday.

                                     henryk
                         three lousy zlotys. and there are 
                         people here making millions.

                                     szpilman
                         i know.

                                     henryk
                         you don't know, believe me. they 
                         bribe the guards. the guards turn 
                         a blind eye. they're bringing in 
                         cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, 
                         french cosmetics, and the poor are 
                         dying all around them and they 
                         don't give a damn.

               suddenly, a woman appears in front of them, barring their 
               way. she's brightly rouged with thickly painted eyebrows, 
               dressed in an old green velvet curtain with an unsteady 
               mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat.

                                     the feather woman
                         excuse me, but have you by any 
                         chance seen my husband izaak 
                         szerman?

                                     szpilman
                         i'm afraid not.

                                     the feather woman
                         a tall handsome man with a little 
                         grey beard?

                they shake their heads.

                                     the feather woman
                         no?
                              (she is near to 
                              tears, then smiles 
                              artificially.)
                         oh, do forgive me.
                              (as she goes)
                         goodbye, sleep well, if you see 
                         him, please do write, izaak 
                         szerman's his name...

               she wanders on. szpilman and henryk, too, continue on their 
               way. and as they go:

                                     henryk
                         sometimes i wish i could go mad.
