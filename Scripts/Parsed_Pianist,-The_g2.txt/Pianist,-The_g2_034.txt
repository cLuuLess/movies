               ext. chlodna street bridge - dusk

               a wooden bridge has been constructed, linking the small 
               ghetto to the large ghetto. few people about, mostly beggars 
               and children.

               szpilman and henryk climb the stairs of the bridge, but as 
               they reach the bridge itself henryk stumbles, sinks to his 
               knees. szpilman gets hold of him, tries to help him stand.

                                     szpilman
                         what's the matter? are you sick?
