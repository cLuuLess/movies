               int. living room, bogucki apartment - later

               the ceramic stove. szpilman's ghetto clothes, torn into 
               strips, are being stuffed into it and burned. janina shoves 
               the strips of clothes into the stove. szpilman, now wearing 
               bogucki's suit and clean-shaven, watches the clothes burn 
               while he spoons hot soup into his mouth.

                                     szpilman
                         thank you, i don't.

                         of town. you'll stay there tonight. 
                         then we'll find you somewhere else.

               janina adds the last strip of clothing.

                                     janina
                         i'll bring you food.
