               still quite dark. the szpilmans and about twenty others 
               lined up under lights shining on them from a couple of 
               german vehicles.

               the nco goes along the line, making a selection, using his 
               pistol to prod people into moving. when he gets to the 
               szpilmans he selects henryk and halina. then, he turns to 
               those who are left:

                                     nco

                         report back here. bring your 
                         belongings. fifteen kilos only.

                                     a young woman
                         where are you taking us?

               the nco turns his pistol on the young woman and shoots her 
               through the head. he marches off while she lies on the 
               ground with blood spurting out of her.
