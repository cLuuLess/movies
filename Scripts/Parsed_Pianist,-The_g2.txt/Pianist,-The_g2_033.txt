               ext. alley and labour bureau, later - dusk

               sun just setting.

               from the shelter of the alleyway, szpilman continues to 
               watch the entrance of the bureau. no mob any more, but 
               people come and go - jewish policemen, shupos, a few jews. 

               almost continuous sounds of distant shots and screams. 

               then, heller appears at the entrance, looks this way and 
               that and goes back inside the building. szpilman alert. 
               again heller appears in the entrance. he beckons someone 
               inside. henryk shuffles out. heller shoves him into the 
               street. henryk stumbles, falls. 

               szpilman runs to him, helps him to his feet.

                                     henryk
                              (immediately on the 
                              attack, furious)
                         you go to heller, did i ask you to 
                         talk to him?

                                     szpilman
                         you're out, aren't you?

               they start to walk.

                                     henryk
                         did you beg, did you grovel to 
                         that piece of shit, that cockroach?

                                     szpilman
                         i didn't grovel, i asked him to 
                         help.

                                     henryk
                         what did you pay him?

                                     szpilman
                         pay him? with what? with what could 
                         i pay him? every zloty i earn we 
                         spend on food!

                                     henryk
                         i can look after myself!

                                     szpilman
                         they were taking you away.

                                     henryk
                         it's nothing to do with you. it's 
                         me they wanted, not you. why do 
                         you interfere in other people's 
                         business?

                                     szpilman
                         you're mad, that's your trouble, 
                         you're mad.

                                     henryk
                         that's also my business.

               they walk on.
