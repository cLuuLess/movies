               ext. chlodna street - day

               a dense crowd of people crossing the bridge in both 
               directions.

               szpilman, shabby and unshaven, hurries along and meets 
               jehuda zyskind coming towards him, accompanied by the small 
               man, majorek.

                                     jehuda
                         wladek!

               szpilman stops.

                                     jehuda
                         i thought you'd be off on tour, 
                         playing london, paris, new york?

                                     szpilman
                              (trying to smile)
                         not this week.

               they're buffeted by the crowd. in the street below them, 
               cars, trams, pedestrians and german guards.

                                     jehuda
                         i have to say you look terrible. 
                         what's the trouble?

                                     szpilman
                         you've heard the rumours they're 
                         going to resettle us in the east?

                                     jehuda
                              (dismissing him)
                         rumours, rumours, you take it all 
                         too much to heart, wladek.
