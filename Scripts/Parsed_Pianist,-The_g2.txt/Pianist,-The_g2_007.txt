               int. warsaw apartment - day

               regina is opening and closing the window, examining the 
               frame with her fingers. halina is on a box, removing and 
               replacing books. mother sits at one end of the table, 
               polishing a man's watch and chain. at the other end, father 
               sits counting a small stack of notes and coins. henryk is 
               deep in thought and szpilman is fiddling with his father's 
               violin. the apartment has less furniture now and the silver 
               has gone.

                                     father
                              (finishing the 
                              counting)
                         five thousand and three.

                                     mother
                         is that all?

                                     father
                         yes, five thousand and three zlotys, 
                         that's all we've got left.

                                     regina
                         it's three thousand and three zlotys 
                         too much,
                              (reading from 
                              newspaper)
                         're: further restrictions regarding 
                         liquid assets: jews will be allowed 
                         to keep a maximum of two thousand 
                         zlotys in their homes.'

                                     mother
                         what are we supposed to do with 
                         the rest?

                                     halina
                         deposit it in a bank. blocked 
                         account.

                                     henryk
                         banks? who'd be stupid enough to 
                         deposit money in a german bank?

                                     regina
                         we could hide the money here in 
                         the window frame.

                                     father
                         no, no, no. i'll tell you what 
                         we'll do. we'll use tried and tested 
                         methods. you know what we did in 
                         the last war? we made a hole in 
                         the table leg and we hid the money 
                         in there.

                                     henryk
                         and suppose they take the table 
                         away?

                                     mother
                         what d'you mean, take the table 
                         away?

                                     henryk
                         the germans go into jewish homes 
                         and they just take what they want, 
                         furniture, valuables, anything.

                                     mother
                         do they?

                                     father
                         idiot! what would they want with a 
                         table?

               all look at the table: it's covered in stains and the veneer 
               is coming away at one end. a table like this?

               he pokes his finger under the veneer. it snaps, revealing 
               bare wood beneath.

                                     mother
                         what on earth are you doing?

                                     halina
                         there's a good place under the 
                         cupboard.

                                     henryk
                         no, no. listen, i've been thinking --

                                     szpilman
                         that makes a change.

                                     henryk
                         you know what we do? we use 
                         psychology.

                                     szpilman
                         we use what?

                                     henryk
                         we leave the money and the watch 
                         on the table. and we cover it like 
                         this.
                              (covers it with the 
                              newspaper)
                         in full view. the germans will 
                         search high and low, i promise 
                         you, they'll never notice it.

                                     szpilman
                         of course they'll notice it. but 
                         look--
                              (lifts the violin 
                              fingerboard.)
                         this is a good place for something.

                                     henryk
                         a good place for what?
                              (to the others')
                         he's insane!

                                     szpilman
                         just shut up.

                                     father
                              (overlapping)
                         my violin?

               they all talk at once.

                                     regina
                         quiet! quiet! order, please, order!

                                     halina
                         she's a lawyer, she likes order.

                                     regina
                         listen, just listen. let's come to 
                         an agreement. we jam the money in 
                         the window frame. the watch we 
                         hide under the cupboard. and the 
                         chain we put in the violin.

               a brief silence.

                                     father
                         will i still be able to play?

                                     szpilman
                         let's find out.

               they start to hide the things.
