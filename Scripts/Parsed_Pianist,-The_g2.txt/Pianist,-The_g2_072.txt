               ext. wisniowa street - night

               dimly lit. empty street. szpilman walks fast to the corner, 
               stops, looks round anxiously. nothing. he takes the armband 
               from his pocket and drops it through the grating of a drain 
               in the gutter just as there's movement in a darkened 
               doorway. szpilman tenses.

               then, out of the darkness of the doorway, a woman: janina 
               godlewska.

               she turns and starts to walk quickly. szpilman, putting 
               the collar of his coat up, follows, keeping pace. a 
               pedestrian walks past in the opposite direction but pays 
               them no attention.

               janina and szpilman walk on.
