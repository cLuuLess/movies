               int./ext.  1st apartment - early morning

               szpilman asleep on the divan. the roar of motor car and 
               motorcycle engines. sporadic firing. 

               he wakes, rushes to the window.

               szpilman's pov:

               a german personnel carrier, an open car carrying officers, 
               and a motorcycle and sidecar roar down the narrow street 
               below towards the buildings at the far end. german soldiers 
               follow behind on the trot, pulling a field gun.

               unseen marksmen fire down on the germans from the buildings. 
               as the german soldiers dismount from their vehicles one of 
               them is hit and falls. the others rush for cover.
