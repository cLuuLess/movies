               int. sleeping quarters, above warehouse - night

               semi-darkness. a large room with an improvised partition 
               of blankets to separate the men from the women. three-tiered 
               bunks.

               on the men's side, father is on the upper bunk, henryk on 
               the lower. szpilman, stripping down to his underwear, is 
               preparing to climb into the middle bunk.

                                     father
                         at least we've got work in the 
                         ghetto. at least we're still 
                         together.

               szpilman nods, climbs into his bunk, settles down. somewhere 
               near, the sound of a train.

               then a volley of shots, german voices shouting.

               szpilman slips off his bunk, hurries to the door, opens it 
               and comes face to face with a german nco and soldiers.

                                     nco
                         out! assemble in the yard!

                                     szpilman
                         we're employed here, we've got 
                         certificates -

               the nco cracks szpilman across the face, turns and goes. 

               szpilman retreats into the room, his nose bleeding. the 
               women are watching from behind the blankets, but mother 
               hurries towards szpilman. she wipes his nose.

               shots, shouts, a scream.
