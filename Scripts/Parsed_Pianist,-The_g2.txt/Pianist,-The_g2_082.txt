               ext. tram stop, warsaw street - afternoon

               szpilman and gebczynski wait with others at the stop as 
               the tram trundles towards them and comes to a halt.

               as they board:

                                     gebczynski
                              (quietly, to szpilman)
                         go as near to the front as possible, 
                         to the german section.
