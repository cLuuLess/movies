               int. warsaw apartment - night

               the family are gathered around the table, listening to 
               father reading from the newspaper.

               the apartment has even less furniture now. the paintings 
               are gone.

                                     father

                         be worn on the right sleeve and 
                         will represent a blue star of david

                         background must be sufficiently 
                         large for the star to measure eight 
                         centimetres from point to point. 
                         the width of the arms of the star

                         doesn't it say we have to provide 
                         these armbands ourselves? where 
                         will we get them?

                                     henryk
                         we're not going to get them. we're 
                         not going to wear them!

               silence, each locked in their own thoughts.
