               int. dorota's villa - night

               szpilman follows dorota into the living room.

                                     dorota
                         sit.

                                     szpilman
                         i'm sorry - i was given this 
                         address. i'm looking for a mr--
                              (he checks the scrap 
                              of paper.')
                         -- a mr dzikiewicz.

                                     dorota
                              (nodding)
                         michal dzikiewicz. he's my husband.

               szpilman sits down slowly.

                                     szpilman
                         i need help. 

                                     dorota
                         he'll be back before curfew.

                                     szpilman
                         i've been in hiding. i need 
                         somewhere to stay.

                                     dorota
                         he'll be here soon.

               awkward silence. he gazes at her. she looks away.

                                     szpilman
                         how long have you been married?

                                     dorota
                         just over a year.

               he nods. brief silence.

                                     szpilman
                         and how's yurek?

                                     dorota
                         dead. 

               again, the awkward silence.

                                     szpilman
                         when's your baby due?

                                     dorota
                         christmas.
                              (a pause.)
                         this is not a good time to have 
                         children. but then...

               the door opens and michal dzikiewicz enters. he sees 
               szpilman and stops. szpilman stands.

                                     dorota
                         this is my husband. wladyslaw 
                         szpilman. marek gebczynski sent 
                         him.

                                     michal
                         oh, yes. i remember.

               he shakes hands with szpilman.

                                     szpilman
                         mr gebczynski said to contact you 
                         only in an emergency, but...

                                     michal
                         don't worry now. we can't move you 
                         tonight.

               szpilman, dizzy, leans on the table for support.

                                     michal
                         you'll sleep on the sofa.

               he and dorota look at him.

                                     szpilman
                         excuse me, could i have a piece of 
                         bread?

                                     michal
                         yes, of course, we'll eat.
