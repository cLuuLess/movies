               int. jehuda zyskind's room - evening

               chaos. papers, pamphlets strewn all over the place. the 
               mimeograph smashed.

               szpilman enters, stands, surveying the devastation. 

               distant sounds of shooting, shouts, cries. 

               he gathers up some papers in a pile, takes off his jacket 
               and covers the pile of papers, making a pillow. he lies 
               down on the floor.

               he stares into the darkness, expressionless, empty.
