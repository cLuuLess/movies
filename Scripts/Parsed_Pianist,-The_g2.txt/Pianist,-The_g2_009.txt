               ext. warsaw street and cafe paradiso - day

               szpilman and dorota stroll along a tree-lined street with 
               bombed-out buildings and rubble. she flicks admiring, almost 
               loving glances at him as they walk and talk. and he is 
               smiling, touched by her.

                                     dorota
                         i nagged jurek for weeks and weeks. 
                         and at last he gave in and said, 
                         'all right, come with me tomorrow,' 
                         and so i came and they bombed the 
                         station.

                                     szpilman
                         you know something? meeting you 
                         like that was absolutely wonderful.

                                     dorota
                         really?

                                     szpilman
                         yes!
                              (he looks at her, 
                              smiles)
                         it was...it was unforgettable.

               she's embarrassed.

                                     dorota
                         i've always loved your playing, 
                         mr. szpilman.

                                     szpilman
                         wladek, please.

                                     dorota
                         no one plays chopin like you.

               she begins to laugh.

                                     szpilman
                         i could accompany you, me on the 
                         piano, you on the cello.

               they become almost helpless, holding on to each other.

                                     dorota
                         oh, mr szpilman, you're quite... 
                         quite wonderful.

                                     szpilman
                         wladek, please.

               amidst their laughter, he takes her hand and kisses it.
