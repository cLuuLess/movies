               int. tram (travelling) - afternoon

               gebczynski and szpilman apprehensive, push through the 
               rear section, packed with poles, seated and standing, until 
               they reach a chain and a sign:

                                     germans only

               in the german section, only three or four passengers. some 
               read newspapers, others stare into space or out of the 
               windows, but never looking at the poles.

               szpilman tries to appear as inconspicuous as possible. the 
               tram rumbles on its way.
