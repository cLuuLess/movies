               int. stores - day

               szpilman has unloaded the sacks of potatoes into the corner 
               and is kneeling, about to untie the string on the smallest 
               sack. a sound alerts him. he looks round.

               an ss lieutenant has entered the stores, sucking his finger, 
               which is bleeding.

                                     ss lieutenant
                         any fucking plaster?

               szpilman immediately hurries to a cupboard, finds a first 
               aid tin, removes a plaster and gives it to the ss 
               lieutenant.

                                     ss lieutenant's voice
                              (while he applies 
                              the plaster to his 
                              finger)
                         what were you up to?

                nothing from szpilman.

                                     ss lieutenant's voice
                         what the fuck are those?

               he indicates the sacks with his chin.

                                     szpilman
                              (in german)
                         we're allowed to take food into 
                         the ghetto. five kilos of potatoes 
                         and a...

               the ss lieutenant walks over to the sacks and kicks the 
               smallest one.

                                     ss lieutenant
                         open it.

                                     szpilman
                         it's only potatoes and bread.

                                     ss lieutenant
                         fuck that, you're lying, i can 
                         smell it. open it.

               szpilman tries to untie the string, but he's too terrified 
               and can't manage it. the ss lieutenant shoves him out of 
               the way, then takes from his belt a dagger and cuts the 
               string.

               the ss lieutenant reaches in and withdraws a handful of 
               long yellow beans. he glowers at szpilman, reaches in again, 
               produces a handful of oatmeal.

                                     ss lieutenant
                         you're all the same. give a jew a 
                         little finger, he takes the whole 
                         hand.

               he throws the oatmeal in szpilman's face.

                                     ss lieutenant
                         you lie to me again and i'll shoot 
                         you personally.

               he kicks szpilman viciously and marches away. szpilman 
               catches his breath, then quickly reaches into the bottom 
               of the sack and finds a pistol and ammunition. he hides 
               them under his clothes.
