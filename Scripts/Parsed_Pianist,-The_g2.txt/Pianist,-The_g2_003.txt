               int. stairs and lobby, radio station - day

               pandemonium. chaos. people rushing in all directions, many 
               carrying files, boxes, papers, shouting, calling. some of 
               the men in military uniform. the bombing continuous. 
               szpilman fights his way down the stairs. he has a small 
               cut on his forehead and is dabbing it with his handkerchief. 
               he has a dazed look. halfway down the stairs, a young woman, 
               dorota, tugs at his sleeve:

                                     dorota
                         mr. szpilman.

               he turns, to see an extremely pretty young woman gazing 
               adoringly at him while they're jostled and shoved. his 
               eyes light up.

                                     szpilman
                         hello.

                                     dorota
                         i came specially to meet you today. 
                         i love your playing, but what a 
                         day to choose.

                                     szpilman
                         who are you?

                                     dorota
                         my name's dorota, i'm jurek's 
                         sister. oh! you're bleeding.

                                     szpilman
                         it's nothing.

               jurek pushes in beside them and takes her arm.

                                     jurek
                         c'mon, dorota, you can write him a 
                         fan letter later, this isn't the 
                         best time, c'mon.

               jurek, pulling dorota, fights his way down the stairs.

                                     szpilman
                              (calling)
                         jurek, why have you been hiding 
                         her?

               and he, too, is carried with the flow into the lobby. debris 
               everywhere. szpilman fights to get to the main door, when 
               another bomb explodes, filling the air with dust and debris, 
               obscuring him and everyone else.
