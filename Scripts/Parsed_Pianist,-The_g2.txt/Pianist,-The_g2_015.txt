               int./ext. ghetto apartment and street - day

               two rooms on the third floor: a living room and a kitchen. 
               the szpilmans are unpacking their belongings in silence. 
               father pauses for a moment to take stock.

                                     father
                         to tell you the truth, i thought 
                         it would be worse.

                         look! come and look!

               they all go to the window and look out. 

               their pov - the street. 

               further along, men are building a wall across the street.
