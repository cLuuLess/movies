               int. szpilman apartment, sliska street - night

               hands on the piano keyboard. podgy, hairy hands with dirty 
               nails. they play an octave, harsh, toneless, with straight 
               fingers.

               the hands belong to mr lipa, a dealer, early fifties. he 
               sits at the piano, now examining the lacquer. regina stands 
               in the bow, watching him. henryk is at the table, also 
               watching intently.

               szpilman sits apart, aloof, his back to the piano and to 
               mr lipa.

                                     mr lipa
                         that's the price. that's what i'm 
                         offering. and my advice is to 
                         accept. you won't get more from 
                         anyone else.

                                     regina
                         but...but it's a steinway, mr 
                         lipa...

                                     mr lipa
                         two thousand. my advice is to take 
                         it. what you going to do when you're 
                         hungry? eat the piano?

               henryk suddenly makes a lunge for him, grabs hold of him, 
               a rough struggle takes place and during it mother and father 
               appear at their bedroom door to watch, appalled.

                                     henryk
                         get out! you're a thieving bastard, 
                         we don't want your money, get out! 
                         we'd rather give it away! get out!

               regina tries physically to restrain him.

                                     mr lipa
                              (overlapping, warding 
                              off henryk)
                         hey! hey! what's the matter with 
                         you? haven't you eaten today, what 
                         you suffering from? hey!

                                     regina
                              (overlapping)
                         henryk, stop it, leave him alone.

                                     mr lipa
                              (recovering, catching 
                              his breath, 
                              overlapping)
                         you people are crazy! i'm doing 
                         you a favour, two thousand, and 
                         i'm paying for the removal, i'm 
                         not even charging for the removal.

               henryk subsides, glowering at him.

                                     mr lipa
                         you haven't eaten today, you're 
                         crazy...

               suddenly:

                                     szpilman
                              (turning to them, 
                              severe)
                         take it.
