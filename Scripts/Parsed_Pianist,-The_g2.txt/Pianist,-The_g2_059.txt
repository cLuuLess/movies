               ext. ghetto street - day

               as before, szpilman and benek march towards the ghetto 
               gates in the demolition column, four abreast, under the 
               command of the jewish foremen and guarded by the two german 
               policemen.

               suddenly:

                                     young ss man
                         halt!

               the column halts before a young ss man, wild-eyed, with 
               his sleeves rolled up and wielding a pistol. he talks 
               excitedly to the policemen then turns, walks along the 
               column dividing them up: some men to the right, others, 
               seven of them, to the left. benek he orders to the left, 
               szpilman to the right. 

               young ss man turns to those on the left.

                                     young ss man
                         lie down!

               terrified, they obey. he stands over them and, one by one, 
               shoots them. when he comes to benek, the seventh man, his 
               pistol runs out of ammunition. he changes the clip, shoots 
               benek and marches off.
