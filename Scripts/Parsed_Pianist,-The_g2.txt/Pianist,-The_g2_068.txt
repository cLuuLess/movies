               int. jewish barracks - night

               a small room with several three-tiered bunk beds. the sound 
               of men's heavy breathing and snoring.

               szpilman lies awake, staring at the ceiling. he reaches 
               inside his jacket, finds a scrap of paper and a pencil, 
               writes something.

               he slips off his bunk and crosses to another set of bunks, 
               crouches down at the bottom one, where majorek sleeps.

                                     szpilman
                              (whispered)
                         majorek!

               majorek is instantly awake.

                                     szpilman
                         have a favour to ask. i want to 
                         get out of here.

                                     majorek
                         it's easy to get out, it's how you 
                         survive on the other side that's 
                         hard.

                                     szpilman
                         i know. but last summer, i worked 
                         for a day in zelazna brama square. 
                         i saw someone i knew. a singer. 
                         her husband's an actor. they're 
                         old friends. (
                              (he holds out the "   
                              piece of paper.)
                         i've written their names down. and 
                         their address. if they're still 
                         there. janina godlewska and andrzej 
                         bogucki. good people. majorek, you 
                         go into the town every day. would 
                         you try and make contact? ask them 
                         if they'd help me get out of here?

               majorek takes the paper but says nothing. he turns over 
               and goes back to sleep. szpilman returns to his bunk.
