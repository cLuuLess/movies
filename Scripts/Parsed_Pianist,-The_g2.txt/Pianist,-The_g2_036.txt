               int. kitchen, cafe nowoczesna - night

               henryk, finishing a bowl of soup and a piece of bread, 
               sits at a worktop with szpilman and benek. the kitchen is 
               small and busy with cooks, waiters, washers-up.

                                     szpilman
                         what's that mean, no employment 
                         certificate?

                                     henryk
                         you have to have an employment 
                         certificate to work for one of the 
                         german firms in the ghetto, 
                         otherwise...

                                     szpilman
                         otherwise what?

                                     henryk
                         you'll be deported.

                                     benek
                         so the rumours were true...

                                     henryk
                         they're going to resettle us. send 
                         us to labour camps. in the east. 
                         and they're closing the small 
                         ghetto.

               silence.
