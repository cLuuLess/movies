               ext.  ghetto street - evening

               szpilman, lost, empty, aimless, tries to catch his breath 
               in the aftermath of his tears.

               he wanders forlornly down the street, passing empty 
               buildings with their doors open, windows smashed. furniture, 
               torn mattresses and pillows lie scattered. feathers fly. 
               desolation.

               he turns a corner.
