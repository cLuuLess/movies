               a shambles. szpilman wanders through the upturned tables, 
               broken chairs. stops, looks about. nothing.

               distant shots, automatic fire.

               he turns and makes for the door. then he hears an urgent 
               hiss. he turns sharply and tries to find the source of it. 
               he hears the hiss again.

               now he sees, hiding under the platform, benek, beckoning 
               to him. szpilman hurries over and crawls on his back until 
               he's beside him. benek replaces a plank and they are hidden 
               from view.
