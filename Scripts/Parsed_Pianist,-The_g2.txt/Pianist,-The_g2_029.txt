               int. cafe nowaczesna - day

               szpilman snaps out of his reverie, seeing, across the heads 
               of the customers, halina, in a state of great anxiety, 
               beckoning urgently. 

               szpilman quickly brings the piece to a close, stands, steps 
               off the platform, threads his way through to halina. she's 
               shivering, almost unable to speak.

                                     szpilman
                         what's happened?

                                     halina
                              (almost incoherent)
                         oh my god, it's terrible, you've 
                         got to do something, oh my god!

                                     szpilman
                              (shaking her)
                         calm down, what, what is it?

                                     halina
                         they're hunting people on the 
                         streets. they've picked up henryk.
