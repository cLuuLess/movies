               ext. railway siding - day

               a cordon of jewish policeman and ss guards. among the great 
               throng of people, the szpilmans trudge towards the train. 

               szpilman and halina walking.

                                     szpilman
                         halina?

                                     halina
                         what?

                                     szpilman
                         funny time to say this.

                                     halina
                         what?

                                     szpilman
                         wish i knew you better.

                                     halina
                              (a smile)
                         thanks.

               the train:

               the szpilmans near the train. the first trucks are already 
               full, the people inside pressed close together, ss men 
               pushing them with their rifle butts.

               people in the trucks cry out in desperation. 

               the szpilmans are pushed along by ss men along the cordon 
               of jewish policemen, past loaded trucks. 

               then, suddenly:

                                     a voice
                         szpilman! szpilman!

               a jewish policeman grabs szpilman by his collar and pulls 
               him back out of the police cordon. it's heller. the rest 
               of the family have reached the next truck to be filled. 

               a scuffle as szpilman tries to resist. another jewish 
               policeman shoves him.

               szpilman stumbles, falls to the ground, in front of him 
               the closed ranks of the jewish policemen's backs.

               he stands, runs at the cordon, seeing between their heads, 
               shoulders, mother, regina, henryk and halina clambering 
               into the trucks. father is looking around, bewildered.

                                     szpilman
                              (yelling)
                         papa!

               father sees him, takes a step towards him, but stops, 
               smiling helplessly. he raises his hand and waves, then 
               turns and goes towards the trucks.

               again, szpilman flings himself at the policemen's shoulders.

                                     szpilman
                              (desperate)
                         papa! mama! halina!

               heller turns on him.

                                     heller
                         what do you think you're doing, 
                         szpilman? i've saved your life! 
                         now, go on, save yourself!

               szpilman stands for a moment, confused, terrified. then he 
               turns and starts to run.

                                     heller
                         don't run!

               szpilman drops to walking pace, makes for the gates. workers 
               are pushing carts piled with the bloated corpses that lay 
               against the wall. szpilman falls in with them and they 
               pass through the gates.
