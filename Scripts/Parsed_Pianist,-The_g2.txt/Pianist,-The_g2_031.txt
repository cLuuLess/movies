               ext. labour bureau building - day

               a mob of men in front of the building being herded this 
               way and that by jewish policemen. more and more captive 
               men are brought in by the german schutzpolizei (shupos).  
               the mob constantly swelling.

               szpilman reaches the back of the crowd.

                                     szpilman
                              (to an elderly man 
                              nearest him)
                         what's happening?

                                     the elderly man
                         they've got my grandson in there. 
                         they pick 'em up, they take 'em 
                         away. what do they do to them? 
                         i've stopped believing in god!

               szpilman scans the mob. the jewish policemen using batons 
               and whips to herd the men. no sign of henryk. szpilman 
               becomes alert. he's seen someone he recognises. heller, 
               with his red hair and hitler moustache, wielding a baton, 
               driving men into the building. with difficulty, szpilman 
               pushes his way through the mob and gets nearer to heller.

                                     szpilman
                              (yelling)
                         yitzchak!

               heller doesn't hear.

                                     szpilman
                         yitzchak!

               heller glances round.

                                     szpilman
                         here, please! wladek szpilman!

               heller shoves someone aside so that szpilman can approach, 
               but he continues to beat and manhandle people.

                                     szpilman
                         henryk's in there.

                                     heller
                         i haven't seen him.

                                     szpilman
                         believe me, they've picked him up.

                                     heller
                         tough luck.

                                     szpilman
                         can you help?

                                     heller
                         oh, you need me now, yes, now you 
                         need me!

                                     szpilman
                         can you help us?

                                     heller
                         it costs.

                                     szpilman
                         i've no money.

                                     heller
                         then there's nothing i can do. he 
                         should've joined us when i gave 
                         him the chance..

                                     szpilman
                         yitzchak, they told me you had 
                         influence.

                                     heller
                         who told you?

                                     szpilman
                         people i know. they said you're an 
                         important man.

               heller just glares at szpilman and then moves away. szpilman 
               stands, jostled by the crowd, uncertain, forlorn.
