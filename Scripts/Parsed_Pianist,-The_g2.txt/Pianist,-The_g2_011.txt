               father, wearing the star of david armband, walks slowly 
               along, carrying a string bag containing potatoes and 
               carrots, his eyes fixed on the pavement as if his thoughts 
               are a million miles away.

               he passes two german officers. they stop.

                                     german officer
                              (a harsh shout)
                         you!

               father stops, turns fearfully and approaches the germans.

                                     german officer
                         why didn't you bow?

                                     father
                              (removing his hat)
                         i'm sorry i...

               i german officer cracks him hard across the face, catching 
               his ear. father reels, collects himself as best he can and 
               starts to shuffle on -

                                     german officer
                              (calling after him)

                         pavement. walk in the gutter!

               father steps off the pavement and walks in the gutter. the 
               german turn and go. father walks on.
