               ext. building site - day

               the workers look up. so does szpilman and, as he does so, 
               the bricks slide off his hod, crashing to the ground below.

                                     zick-zack
                         you!

               an ss man, zick-zack (his nickname), with a whip, approaches 
               szpilman.

                                     zick-zack
                         here!

               szpilman goes to him. enraged, zick-zack grabs him by the 
               hair and presses his head hard between his thighs and then 
               beats him mercilessly.

                                     zick-zack
                              (with every stroke, 
                              hissing through 
                              clenched teeth)
                         und-zick! und-zack! und-zick! und-
                         zack!

               after a dozen or so strokes, szpilman falls forward and 
               lies in the dirt. zick-zack nods, satisfied.

                                     zick-zack
                         get him away from here.

               two poles, without armbands, one of them bartczak, drag 
               him away.

               bartczak and the other man help szpilman to his feet.

                                     bartczak
                         hope you played the piano better 
                         than you carry bricks.

                                     polish workman
                         he won't last long if he goes on 
                         like this.

                                     bartczak
                         i'll see if i can get him something 
                         better.
