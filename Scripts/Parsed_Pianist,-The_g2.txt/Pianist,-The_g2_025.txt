               int. ghetto apartment - evening

               summer. the windows are open and the sounds of the ghetto 
               can be heard in the background. the family sit round the 
               small table as mother comes with a saucepan of soup and 
               starts to serve.

                                     mother
                         and, please, tonight, for once, i 
                         don't want anything bad talked 
                         about. let's enjoy our meal.

                                     henryk
                         okay, then i'll tell you something 
                         funny. you know who i mean by dr. 
                         raszeja.

                                     regina
                         the surgeon?

                                     henryk
                         the surgeon. well, for some reason, 
                         don't ask me why, the germans 
                         allowed him into the ghetto to 
                         perform an operation...

                                     halina
                         on a jew? they allowed a pole to 
                         come in to operate on a jew?

                                     henryk
                         he got a pass, that's all i know. 
                         anyway, he puts the patient to 
                         sleep and starts the operation. 
                         he'd just made the first incision 
                         when the ss burst in, shoot the 
                         patient lying on the table, and 
                         then shoot dr. raszeja and everybody 
                         else who was there. isn't that a 
                         laugh? the patient didn't feel a 
                         thing, he was anaesthetised -

               he laughs. no one else does.

                                     mother
                         henryk, i said nothing bad.

                                     henryk
                         what's the matter with you all? 
                         have you lost your sense of humour?

                                     szpilman
                         it's not funny.

                                     henryk
                         well, you know what's funny? you're 
                         funny with that ridiculous tie.

                                     szpilman
                         what are you talking about, my 
                         tie? what's my tie got to do with 
                         anything? i need the tie for my 
                         work.

                                     mother
                         boys, boys...

                                     henryk
                         your work, yes, playing the piano 
                         for all the parasites in the ghetto, 
                         they don't give a damn about 
                         people's sufferings, they don't 
                         even notice what's going on around 
                         them!

                                     father
                         i blame the americans.

               the others look at him.

                                     szpilman
                         for what? for my tie?

                                     father
                         american jews, and there's lots of 
                         them, what have they done for us? 
                         what do they think they're doing? 
                         people here are dying, haven't got 
                         a bite to eat. the jewish bankers 
                         over there should be persuading 
                         america to declare war on germany!

               suddenly, there's a roar of engines and a screech of brakes. 
               slamming of doors. 

               the family rush to the windows.
