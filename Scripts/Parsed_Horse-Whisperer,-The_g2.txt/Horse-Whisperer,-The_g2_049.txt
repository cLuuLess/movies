	int. new york public library - night

	annie sits in the huge reading room, books spread out before 
	her, under a green reading lamp. her voice tells us what she's 
	reading:

				  annie (v.o.)
		"it was in america that horses first 
		roamed..."

	in the books, we see pictures, lithographs, paintings and 
	drawings...

				  annie (v.o.)
		"a million years before the birth of 
		man, they grazed the vast empty plains of 
		grass and crossed to other continents 
		over bridges of rocks... they first knew 
		man as the hunted knows the hunter, for 
		long before man saw horses as a means to 
		killing other beasts, man killed them for 
		meat..."

	annie's v.o. continues over;
