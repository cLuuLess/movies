	int. annie and grace's motel room - night

	camera moves to reveal annie on the phone in front of her 
	computer and fax...  plugging in extension cords as she talks:

				  annie
		... the phone company's putting in extra 
		lines. i'll call back with the numbers. 
		oh, and i want you to get in touch with 
		this lady in town here -- they say she's 
		sort of a physical therapist for the 
		rodeo boys but keep the one at the 
		hospital we already contacted on call...

	grace sits alone in the living room. watching tv, but anxious 
	and disturbed about what she's committed herself to.
