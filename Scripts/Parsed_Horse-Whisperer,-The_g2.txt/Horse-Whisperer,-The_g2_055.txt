	int. rona's trailer - night

	a small, well-used trailer. tom and rona are finishing dinner 
	like comfortable old friends. rona rises, taking the plates 
	into the kitchen and starts rinsing them:

				  rona
		oh i clear forget. you had a call from 
		some woman in new york. she sounded 
		pretty wound up.

				  tom
		i don't any woman in new york. but from 
		what i hear, most of them are wound up.

				  rona
		the number's by the phone.

	he nods but doesn't move. he just looks at rona and smiles. 
	she's a good woman. but tom hopes she doesn't want anymore 
	than what they have together. rona notices him looking and 
	smiles:

				  rona
		what are you looking at, young man?

				  tom
		how long were you married?

				  rona
		long enough.

				  tom
		you ever miss it?

				  rona
		does a horse miss a saddle?

				  tom
		sometimes.

	she chuckles, shuts the water off and crosses back to him, 
	sitting beside him.

				  rona
		well as a matter of fact, i don't... most 
		of the time.

	she starts unbuttoning his shirt.

				  tom
		you know, rona, we weren't all that good 
		together even when we were good together.

				  rona
		honey... i was always good.

	tom smiles as rona leans in. they kiss.
