	int. grace's hospital room - daybreak

	the room's lights are dimmed. dawn is being to break through.

	grace, slowly, opens her eyes coming out of sedation. she 
	takes a moment to figure out where she is... to remember.

	she uses her hands to hoist herself up, but she's unsteady 
	and knocks into her bedside table -- knocking the good luck 
	charm from india off the table. it rolls under the bed, with 
	a water tumbler. grace never sees the charm.

	grace looks where her leg once was. she feels the blanket, 
	the empty space where her leg once was... just like her mother 
	did (did her father couldn't). instead of self-pity, she's 
	oddly fascinated.
