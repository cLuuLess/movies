	int. hospital, connecticut - day

	annie is running through the corridors, her bags in tow. she 
	sees robert standing in the corridor talking to a doctor. she 
	runs for them.

	when she appears, robert and the doctor stop their 
	conversation. robert looks to annie, who is waiting for news.

				  annie
		what!?

	robert is teary eyed, beaten down.

				  robert
		judith's dead.

	annie's horrified, waiting for news of grace.

				  annie
		what about grace?

				  robert
		she was in pretty bad shape. they've 
		done a c.a.t. scan -- she has some 
		hemorrhaging...

				  doctor
		but nothing we can't handle...

				  annie
			(impatient)
		where is she now?

				  doctor
		surgery.

				  annie
		surgery! for what-?

				  robert
			(interrupting)
		annie, her leg was shattered -- what 
		they call the distal epi.. epi..

				  doctor
		distal epicondyle of the femur...

				  robert
			(quietly, crying)
		they have to take the leg off.

	annie responds without tears and cries but with a quiet 
	shock. we can tell her mind is racing, trying to process the 
	information, until finally she asks:

				  annie
		which leg?

	the doctor and robert are surprised by the question.

				  robert
		what difference does it make?

	annie stares for a beat, then nods apologetically.
