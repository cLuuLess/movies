	ext. grace's private school - morning

	annie pulls up in a range rover and stops. grace moves for 
	the door. annie asks respectfully;

				  annie
		do you want any help?

	grace doesn't even bother to answer. she manages to get onto 
	the pavements, then turns for her bag...

	annie notices other kids looking at grace from behind, as they 
	enter the school.

				  annie
		dad'll pick you up today, all right?

				  grace
		okay.

	grace looks up to her mother. what is unspoken between them 
	is the understanding that today will be difficult and there's 
	nothing either one can do about it.

				  annie
		you'll be fine.

	grace nods and turns to the school. annie watches her go.
