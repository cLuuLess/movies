	ext. annie and grace's cottage - day

	tom walks up some wooden steps to a door and knocks. he hears 
	a tv on inside. and grace's voice:

				  grace (o.s.)
		mom! the door!

	he hears annie's muffled reply from o.s. he hears some banging 
	as grace fumbles for her crutch and comes to the door. she 
	opens it only so far as to reveal her upper body:

				  grace
		yeah?

				  tom
		uh, i'm tom booker. your mother 
		around?

	grace hops to the side as tom walks by her, into the room. 
	grace is closing the door as he turns to see, for the first 
	time, that grace is one leg.

				  grace
		she'll be right out. she's on the 
		phone.

	grace hops back to the bed in front of the tv. tom nods and 
	puts his hat down -- noticing the prosthetic leaning against 
	the window, near her bed. he hears annie on the phone and 
	looks to the other room, the door ajar -- seeing only her 
	legs, seated on the edge of her bed, as she talks. her foot 
	taps impatiently.

				  tom
		first time in montana?

	grace, rudely nods, still looking at the tv.

	beat. tom doesn't like her manner, but can easily see through 
	it. he sits.

				  tom
		she gonna be long?

				  grace
		probably. she's on the phone twenty-
		three hours a day.

				  tom
		what does she do?

				  grace
		she's an editor.

				  tom
		mmm. an editor.

				  grace
		not like books or literature or anything. 
		just a magazine... just in case she 
		hasn't told you -- which i'm sure she 
		hasn't -- i don't want to be a part of 
		this, ok?

	tom just sort of nods. a beat or two later, annie enters.

				  annie
		sorry about that. hi. grace, this is 
		mr. booker... have you looked at 
		pilgrim?

	tom sees grace turn away, just as annie enters. he takes a 
	moment. he could say no right there, but something stops him.

				  tom
		uh, no. i was gonna take a look now.

				  annie
		you want us to come with you? i just 
		have to run to the main house and give 
		mr. peterson a check.

				  tom
		doesn't matter.

				  annie
		grace?... grace, you want to come with 
		us, take a look at pilgrim?

	grace keeps looking at the tv. no reply. tom is half way out 
	the door when he says to annie -- making sure grace can hear --

				  tom
		probably best she stays behind, anyway.

	he disappears. annie gives grace a final look and exits, closing the door.

	alone, grace flings her body across the bed, reaching for her 
	prosthetic -- putting it on feverishly. she is completely 
	intrigued by tom.
