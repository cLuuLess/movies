	int. the ranch house, double divide - night

	frank, tom, joe and tom twin boys, 6 years old, sit at a dining 
	table eating dinner, as diane serves. we parachute into the 
	middle of the conversation:

				  diane
		... well, i just think she's got a lot 
		of nerve showing up here. draggin' that 
		child and that poor animal all the way...
			(to one of the twins)
		you eat with those fingers again and you 
		know what'll happen!
			(the boy cowers)
		frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?

				  frank
		oh hell, i don't know... according to tom, 
		she's a pretty determined woman. must've 
		thought it was worth it.

				  diane
			(sits down)
		i guess they'll want feeding and all, out 
		here all day long.

				  tom
		i don't believe they'll expect that.

				  diane
		what, they ain't going forty miles into 
		choteau everytime they want a hamburger.

				  frank
		mixed salad.

				  diane
		what?

				  frank
			(slyly)
		i believe women from new york eat mixed 
		salads. ain't that right, tom?

	tom hides a grin -- he knows frank into teasing her now.

				  tom
		i believe so. saw it on a television 
		show, once.

				  diane
		well, that's just what we need on a cattle 
		ranch -- a vegetarian from new york.

	everyone eats. beat.

				  joe
		when you figure on branding?

				  frank
		weekend after next...

				  tom
		if the weather holds.

	frank nods. silence again. everyone eats. beat.

				  joe
		what's an editor do anyway?

				  diane
			(playing)
		we're not sure, sweetheart, but they 
		eat like rabbits.

	tom and frank chuckle. diane smiles -- in on the joke with 
	them. the children are curiously confused.
