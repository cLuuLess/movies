	int. maclean farmhouse, master bedroom/closet - mid-morning

	a walk-in closet of the master bedroom; one side is annie's, 
	one side is robert's.

	robert stands before his bureau in the closet -- he has just 
	showered and is putting on his watch and ring which lay 
	beside his cologne assortment. a framed photo of he and annie 
	in india -- younger, vibrant, in love... when they first met.

	the phone rings. robert enters into the bedroom to pick up.

				  robert
		hello?

	insert annie: they speak in dulled, emotionless voices:

				  annie
		it's me.

				  robert
		hi.

				  annie
		hi.

	awkward pause.

				  robert
		so, what, uh, what train are you taking?

				  annie
		i should be in by two.

				  robert
		okay. you want me to pick you up?

				  annie
		sure... what's grace up to?

				  robert
		riding with judith.

	beat.

				  annie
		i'm sorry about last night. i shouldn't 
		have brought it up over the phone.

				  robert
		that's okay. we have to talk about it 
		and we're not always in the same place
		... so... i just have to get used to it.
			(beat)
		what do you want to do about dinner?

				  annie
		i don't know. we'll figure it out.

	pause. there is a lot unspoken but understood between them. 
	annie's other phone line rings. robert hears it as well.

				  robert
		okay. we'll see you later then.

				  annie
		yeah. bye.

	annie picks up the other line and her manner brightens, her 
	energy boosts...

				  annie
		don! my love, how are you? did you hear 
		about fiske?... no, suing is too 
		civilized. can't we get your friend at le 
		cirque to serve him a fatal piece of 
		poached salmon?... ha, ha... that's even 
		better...
