	grace, in the back seat, wearing her headphones, listening to 
	her music (maybe liz phair or holly cole). detached. non-
	committal. as trucks pass by, their time slapping the pavement, 
	she reacts and turns to the other window.

	annie, in sunglasses, shifts her attention between the road 
	and her rear-view mirror -- checking on grace.
