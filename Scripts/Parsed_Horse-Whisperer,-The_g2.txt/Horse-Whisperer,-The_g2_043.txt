	ext. grace's school - day

	annie is crossing an empty school yard. grace is sitting on 
	the ground, her back against a wall, her "legs" in front of 
	her. she has been crying. she looks up to her mother.

				  grace
		it's too hard.

	annie kneels before her sympathetically brushing her hair away:

				  annie
		oh, honey... what happened?

				  grace
		doesn't matter. i... i don't want to 
		come back, that's all.

				  annie
			(softly)
		oh. well, what are you going to do? you 
		have to go to school, honey. i mean, what --

				  grace
			(snaps)
		i'm not coming back! that's it! i want to 
		go home!

				  annie
		grace, listen to me. your body is just 
		healing. you have to give the rest of you 
		time as well...

				  grace
		is that your version of a pep talk?

				  annie
		you are not staying home all day feeling 
		sorry for yourself. you're going to get 
		up and you're going to figure this out.

				  grace
			(snotty)
		fine!

				  annie
		it's still early. what's your next class?

	with secret delight, grace viciously utters the word:

				  grace
		gym!
