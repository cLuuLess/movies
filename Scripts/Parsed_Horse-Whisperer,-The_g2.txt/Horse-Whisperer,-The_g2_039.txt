	int. grace's bedroom - night

	grace stands by her door and can hear her parents muffled, 
	tense voices. annie is angry at his complacency. robert just 
	wants what's best for grace. she closes the door. silence. 
	she puts her crutches against the wall and tries to walk 
	towards her bureau without them. it is a struggle, but she 
	does... almost falling, but grabbing the bureau just in time. 
	the 8x10 of her and pilgrim, falls face down. she props it up 
	and looks at it -- focusing on her horse, then on judith. 
	suddenly, she lashes out, knocking the photograph onto the 
	floor...

				  robert (o.s.)
		honey, you all right? did something 
		fall?

				  grace
			(angrily shouts)
		no!
