	int. tom's bedroom - night

	tom enters and closes the door. turns on a stereo which plays 
	a cello piece by yo-yo ma. books fills his room. he sits at 
	his desk, puts on eye glasses and looks through some paperwork. 
	suddenly he stops, looking over the paperwork, into space. a 
	thought passes by. we don't know what.
