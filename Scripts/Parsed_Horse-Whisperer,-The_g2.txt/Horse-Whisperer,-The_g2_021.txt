	ext. the woods - late morning

	pilgrim is hiding in the shadows under an old railroad bridge, 
	standing up to his knees in the river. his chest is cut open, 
	bleeding. his face cut, contorted and swollen. liz hammond, 
	the local veterinarian, hides a hypodermic needle in her 
	jacket, quietly walking into the water.

	a policeman is going into the water downstream from pilgrim, 
	whose chest is heaving, blood drips into the water. he 
	watches liz. she is almost to him when suddenly he bolts, 
	running upstream.

	the policeman behind him shouts and waves his arm. frightened, 
	pilgrim wheels back toward liz, who manages to stick the hypo 
	in his neck. he rears, knocking her down, then runs out of 
	the river, the hypo still in his neck. he runs for the 
	sanctuary of the woods.
