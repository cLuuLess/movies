	int. hospital cafeteria - pre-dawn

	the clock is ticking on the wall. the cafeteria is empty 
	except for one tired intern, drinking coffee on a break.

	robert and annie are having a cup of coffee. in the silence, 
	they search for things to say. until:

				  robert
		i saw judith's parents while you were 
		at the apartment...
			(annie listens)
		i wanted to say something...
			(beat)
		but i... i was so relieved that grace 
		was still... that it wasn't our daughter.

				  annie
		we're very lucky.

				  robert
			(nods)
		the funeral's on friday.

	he rises and crosses to the self-help coffee dispenser as he 
	continues...

				  robert
		oh, uh, i meant to tell you... alex 
		brought that fabric over...

				  annie
		okay.

				  robert
		it's on the table by the phone. i didn't 
		know what to tell him...
			(returns to table, sits)
		... whether or not we were...
			(beat)
		... if we still we're thinking of redoing 
		the couch.

	annie just nods. she senses robert is looking for some kind 
	of reassurance, but she can't give it to him. he continues;

				  robert
		... and uh... mario called about moving 
		the wisteria?

				  annie
		oh. right. i'll call him.

	pause. annie looks at her husband as he stares off to the 
	side, deep in his thoughts. she can sense he's sinking as he 
	fidgets with the napkins. she remembers:

	memory:
