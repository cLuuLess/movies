	ext. woods - day

	pilgrim is sedated, lying in his own blood in the snow, 
	surrounded by police and trackers. he is being attended to by 
	liz hammond, who is dictating to her assistant:

				  liz
		... his skull, cheek, and nose are 
		severely fractured. he has a deep 
		chest wound. i'm not even sure it 
		can be closed.

				  local tracker
			(deadpan, local accent)
		animal should be put down -- anybody can 
		see that.

	liz looks up to him, resentfully, but knows he's right.
