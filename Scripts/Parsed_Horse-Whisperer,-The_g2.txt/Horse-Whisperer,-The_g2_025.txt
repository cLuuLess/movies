	int. grace's hospital room - day

	camera moves from grace's face down her body to robert's 
	hand, which rubs her good leg. he looks at her lovingly, 
	pushing the hair from her forehead.

	annie, needing to do something, tenderly straightens grace's 
	blankets. it is plain to see where her leg had once been. 
	robert can't look. annie, one to face her fears, bravely 
	looks at it head on. she notices the i.v. bag and rises on:

				  annie
		that bag's almost empty.

				  robert
			(looking)
		no, it's got a little left. they'll be 
		in to change it.

				  annie
			(as she exits)
		robert, you leave it up these people...!

	robert is about to respond but annie is already out the door. 
	we hear the o.s. dialogue as robert listens.

				  annie (o.s.)
		excuse me, my daughter needs a new 
		i.v.

				  nurse (o.s.)
		we have her down, we'll be right in.

				  annie (o.s.)
		i'd like it taken care of now please.

	annie enters first.

				  annie
		you have to keep on top of these people 
		or else they just sit on their --

	but robert is ignoring her. facing grace, smoothing away her 
	hair. he's giving her the silent treatment. annie knows this 
	means robert doesn't approve of her dictatorial behavior. 
	annoyed, she turns away as well.

	the nurse enters with a new bag and begins to replace the old 
	one as robert backs away.

				  robert
		i'm sorry.

				  annie
		tch. what are you --

	annie, about to respond to his inappropriate politeness, is 
	stopped by robert, who finally looks at her. it's a powerful 
	look that tells her to calm down and shut up. it's a look 
	that, for all of robert's sensitivity, affects annie. she 
	gets the message and stays calm.

	as the nurse leaves, annie is about to say thank you, but 
	robert beats her to it.

				  robert
		thank you.

	annie and robert stand facing each other, when the phone rings. 
	annie picks up.

	intercut
