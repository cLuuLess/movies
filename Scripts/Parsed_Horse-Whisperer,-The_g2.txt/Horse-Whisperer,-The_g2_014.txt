	int. annie's magazine office - mid-morning

	annie, casually dressed, enters the empty offices of her 
	magazine. she turns on the light, revealing a large row of 
	stalls and glassed in private offices. everywhere we look, we 
	see indications of the kind of magazine she edits.

	she strolls to her office -- the largest -- surrounded by 
	windows. the office walls are covered with photos, most of 
	which are cover stories on annie.

	(one photo is of annie's father martin. a british ambassador 
	with his young daughter on his lap, her arms affectionately 
	around his neck. her mother stands right behind them, posing 
	like a member of the royal family.)

	annie sits and takes a breath. the only photo on her desk is 
	a family portrait, taken when annie was given the crystal 
	award -- robert, grace, herself and the award. she checks her 
	watch -- it is almost 9:30.
