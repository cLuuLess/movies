	ext. iowa motel - later that same morning

	annie is returning from her jog, sweating. as she crosses to 
	her motel room, she stops by the window, looking in to see:

	grace, on the floor, straining to do her exercises.

	annie fills with compassion for her girl -- reminded of the 
	struggle she faces everyday.
