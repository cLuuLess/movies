	ext. horse arena, california - day

	inside the corral, a small black thoroughbred is being worked 
	by tom. as he rides and narrates into a radio microphone to 
	the crowd, we sense this is a man of good humor and great 
	skill --  guileless, sensible, of the earth.

				  tom
		... it's always kind of interesting to 
		hear the horse's side of the story...

	the crowd laughs warmly. he directs his comments to a woman 
	wearing an expensive ralph lauren western outfit, standing 
	outside the corral...

				  tom
		now if he was cranky or lazy, like you 
		say he is, we'd be seeing his tail 
		twitching there and his ears back, 
		maybe. but this isn't a cranky horse, 
		it's a scared horse. you see how braced 
		he is up around the neck back there. 
		he just doesn't know which way to turn...

	the woman nods. tom turns the horse on a dime so that he 
	always stays facing the circling thoroughbred...

				  tom
		you see how he keeps pointing his 
		hindquarters in at me? well, i'd guess 
		the reason he seems reluctant to move 
		out is because when he does, he gets in 
		trouble for it.

				  the woman
		he's not good at transitions, you know? 
		when i want him to move from a trot to a 
		lope, say...

				  tom
			(smiles)
		well, i'm sure that's what you think but 
		that's not what i'm seeing. you may think 
		you're asking for a lope, but your body 
		may be saying something else altogether. 
		you might be putting too many conditions 
		on him. for instance, you might be saying 
		"go, but, hey, don't go too fast." he can 
		tell that from the way you feel. your 
		body can't lie. you ever give him a kick 
		to make him move out?

				  the woman
		he won't go unless i do.

				  tom
		and then he goes and you feel like he's 
		going too fast, so you yank him back?
			(she nods)
		and next thing you know, he's bucking.
			(she nods again)
		well, if someone told you to go, stop, 
		go, stop -- you'd buck too.

	the people laugh. the woman smiles self-consciously.

				  tom
		it's a dance, see... somebody has to lead 
		and somebody has to follow.

	tom gracefully moves his horse around the ring, "dancing". he 
	then takes up a long coiled rope and throws it so that the 
	coils slap against the black horse's flank, making it burst 
	into a lope. and again... making the animal go from a trot to 
	a lope, letting it slow, then up to a lope again.

				  tom
		i want him to get so he can leave real 
		soft. he's getting the idea now. he's 
		not all braced up and tense like he was 
		at the start. he's finding out it's okay.

	he throws the rope again and this time the transition to the 
	lope is a smooth one.

				  tom
		you see that? he's getting better 
		already. pretty soon, if you work at 
		it, you'll be able to make all these 
		transitions easy on a loose rein.
			(sotto voce, wry)
		yeah, and pigs'll fly.
			(to woman)
		he's going to be okay -- so long as you 
		don't go yanking on him.

	she nods, but he can see she's upset, feeling foolish. he 
	walks the horse over to her, turns off the microphone and 
	speaks sympathetically:

				  tom
		look, the truth is it's all about self-
		preservation. these animals.
			(with great affection)
		... well, they just have such big hearts, 
		you know? there's nothing they want more 
		than to do what you want them to do. but 
		when the messages get all confused, the 
		only thing they know to do is try and 
		save themselves... now, why don't you go 
		saddle up and see what happens.

	feeling better, and not a little attracted to his heartfelt 
	man's man, the woman smiles and reaches for his hand to climb 
	over the rail. her horse lets her come right up to him and 
	stroke his neck. tom comments;

				  tom
		they won't ever hold a thing against 
		you. they're the most forgiving 
		creatures god ever made.

	turning on his mike and turning back to the crowd, he says:

				  tom
		okay, who's next?

	a young boy leads a mule into the ring. tom smiles:

				  tom
		now god has another idea entirely with 
		the mule.
