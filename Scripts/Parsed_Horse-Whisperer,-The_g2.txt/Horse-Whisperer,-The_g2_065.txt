	int. motel room, ohio - night

	a small furnished motel room with two twin beds.

	grace sits up in bed watching tv, with no expression. a sitcom 
	with canned laughter serves as a hypnotic drug.

	annie enters from the bathroom, after showering, drying her 
	hair. grace doesn't bother to look up.

				  annie
		you want to take your bath?
			(grace shakes her head)
		we have to get up early tomorrow. you 
		may not have enough time to --

				  grace
		fine -- i'll take my bath.

	she begins moving off the bed.

				  annie
		no, i don't mean you have to. it's just 
		that we may not have enough --

				  grace
		-- enough time tomorrow. i know.

				  annie
		look, if you want to take it in the 
		morning, that's fine.

				  grace
			(interrupts on "fine")
		i don't care.

	annie realizes she may have pushed too hard, but she also 
	realizes there's no talking to grace now. so, she achieves 
	her goal --

				  jannie
		take it now.

	grace hobbles off the bed, enters the bathroom and shuts the 
	door.
