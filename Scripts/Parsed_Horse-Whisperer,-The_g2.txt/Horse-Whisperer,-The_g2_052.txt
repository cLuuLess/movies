	ext. a fairgrounds parking lot, california - day

	a hot, dusty fairgrounds horse arena. the worn wooden bleachers, 
	crowded. lines of cars and pick-up trucks.

		"...for secrets uttered softly into 
		troubled ears, these men were known as 
		the whisperers..."

	one particular pick-up truck has its back door opened. a 
	man's leg is sticking out, putting on a pair of boots.

	a moment later the man gets out of the car. holding a cowboy 
	hat, he has a certain quality, a self-respect, that men who 
	know themselves seem to have. tom booker.

	a weathered redheaded woman named rona -- late forties, strong, 
	wiry horsewoman's build -- is walking towards him.

				  rona
		hey, darlin'.

				  tom
		hey, rona. sorry i'm late.

				  rona
		i wouldn't know what to do if you were 
		on time.

	they walk together towards the fairgrounds.

				  tom
		you're looking fit.

				  rona
		fit? you want to check my teeth.
			(tom laughs)
		good crowd today. i think you'll have 
		some fun. you going to stay for dinner?

				  tom
		if it's not too much trouble, i thought 
		i might.

				  rona
			(playful)
		kind of trouble i'm in the mood for.

				  tom
		oh-oh... maybe i better get back in the 
		truck.

	rona lets out a hearty laugh as they enter the horse arena.
