	the girls ride down, along a stand of hickories and poplars 
	to a river. they stop the horses and their conversation, to 
	listen to the sound of the water. below them, off in the 
	distance, they can just make out a two-lane country road.

				  grace
		you want to go down or stay along 
		the river?

				  judith
		we already did the river. let's go down 
		and across the old bridge. we can circle 
		back.

	they begin to make their way.
