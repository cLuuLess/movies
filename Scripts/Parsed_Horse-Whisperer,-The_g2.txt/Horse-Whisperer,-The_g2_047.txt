	ext. dyer horse farm, connecticut - day

	it's raining. the maclean car is parked by the barn. they 
	are walking towards the stables under their umbrellas as liz 
	runs to greet them.

				  liz
		hello...
			(to grace)
		it's so good to see you. how ya 
		doing?

				  robert
		she's doing just grea. aren't you 
		kiddo?

				  grace
		i'm fine.

				  liz
		well, come on. he's out back now...
			(leads them)
		mind how you go. it's pretty muddy back 
		there.

				  grace
		why is he in the back? why isn't he in 
		the barn with the other horses?

	liz stops, causing everyone to stop. she turns to face grace, 
	realizing she doesn't know. she looks at robert and annie, 
	accusingly. she tries to explain:

				  liz
		well, grace, you see... pilgrim just... 
		isn't the same horse he used to be.
			(to the parents)
		as a matter of fact, maybe now's not 
		the best time to --

				  grace
		i really want to see him.

	liz looks at annie. annie nods. liz leads them on.

	they reach a row of empty old stalls. they cross to one of 
	the stalls -- its doors are closed. liz draws back the bolt 
	on top half of the door.

	there is an immediate explosion of sound inside the stall, 
	the sound of fear, startling them. then it's still. liz 
	slowly opens the door. grace, with the aide of her cane, 
	walks to the stall. she hesitates, then looks in. it takes a 
	moment for her eyes to grow accustomed to the dark. she sees 
	pilgrim with his head down in the shadows...

				  grace
		hello, beautiful boy...

	he lifts his head at the sound of her voice. grace, and the 
	audience, see him for the first time -- his mad eyes, his 
	terrible disfigurement...

	grace cries out, stepping backwards, nearly stumbling in the 
	mud... what is left of her horse are gone. annie realizes 
	what's happened and, together with robert, rush to her... they 
	too see the monster pilgrim has become and are horrified. 
	grace angrily pushes away from them and "runs" off. robert 
	goes after her.

	annie is standing in the rain with liz -- her eyes unable to 
	move away from the sight of pilgrim.

				  liz (o.s.)
		you should have told her, annie. i 
		tried to explain to you how bad it was... 
		i guess you had to see it. but, there's 
		nothing to be done. this animal's beyond 
		help. annie, can i have your permission 
		now to put him down?

	annie stands in the rain, hands in pocket, fixed on pilgrim 
	and more determined than ever;

				  annie
		no.
