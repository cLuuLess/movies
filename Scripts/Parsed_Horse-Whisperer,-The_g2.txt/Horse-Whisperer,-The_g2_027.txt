	int. the university animal hospital, recovery stalls - night

	a line of recovery stalls with various sick and hurt animals. 
	liz, exhausted asleep, on a chair outside a stall. there's a 
	slight scratching sound. a hoof against the stall. it gets 
	louder, awakening liz. she gets up and looks inside the 
	paddled stall:

	pilgrim is lying in the stall, heavily bandaged. he is waking 
	up. his first instinct is to kick at the paddled stall walls. 
	he looks at liz, his eyes filled with madness -- enraged to 
	still be alive.
