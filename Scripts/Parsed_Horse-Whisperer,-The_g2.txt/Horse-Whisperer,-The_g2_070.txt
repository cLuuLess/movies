	int. motel in iowa - night

	grace and annie enter the room to find a double bed instead 
	of two twins. neither comments.

	annie exits o.s., carrying the bags inside, as she says:

							  dissolve to:

				  annie
		you should call your dad before it 
		gets too late.

				  grace
		i already did.
			(annie's surprised)
		this morning. when you went running.

				  annie
		oh. you didn't tell me.

				  grace
		i didn't know i had to.

				  annie
			(stares angrily, speaks 
			 softly)
		you don't.

	silence. annie exits past her to the car.

							  dissolve to:

	later

	grace is asleep in her twin bed. once again, annie is wide 
	awake. the clock reads: 4:55 am. but annie can not sleep. 
	camera moves away from annie, past her side of the bed, to 
	the other side of the room.

	we see the shadow of a woman coming towards the bed. she 
	comes in camera angle and we follow to her back to the bed, 
	which has now transformed into --

	a bed from the past, in which a ten-year-old annie is 
	sleeping with her younger brother george.

	we are in memory.

	the woman gently shakes little annie awaken.

				  woman
		annie... annie, sweetheart... wake 
		up.

	the little girl, with sleep in her eyes, turns and sees her.

				  woman
		bad news i'm afraid. your daddy's 
		gone.

	end of memory.

	annie, in present time next to grace, thinks of this as she 
	stays awake. putting her jogging parka on over her nightgown, 
	she goes outside.
