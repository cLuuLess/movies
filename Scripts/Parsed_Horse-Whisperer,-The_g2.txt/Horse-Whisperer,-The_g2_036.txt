	ext. central park west apartment building - day

	a limousine drives up as the doorman gets the car door. the 
	weather is slightly warmer. people's clothing looks as if 
	spring is coming nearer.

	annie exits first, carrying a jacket for grace. she is 
	followed by robert, who immediately turns to help grace. we 
	hear her o.s.

				  grace (o.s.)
		dad! i can do it, ok?!

				  robert
		ok, ok.

	annie shoots him a disapproving look.

	we see grace's good leg exit first... then two crutches, 
	followed by... a prosthetic leg. grace scoots into view, and 
	takes a breath.

				  grace
		you all go ahead. i'll be up by 
		christmas.
