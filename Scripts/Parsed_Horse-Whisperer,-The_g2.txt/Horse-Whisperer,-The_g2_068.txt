	int. suburban - day

	grace and annie occupy their same positions. annie is on the 
	car phone with her office.

				  annie
		okay, listen -- let's do this. when 
		i get to the next motel, i'll see if 
		they have a fax. if not, i'll call 
		you tomorrow to --

	annie continues o.s. when we hear a shifting, a rocking in 
	the trailer behind them. as if pilgrim made a sudden move. 
	grace quickly turns her head. annie looks in the rear view at 
	grace.

				  annie
		uh lucy, look, i have to go. ok... 
		later.

	annie hangs up and smiles at grace through the mirror. grace 
	reaches for her walkman and headphones. annie offers;

				  annie
		grace! grace!

	grace lowers one side of her headphones;

				  annie
		would you like to put your music on 
		up here?

	grace shrugs. annie shrugs it off as well. grace replaces the 
	headphone. annie turns on the radio -- nothing but country or 
	gospel or religious talk shows... she shuts it off. frustrated, 
	annie looks up ahead and sees:

	a truck stop diner

	annie yells to be heard through the headphones;

				  annie
		it's almost lunchtime. are you 
		hungry!?

				  grace
			   	 (shrugs)
		whatever you want.

				  annie
		fine!

				  grace
		fine.

	annoyed, annie pulls onto the gravel and stops, talking to 
	herself --

				  annie
		fine!

	she exits the car, banging the door. as she walks acrund the 
	car to help grace, she talks to herself in a sarcastic whisper:

				  annie
		"whatever you want!" well, this is what 
		i want. i want to eat lunch and i want 
		to smoke a cigarette and i want to keep 
		talking to myself for the next two 
		thousand fucking miles..."!

	she opens grace's door. grace senses her mother's anger.
