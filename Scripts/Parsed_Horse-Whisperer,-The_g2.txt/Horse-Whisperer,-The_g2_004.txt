	int. grace's bedroom - morning

	grace awakens, calmly. takes a breath. slides out of bed and 
	stands before a window, overlooking a beautiful connecticut 
	country house. we see a snow-covered field and distant woods. 
	grace presses her faces against the cold, frosted window 
	eager to get out.
