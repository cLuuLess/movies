	ext. dyer horse farm - morning

	the snow has stopped falling. grace walks along a hill, hands 
	in pocket. spread out on the landscape are horses, on a horse 
	farm, standing like statues in the white covered fields.

	as grace comes along the hill, we see another girl (judith) 
	coming from the opposite direction. she doesn't have grace's 
	lean elegance but her warm, friendly smile brightens her 
	face. upon reaching her, grace returns the smile with a hug.

				  judith
		it's warmer than i thought.

				  grace
		you want to go to a movie tonight?

				  judith
		i thought your mom's coming up?

				  grace
			(prickly)
		so?

	judith immediately senses a problem so she continues casually, 
	as they begin walking away from camera...

				  judith
		my parents are having friends from 
		college over. they're really nice... 
		they have this gorgeous son who wants 
		to be a forest ranger.

				  grace
		can i come? i'll start a fire...

	judith laughs as they continue talking, their voices trailing 
	off, as the girls head for the stables.
