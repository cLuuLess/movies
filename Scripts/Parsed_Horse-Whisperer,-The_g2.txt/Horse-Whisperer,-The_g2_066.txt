	int. motel room in ohio - night

	the lights are off. annie lays in bed, wide awake. it is the 
	middle of the night.

	grace, asleep in the other bed, begins whimpering. she's 
	having a bad dream. annie rises -- considering whether or not 
	to intercede... finally, grace begins to cry out... softly at 
	first, but with increasing intensity until she awakens in 
	fear... annie appears right by her side.

				  annie
		what, sweetheart? what?

	shaken, grace cannot fight how much she needs her mother at 
	that moment. she wraps her arms around her, tightly, and tries 
	to catch her breath.

				  annie
		it's sleeping in a strange bed, 
		that's all. happens sometimes. it's 
		ok. it's ok.
