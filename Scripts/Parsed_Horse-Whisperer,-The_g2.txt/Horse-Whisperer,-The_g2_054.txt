	ext. the fairgrounds - later that day

	tom has finished his "show." people are shaking his hand, 
	thanking him, as he walks away from the corral, towards a 
	trailer.

	the woman in the ralph lauren approaches:

				  woman
		excuse me.

	he faces the woman:

				  woman
		hi. i'm dale. i just wanted to -- i can't 
		get over the way he felt under me after 
		you'd finish with him. everything had 
		just, i don't know, freed up or something.

	the woman is flirting. tom shrugs, uncomfortably;

				  tom
		well, that'll happen.

				  woman
		where did you learn all this stuff?

				  tom
		what stuff is that?

				  woman
		about horses? i'd love to learn more 
		about it myself. do you offer any 
		private lessons for riders?

				  tom
		 	(getting the message)
		well... dale... you know, a lot of this 
		stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.

				  woman
		what do you mean?

				  tom
		well, if the rider's nuts, the horse 
		bolts.
			(smiles)
		that's the whole lesson right there. 
		you have a good day now... just... keep 
		on freeing yourself up.

	he leaves her, entering the trailer.
