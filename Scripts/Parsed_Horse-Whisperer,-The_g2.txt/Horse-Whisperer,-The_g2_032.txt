	int. a smaller apartment, kitchen - a night remembered

	a younger annie stands in a bathrobe, noticeably pregnant, 
	cooking at a stove -- reading instructions from a propped up 
	cookbook. frank sinatra is blasting as she sings along, in 
	full voice, without inhibitions;

				  annie
		"she's loves the theatre but never comes 
		late... she never bothers with people she 
		hates... that's why the lady is a tramp!..."

	a younger robert, wearing a suit, arrives home from work. seeing 
	her, he smiles affectionately. he puts down his briefcase and 
	bursts into his own playful sinatra impersonation:

				  robert
		"she loves the free..."

	startled, annie turns around and smiles:

				  robert
			(sexily undoing his tie)
		"... fresh, wind in her hair... life 
		without care... she's broke... but 
		it's 'ok'...

				  annie
			(a la fan)
		sing it to me, frankie!

				  robert
			(a la sinatra cool)
		how's my pregnant chick!

	she moves to him and they embrace... he wraps his arms around 
	her. they kiss. annie laughs.

				  annie
		you can hardly get your arms around me. 
		how depressing. you're so early.

				  robert
		i had to excuse myself from a meeting. 
		it's ridiculous. i kept thinking about 
		the baby... you... and, i swear, i was 
		going to start bawling right into my 
		briefs.

				  annie
			(loving it)
		aw... that's so sweet.

				  robert
		i love you.

				  annie
		do you? do you really?

	they turn to each other and kiss.

	end of memory.
