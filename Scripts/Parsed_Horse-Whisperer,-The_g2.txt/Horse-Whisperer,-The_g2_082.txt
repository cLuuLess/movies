	ext. the double divide range - day

	men are working in the corral, saddle horses standing nearby, 
	trying to get a sick calf to suckle a cow. one of the men is 
	tom booker, working along side his brother frank, and his 
	nephew, joe. frank is a good man -- solid work ethic, 
	christian fearing, wry sense of humor. with the build of a 
	football player, his strength never overwhelms his boyish, 
	good-natured heart. joe is eleven, wearing his cowboy hat 
	like a badge of honor. the three men seem as inseparable to 
	each other, as they are to the land. as they work:

				  joe
		can we take a look at bronty's foal 
		when we're done here, dad?

				  frank
		sure. as long as she don't mind.

				  joe
		there's a kid at school says we 
		should've imprint-trained him.

	tom and frank don't say anything. just nod, knowingly.

				  joe
		he says if you do it soon as they're 
		born, it makes them real easy to handle 
		later on.

				  frank
		that's what some folks say.

				  joe
		there was this thing on the tv about a 
		guy who does it with geese. he has this 
		airplane and these baby geese all grow 
		up thinking it's their mom, and he flies 
		it and they just follow.
			(to tom)
		you hear 'bout that, uncle t?

				  tom
		yeah, i hear about that.

				  joe
		well, what do you think about that 
		stuff?

				  tom
		well, joe, i'll tell ya -- i don't know 
		a whole lot about geese. maybe it's okay 
		for them to grow up thinking they're 
		airplanes. but horses, as far as i can 
		tell, can't fly.

	frank laughs. joe smirks as tom messes his hat up. there's the 
	sound of a car. they turn.

	the suburban is coming over the ridge, heading down the 
	driveway in a cloud of dust.

				  joe
		we expecting company?

	frank shakes his head. as the suburban slows down, tom 
	recognizes the driver.

				  tom
		i don't believe it.

				  frank
		you know her?

	annie, out of her element, hiding behind sunglasses, gets out 
	as tom approaches her by himself. annie girds herself for the 
	confrontation.

				  annie
		hello, mr. booker. annie maclean. from 
		new york. we talked on the phone.

	she extends her hand. tom shakes it, nodding, staring at her 
	curiously.

				  annie
		it's, uh... beautiful country. i had a 
		little bit of a hard time finding the 
		place. there are no signs.

				  tom
		plenty of signs -- just none of them 
		printed. who do i get the idea you're 
		not just passing through!

				  annie
		well... ok... here it is... uh... i'd 
		like you to take a look at my horse. 
		now -- it won't take long and if, after 
		that, you still don't feel...

				  tom
		were you thinking of personally driving 
		me back east?

				  annie
		oh no. she's here. i brought him along. 
		and my daughter, too. we're staying at 
		peterson's...

				  tom
		you mean you hauled him all the way out 
		here? just like that?

				  annie
			(slightly taken aback)
		well... yes... i had a trailer. it's not 
		like i made him run along side of the car.

				  tom
		all by yourself?

	she nods. tom cannot help be impressed by her guts and fortitude.

	camera cuts away for a moment to a window in the ranch house, 
	through which diane -- frank's fiery, loyal pioneer wife -- 
	looks at the duo with suspicion.

				  tom
		i uh... ha, ha... i don't think i ever 
		met a lady quite like yourself and i 
		appreciate all the pains you've gone 
		through to --

				  annie
		look! please! don't do the "shucks, 
		ma'am" thing again!
			(tom, surprised, listens)
		i've driven a few thousand miles for a 
		few minutes of your time. i've brought 
		him here -- to your neck of the...
			(seeing no woods)
		-- mountains. just take a look at him. 
		if you still feel the same way, i'll 
		be on the road by morning and you'll 
		never see me again. ok? deal?

	tom tries to hide a smile of respect. annie, thinking she may 
	have him, starts backing away towards her car -- as one would 
	a dangerous animal they think they might have tamed...

				  annie
		we're at peterson's. whenever you're 
		free. you don't even have to call.

	she gets into the suburban. tom watches her drive off.
