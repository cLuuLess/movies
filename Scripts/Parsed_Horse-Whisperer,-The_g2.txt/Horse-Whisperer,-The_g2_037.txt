	the three sit at a dinner table, eating dinner. grace picks 
	at her food. robert can't help staring at her. annie eats, 
	watching them both.

  		no, i'm just not that hungry.

				  annie
		why don't you go lie down?

				  grace
		i don't want to lie down. i've been 
		lying down enough.

				  robert
		you want to watch some television?

				  grace

	robert and annie wait. she doesn't continue. she rises, 
	reaching for her crutches. robert moves to help.

				  grace
		i got it! i got it!

	she exits into her room. annie looks at him disapprovingly.
