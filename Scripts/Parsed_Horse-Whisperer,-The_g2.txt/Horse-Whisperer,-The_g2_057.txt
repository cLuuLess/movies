	ext. a roadside service station somewhere in utah - day

	an endless sky. an empty ribbon of two-lane highway in utah. 
	a small roadside station. tom's pick-up truck, his horse 
	trailer hitched to it, getting gas.

	tom is on the pay phone. we hear annie's voice:

				  annie (o.s.)
		this is annie maclean.

				  tom
		yeah. hello. this is tom booker. i got a 
		message you called.

	intercut annie in her office:

				  annie
			(efficient, expeditiously)
		oh! yes. thank you for calling back. uh, 
		all right, let me try to explain my 
		situation as briefly as possible... you 
		see, my daughter had an accident with 
		her horse... they were both injured and 
		she, my daughter, she hasn't been able 
		to... fully... uh... it was an extremely 
		traumatic experience... and uh...

	tom, sensing her turmoil, listening compassionately.

				  annie
		i went on the internet and found this 
		article about you... it says you're a horse 
		whisperer, that you... you help people 
		with horse problems. and you have quite a 
		success rate when it comes to traumatized --

				  tom
		well, see, truth is, ma'am, i help horses 
		with people's problems.

				  annie
		well, you know, however you want to put 
		it -- i got your information from the 
		publisher of the article. i called 
		montana and your sister-in-law, i think, 
		gave me this number.
			(trying to be charming)
		i'm been hot on your trail you could say 
		because i was hoping you'd consider 
		coming to new york and taking a look at 
		my daughter's horse and possibly --

				  tom
		ma'am, i'm very sorry about your problems 
		and i appreciate what your daughter must 
		be going through, but i'm afraid you've 
		misunderstood whatever it is you read. i 
		don't do that sort of thing.

				  annie
		well, if you could just come for the day. 
		new york's only a few hours by plane, 
		i'd have you home by dinner...

				  tom
		look, even if it was nearer, that's just 
		not what i do. i give clinics. and i'm 
		not even doing them for a while. i'm 
		heading back to montana right now. i got 
		a ranch to take care of...

				  annie
			(interrupts, abruptly)
		i'll pay you for your fare. i'll send you 
		to montana first class.

				  tom
			(getting impatient)
		ma'am, first class to montana is a waste 
		of good money. now, am i being too polite 
		here or when i say no in utah, does that 
		mean yes in new york city?

	annie is taken aback. tom feels badly.

				  tom
		i, i don't mean to sound insensitive. i 
		understand your situation. but there's 
		nothing i can do. you just called the 
		wrong person, that's all. i hear there 
		are a bunch of therapists in new york. 
		maybe you should call one of them.

				  annie
		mr. booker, if i could just ex --

				  tom
		i am very sorry, ma'am. goodbye now.

	he hangs up before annie can continue.
