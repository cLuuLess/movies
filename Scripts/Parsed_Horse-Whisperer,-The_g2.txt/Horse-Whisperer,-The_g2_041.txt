	int. grace's school - morning

	grace makes her way through the hall. it is the first time 
	she has had to maneuver through a crowd. some of the younger 
	children are especially unconscious. grace sweats her way 
	through, trying to maintain her balance and her sanity.

	as grace slowly moves along, whatever small faith she had 
	that she could get through this day, begins to diminish.
