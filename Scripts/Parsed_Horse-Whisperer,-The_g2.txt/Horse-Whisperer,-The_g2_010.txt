	int. maclean's new york apartment - morning

	dressed in running clothes, annie opens the door and picks up 
	several newspapers that were delivered. she carries them into 
	the kitchen and sets them beside a huge stack of publications, 
	magazines, papers, etc... knowing she must read all of them at 
	some point, she breathes a disgusted sign. she thumbs through 
	the post as she pours herself a cup of coffee. something 
	catches her eyes and she snarls:

				  annie
		that little shit!

	she dials a portable phone and moves through the apartment as 
	she talks:

				  annie
		hi lucy?... did i wake you?... have 
		you read the post?... they've got a 
		little item about me and fiske. he's 
		saying i fired him and that i faked 
		the new circulation figures.. ha, ha... 
		oh, please... it's the last act of a 
		desperate gnome... set up a phone call 
		with don farlow for 9:30...

	throughout the phone call, annie is selecting clothes, 
	turning on the shower, undressing...
