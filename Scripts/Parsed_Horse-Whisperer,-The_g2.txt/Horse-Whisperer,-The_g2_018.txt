	int. annie's office - morning

	annie's office is now crowded with a dozen or so employees; 
	sitting on the couch, on the window sills, on the arms of 
	chairs, against the walls... paper bag emptied of bagels, 
	cream cheese, orange juice, paper plates...

	hand held camera captures the energy of the room as it 
	follows overlapping lines, laughter, etc... yet, no matter how 
	casual it all seems, annie is very much at the center of 
	control... we enter the scene of laughter, as annie asks 
	kevin, a feature writer:

				  annie
		... so what did you say to her?

				  kevin
		i said, thank you very much...
			(laughter, ad libs)
		i really should do the interview... but 
		perhaps if you'd like to have dinner...

	laughter... everyone starts ad libbing...

				  various characters
		dinner!!... he's so cute.... why don't i 
		get those kind of interviews?... look, 
		he has husband number eight written on 
		his forehead...

				  annie
		all right, all right, all right... kevin, 
		good job. write the interview. if i don't 
		like it, you may have to sleep with her 
		for a follow-up!
			(laughter)
		now... i'm thinking about another fashion 
		designer spread... who's news out there?

	characters shout out designer names and comments as the phone 
	rings and lucy picks up... speaking amdist the talking...

				  lucy
		hold on.
			(presses hold)
		gottschalk.

	the room goes dead quiet, instantly. then erupts in laughter 
	as everyone realizes it. annie, however, waves her hand as 
	she takes the phone...

				  annie
		quiet... quiet!

	everyone obeys. annie presses speaker phone.

				  annie
		david?

				  david gottschalk (vo)
		who's there?

				  annie
		everyone. working overtime. just for you.

				  david gottschalk (vo)
		did you speak to farlow?

				  annie
		yes. we're suing.

				  david gottschalk (vo)
		is that absolutely necessary? it'll just 
		make it a bigger story.

				  annie
		david, he signed an agreement that he 
		wouldn't talk to the press and he's 
		libeled me by saying i faked the figures. 
		you're not going soft on me, are you?

	silence. gottschalk doesn't immediately respond. everyone 
	waits. covert looks between characters suggest this is 
	interesting -- has annie over-stepped her bounds with the 
	magazine's owner? annie waits without a shred of anxiety -- 
	even though she might have some. finally:

				  david gottschalk (vo)
		well, i suppose we could use another 
		good public feud...

				  annie
		exactly...

	everyone silently acknowledges annie guts and influence.
