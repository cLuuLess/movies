	int. grace's bedroom in farmhouse - night

	annie opens the door and enters, flicking on the light. 
	camera is on her back, as she places a small suitcase on the 
	bed and opens it. she begins her task with cool efficiency. 
	opening drawers and closets, assessing what should be taken, 
	what isn't necessary.

	suddenly, she stops. she feels disoriented for a moment. she 
	can't remember the last time she was inside this room. she 
	takes a moment to pause and actually look around.

	in the light, we now see more of grace's inner sanctum. horse 
	riding prize ribbons in various colors adorn the walls. 
	books. a girl's bureau cluttered with teenage possession 
	ranging from childhood toys to items that suggest a reaching 
	towards adulthood. annie examines some items, affectionately. 
	a good luck charm from india sits among her things. annie 
	takes it to pack in the suitcase.

	she notices a framed 8x10 of grace sitting proudly atop 
	pilgrim with judith at her heel. she then notices the edge of 
	another picture behind this one, in the frame. she pulls the 
	pilgrim photo out to reveal: an old 8x10 of annie hugging 
	grace as a toddler. with her back to camera, annie remembers:

	memory:
