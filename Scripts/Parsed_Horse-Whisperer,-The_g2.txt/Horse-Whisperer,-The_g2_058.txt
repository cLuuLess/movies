	int. grace's bedroom - night

	annie reaches for grace's bedroom door, then pauses. she 
	realizes she should knock. she does and whispers:

				  annie
		grace?
			(knocks again)
		grace, it's mom.

	annie slowly opens the door. she finds grace's bed empty. she 
	looks over to the window to find grace sitting in a chair, in 
	the dark, looking out the window.

				  annie
		grace. what are you doing?

	not looking up, grace speaks in a hollow voice.

				  grace
		i can't find that charm daddy gave me 
		from india.

				  annie
		i brought it to you in the hospital.

				  grace
		no, you didn't.

				  annie
		grace, i put it on the table near your --

				  grace
			(apathetic)
		doesn't matter.

	beat.

				  annie
		have you decided about pilgrim?

				  grace
		what about him?

				  annie
		well... how you feel all right about 
		telling liz to put him down...

				  grace
		i think we should. it's not fair to let 
		him suffer. he's not much use anymore. 
		he'd hate living like that.

				  annie
		i think that's... very compassionate 
		and... mature way of looking at it.

				  grace
		mom?

				  annie
		yeah?

				  grace
		maybe they should put me down too.

				  annie
		what?

				  grace
		i mean, i'm not much use anymore. why 
		can't they be compassionate to me?

	what frightens annie most is the calm and apathy in grace's 
	voice. she's surrendering... annie, for the first time in a 
	long time, feels she's losing control.
