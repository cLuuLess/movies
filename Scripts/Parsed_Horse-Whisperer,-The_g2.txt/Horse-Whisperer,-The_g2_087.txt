	int. double divide kitchen - continuous - night

	diane is in her bathrobe doing bills at the kitchen table, as 
	she listens to a book of tape. her hand on her forehead, her 
	other hand writing. tom enters to take his hat off the 
	sideboard. he moves to the table and reaches over for a 
	cookie from a plate of cookies. without looking up, diane 
	slaps his hand. tom then pours himself a cup of coffee... then 
	swiftly sneaks his hand back and grabs a cookie. diane smiles. 
	tom exits.

	it is only then that diane looks up after him.
