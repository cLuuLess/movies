ext. commuter train station - morning

the platform is crowded with business commuters.  joel is
among them.
the platform across the tracks from them is empty.  suddenly,
joel turns and makes his way through the crowd.  he climbs
the stairs, crosses the overpass and makes his way to the
empty platform.  an almost empty train pulls into that
platform.  joel gets on the train and watches the business
commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of
the station.
