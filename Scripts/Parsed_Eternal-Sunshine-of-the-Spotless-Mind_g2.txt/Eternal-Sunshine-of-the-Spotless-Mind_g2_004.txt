int. waiting room - day

subtitled: fifty years earlier

every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall,
magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic
seascape paintings on the walls.  the receptionist, mary, 25,
can be seen typing in the reception area.  behind her are
shelves and shelves of medical files.  the door opens and
clementine enters.  she's in her early thirties, zaftig in a
faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt.  she's
decidedly funky and has blue hair.  mary looks up.

		mary
	may i help you?

		clementine
		(approaching reception area)
	yeah, hi, i have a one o'clock with dr.
	mierzwiak.  clementine kruczynski.

		mary
	yes, please have a seat.  he'll be right
	with you.

clementine sits.  she looks tired, maybe hungover.  she picks
up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest.
