int. joel's apartment - night

joel distractedly reads a book, checks the clock, goes back
to the book.  the door opens.  he looks up.  clementine is
staggering in, drunk.

		clementine
	yo ho ho!

		joel
	it's three.

		voice-over
	shit.  the last time i saw you.

		clementine (cont'd)
	anyhoo, sweetie, i done a bad thing.  i
	kinda sorta wrecked your car...

		joel
	i can't believe you wrecked my car.

		joel
	you're driving drunk.  it's pathetic.

		clementine
	...a little.  i was a little tipsy.
	don't call me pathetic.

		joel
	well it is pathetic.  and fucking
	irresponsible.  you could've killed
	somebody.

the scene is starting to degrade.  the acting becomes anemic.

		joel (cont'd)
	i don't know, maybe you did kill
	somebody.

		clementine
	oh christ i didn't kill anybody.  it's
	just a fucking dent.  you're like some
	old lady or something.

		voice-over
	right!  she called me an old lady here,
	too!  and i remember, i said...

		joel (cont'd)
	and what are you like?  a wino?

		clementine
	a wino?  jesus, are you from the fifties?
	a wino!
		(laughs)
	face it, joel.  you're freaked out
	because i was out late without you, and
	in your little wormy brain, you're trying
	to figure out, did she fuck someone
	tonight?

		joel
	no, see, clem, i assume you fucked
	someone tonight.  isn't that how you get
	people to like you?

this shuts clementine up.  she is stung and she starts
gathering up her belongings, which are strewn about the
apartment.  joel is immediately sorry he said this.  he
follows her around.

		joel (cont'd)
	i'm sorry.  okay.  i didn't mean that.  i
	just... i was just... pissed, i guess.

clementine is out the door.  joel follows.
