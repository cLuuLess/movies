int. laboratory - day

joel enters.  mierzwiak stands there with stan in his lab
coat.

		mierzwiak
	ah, mr. barish.  this is stan.  he'll be
	in charge of your procedure tonight.

stan nods professionally.

		stan
	mr. barish.

		joel
	how exactly is this going to work
	tonight?

as mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade,
mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry
and monotonous.

		mierzwiak
	we'll start with your most recent
	memories and go backwards -- there is an
	emotional core to each of our memories --
	as we eradicate this core, it starts its
	degradation process --  by the time you
	wake up in the morning, all memories
	we've targeted will have withered and
	disappeared.  like a dream upon waking.

		joel
	is there any sort of risk of brain
	damage?

		mierzwiak
	well, technically, the procedure itself
	is brain damage, but on a par with a
	night of heavy drinking.  nothing you'll
	miss.

joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment.  suddenly
he gets it.

		joel
	it's happening now!  i'm already in my
	brain.

mierzwiak looks at the fading room.

		mierzwiak
	yes, i suppose you are.
		(back in his faded memory
		 persona)
	so, let's get started -- if we want the
	procedure underway tonight, we have some
	work to do.

joel is sitting in a chair.  electrodes connect him to some
electronic machinery monitored by stan.  mierzwiak watches
from the corner.

		stan
	we use the articles you brought to create
	a map of clementine in your brain.
	tonight while you sleep we'll be able to
	trace the map and erase.

		joel
	but you're tracing and erasing now.  it's
	already started.  i'm home in my bed.

stan pulls a snow globe from one of joel's bags, shows it to
joel.  the equipment registers joel's reaction.

		stan
	very good.

stan pulls out a potato dressed as a vegas showgirl.  joel
studies it.  the machines register his response.

		mierzwiak
	we'll dispose of these mementos when
	we're done here.  that way you won't be
	confused later by their unexplainable
	presence in your home.

stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of clementine
printed on it.  joel looks at the cup.  the machines record
his reaction.

		stan
	good.  we're getting healthy read-outs.

the room, stan, and mierzwiak are now vague and wispy.

		stan's voice
	patrick, do me a favor --

joel is watching stan.  stan is not speaking, yet his voice
continues.

		stan's voice (cont'd)
	-- and check the voltage levels, i'm not
	wiping as clean as i would like here.

joel looks up.  stan's voice seems to be coming from above.
