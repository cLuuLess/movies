ext. beach - later

joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his
lap.  people warm themselves at the fire.  joel watches
couples talking, kissing, rob sharing a joint with a guy.

		joel
	you were down by the surf.  i could just
	make you out in the dark.

joel looks down to the water.  there's clementine, in her
orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea.

		joel (cont'd)
	your back to me.  in that orange
	sweatshirt i would come to know so well
	and even hate eventually.  at the time i
	thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.

		voice-over
	i remember being drawn to you even then.
	i thought, i love this woman because
	she's alone down there looking out at the
	black ocean.

		joel (cont'd)
	but i went back to my food.  the next
	thing i remember, i felt someone sitting
	next to me and i saw the orange sleeve
	out of the corner of my eye.

a shot of the orange sleeve.  joel looks up.

		clementine
	hi there.

		joel
	hi.

		voice-over
	i was so nervous.  what were you doing
	there, i wondered.  your hair was lime
	green.  green revolution.

a shot of her green hair.

		joel
	you said...

		clementine
	i saw you sitting over here.  by
	yourself.  i thought, thank god, someone
	normal, who doesn't know how interact at
	these things either.

		joel
	yeah.  i don't ever know what to say.

		clementine
	i can't tell you how happy i am to hear
	that.  i mean, i don't mean i'm happy
	you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... i'm
	such a loser.  every time i come to a
	party i tell myself i'm going to be
	different and it's always exactly the
	same and then i hate myself after for
	being such a clod.

		joel
	even then i didn't believe you entirely.
	i thought how could you be talking to me
	if you couldn't talk to people?

		voice-over
	but i thought, i don't know, i thought it
	was cool that you were sensitive enough
	to know what i was feeling and that you
	were attracted to it.

		clementine
	but, i don't know, maybe we're the normal
	ones, y'know?  i mean, what kind of
	people do well at this stuff?

		voice-over
	and i just liked you so much.

		clementine (cont'd)
	you did?  you liked me?

		joel
	you know what i did.

		clementine
	yeah, i know.  i'm fishing.

		joel
	you said --

she picks a drumstick off of joel's plate.

		clementine
	i'm clementine.  can i borrow a piece of
	your chicken?

		joel
	and you picked it out of my plate before
	i could answer and it felt so intimate
	like we were already lovers.

		joel (cont'd)
	i remember --

		voice-over
	the grease on your chin in the bonfire
	light.

shot of a smudge of chicken grease on clementine's chin.

		clementine
	oh god, how horrid.

		joel
	i'm joel.

		voice-over
	no, it was lovely.

		clementine (cont'd)
	hi, joel.  so no jokes about my name?

		joel
	you mean, like...
		(singing)
	oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my
	darlin', clementine... ?  huckleberry
	hound?  that sort of thing?

		clementine
	yeah, like that.

		joel
	nope.  no jokes.  my favorite thing when
	i was a kid was my huckleberry hound
	doll.  i think your name is magic.

she smiles.

		clementine
		(eyes welling)
	this is it, joel.  it's gonna be gone
	soon.

		joel
	i know.

		clementine
	what do we do?

		joel
	enjoy it.  say good-bye.

she nods.

joel and clementine are walking near the surf.

		joel (cont'd)
	so you're still on the zoloft?

		voice-over
	next thing i remember we were walking
	down near the surf.

		clementine
	no, i stopped.  i didn't want to feel
	like i was being artificially modulated.

		joel
	i know what you mean.  that's why i
	stopped.

		clementine
	but my sleeping is really fucked up.

		joel
	i don't think i've slept in a year.

		clementine
	you should try xanax.  i mean, it's a
	chemical and all, but it works... and it
	works just having it around, knowing that
	it's there.  like insurance.

		joel
	yeah?

		clementine
	i'll give you a couple.  see what you
	think.

		joel
	okay.

		clementine
	have you ever read any anna akhmatova?

		joel
	i love her.

		clementine
	really?  me, too!  i don't meet people
	who even know who she is and i work in a
	book store.

		joel
	i think she's great.

		clementine
	me too.  there's this poem --

		joel
	did this conversation come before or
	after we saw the house?

		clementine
	i think, before.

		joel
	seems too coincidental that way.

		clementine
	yeah, maybe.

joel and clementine wander near some beach houses closed for
the winter.

		clementine (cont'd)
	do you know her poem that starts "seaside
	gusts of wind,/and a house in which we
	don't live...

		joel
	yeah, yeah.  it goes "perhaps there is
	someone in this world to whom i could
	send all these lines"?

		clementine
	yes!  i love that poem.  it breaks my
	heart.  i'm so excited you know it.
		(pointing to houses)
	look, houses in which we don't live.

joel chuckles appreciatively.

		clementine (cont'd)
	i wish we did.  you married?

		joel
	um, no.

		clementine
	let's move into this neighborhood.

clementine tries one of the doors on a darkened house.  joel
is nervous.

		joel
	i do sort of live with somebody though.

		clementine
	oh.

she walks to the next house, tries the door.

		clementine (cont'd)
	male or female?

		joel
	female.

		clementine
	at least i haven't been barking up the
	wrong tree.

she finds a window that's unlatched.  she lifts it.

		clementine (cont'd)
	cool.

		joel
	what are you doing?

		clementine
	it's freezing out here.

she scrambles in the window.  joel looks around, panicked.

		joel
		(whisper)
	clementine.

		voice-over
	i couldn't believe you did that.  i was
	paralyzed with fear.

the front door opens and clementine stands there beckoning.

		clementine (cont'd)
	c'mon, man.  the water's fine.  nobody's
	coming here tonight, believe me.  this
	place is closed up.  electricity's off.

		joel
	i hesitated for what seemed like forever.

		clementine
	i could see you wanted to come in, joel.

he walks cautiously toward the door.

		clementine (cont'd)
	as soon as you walked in.  i knew i had
	you.  you knew i knew that, right?
