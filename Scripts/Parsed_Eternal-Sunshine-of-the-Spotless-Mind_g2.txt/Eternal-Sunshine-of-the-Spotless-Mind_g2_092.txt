ext. joel's apartment building - night

stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette.  he has an
unobstructed view into joel's bedroom window.  he watches
mierzwiak and mary.  they're talking as howard works.  it
appears to be a very serious discussion.  a car pulls up
outside.  stan turns to see.  a middle-aged woman gets out,
checks the address on joel's building, approaches the only
lit window, watches mierzwiak and mary inside.  mierzwiak's
resolve has apparently weakened and he and mary kiss again.
this time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and
falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious joel.  the
woman in the window is transfixed.  as mierzwiak fumbles to
unzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window.
he practically shrieks and jumps up.
