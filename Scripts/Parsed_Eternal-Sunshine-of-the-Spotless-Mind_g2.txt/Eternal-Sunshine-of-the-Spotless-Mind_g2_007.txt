ext. commuter train station

subtitle: two weeks later

the platform is crowded with business commuters.  joel is
among them.  he is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a
briefcase.  the platform across the tracks from him is empty.
suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd.  he
climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty
platform.  soon an almost empty train pulls up to that
platform.  joel gets on and watches the business commuters
through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the
station.
