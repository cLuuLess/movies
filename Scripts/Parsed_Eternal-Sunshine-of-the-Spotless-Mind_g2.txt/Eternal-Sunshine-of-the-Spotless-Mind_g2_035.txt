int. joel's apartment - night

patrick is checking out the apartment.  stan monitors the
equipment.

		stan
		(uninterested)
	it's an apartment.

		patrick
	not a dump, then, but kind of plain.
	uninspired.  and there's a stale smell.
	sort of stuffy.  i don't know.  stuffy.

		stan
	patrick, let's just get through this.  we
	have a long night ahead of us.

		patrick
	yeah.

patrick returns to the bedside, focuses on the machines for a
moment.  he glances at the unconscious joel.

		patrick (cont'd)
	so who do you think is better-looking, me
	or this guy?

stan glances sideways at patrick.
