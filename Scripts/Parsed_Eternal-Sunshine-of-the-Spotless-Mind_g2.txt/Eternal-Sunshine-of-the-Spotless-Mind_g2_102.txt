clementine wears a generic black dress now.

		joel
	right.  something black though.

		clementine
	i'll buy that.  black's always good.

		joel
	we did talk about naomi.

		clementine
	i said: are you sure?  you seem unsure.

		joel
	i'm sure, i said.

		clementine
	but you weren't.  i could tell.

		joel
	i was so nervous.  i remember i couldn't
	think of anything to say.  there were
	long silences.

there is a long silence.

		joel (cont'd)
	i thought i was foolish.  i thought i'd
	mistaken infatuation for love.  you said:

		clementine
	so what.  infatuation is good, too.

		joel
	and i didn't have an argument.
