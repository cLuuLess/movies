ext. rowboat - day

joel, the size of a ten year old, sits fishing with his
oversized father.  clementine is naked and in the boat, too.
she's reading the play by stephen dixon.

		clementine
	i love this book, joel.  thank you so
	much for telling me about it.

joel is his father.  the father is drunk and sullen.  he
faces away from joel, looks out at the lake.

		father
	don't be like me, son.  don't waste your
	life.  you'll come to a point someday
	where it'll be too late.  you'll be sewn
	into your fate...

		joel
	it was horrifying, seeing my father like
	that.
	there was no hope for me if his life was
	such a failure.  and he saw failure in
	me, too, written in my future.

clementine watches the frightened, confused joel.

		clementine (cont'd)
	joel, you're not sewn in.  he's wrong.

		father
	...and there'll be nowhere to go except
	where you're headed, like a train on a
	track.  inevitable, unalterable.

the scene poops out of existence with a flash of light.
