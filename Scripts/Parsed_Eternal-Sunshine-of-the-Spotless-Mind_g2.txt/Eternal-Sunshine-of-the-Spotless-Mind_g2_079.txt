int. joel's bedroom - night

stan works on trying to get the signal back.  his hair is
combed and he's dressed neatly, looking professional but
still stoned.  mary is pacing nervously to and from the
window, looking out into the night.  she's dressed also, and
she's wearing more make-up now.  her hair is pulled up into
some sort of style.  suddenly she freezes at the window.

		mary
	there he is.  oh my god.  oh my god.  do
	i look okay?

she doesn't say anything.

		mary (cont'd)
	i'm still stoned.  are you?  crap.

she looks in the mirror.

		mary (cont'd)
		(to joel)
	your visine didn't do shit, fella.

the doorbell buzzes.  mary lunges for the door, then calms
herself before opening it.  mierzwiak, holding an equipment
bag, looks surprised.

		mierzwiak
	mary.  what are you doing here?

		stan
	she came to help, howard.

		mary
	i wanted to learn as much about the
	procedure as possible, howard.  i think
	it's important for my job...to help
	comfort the clientele.  you know.

mierzwiak looks from mary to stan, nods, and enters.  mary
closes the door.  mierzwiak crosses to the equipment.

		mierzwiak
	let's get to the bottom of this.  shall
	we?

he sits down in front of the computer and does some fiddling.

		mierzwiak (cont'd)
	odd.

he fiddles some more.  mary looks on, fascinated.

		stan
	i tried that already.

		mierzwiak
	did you try going through c-gate?

		stan
	yeah.  of course.

mierzwiak ponders.  he unzips his equipment bag, pulls out
another laptop computer and plugs it in to the system.

		mierzwiak
	i'm going to do a spectrum search
	throughout his memory, see if anything
	comes up.

mierzwiak presses some more buttons.  the program starts up.
a much more complex and detailed human brain appears on this
screen.  it rotates.  eventually mierzwiak sees a small
distant light in the brain.  he zeroes in on it.

		mierzwiak (cont'd)
	okay, here it is.  i don't know why it's
	off the map like that, but --
