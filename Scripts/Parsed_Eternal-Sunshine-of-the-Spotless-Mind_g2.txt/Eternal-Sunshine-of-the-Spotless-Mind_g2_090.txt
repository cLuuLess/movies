ext. suburban street - day

joel is one of a group of five year olds.  he holds a hammer
and is poised to hit a dead bird in a red wagon.  the other
boys are goading him.

		boys
	c'mon, joel, you have to.  do it already.

joel doesn't want to.  clementine watches.

		joel
	i can't.  i have to go home.  i'll do it
	later.

		voice-over
	i didn't want to do this.  but i had to
	or they would've called me a girl.

joel miserably smashes the bird repeatedly with the hammer.
red jelly guts cover the hammer and the wagon bottom.  the
kids hoot.

		voice-over
	i can't believe i did that.  i'm so
	ashamed.

a live bird watches from a tree.  clementine, still dressed
for her birthday dinner (wearing her new bracelet), pulls
joel away from the other boys.  the two of them walk down
joel's suburban street.

		clementine
	it's okay.  you were a little kid.
		(beat)
	this is a great birthday present.
	getting to see you as a boy.

she kisses him and they walk holding hands.

		joel
		(pointing)
	that's where i live.  lived.

joel looks down at her hand.  it's fading.  the bracelet is
gone.  clementine is gone.  his childhood house is gone.
