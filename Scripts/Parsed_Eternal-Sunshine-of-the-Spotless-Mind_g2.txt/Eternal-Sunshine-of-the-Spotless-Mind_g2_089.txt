int. restaurant - night

joel and clementine are laughing as she blows out the candle
on a slice of cheesecake in front of her.  joel hands her a
small wrapped box.

		joel
	happy birthday.

		clementine
		(unwrapping the gift)
	thanks, joely.  a present!  oh boy!

she pulls out the bracelet.  it's the same bracelet patrick
gave her.

		clementine (cont'd)
	oh, joel.  it's beautiful!
		(slip it on)
	i mean, you're the first guy who ever
	bought me a piece of jewelry i could
	honestly say that about.

he notices she's starting to fade.

		joel
	i scoured the city for it.

		clementine
	i love it!

she leans across the table to kiss him.  he grabs her and
runs through the decaying scene and into the vague night.
