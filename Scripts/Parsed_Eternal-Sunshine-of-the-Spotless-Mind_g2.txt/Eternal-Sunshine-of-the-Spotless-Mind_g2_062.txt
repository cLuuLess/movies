int. clementine's apartment - night

candles are lit.  joel and clementine are under a blanket on
the living room rug listening to music.

		clementine
	joely...

		joel
	yeah, tangerine?

		clementine
	do you know the velveteen rabbit?

		joel
	no.

		clementine
	it's my favorite book.  since i was a
	kid.  it's about these toys.  there's
	this part where the skin horse tells the
	rabbit what it means to be real.
		(crying)
	i can't believe i'm crying already.  he
	says, "it takes a long time.  that's why
	it doesn't often happen to people who
	break easily or have sharp edges, or who
	have to be carefully kept.  generally by
	the time you are real, most of your hair
	has been loved off, and your eyes drop
	out and you get loose in the joints and
	very shabby.  but these things don't
	matter at all, because once you are real
	you can't be ugly, except to people who
	don't understand."

she's weeping.  joel is stroking her hair.  they kiss and
begin to make love under the blanket.  it's sweet and gentle
and then it starts to fade.

		joel
		(screaming)
	no!  jesus, no!

he looks down and clementine's tear-streaked face is fading.
she continues as if she's still being made love to, even
though joel is completely beside himself.  he jumps up naked
and yells at the ceiling.

		joel (cont'd)
	please!  please!  i've changed my mind!
		(looks down at fading
		 clementine, then at ceiling)
	i don't want this.  wake me up!  stop the
	procedure!  plea --
