int. tube -day

the woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a
line of chairs shooting through a glass tube.  the other
chairs are peopled with commuters.  we stay with the woman as
she and the others travel over new york city in the tube.
there are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the
skyline.  the woman glances at the manuscript in her lap.
it's called:

eternal sunshine of the spotless mind

this serves as the movie's opening title.  the other credits
follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes.
their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank.
