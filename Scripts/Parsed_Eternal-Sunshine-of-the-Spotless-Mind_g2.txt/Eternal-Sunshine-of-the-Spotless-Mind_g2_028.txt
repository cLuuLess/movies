int. joel's apartment - night

joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas.  his eyes are closed
and electrodes connect his head to several machines.  the
machines are operated by stan, now in grubby street clothes
and in need of a shave, and by patrick, dressed similarly.
the monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light
blips running like streams through an image of joel's brain.
stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the
lines.  patrick (who we saw earlier with clementine at the
bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines.

		patrick
	the voltage looks fine.

		stan
	then check the connections.

patrick fiddles with some jacks.

		patrick
	does that help?

		stan
	yeah, that looks better.  thanks.
