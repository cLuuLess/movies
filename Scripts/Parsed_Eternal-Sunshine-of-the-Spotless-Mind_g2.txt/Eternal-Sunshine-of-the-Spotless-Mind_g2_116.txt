int. joel's bedroom - night

the lights are off.  joel sits on a chair near the window,
writing in his journal.  the streetlight illuminates the
paper.  naomi sleeps in the bed.

		voice-over
	i met someone tonight at a party on the
	beach.  her name is clementine.  there is
	something alive about her.

naomi turns over in bed, sees joel.

		naomi
		(full of sleep)
	hi.

		joel
	hi.

		naomi
	how was it?

		joel
	you didn't miss much.  rob carrie say
	hello.

		naomi
	hi, rob and carrie.

		joel
	go back to sleep.

the room is starting to decompose.

		naomi
	yeah.  come to bed.  i'm cold.

		joel
	in a minute.

naomi turns over.  joel goes back to his writing.

		voice-over
		(more and more emotionless)
	i don't know what to do about this.  i've
	been feeling so alienated and numb
	lately.  forever.  the thought of not
	acknowledging my feelings again seems
	self-destructive.
	how can i continue on this path toward a
	living death, a life filled with
	obligation and guilt and responsibility
	but joyless, hopeless?  i need to speak
	with clementine.

the scene has turned to a husk.
