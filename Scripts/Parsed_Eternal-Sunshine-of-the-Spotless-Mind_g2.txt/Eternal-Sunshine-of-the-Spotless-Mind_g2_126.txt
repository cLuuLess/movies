int. car - night

joel sits in the back seat, rob and carrie are in the front.

		carrie
	did you have fun?

joel nods glumly.

carrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as joel
studies the faded husks of memories, piled like refuse
outside the moving car window.  he sees dried-out version of
previous interactions with clementine playing out in loops.
he looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the
beach with rob and carrie.  it, too, is decaying.  soon all
has crumbled into dust.  everything goes black.
