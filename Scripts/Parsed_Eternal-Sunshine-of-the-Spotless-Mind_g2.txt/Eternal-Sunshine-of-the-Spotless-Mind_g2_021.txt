int. joel's apartment - night

joel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the
lights, crosses to look furtively out the window.  it's
snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam
of a streetlight.

		joel
	it was snowing.

		voice-over
	there are two of them.  couldn't make
	them out.  the orange glow of a
	cigarette.

joel squints to see inside the van.  two dark figures talk.
one sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily
illuminates the interior.  the figure in the driver seat
rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to joel.

		joel
	the driver waved.  so casual, friendly.

		voice-over
	i'm like a joke to them.

joel pulls away from the window, his face blanched.

		voice-over
	i guess they figure they can act like
	they want.  they don't have to worry
	about me remembering.

he paces, mulling things over.  as he does, the scene starts
to change, almost as if it is drying out.

		joel
	i might be making a mistake.

		voice-over
	maybe i'm making a mistake.  maybe i just
	need to learn to live with this.  first
	of all, i'll get over it.  secondly, it
	happened.  those who do not remember
	history are condemned to repeat it.  who
	said that?  churchill?  i'm not sure.
	but i don't care.  she did it to me.  i
	have to rid myself of this.  fuck her.

		joel
	fuck you, clementine.

the colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague.
even joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his
emotional intensity becoming diffused.  joel does not seem
aware of this.  he stops pacing, takes a small vial from his
pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm.  he looks at it.
it's pink.  there's some illegible initials stamped on it.

		joel (cont'd)
	pink.
		(beat)
	there was a number on it.  i remember.
	al 1718?
		(beat)
	i have to follow through with this.  i
	have no choice.

		voice-over
	the pill was pink, i remember.  it had
	some letters and numbers on it.  what
	were they?  al 1718?  al something.  four
	digits.  i don't like taking pills when i
	don't know what they are.  i have no
	choice.

he swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his
clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store
packaging.  he sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone.

		joel (cont'd)
	we're sorry, the number you have
	dialed...
		(beat)
	screw you, clementine, for doing this ...

		recorded voice
	we're sorry, the number you have dialed
	is no longer in service.  if you think
	you have reached this recording in error
	-

		joel (cont'd)
	bye.

joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed.  by now the
scene is lifeless, almost a husk.  he hears the apartment
building door open.  he hears footsteps.

		joel (cont'd)
	it's them.

		voice-over
	it's too late.

his eyelids are getting heavy.  he closes his eyes.

black.

he hears a key in his apartment door.

		joel (cont'd)
	fuck.
