int. chinese restaurant - night

joel and clementine eat dinner in silence.  joel looks around
at other couples in the restaurant.  some seem happy and
engaged.  others seem bored with each other.  he turns back
to his food.

		joel
	how's the chicken?

		voice-over
	is that like us?  are we just bored with
	each other?

		clementine
	good.

he watches her as she downs her wine and pours herself
another glass.  she holds the wine bottle up to joel.

		clementine (cont'd)
	more?

		joel
	no.  thanks.

there's a silence.

		clementine
	how's the fish?

the scene is fading.

		joel
	it's good.

they continue to eat in silence as the scene dissolves.

		patrick's voice
	hi, clementine! -- why, what's wrong? --
	oh, i'm sorry. -- well, i'm not sure, i
	kind of have to study for my test --
