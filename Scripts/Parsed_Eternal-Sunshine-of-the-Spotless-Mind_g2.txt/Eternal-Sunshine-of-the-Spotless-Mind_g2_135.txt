int. mierzwiak's ofice - continuous

mierzwiak dials his phone and waits.  he hangs up.  mary
enters with the papers.

		mary
	i need this signed, howard.

he takes it, unable to make eye contact.  he signs it, hands
it back.

		mary (cont'd)
	thanks.
		(beat)
	so... do we talk about this... or what?

		mierzwiak
	i don't know what i'm supposed say, mary.
	i want to do the right thing here.

		mary
	do you love me?  did you love me?
	something.  i listened to my tape.  i
	can't believe i've been sitting right in
	front of it for a year.  it's like
	listening to someone else's story.  i
	mean, i hear myself talking about having
	sex with you and i can't even imagine you
	naked.  i can't even say "naked" to you!

		mierzwiak
	i have a family, mary.

		mary
	you made me have an abortion.

		mierzwiak
	it was a mutual decision.

		mary
	you made me have you erased!  i loved
	you.  i love you!  how could you --

		mierzwiak
	i didn't make you.  you thought it best.
		(off her stare)
	but, look, i take full responsibility.

she looks at him for a long while.  then, out of frustration,
she screams.
