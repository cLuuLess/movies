int. mary's apartment - day

mary opens the door.  stan stands there with two cups of take
out coffee.

		mary
	oh.

		stan
	hi.

		mary
	what do you want, stan?

		stan
	can i... i brought some --

she steps aside for stan to enter.  he does, looks around,
sees the tapes and the stuffed envelopes on the floor.

		stan (cont'd)
	what's this?

		mary
	nothing.

		stan
	i know what it is.

		mary
	then why did you ask me?

		stan
	i don't know.  i just -- there are a lot
	of really confused people showing up at
	the office.

		mary
	they have a right to know.  howard is a
	thief.  he steals the truth.
		(suddenly weeping)
	i can't remember my baby!  i can't
	remember my baby.  it existed and i can't
	even remember.  do you understand that?

stan doesn't know what to say.  he stands there dumbly.  mary
slumps into a ball on a chair.

		stan
	mary, people come to him voluntarily.

		mary
	i won't allow it.  those who cannot
	remember the past are condemned to repeat
	it.  what do you think of that?  that's
	from my quote book.

		stan
	the office is filled with people who want
	their memories re-erased.

		mary
		(hysterically)
	remember the alamo!  remember the alamo!

		stan
	mary... please.  this is hurting people.

long pause, then:

		mary
		(small)
	i don't want to hurt people.
		(breaking down)
	but these things happened!  all these
	little sadnesses, the big ones.  what if
	no one remembers?  what does that do to
	the world?
		(beat, quietly)
	someone has to remember, stan.

they look at each other.
