int. joel's car - night

joel drives past vague local landmark.

		carrie's voice
	think about it: to be told you lived an
	existence of which you have no
	recollection.

		joel's voice
	but what am i supposed to do?

		carrie's voice
	move on, sweetie.

		joel's voice
	how can i?  how can i move on when i know
	i'm the only one to carry this love we
	had?  how do i do that?
