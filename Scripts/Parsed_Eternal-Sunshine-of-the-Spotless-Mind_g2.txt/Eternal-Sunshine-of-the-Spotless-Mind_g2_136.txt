int. restaurant - night

joel sits across from naomi.

		naomi
		(oddly cautious)
	so... you haven't been involved with
	anyone in all this time?

		joel
	it's been a pretty lonely couple of
	years.

		naomi
	i'm sorry.

		joel
	well, it was my fault -- the break-up.
	i'm sorry.

		naomi
	oh, sweetie.  it really does cut both
	ways.  we were taking each other for
	granted and --

		joel
	i miss you.

		naomi
	miss you, too.
		(awkward pause)
	i have been seeing someone for a little
	while.

		joel
		(trying for enthusiasm)
	oh!  great.  that's great!

		naomi
	a religion instructor at columbia.  a
	good guy.  he's a good guy.

		joel
	i'm sorry.  i really shouldn't have --

		naomi
	i'm glad you called.
