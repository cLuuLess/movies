int. vague space

an old man and the second old woman eat breakfast.

		second old woman (clementine) (v.o.)
	-- i said something like we should go
	upstate and see the leaves change...

the old man looks up from his cereal and stares blankly.  the
woman smiles, but there is no response... just a dead stare.

		second old woman (clementine) (v.o.)
		(cont'd)
	he just stared at me as if i didn't
	exist.  as if i had never existed...
