int. joel's car - night

joel drives fast, recklessly.  the intensity is back.  he's
weeping as he drives.

		joel
	gotta get home.  how could she do this to
	me?
	how could she not care about what we
	meant to each other.  what a fuck!  what
	a fucking monster she is!

		voice-over
	oh, god.  i miss her.  i can't believe
	she's with that guy now!  i'm never going
	to see her again.  i love her so much.
	what a fucking monster she is!

the scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment
building, and gets out of the car.  joel spots the parked
van.  we've seen this before, but it's dried out now.

		joel
	them.
