int. lab room - day

the memory is becoming vague, characters' affects flat.  stan
pulls out a pile of loose-leaf pages.  mierzwiak smiles.

	ah, your journal.  this will be
	invaluable.

	december 15th, 2004.  i met someone
	tonight.  oh, christ:  i don't know what
	to do.  her name is clementine and she's
	amazing.  so alive and spontaneous and
	passionate and sensitive.  things with
	naomi and i have been stagnant for so
	long.

the scene is just a shell of itself as stan rattles on.

		stan's voice
	i think we got this one.  let's push on.

joel looks up at the ceiling.
