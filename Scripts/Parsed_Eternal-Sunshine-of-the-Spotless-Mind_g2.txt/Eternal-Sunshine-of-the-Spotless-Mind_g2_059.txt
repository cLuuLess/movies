int. joel's bedroom - night

it's dark.  joel and clementine are in bed.  the memory is
already in the midst of being erased.  clementine is talking
in a monotonous, robotic manner.

		clementine
	you don't tell me things, joel.  i'm an
	open book.  i tell you everything.  every
	damn embarrassing thing.  you don't trust
	me.

		joel
	no, it isn't that.

		clementine
	i want to know you.

		joel
	i just don't have anything very
	interesting about my life.

		clementine
	joel, you're a liar.

the scene is faded completely now and joel just lies there
for a moment, registering clementine's statement.
