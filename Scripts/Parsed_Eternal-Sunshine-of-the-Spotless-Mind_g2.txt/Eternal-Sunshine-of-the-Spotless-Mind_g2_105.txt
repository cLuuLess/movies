int. lacuna reception area - night

mary enters the dark room, frazzled.  she flips on the
fluorescent lights and searches the file folders, finds one
with her name on it.  her jaw drops.  with a shaky hand, she
puts the tape into the player on her desk and presses "play."

		mierzwiak voice
	okay, so just tell me what you remember.
	and we'll take it from there.

		mary's voice
		(shaky)
	um, i liked you immediately.  at the job
	interview.  you seemed so... important
	and mature.  and i loved that you were
	helping all these people.  you didn't
	come on to me at all.  i liked that.  i
	was tongue-tied around you at first.  i
	wanted you to think i was smart.  you
	were so nice.  i loved the way you
	smelled.  i couldn't wait to come to
	work.  i had these fantasies of us being
	married and having kids and just...
		(starts to cry)
	...and so... then... when...
	that one day, when i thought you looked
	at me back... like... oh, howie, i can't
	do this?  how can i do this?

		mierzwiak voice
	it's what's best, mary.  you know that.

mary slumps to the floor.  we move into her eyes.

		mary's voice
	yeah, i know.  oh, god.  okay, well, i
	was so excited...

a series of murky images.  no detail.

a flirtatious look from mierzwiak.

		mary's voice (cont'd)
	...remember you bought me that little
	wind-up frog?

a vague shot of a wind-up frog.

		mary's voice (cont'd)
	and you said...

a vague shot of mierzwiak mouthing to mary's voice.

		mary's voice (cont'd)
	"this is for your desk.  just a little
	token"

back to mary sitting on the floor, listening to the tape.

		mary's voice (cont'd)
	i knew then... i knew something was going
	to happen... something wonderful.
