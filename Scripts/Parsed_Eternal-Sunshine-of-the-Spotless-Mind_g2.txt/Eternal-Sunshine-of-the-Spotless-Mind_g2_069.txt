int. clementine's apartment - night

patrick reads the journal.

		clementine's voice
	... and we made love right on the ice.
	it was absolutely freezing on my ass!  it
	was wonderful.

clementine enters, dressed for the cold.  patrick puts the
notebook away.

		clementine
	i'm so excited.  yay!

		patrick
	i'm excited, too.  oh, and i wanted to
	give you this.  it's a little... thing.

patrick pulls the bracelet from his pocket, hands it to her.

		patrick (cont'd)
	i didn't have a chance to wrap it.

		clementine
	it's gorgeous.
		(slipping it on)
	just my taste.  i've never  gone out with
	a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry i
	liked.
		(kisses him)
	thanks.  so let's get going.  long drive.
