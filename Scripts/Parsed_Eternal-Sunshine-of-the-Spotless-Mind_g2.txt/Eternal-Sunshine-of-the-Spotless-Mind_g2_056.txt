ext. zoo - day

joel and clementine walk around unhappily.  they barely look
at the animals.  clementine watches parents with babies.

		joel
	oh shit.  i remember this.
		(to clementine)
	want to go?

		clementine
		(pissy)
	i want to have a baby.

		joel
	let's talk about it later.

		clementine
	no.  i want to have a baby.  i have to
	have a baby.

		joel
	i don't think we're ready.

		clementine
	you're not ready.

		joel
	clementine, do you really think you could
	take care of a kid?

she turns violently toward him, glaring.

		clementine
	what?!

		joel
		(mumbly)
	i don't want to talk about this here.

		clementine
	joel, we're fucking gonna talk about it!

joel looks around.  people are watching.

		clementine (cont'd)
	you can't fucking say something like that
	and say you don't want to talk about it!

		joel
	clem, i'm sorry.  i shouldn't have --

		clementine
		(screaming now)
	i'd make a fucking good mother!  i love
	children!  i'm creative and smart and i'd
	make a fucking good mother!

the scene starts to fade.  clementine's rant continues but
becomes attenuated and vague.

		joel
	oh, thank god.  it's going.

		clementine
	it's you!  it's you who can't commit to
	anything!  you have no idea how lucky you
	are i'm interested in you!  i don't even
	know why i am!  i should just end it
	right here, joel.  leave you in the zoo.
	maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang
	out with!

she's crying now, but it's almost animatronic, no real
emotion in it.  the scene is a husk.

		joel
	it's going, clementine.  all the crap and
	hurt and disappointment.  it's all being
	wiped away.

she looks up at him.

		clementine
	i'm glad.

their eyes lock.  she is fading before his eyes.

		joel
	me, too.
