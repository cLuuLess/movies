int. car - moments later

joel drives.  he passes clementine walking.  she looks cold.
he considers, slows, rolls down his window.

		joel
	hi.  i could give you a ride if you need.

		clementine
	no, that's okay.  thanks, though.

		joel
	you're sure?  it's cold.

		clementine
	i don't want to take you out of your way.

		joel
	it's okay.

		clementine
	yeah?

he pulls over.  she climbs in.  they drive.

		joel
	where do you live?

		clementine
	you're not a stalker or anything, right?

		joel
	well, i probably wouldn't say if i were,
	but no.

		clementine
	you can't be too careful.  i've been
	stalked.  i've been told i'm highly
	stalkable.  i don't need that.

		joel
	i'm not a stalker.

		clementine
		(beat)
	you know wilmont?

		joel
	yeah.

		clementine
	wilmont.  near the high school.

joel turns.  they drive in silence.

		clementine (cont'd)
	look, i'm very sorry i came off sort of
	nutso.  i'm not really.

		joel
	it's okay.  i didn't think you were.

there's a silence.

		clementine
	so you like bookstores, huh?

		joel
	i like to read.

		clementine
	me too.  it is rain dogs, by the way.

		joel
	yeah?  i can't remember that album very
	well.  i remember liking it.  but --

		clementine
	the song's 9th and hennepin.  i spent
	most of the train ride trying to
	remember.  "till you're full of rag water
	and bitters and blue ruin/and you spill
	out/over the side to anyone who'll
	listen."  remember?

		joel
	sort of, um...

		clementine
	remember?  "and you take on the dreams of
	the ones who have slept there/and i'm
	lost in the window/i hide on the
	stairway/i hang in the curtain/i sleep in
	your hat..."
		(starts to cry)
	oh, shit.  i'm so stupid.  sorry.

		joel
	what?

		clementine
	i'm just a bit of a wreck.  "i sleep in
	your hat" makes me cry.
		(pointing to a house)
	me.

joel pulls over.

		clementine (cont'd)
	thanks very much.  that was very nice of
	you.

		joel
	well, i wouldn't want to be --

		clementine
	oh, geez, i'm full of shit.  i already
	told you that.
		(pause)
	anyway.  see ya.

clementine opens the car door.

		joel
	take care.

		clementine
		(turning back)
	hey, do you want to have a drink?  i have
	lots of drinks.  and i could --

		joel
	um --

		clementine
	never mind.  sorry, that was stupid.  i'm
	embarrassed.  good night, joel.
