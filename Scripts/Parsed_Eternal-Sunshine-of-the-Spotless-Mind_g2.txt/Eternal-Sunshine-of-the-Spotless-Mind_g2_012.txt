ext. montauk train station platform - late afternoon

joel sits on the bench waiting for a train.  clementine
enters the platform, sees joel, the only other person there.
she waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if
they're old friends.  he waves back, embarrassed.  she takes
a seat on a bench far down the platform.  joel stares at his
hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to
conceal his awkwardness.
