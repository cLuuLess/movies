int. joel's apartment - continuous

joel hangs up.  he dials the phone.

		joel
	it's true.

		clementine's voice
	i know.  i spoke to my friend magda.

joel is immersed in the several page document.

		joel
	look, i have to go.  i have to think.

		clementine's voice
	joel, we've fucked.  we've made love.
	like a million times.  and we were so
	sweet and shy and inept with each other
	last night.  isn't that lovely?

joel doesn't know what to say as this registers.  he just
stands there dumbly.

		clementine's voice (cont'd)
	come over here, sweetheart.  please.
