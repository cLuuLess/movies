ext. parking structure - early morning

stan pulls the van into space marked "lacuna."  he gets out,
crosses to his car.  mary is sitting on the hood.

		stan
	hey.

		mary
		(beat)
	do you swear you didn't know?

		stan
	i swear.

		mary
	and you never even suspected?  never saw
	us behaving in any unusual way together?

		stan
	once, maybe.

she watches him closely, waiting for him to continue.

		stan (cont'd)
	it was here.  at his car.  i was coming
	back from a job and spotted you together.
	you seemed caught.  i waved.  you
	giggled.

		mary
	how did i look?

		stan
		(beat)
	happy.  happy with a secret.

mary starts to cry.

		mary
	and after that?

		stan
	i never saw you together like that again.
	so i figured i was imagining things.

mary says nothing.

		stan (cont'd)
	i really like you, mary.  you know that.

		mary
	do you remember anything else?  what i
	was wearing?  was i standing close to
	him?  was i leaning against his car like
	i owned it?  how did he look at me when i
	giggled?  tell me everything.

		stan
		(thinking)
	you were in red.  that red sweater with
	the little flowers, i think.  you were
	leaning against his car.
		(thinking)
	he looked a little like a kid.  kind of
	goofy and wide-eyed.  i'd never seen him
	look like that before.  happy.  you
	looked beautiful.  you looked in love.

		mary
		(heading toward the levator)
	thanks, stan.

she stops but doesn't turn to face him.

		mary (cont'd)
	you're nice.
		(beat)
	but i love him.  i knew i loved him.  now
	i know.

he nods.  she waves, heads to the elevator.
