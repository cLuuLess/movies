int. kitchen - day

the kitchen is dated and vague.  joel and clementine are in
an oversized playpen; they're adults but small.  joel wears
footsie pajamas with some vague little animals on them.  he
holds a a red furry huckleberry hound doll.  clementine is
still in her panties and bra.  an oversized woman in high
heels, seen from a low angle, hurries back and forth
preparing dinner.

		clementine
	jesus.  what's this?

joel looks around at the kitchen, at his doll, at the woman.

		joel
	i must be about two.
		(oddly)
	i want my mommy.  she's busy.  she's not
	looking at me.
		(back to himself, re: doll)
	look, my huckleberry hound doll!  i told
	you about this!
		(beat)
	i want my mommy!

he starts to cry.  clementine tries to comfort him.  she hugs
him.

		joel (cont'd)
		(crying still)
	i want my mommy.
		(adult, to clementine)
	i don't want to lose you, clem.

		clementine
	i'm right here.

		joel
	i'm scared.  i want my mommy.  i don't
	want to lose you.  i don't want to
	lose...

		clementine
	joel, joely, look... it's not fading.
	the memory.  i think we're hidden.

joel sucks in some snot.  his mother scurries back and forth
clanging pots.  the room is not decaying.  joel smiles.
