int. joel's bedroom - early morning

howard watches the monitor.  the last specks of light are
fading.  it grows dark.  he is tired, his eyes are hollow.
he turns to stan, who is staring out the window at the dawn.

		howard
	okay.

stan turns and wordlessly begins the clean-up.  he pulls the
electrodes off of joel's scalp, coils cable, packs bags.
howard dials the bedside phone.  he waits as it rings.

		hollis's voice
	hi, you've reached the mierzwiaks.  we
	can't come to --

howard hangs up.
