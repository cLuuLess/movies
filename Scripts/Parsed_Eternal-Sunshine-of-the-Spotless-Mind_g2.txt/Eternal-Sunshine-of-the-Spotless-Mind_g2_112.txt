ext. park - day

joel walks with naomi.

		naomi
	so what's going on, joel?

		joel
	i don't know, i've just been thinking,
	maybe we're not happy with each other.

		naomi
	what?

		joel
	y'know, we've been, i don't know, sort
	of, unhappy with each other and --

		naomi
	don't say "we" when you mean "you."

		joel
	i think maybe, we're both so used to
	operating at this level that -- how can
	one person be unhappy?  if one person is
	unhappy, both have to be... by
	definition.

		naomi
	bullshit.  who is it?  you met someone.

		joel
	no.  i just need some space, maybe.

		naomi
	the thing is, joel, whatever it is you
	think you have with this chick, once the
	thrill wears off, you're just going to be
	joel with the same fucking problems.

		joel
	it's not somebody else.

		voice-over
	i hate myself.

naomi walks off.  joel watches her.  the scene fades.
