clementine steps out onto it.  joel follows nervously.

		clementine
	don't worry.  it's really solid this time
	of year.

		joel
	i don't know.

she takes his hand and he is suddenly imbued with confidence.

		joel (cont'd)
	this is so beautiful.

she squeezes his hand.

		clementine
	isn't it?

she runs and slides on the ice.  joel is by himself now.

		joel
	i don't know.  what if it breaks?

		clementine
	what if?

clementine lies on her back and stares up at the stars.  joel
is paralyzed.  he looks back at the shore.

		joel
	i think i should go back.

		clementine
	joel, come here.  please.

he hesitates then gingerly makes his way over to her.  she
reaches for his hand and gently pulls him down.  he lies on
his back beside her, their bodies touching.  he wants to turn
to her, but out of shyness, doesn't.  she holds his hand.
they look up at the stars.  she smiles, doesn't say anything
and snuggles closer to him.

		joel
	listen, did you want to make love?

		clementine
	make love?

		joel
	have sex.  y'know --

		clementine
	oh, um...

		joel
	because i just am not drunk enough or
	stoned enough to make that happen right
	now.

		clementine
	that's okay.  i --

		joel
	i'm sorry.  i just wanted to say that.
	this seems like the perfect romantic
	exotic place to do it and --

		clementine
	hey, joel --

		joel
	-- and i'm just too nervous around you
	right now.

		clementine
	i'm nervous, too.

		joel
	yeah?  i wouldn't have thought that.

		clementine
	well, you obviously don't know me.

		joel
	i'm nervous because i have and enormous
	crush on you.

she smiles up at the sky.

		clementine
	show me which constellations you know.

we see people going to their mailboxes, finding manila
envelopes.  one by one they open the envelopes and pull out
tapes.  we see stunned, confused, disbelieving reactions as
people listen to their tapes.
