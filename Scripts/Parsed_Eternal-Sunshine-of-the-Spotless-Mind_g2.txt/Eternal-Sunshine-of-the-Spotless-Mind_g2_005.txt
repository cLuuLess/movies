mary pads down the hallway.  she knocks on a closed door.

		mierzwiak (o.s.)
	yes?

mary opens the door, peeks in.  howard mierzwiak, 40's,
professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers.

		mary
	howard, your one o'clock.

		mierzwiak
		(not looking up)
	thanks, mary.  you can bring her in.

she smiles and nods.  it's clear she's in love.  it's equally
clear that mierzwiak doesn't have a clue.  mary turns to
leave.

		mierzwiak (cont'd)
		(looking up)
	mary...

		mary
		(turning back)
	yes?

		mierzwiak
	order me a pastrami for after?

		mary
	cole slaw, ice tea?

		mierzwiak
		(nodding)
	thanks.

		mary
	welcome, howard.

she smiles and heads down the hall.  stan, 30's, tall,
spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway.

		stan
	boo.

		mary
	hi.

she glances back nervously at mierzwiak's open door.

		stan
	barely seen you all morning, kiddo.

he leans in to kiss her.  she cranes her neck to keep him
off.

		mary
		(reprimanding whisper)
	stan... c'mon...

		stan
	sorry.  i just --

		mary
		(somewhat guiltilly)
	it's just...y'know... i mean...

		stan
	i know.  anyway --

		mary
	anyway, i've got to do my tap
	dance here.

she indicates the door to the reception area.  stan nods.

		stan
	see you later, alligator.

		mary
	'kay.

		stan
	hey, if you're ordering lunch for
	mierzwiak, would you --

		mary
	i better do this, stan.

stan nods again and mary opens the door to the waiting room.

		mary (cont'd)
	ms. kruczynski?

		clementine (o.s.)
	hi.

after a moment, clementine appears in the doorway.  mary
leads her down the hall, not looking back.

		mary
		(professionally courteous)
	how are you today?

		clementine
	okay, i guess.

		mary
		(at mierzwiak's office)
	here we are.

mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk.

		mierzwiak
	ms. kruczynski, please come in.

clementine enters the office.  mary smiles at mierzwiak and
closes the door, leaving them alone.
