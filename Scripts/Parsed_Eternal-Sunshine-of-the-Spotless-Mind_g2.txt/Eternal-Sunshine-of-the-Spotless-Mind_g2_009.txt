ext. beach - day

joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase.  he
passes an old man with a metal detector.  they nod at each
other.

later: joel looks out at the ocean.

later: joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook.  he
opens it and writes with a gloved hand.

	january 13th, 2006.  today i skipped work
	and took the train out to montauk.
		(thinks)
	it's cold.
		(thinks some more)
	the sky is gray.
		(thinks some more)
	i don't know what else to say.  nothing
	happens.  nothing changes.  i saw naomi
	last night.  we had sex.  it was weird to
	fall into our old familiar sex life so
	easily.  like no time has passed.  after
	two years apart suddenly we're talking
	about getting together again.  i guess
	that's good.

he has no other thoughts.  he glances up, spots a female
figure in the distance, walking in his direction.  she stands
out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded
sweatshirt.  it's clementine.  he watches her for a bit, then
as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least
pretends to.  once she passed, he watches her walk away.  she
stops and stares out at the ocean.  joel writes.

		joel (v.o.) (cont'd)
	if i'm constitutionally incapable of
	making eye-contact with a woman i don't
	know.  i guess i'd better get back to
	naomi.

later: joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the
season.  he peeks cautiously in a dark window.

later: joel digs into the sand with a stick.
