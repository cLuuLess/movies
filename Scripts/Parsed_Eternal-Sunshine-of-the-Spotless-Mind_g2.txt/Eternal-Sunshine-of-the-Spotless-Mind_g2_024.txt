ext. new york street - day

joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff.
he's been crying.  he looks behind him and finds himself
looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on
the snowy street.  he turns back to the new york street and
spots the address he was looking for: 610 11th avenue.
