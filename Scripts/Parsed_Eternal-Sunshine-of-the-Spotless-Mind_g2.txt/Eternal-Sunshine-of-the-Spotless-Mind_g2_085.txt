ext. schoolyard - afternoon

joel, now the size of a junior high school kid and dressed
accordingly, is peering around the corner of the school
building toward the bike rack.  clementine is with him,
dressed as she was in the parked car.

		clementine
	look at you, cutey!  what are we doing?

		joel
	this kid, joe early, is going to beat the
	shit out of me.

		voice-over
	i'm terrified.  i thought if i hung
	around the art room long enough, he'd go
	home and i could get my bike.

they head toward the bike rack.  joel's is the only bike
remaining.

		clementine (cont'd)
	poor joel.

they're at the bike rack and a bunch of kids, including
giant, fat joe early come around the corner.

		joe early
	hi, jill.

		joel
	he calls me jill.  everyone calls me jill
	after this.

the other kids laughs.

		joel
	just shut up, joe.  i'm going home.

		joe early
	i don't think so.  we're fighting.

		joel
	i don't want to fight you.

the kids start chanting, "fight, fight, fight..."  joe early
throws a wild punch that hits joel in the side.  joel falls
and stays down, covering himself.

		joe early
	c'mon, jill.  get up, faggot.  c'mon.

joel doesn't say anything.  he peeks humiliated at
clementine.  she's watching him.  she's got a tear in her
eye.  she kneels down beside him, puts her arm around him.

		joel
	i'm too scared to even throw a punch.
	when i tell people this story i leave
	that part out.

the scene flashes violently to white and is gone.
