int. diner - day

it's a local tourist place, but off-season empty.  joel sits
in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of
tomato soup.  an elderly couple drink coffee at the counter.
clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood.  joel
glances at her bright blue hair.  she picks an empty booth
and sits.  joel studies her discreetly.  the waitress
approaches her with a coffee pot.

		waitress
	coffee?

		clementine
	god, yes.  you've saved my life!

the waitress pours the coffee.

		waitress
	you know what you want yet?

		clementine
		(laughing)
	ain't that the question of the century.

the waitress is not amused.

		clementine (cont'd)
	you got grilled cheese and tomato soup?

		waitress
	yeah.  we're having a run on it.

the waitress heads to the grill.  clementine fishes in her
bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment,
pours something in, then brings the cup back up.

		clementine
		(calling)
	and some cream, please.

clementine looks around the place.  her eyes meet joel's
before he is able to look away.  she smiles vaguely.  he
looks embarrassed, then down at his journal.  clementine
pulls a book from her purse and starts to read.  joel glances
up, tries to see the cover.  it's blue.  he can't read the
title.
