int. clementine's car - night

it's a rust bucket.  clementine drives through the snow.
she's crying and holding patrick's hand.

		clementine
	what's wrong with me?

		patrick
	nothing is wrong with you.  you're the
	most wonderful person i've ever met.

she glances gratefully over at him then starts to cry even
harder.
