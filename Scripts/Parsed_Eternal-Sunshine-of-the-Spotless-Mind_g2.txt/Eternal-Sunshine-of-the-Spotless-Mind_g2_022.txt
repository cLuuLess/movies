int. bookstore - night

joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop.  it's a jarring
transition, visually and emotionally.  joel is in the midst
of some traumatic state of mind.
he fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches
clementine stack books on shelves.  her hair is bright orange
now.

		joel
	i should maybe talk to you.

		voice-over
	clementine.  i should just maybe talk to
	her.

joel rises and heads toward clementine.

		joel
	i love you and if you knew that... if i
	told you what happened...  i'll explain
	everything, what we meant to each other.
	i'll tell you everything about our time
	together.  you'll know everything again
	and...

		voice-over
	maybe if i just explain what happened, i
	wouldn't have to go through this and i
	could tell you everything and it would be
	like you knew and we could rebuild and we
	could be happy again and...

right before joel gets there, patrick, a skinny young man
approaches clementine.  joel stops, watches.  the young man
seems out of breath.  he glances over at joel, then taps
clementine on the shoulder.  she turns, annoyed, sees who it
is and her face lights up.

		joel
	clementine.

		voice-over
	that's your look for me.

clementine giggles, stands and pokes patrick playfully in the
ribs.

		patrick
	i just thought i'd say hi.  i was in the
	neighborhood.

		clementine
	you were not.

		patrick
	i was not.

joel is mesmerized by their familiarity.  as he stands there,
the scene starts to dry out.
clementine and patrick continue their flirtation but it's
turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines.  the
bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy.

		clementine
	come over after i'm done here?

		patrick
	i can't.  i want to, but i have to study.

		clementine
	you rat.

		patrick
	i really want to, but tonight's
	important.  test tomorrow.

		joel
	how could she have done this to me?  how
	could anyone do this to anyone?

		clementine
		(to patrick)
	you didn't say anything about my hair.

		patrick
	it's so cool.  you're by far the most
	sensational person in the room.

		clementine
	in the room?

		patrick
	in the world.

joel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he
realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd.

		joel
	what's happening here?
		(looks at watch; it's 9:30)
	oh, god!  i have to go home.  they'll be
	there soon.

joel turns to leave.
