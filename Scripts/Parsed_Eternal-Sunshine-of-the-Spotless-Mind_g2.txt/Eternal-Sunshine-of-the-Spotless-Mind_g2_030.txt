int. joel's apartment - day

joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large
plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with
clementine.  there are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some
potatoes dressed as women, some clothing clementine has left
there, some cd's.  he pulls a big clump of pages out of his
loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag.

he gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes:

december 15, 2004   nothing much happened today.  i stayed
home.  naomi worked on her dissertation.

the scene is fading as he continues to write.
