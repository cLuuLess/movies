int. joel's apartment - a few minutes later

joel enters with his mail.  he opens a manila envelope, reads
the enclosed file, sticks the cassette tape in his stereo,
listens.  joel dials the phone.

		clementine's voice
	yeah?

		joel
	did you send this?  is it a joke?

		clementine's voice
	i probably got the same thing as you.

		joel
	i mean, i haven't even told anyone i've
	met you.  who would even know to do this?

		clementine's voice
		(matter of fact)
	maybe it's true then.  it's my voice on
	the tape.

		joel
	that's what you have to say?  how could
	it be true?  i never even heard of any
	procedure like this.  it's a joke.

		clementine
	maybe.  call someone who'd know.

montage

we see the people we saw opening envelopes, now on the phone.
we hear over and over:  "is this true?", "did this really
happen?", "do i know you?", "is it true?"
