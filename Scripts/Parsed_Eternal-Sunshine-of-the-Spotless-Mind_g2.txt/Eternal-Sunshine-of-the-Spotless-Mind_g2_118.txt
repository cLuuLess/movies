int. rob and carrie's car - night

rob drives.  carrie fiddles with the radio dial in the front
passenger seat.  joel sits in the back.

		carrie
	i'm sorry naomi couldn't make it.  you
	okay?  you seem quiet.

		joel
	just a little overworked, maybe.

		voice-over
	the trip to the party where i met
	clementine.  my first memory of her is
	now my last memory of her.

joel looks out the window.  carrie turns around and says
something to joel.  she is backlit, her hair a halo of frizz.

		joel
	i remember you turned around.  your face
	was dark and your hair was backlit -- i
	could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me
	if things were okay between naomi and me.

		carrie
	i did.  you said, things were fine.

		joel
	i remember.

		carrie
	this is the night you met clementine,
	joel.  i remember watching you walk down
	the beach with her and i thought, oh
	shit.

		joel
	yeah, you told me that later.

		carrie
	i told you that later.

joel looks out he window.  he sees the husk of a memory on
the darkened roadside.  it's joel and carrie in:
