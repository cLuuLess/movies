int. joel's bedroom - night

stan and mary lie on the floor, their stoned minds wandering
after sex.  stan suddenly perks up.  he looks at the monitor.

		stan
	it's stopped.

		mary
	what?

		stan
	listen, it's not erasing.

he makes his way, naked, to the computer screen.

		stan (cont'd)
	it's not erasing.  he's off the screen.

		mary
	where?

		stan
	i don't know.  he's not on the map.

stan tries to break through his marijuana haze.  he fiddles
nervously with the equipment.

		stan (cont'd)
	i don't know what to do!  i don't know
	what to do!  crap.  crap...

		mary
	well, what should we do?

		stan
	i don't know!  i just said that!

		mary
	sor-ry
		(beat)
	we have to do something.  he can't wake
	up half done.

		stan
	shit!

he jerks the joystick spastically.  mary, also naked, gets up
and looks over his shoulder at the screen.

		mary
		(definitely)
	we should call howard.

stan turns and looks at her.  he's stoned and trying to
understand her motivation.

		stan
	no way.  i can handle this.

		mary
	this guy's only half cooked.  there's no
	time to fuck around, stan.

stan tries to think.  he paces.  mary watches him.  finally:

		stan
		(without making eye contact)
	okay.

he dials the phone, waits.

		stan (cont'd)
	hello, howard?
