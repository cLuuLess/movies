int. joel's apartment - night

joel is unconscious on the bed, completely still.  mary and
stan watch the monitor and smoke a joint.  after a silence:

		mary
	it's amazing, isn't it?  such a gift
	howard gave the world.

		stan
		(a sigh)
	yeah.

		mary
	to let people begin again.  it's
	beautiful.  you look at a baby and it's
	so fresh, so clean, so free.  and
	adults... they're like this messy tangle
	of anger and phobias and sadness...
	hopelessness.  and howard just makes it
	go away.

		stan
	you love him, don't you?

mary seems surprised, taken aback, caught.  she is silent for
a long moment.

		mary
	no.
		(beat)
	besides, howard's married, stan.  he's a
	very serious and ethical man.  i'm not
	going to tempt him to betray all he
	believes in.

stan takes another drag on the joint, passes it to mary.
