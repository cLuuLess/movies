int. joel's apartment - night

joel enters, drops his overcoat on a chair, dials the phone.

		joel
	hi, naomi, it's joel.

		naomi's voice
	hi.

		joel
	how's it going?

		naomi's voice
	good.  i called you at work today.  they
	said you were home sick.

		joel
	i know.  i had to take the day to think.

		naomi's voice
	yeah, i tried you at home.  did you get
	my message?

		joel
	i just got in.

		naomi's voice
	long day thinking.

joel flips on messages with volume down.

		joel
	yeah, i suppose so.

		naomi on machine
		(cheerful)
	hi.  they told me you were sick!  so...
	where are you?!  i had a really nice time
	last night.  just wanted to say hi, so...
	hi.  call me.  i'm home.  call me!

		naomi's voice
	that's me.

		joel
	there you are.
		(pause)
	naomi, it's just... i'm afraid if we fall
	back into this fast without considering
	the problems we had...

		naomi
	okay, joel.  i suppose you're right.

		joel
	i had a good time last night.  i really
	did.

		naomi
	so i'm going to get some sleep.  i'm glad
	you're okay.

		joel
	we'll speak soon.

		naomi
	'night.

she hangs up and joel stands there for a minute feeling
creepy, then he dials the number on a piece of paper.

		clementine's voice
	what took you so long?

		joel
	i just walked in.

		clementine's voice
	hmmm.  do you miss me?

		joel
	oddly enough, i do.

		clementine's voice
	ha ha!  you said, i do.  i guess that
	means we're married.

		joel
	i guess so.

		clementine's voice
