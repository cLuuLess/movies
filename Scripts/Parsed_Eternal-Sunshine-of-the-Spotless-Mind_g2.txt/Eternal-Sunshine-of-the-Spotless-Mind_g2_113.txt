int. border's bookstore - night

joel enters, looks around.  there's no sign of clementine.
joel approaches a male employee.

		joel
	is there a clementine who works here?

		male employee #1
		(calling to another male
		 employee)
	mark, is clem on tonight?

		male employee #2
	on my dick, bro.
		(turns, sese joel, embarrassed)
	oh, hey.  yeah, i think she's upstairs in
	philosophy.

joel climbs stairs, searches the aisle, spots clementine.

		joel
	hi.

she turns.

		clementine
	i didn't think you'd show your face
	around me again.  i figured you were
	humiliated.  you did run away, after all.

		joel
	sorry to track you down like this.  i'm
	not a stalker.  but i needed to see you.

		clementine
		(seemingly uninterested)
	yeah?

		joel
	i'd like to... take you out or something.

		clementine
	well, you're married.

		joel
	not yet.  not married.

		clementine
	look, man, i'm telling you right off the
	bat, i'm high maintenance.  so i'm not
	going to tiptoe around your marriage or
	whatever it is you got going there.  if
	you want to be with me, you're with me.

		joel
	okay.

		clementine
	so make your domestic decisions and maybe
	we'll talk again.

she goes back to stacking.  joel stands there helplessly.

		joel
	i just think that you have some kind
	of... quality that seems really important
	to me.

the scene is disintegrating.  clementine's speech is
delivered without passion.

		clementine
	joel, i'm not a concept.  i want you to
	just keep that in your head.  too many
	guys think i'm a concept or i complete
	them or i'm going to make them alive, but
	i'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking
	for my own peace of mind.  don't assign
	me yours.

		joel
	i remember that speech really well.

		clementine
		(smiling)
	i had you pegged, didn't i?

		joel
	you had the whole human race pegged.

		clementine
	probably.

		joel
	i still thought you were going to save
	me.  even after that.

		clementine
	i know.

		joel
	it would be different, if we could just
	give it another go around.

		clementine
	remember me.  try your best.  maybe we
	can.

the scene is gone.
