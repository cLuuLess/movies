int. old man's office - a few minutes later

old howard works at his desk.  old mary enters with the
second old woman.

		old woman (mary)
	dr. mierzwiak, this is clementine
	kruczynski.  she'd like to talk to you.

old howard and the old mary eye each other.

		old man (howard)
	hello, ms. kruczynski.  nice to meet you.
	please have a seat.

he indicates a sitting area.  she sits.  he joins her.

		old man (howard) (cont'd)
	would you mind if i tape our discussion?

she shakes her hear.  he punches a couple of buttons on his
computer console.  a tape recorder starts up and his computer
screen lights up so only he can see it.  on it we see a whole
file on clementine kruczynski: a list of fifteen dates of
previous erasures stretching back fifty years, all of them
involving joel barish.

		old man (howard) (cont'd)
	so, why don't you begin by telling me why
	you've come here.

		second old woman (clementine)
	well, i met this man, joel, three years
	ago at a senior dance...  we'd both been
	alone for so long and...
