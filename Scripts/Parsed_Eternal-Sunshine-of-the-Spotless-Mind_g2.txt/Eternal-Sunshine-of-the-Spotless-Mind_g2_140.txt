int. mary's apartment - morning

mary gets out of bed.  she has been crying all night.  she's
a wreck.  she puts on some coffee then crosses into the
living room area.  sitting there are piles of the files from
work.  she pulls the top one out, copies the name and address
onto an envelope stuffs the file and tape cassette in.  she
pulls another file out.  this one has joel's name on it.  she
copies it onto an envelope.
