int. waiting room - day

joel sits in the small room with his bags.  a woman across
from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap.  her
eyes are red from crying.  mary, the receptionist, pokes her
head through her window into the waiting room.

		mary
	hello again, mr. barish.  good, you've
	got your stuff.
