int. kitchen - day

joel and clementine are in the playpen.  joel's oversized
mother reaches down as she hurries by and pats joel on the
head.

		mother
	how's my baby boy?

she's gone.

		joel
	i really want her to pick me up.  it's
	weird how strong that desire is.

clementine holds his hand.  he looks over at her.

		clementine
	you know, we're okay.  they're not
	finding us.  you'll remember me in the
	morning.  and you'll come to me and tell
	me about us and we'll start over.

		joel
	i loved you so much this day.  on my bed
	in your panties.  i remember i thought,
	how impossibly lucky am i to have you on
	my bed in your panties.

she kisses him.

		clementine
	you remember what happened next?

		joel
	i came over to the bed and you smelled so
	good, like you just woke up, slightly
	sweaty.  and i climbed on the bed with
	you and you said something like --

		clementine
	-- another rainy day.  whatever shall we
	do?

he laughs.  she unbuttons his pajamas.  they begin to make
love.  joel's mother hurries around the kitchen.  joel stops,
looks at clementine.

		joel
	there's this guy!

		clementine
	what?

		joel
	there's this guy.  i heard him talking in
	my apartment.  he's one of the eraser
	guys.  and he fell for you when they were
	erasing you, so he introduced himself the
	next day as if he were a stranger and now
	you're dating him.

		clementine
	really?  is he cute?

		joel
	he stole a pair of your panties while you
	were being erased!

		clementine
	gross! you must remember to tell me this
	in the morning.  i'm, like, so freaked
	out now.
