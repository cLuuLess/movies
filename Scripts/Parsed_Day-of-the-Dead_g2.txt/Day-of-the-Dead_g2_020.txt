20	ext. the private dock - day

miguel's rifle is in his right hand. his left hand clings to the 
frame of an open window on his side of the shed. there's a sudden, 
startling music sting and, with it, a zombie appears inside the open 
window. grotesque and drooling dark saliva, its hungry mouth lunges 
at miguel's left arm. its teeth tear a large strip of flesh out of 
the arm six inches above the wrist.

miguel screams. he pulls away from the creature, his terrified eyes 
staring at the bleeding wound. a zombie bite means infection and 
almost certain death.

the zombie leans out through the open window, its hands clawing the 
air trying to reach miguel. sarah pulls a giant .45 from her holster 
belt. bullamn! bullamn! bullamn! she fires three rapid shots.

the skull of the zombie indents in front like a hard-boiled egg shell 
that's been whacked with a spoon bowl. blackened blood and brain 
matter flies out of the back where the bullets exit. the creature 
falls, destroyed.
