146	int. the gymnasium - night

the guards are trying to close the entrance doors manually. the big 
slabs won't budge. suddenly gasparilla appears. drawing a pistol from 
a holster he wears, without warning he shoots one of the guards. the 
other guard flees.

gasparilla falls onto the dead man and rips off his orange-circle 
vest. the zombies are pressing in now, into the gymnasium. gasparilla 
and several remaining party-goers (none with vests) are trapped.
