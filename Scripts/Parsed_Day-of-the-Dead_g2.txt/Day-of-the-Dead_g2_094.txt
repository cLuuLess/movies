94	int. the hospital - night

john, sarah and lukey are facing out across the compound. a teeming 
tropical rain has started to fall.

john
this just ain't your day, is it, darlin' 
sarah.

sarah can't help but snicker. suddenly her head spins exhaustion is 
conquering her body as last. john puts a big arm around her.

john
three more minutes. then you can sleep. you 
gotta stay with it for three more minutes.

mcdermott joins them and the group moves out into the rain. lukey 
waddles back through the maze of cots.

logan, spider and diesel have moved to about the center of the big 
room. the patients around them, their eyes bulging, look like lemurs.

logan
how do we know she's alright? how do we 
know?

the same intonation again. this guy's wrapping is definitely coming 
loose.

the zombie rises up behind logan's back. it's the woman whose wrist 
lukey checked earlier. its teeth are dripping with drool, its hands 
reaching out wantingly.

logan turns around. calmly, but with the swiftness of a rattlesnake, 
he shoots out the hand that's holding the scalpel. the blade sinks 
deeply into the zombie's forehead. logan pulls it out and strikes 
again, and again, and again, like a swordsman thrusting, thrusting, 
thrusting. finally the creature collapses. logan wipes the scalpel on 
his already blood-covered apron. rain water drops onto him from holes 
in the roof above. he doesn't seem to notice.
