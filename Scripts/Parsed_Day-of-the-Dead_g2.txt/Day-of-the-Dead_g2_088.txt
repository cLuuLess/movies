88	ext. entrance number six - night

hatchway number six is surrounded by protective fencing and, from it, 
a fenced alleyway runs off through the brush toward...we don't know 
what yet.

the hatch opens and toby, along with two other prisoners, also 
disarmed troopers, is led down that alleyway by three guards.

john, sarah and bill mcdermott peer out from nearby foliage. they 
watch the procession. john whispers.

john
the fences make a safe pathway to stalag 
seventeen. that's where we live. that's 
where you gonna live, too. hell's half 
acre. it's not a nice place. them boys 
there is prisoners. what's their 
punishment? they sent out to the stalag for 
a few weeks. that's punishment enough.

spider seems to appear from nowhere. she motions and the others 
follow her through the thick jungle.
