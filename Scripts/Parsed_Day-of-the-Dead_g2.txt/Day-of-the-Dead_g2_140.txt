140	int. the main chamber of the cave - night

rhodes and eight troopers turn a corridor and there, before them, is 
a sight out of dracula's tomb. moving through the lava-stone arches, 
between the giant earthen pillars, is the army of blue and white 
zombies. rhodes and his men can't possibly fight them, there are too 
many. rhodes spots a door with a caged red light overhead. they can 
get to it by slicing through only a few of the advancing ghouls.

rhodes
this way. over here! shoot! shoot them! 
shoot to kill! in the head!

their rifles blaze as they drive through the edge of the zombie 
horde. several of the creatures go down, their heads blasted open by 
rapid-fire rounds.

one grabs rhodes by the sleeve of his jacket. the captain turns on 
his heels and stares at the thing with outraged disbelief. he raises 
his magnum and pumps two quick shells into the creature's brain.

the platoon finally reaches the door. rhodes holds it open while his 
men run inside. he holsters his pistol and unslings his automatic. 
the zombies press towards him. he selects a few of the closest ones, 
aims, and fires, with a look of enjoyment on his face. for a moment 
he resembles doc logan, madness bristling inside him.

the zombies fall, their heads shattered, one of rhodes' men calls 
from inside the doorway.

trooper
captain...captain!

rhodes fires another quick burst, then he turns and moves through the 
doorway.
