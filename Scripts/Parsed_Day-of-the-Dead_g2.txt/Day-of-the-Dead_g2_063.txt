63	ext. the jungle near the clearing - day

chico is still alive. he fumbles for his holstered pistol but before 
he can draw it three troopers are on top of him. tricks tromps a boot 
on his hand. toby tyler aims his rifle squarely at his sweating brow.

chico
yes...yes, do it...please...you can't let 
me die this way...please. destroy me. a 
bullet...in the head...i don't want to 
become...one of...one of them.

toby looks down at the man, at his terrible wounds, clearly fatal 
ones. toby clicks a shell into the firing chamber of his rifle. his 
finger is just sliding under the trigger shield when captain rhodes 
strides up behind him.

rhodes
take his weapon, tyler.

toby is startled by the voice at his back. he turns towards the 
captain, then he looks back down at the guerillero, hesitating..

rhodes
take his gun, ass hole. he still has the 
strength to pull a trigger.

reluctantly toby obeys, reaches down for chico's pistol.

chico
please...senor...destroy me...one 
bullet...please.
	
rhodes
maybe. we'll have a little talk first. 
then....maybe...i can help you out. string 
him up.

the third soldier reaches down and grabs the wounded guerillero under 
the arms. tricks stoops to help. chico screams in agony when he is 
moved. toby lunges in to help the others, thinking to ease the man's 
pain.

rhodes
they can handle it, tyler. you've been 
buckin' for a shit detail lately so here's 
one you're gonna love. we've got two dead. 
cut the heads off and get the bodies 
underground to the refrigerators. fast. 
it's a hot day.

toby grimaces but doesn't speak. he turns and moves briskly towards 
the clearing. rhodes watches him go.
