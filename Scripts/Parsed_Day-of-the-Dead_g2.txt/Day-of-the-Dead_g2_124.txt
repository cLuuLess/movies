124	int. entrance seven - night

julie grant has been rope-tied to an eyelet in the wall. diesel sets 
down a pistol and a box of ammo beside doc logan who is sitting on 
the floor beside the control booth. he's having trouble catching his 
breath. his wound has turned his entire front red.

diesel
you'd hold us back. we have to go on.

logan
hmmmmmm? oh, yes. go on.

spider, her shirt buttoned again over her new dressings, is carefully 
signing something. diesel reads her fingers.

diesel
maps. yes. she was supposed to bring us 
maps.

jack steps over to julie. he frisks her pockets and finds two hand-
drawn maps showing complete layouts of the cave.

diesel
alright. let's go.

they move out, diesel supporting spider, jack with his rifle ready.
