159	ext. the backwater - night

the soldiers aboard the fishing boat hear noises coming from the 
surrounding jungle.

soldier
who is it? who's out there?

john (o.s.)
we want the boat! drop yer guns or we'll 
blast you!

the soldiers hesitate, looking around at the dark jungle.

toby (o.s.)
we got you surrounded!

a sudden burst of automatic fire lights up the black foliage. the 
soldiers react, flinging their weapons over the side into the water.

the refugees spill out of the undergrowth and scramble over to the 
boat, lifting the children and the wounded tricks on board carefully.

john pauses to look back into the jungle.

john
damn you, island. damn you ta hell and 
worse!

mcdermott
we ain't outa here yet. get yer ass movin' 
ya dumb bastard.

mcdermott tries to slug from his flask, finds it empty. with a shrug 
he tosses the thing into the backwater. the engine starts as john 
climbs aboard, sarah and toby giving him their hands.
