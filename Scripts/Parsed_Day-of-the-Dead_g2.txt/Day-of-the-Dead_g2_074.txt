74	ext. the jungle - evening

sarah, sweating, exhausted, bleeding from cuts made by jungle 
branches, wrings out a piece of cloth torn from her sleeve. she has 
dipped it into a jungle stream. cautiously she tastes the water, 
decides to chance it and squeezes the cloth into her mouth.

the night birds suddenly stop their singing and the quiet makes sarah 
look up. standing across the stream, only ten feet away, is a 
particularly grotesque zombie. vultures stand on the marshy ground 
beside the creature's legs, their sharp beaks picking bloody holes in 
its ankles and feet.

sarah jumps to her feet, fighting back exhaustion one more time. she 
unslings her rifle, aims it, then thinks better of firing. grabbing 
up her supply pack she runs into the darkening jungle.
