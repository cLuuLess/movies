45	ext. the cave entrance - day

as we cut in closer we see that the three slumped figures are 
zombies. they are wearing khakis and they are armed with rifles and 
pistol belts. their helmets have been painted an identifying bright 
red and they wear slipover vests dyed the same bright colour.

all the others in the platoon are humans. they, too, wear vests but 
theirs are not red but white, with large orange circles emblazoned 
front and back. two of the men wield long electric cattle prods for 
use should the zombies misbehave, but the creatures, amazingly, are 
shambling along with the rest of the platoon voluntarily, co-
operatively, even somewhat excitedly....the kind of excitement seen 
in a puppy that's just learned a new trick.
