32	ext. gasparilla's island (est.) - day

it looks like a tropical paradise. greatly separated from the other 
smaller islands on the horizon, its vegetation is dense and lush. 
there's no sign that civilisation ever invaded the place, no power 
lines, no buildings. what meets the eye is all natural and inviting.

the fishing boat chugs into a tidewater basin on the afternoon side 
of the island.
