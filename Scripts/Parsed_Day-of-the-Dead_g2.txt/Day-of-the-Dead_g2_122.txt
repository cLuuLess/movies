122	int. entrance number two - night

a circular light blinks green with a buzzing sound. the two inside 
guards punch up a video monitor. the screen shows toby tyler and 
lukey holding pistols on sally and bill mcdermott.

guard

toby (filter)
(on video) let us in. there's been a 
revolt...at stalag seventeen...there's 
rebels crawlin' everywhere!

guard #2
i know him. that's tyler.

toby (filter)
(on video) fer chrissake! lemme in, dammit! 
lemme in!

the first guard hits a button and the big steel entrance door swings 
open. the rebels storm in like an ocean wave taking the hapless 
guards completely by surprise. they knock them unconscious and take 
their weapons. toby pushes a button which causes the outer door to 
swing shut, then he leads the band down the corridor.

they go through a door about a hundred yards from the entrance.
