51	ext. the clearing - day

the man in command of the platoon is obvious, strutting around while 
others do the dirty work. this is captain rhodes. he's 
conscienceless, the low of the low, and a weasely-looking guy, to 
boot. he watches the operation almost hoping for trouble. (he loves 
to torture disobedient zombies.)

behind him, their automatics ready, are several troopers especially 
assigned to protect the captain. one of these troopers is toby tyler, 
a good guy. toby is revulsed by the scene in the clearing. he drops 
his head, almost gagging. rhodes notices.

rhodes
you'll get used to this, tyler. it's the 
only way. they don't bite the hand that 
feeds.
	
toby looks up. he can't conceal his contempt for the captain. rhodes 
reads it in his eyes and is about to say something when a sound 
distracts him.

one of the rag-tag zombies is running amok. the zappers poke at the 
creature but that just makes it angrier.

rhodes
get that thing away from the others!
bring it here!

one trooper has a long pole with a wire noose on the end. he drops 
the noose over the wild zombie's head and the wire tightens, biting 
into the dead flesh on the thing's neck. the pole is long enough to 
control the creature while keeping it out of reach.
