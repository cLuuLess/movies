26	ext. the private dock - day

chico is still busy returning fire. bullets whiz through the air 
around his head. one knicks him on the shoulder, a superficial but 
painful wound.

chico
jesus christ! get up here, woman! get the 
hell up here!

sarah has no choice but to help in the fight. she lays miguel as 
gently as she can on his back. he's gone into deep shock, shivering 
violently. rubbing tears away from her eyes, sarah jumps to her feet, 
takes up a post and begins to fire at the attackers.

the attackers are grinning like old-fashioned pirates as their guns 
chew up the dock. suddenly, just behind the trawler, we see a flash 
of colour speeding by...

it's the fishing boat! the wounded maria is steering. tony is 
standing on the prow with his rifle firing... 
rattatattatattatattatatt!!!!

one of the attackers is hit from behind. his back turns solid red and 
he pitches forwards, falling between the boat and the dock into the 
water below.

the other attacker (#1) turns and fires in response. tony is hit in 
the stomach. he falls to his knees and grabs the side of the boat but 
he keeps firing.

the attacker pivots against a mast. for a moment he doesn't realise 
that his neck has been ripped open by a line of bullets. he tries to 
scream. can't. a plume of red shoot out of his mouth. then he 
realises. he realises that he's a dead man. he falls.

maria
tony....tony....

tony
pull in! get the others.

tony is clutching at his bleeding belly as maria, in pain from her 
own wound, circles the boat towards the edge of the dock.
