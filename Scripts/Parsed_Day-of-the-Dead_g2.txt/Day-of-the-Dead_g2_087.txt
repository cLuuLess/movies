87	int. the residence - night

mary moves down a corridor with numbered doors on both sides. we hear 
the sound of life, music blasting, voices laughing, arguing, crying. 
people move by. a man and a woman are fighting. she slaps him, he 
punches her, she kicks him in the balls. three hookers pound on a 
door. the door is opened by a naked man wearing a dildo on his nose. 
other men, behind him, laugh wildly as the hookers enter their smoke-
filled room.

mary stops in her tracks when she sees that outside a door numbered 
83 (the door to her quarters) there are two of rhodes' soldiers with 
rifles in hand. the door itself is open and shadows move inside.

mary turns quickly, before she is spotted, and starts back through 
the hallway. as she turns a corner she is grabbed by toby tyler.

mary
toby...thank god...wait here. i gotta find 
out what's goin' on.

toby
hey. slow down. what is it?

mary
some of rhodes' men. at the door.

toby
that bastard. i didn't think he'd make his 
move so fast.

mary
it's because of me.

toby
oh, bullshit, mary. it's because rhodes is 
a prick.

mary
i want you to leave. then maybe...

toby
we're both gonna leave. leave the island. 
i've been talkin' to tricks. we think we 
can smuggle out one of those inflatable 
rafts. they're crated up real small. 
they've got air canisters. there's food 
inside. even a little motor.

mary
i am not...a guerilla fighter, toby. i'm 
not a pioneer. i'm not...i'm not strong 
that way. i need...

toby
need what? civilised order like we have 
down here? christ!

mary
i can work here. maybe my work can 
help...help everyone. i can do more good 
with access to this equipment than i can 
off in some wasteland.

toby
for the good of mankind. that's what every 
monster-maker says.

mary looks into toby's eyes. she's hurt, yet angry. the kind of anger 
that comes involuntarily when somebody strikes an already sensitive 
guilt-nerve.

toby
we're gettin' out. me and tricks. i want 
you to come with us. i want that more than 
anything. i'll send word. i'll let you know 
a time and a place to meet. we probably 
won't be able to wait around so if you're 
not there on the dot...well...if you're not 
there, i'll know you're not comin'.

she grabs him, holding him tightly against her. they kiss, hard and 
long. toby pulls away, looks at her lovingly, then turns and starts 
toward the guarded apartment. mary follows.

toby
(walking) i don't know what they're gonna 
do to me. i figure they'll just send me out 
to stalag seventeen but if...if it's worse 
than that...tricks will know. stay in touch 
with tricks.

as they approach the door to number 83, the soldiers there raise 
their rifle to ready positions.

soldier
you tyler?

toby
yes.

soldier
you're under arrest. i'll take your weapon.

toby hands over his rifle and begins to unbuckle his pistol belt. two 
more soldiers appear from inside the open apartment.

mary
what's he supposed to have done? what are 
the charges?

soldier
dunno, ma'm. we're on orders.

mary
look...i'm mary henried. i'm with the 
special conditioning center. i'm not 
without influence...

toby
(calmly) mary.

mary
i'll have somebody's ass for this. i'll 
have your ass, soldier. i'm not gonna stand 
here and...

toby
(more insistent) mary!

she gives up. she looks into toby's eyes.

toby
i'll be alright. just remember the things i 
said. take care of yourself.

the soldiers escort toby down the hall without force. mary watches 
their backs for a time, then she flings her books and papers angrily 
into the open apartment. she begins to cry.
