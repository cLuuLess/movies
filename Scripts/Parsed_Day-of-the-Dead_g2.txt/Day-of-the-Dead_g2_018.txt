18	ext. the private dock - day

miguel, sarah and chico react to the gunfire. they draw their weapons 
and look for cover.

they are at the far end of the dock, their backs to the sea. there is 
a work shed nearby. bullets whiz past them as they charge towards the 
wooden structure. they make it there safely and they begin to return 
fire. a gun battle ensues between the two groups.
