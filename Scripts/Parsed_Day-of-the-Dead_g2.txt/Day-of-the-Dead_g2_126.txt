126	int. the communications room - night

the rebels, all wearing gas masks, burst into the room. toby moves 
right toward an intercom. he punches in a code and waits while the 
intercom buzzes.

toby
come on, mary. answer. answer!

nothing. toby punches up another code while the others drag the 
unconscious guard out of the doorway, letting the doors shut behind 
them. a voice comes over the speakers.

tricks (o.s. - filter)
yeah.

toby
tricks, it's tyler. we're inside.

tricks (o.s. - filter)
what? was that you that set off the alarms?

toby
no. there's some loonies from outside. 
they're gonna try to blow the powder 
magazine.

tricks (o.s. - filter)
where are you? what's the plan?

toby
find mary. if you can get help do it. we're 
gonna hit the power station and haul-ass 
outa here. we'll be at exit five...that's 
exit five in exactly ten minutes.

tricks (o.s. - filter)
i think i can get a couple guys.

toby
and mary! you gotta find mary!

tricks (o.s. - filter)
i'll try, tob. i'm gone.

tricks clicks off. toby levels his automatic at the radio console and 
fires. sparks fly, chunks of wood and metal shoot off in every 
direction.

mcdermott
hold on! hold on! yer wastin' yer 
ammunition. hit 'er in here...then around 
back in the circuit boards.

toby levels off again, this time at the "kill-zones". bullets fly. 
more sparks dance as the unit breaks apart.

mcdermott
(shouting) and over here. the alarm 
systems. these central panels here. these 
circuits.

sarah and sally step up and start blasting. a profusion of sparks 
this time as the alarm systems seem to explode.

suddenly a collection of red lights start blinking urgently. a bell 
sounds. the large rectangle over the exit is flashing a new word: 
evacuate! evacuate! evacuate!

mcdermott
jesus, mary and joseph! (he slugs from his 
flask) by blowin' the alarm panels...we 
signalled an evac!
