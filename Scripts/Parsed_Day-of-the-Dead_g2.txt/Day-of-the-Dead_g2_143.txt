to an opposite door. before they can escape, a troop of soldiers 
appears. a gunfight ensues.

his feet. the soldiers have them divided in the two opposite 
doorways.

open fire. the soldiers respond. two more soldiers go down. one of 
tricks' men is killed. tricks himself is wounded badly in the
