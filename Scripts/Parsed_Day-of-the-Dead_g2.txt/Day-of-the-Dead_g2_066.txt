66	ext. the clearing - day

close on the disembodied head of one of the dead soldiers. tricks is 
dropping the thing into a large plastic bag which obviously already 
contains the second head. toby wraps the mouth of the bag and begins 
to walk off. rhodes stops him.

rhodes
where are you going, tyler?

toby
my..."detail", sir. we're going to bury the 
heads.

rhodes
no time for that. i'll take care of them.

toby
just....following procedure, sir. they're 
entitled to burial.

rhodes
i said, i'll take care of them. just leave 
them there. go help with the rest of the 
gear.

rhodes has it in for toby (we'll find out why later), and of course 
the feeling is mutual. toby sets the bag down on the ground and, 
seething, he trots off towards the rest of the platoon. tricks 
follows.

after a moment, rhodes motions with his head. the soldier with the 
long noose pole steps into view with the captive zombie, the one that 
ran amok earlier. the man follows rhodes towards the jungle, dragging 
the gurgling creature along, the wire noose digging into the thing's 
neck.
