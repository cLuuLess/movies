80	int. communication center in the cave - night

this is the central area for all varieties of communication. there 
are radio consoles, both intercom and outgoing, there are video 
control panels and there are large computer terminals. reflecting the 
panic to set up operations back when the disaster first struck, much 
of the equipment is placed haphazardly and not built in. wires run 
every which way, bare antennas and loose connectors clutter the 
place. engineers scurry with tool boxes constantly repairing, 
patching, trouble shooting.

most of the personnel are technicians but there is a group of 
scientific types, obvious in their white lab coats. among these is 
mary henried, who we caught a glimpse of outside entrance two.

at a security station, a guard notices something on one of his own 
video screens which monitor key locations inside the cave.

guard
there's activity in the dormitory!

mary and one of her assistants, julie grant, a younger girl, move 
over to the video console. one screen there shows what looks like a 
prison corridor. cells with heavily barred doors run down both sides. 
we can see the distinct movement of shadows in the corridor. mary 
reacts instantly stepping over to an intercom and pressing a send-
button.

voice (o.s. - filter)
gate twenty-three.

mary
this is mary henried. did anyone enter the 
dormitory?

voice (o.s. - filter)
yes, ma'm. captain rhodes.

mary clicks off, infuriated. she hurries towards an exit followed by 
julie grant.
