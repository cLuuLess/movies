84	int. a conditioning room in the cave - night

there are cardiographs, e.e.g. monitors, and all sort of physical 
conditioning devices. on tables lie symbology cards and coloured 
blocks for dexterity testing. there are large cut-out shapes on the 
walls, triangles, squares and familiar orange circles.

mary storms into the room flinging the door shut behind her. rhodes 
catches it with his black leather gestapo boot.

rhodes
you can't run away from the planet, miss 
science. you can't even run away from the 
island, heh heh.

mary
leave me alone, you...cocksucker!!!

rhodes laughs loudly. mary faces him, hatred boiling away her 
vocabulary. she can't think of word that are adequate.

mary
you're....you're disgusting! 
you're....filth!

rhodes
and you're the one who builds the bomb and 
they says, 'i hope it'll never actually be 
used'.

mary is stopped...by her own guilt. she turns and busies herself 
gathering books and papers, then she clicks off a light and moves 
toward the doorway where rhodes stands.

mary
(calmer, with method) julie grant is a 
behaviouralist. she's not medical. she 
hasn't been as...exposed to...to 
things...as some of the rest of us. she'll 
be alright. i'll talk to her. she'll be 
alright.

rhodes
oh, i have no doubt.

mary
(recognising threat in his voice) if you 
put her on the shit list because of her 
reaction here tonight i'll go to dickerson.

rhodes
ah, yes, our noble gasparilla does seem to 
favour you lately. i understand he assigned 
you a roommate of your choice. the rest of 
us have to pick names out of a hat. 

mary
(reading his jealousy) rhodes, you and i 
had a roll in the hay together when i first 
got here. it was a wholly unsatisfying 
experience which i do not want to, and 
which i never will repeat! so give up, 
mister! i'm going home...to that roommate 
you mentioned.

mary pushes past rhodes into the hallway.
