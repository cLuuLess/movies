58	ext. the jungle near the clearing - day

chico is hit high on the right side of his chest. sarah fires a quick 
burst out into the clearing as she tries to pull the man deeper into 
the jungle.

suddenly, from right behind sarah's back, comes a blood curdling 
scream. a dark figure looms up startling us all.

miguel
burn the church! kill the priest!

it's miguel, sweating, his eyes sunken into deep black sockets. he is 
charging toward the clearing with his automatic blazing in his one 
good hand. he thunders right past sarah almost knocking her down.
