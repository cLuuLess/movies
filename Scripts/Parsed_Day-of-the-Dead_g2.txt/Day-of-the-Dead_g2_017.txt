17	ext.	a small private dock - day

away from the city, this dock is wooden, rickety. derelict boats rust 
at their moorings. the fishing boat is tied-on at one end of the pier 
and the guerilleros are moving through the area, scavenging. this 
time chico helps maria with the siphon hoses. tony lingers sullenly 
near the fishing boat which has its motor still idling.

maria's siphon hose is stuffed into the gas tank of a large trawler. 
she sucks on the hose and, unexpectedly, foul tasting liquid fills 
her mouth.

maria
ay! gasolina! gasolina!

without warning, a figure pops up from behind the side wall of the 
trawler. he reaches out and grabs the woman, pulling her against the 
boat, his arm around her neck, a pistol to her head.

tony sees the action. he dives into the fishing boat, crawls over to 
his rifle and scrambles towards the pilot's controls.

with a lightning move, maria pulls a knife from her belt. she 
wrenches around and plunges the blade into her attacker's chest. the 
man staggers back, screaming. maria breaks away and runs across the 
dock. the man fires his pistol wildly.

maria is hit in the arm. she tumbles forwards onto the decking.

tony reacts, opening fire with his automatic.

bullets rip into the attackers chest: he falls out of the trawler 
onto the dock, but two more gunmen appear behind him, mean-looking 
desperadoes with rifle spitting lead.

tony ducks as low as he can. he grabs the controls and pilots the 
fishing boat along the edge of the dock toward the downed woman.
