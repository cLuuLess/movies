49	ext. the clearing - day

first one comes....then two more....three more. zombies are shuffling 
out of the jungle and converging on the platoon.

they seem to come from everywhere. soon there are twenty or more. 
most are tattered and ragged but others wear vests, the same type as 
worn by the platoon. these are solid colours, some white, some blue. 
none are red and none have orange circles.

as the zombies push in closer they seem to get agitated. they start 
growling and reaching out. the men with the cattle prods poke at the 
more unruly creatures and zapping sounds can be heard.

the creatures form a kind of ragged queue, lining up in front of the 
"good humour" men. from inside their freezer cartons those men 
produce great bloody chunks of raw meat. the zombies docilely take 
the hand-outs and go lurching out of the queue, some starting to eat 
immediately, others retreating into the cool of the jungle to enjoy a 
more private supper.
