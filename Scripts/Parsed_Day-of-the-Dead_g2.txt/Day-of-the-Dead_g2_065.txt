65	ext. the clearing - day

close on chico. he's dangling from a rope which is tied over a tall 
tree, his feet ten feet off the ground.

zombies wander here and there. they've all received their rations. 
the picnic is breaking up now. occasionally one of them gets surly 
but it doesn't amount to anything. soldiers stand ready with electric 
prods, others with guns.

paraphernalia is being packed away. men carry equipment in the 
direction of the elevator.

rhodes walks up beneath where chico is hanging. he's careful not to 
step in too close. he doesn't want to get any dripping blood on his 
uniform.

chico
please....shoot me.

rhodes
and if i don't? if i don't you'll come back 
after your death. you'll come back and find 
yourself hanging there...wanting to 
eat...needing to eat human flesh. you hate 
that thought, don't you? that's the 
ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't 
it?

chico is weeping now. with a found spurt of energy he struggles 
against the rope. no use. it only brings pain.

rhodes
after hanging up there a few days you will 
be mad for food...crazed! you will lust for 
it! you will be worse than any of them!

chico
no...nooooooo...shoot me! shoot me! 
shooooooooot meeeeeeeee!!!

rhodes
i'll bargain with you. how many of you are 
on the island?

chico
two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
(he nods towards miguel's corpse.)

rhodes
i don't believe you, rebel. where are your 
headquarters? on the mainland?

chico
the mainland...is dead...a dead 
place...nobody there...

rhodes
where are your headquarters, rebel? tell me 
or i'll let you hang there 
forever...forever!

chico
there are no...headquarters. there are 
no...rebels. only the walking dead. don't 
you see. they have won.

rhodes
then why did you come here?

chico
to look...look for a place...a place to 
live in...an empty place...a... 
new...place...

rhodes
how did you know we were on this island? do 
others know? will others come?

chico
nooooo. believe me. there are no 
others...no rebels...nobody...it's 
over...it's ooooo....

the man collapses, unconscious.
