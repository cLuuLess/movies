81	int. the dormitory in the cave - night

close on: the mouth of a large plastic bag. a hand wearing a black 
leather glove pulls a human head out of a bag by its hair. it's the 
head of one of the dead soldiers from rhode's platoon. the hand 
belongs to rhodes himself.

in the darkness of a cell, a red coat zombies takes a hesitant step 
forward. rhodes tries to shove the head through the bars but it 
sticks. when rhodes lets go it stays there, wedged at shoulder 
height.

rhodes
take it, friend. take it. it's a present. 
from me to you.

the red coat steps forward and lays its hand on the head.

rhodes
just remember who gives you favours.

the zombie pulls hard and the head pops through onto its side of the 
bars. the creature lurches off towards a cot in the shadows at the 
rear of the cell where it hunkers down and begins to ravish the head, 
tearing flesh off, eating it hungrily.

on the cell door we notice a plaque with a number (5) and, written in 
marker, the red coat's nickname, "bluto".

rhodes moves past other cells, each holding a nicknamed red coat. 
grumpy stands way back in the shadows. tonto stands near the bars, 
growling. fatso is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old 
who needs to pee.

rhodes stops at a cell marked "bub!". inside we see a silhouette, 
tall, erect, not moving a muscle. rhodes grins.

rhodes
well, bub. i've heard about you. miss 
henried's pride and joy.

rhodes steps closer and bub snarls warningly.

rhodes
surly sonofabitch. i want to make friends, 
bub. friends. i have one more goodie in my 
sack here.

a loud, clanging sound interrupts. rhodes turns to see.
