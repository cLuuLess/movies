61	ext. the jungle near the clearing - day

chico breaks through some brush to find himself face-to-face with 
toby tyler's group of soldiers. he stops, reverses course, and ducks 
into a cluster of palms. one of the soldiers fires. 
rattatattatattatatt!!!

bullets rip the palm fronds apart. there's a scream and chico 
somersaults out into view. new wounds bleeding across the center of 
his chest.
