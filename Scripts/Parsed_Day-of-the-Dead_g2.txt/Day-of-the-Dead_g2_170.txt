170	ext. the beach - night

the corpse lies in the moonlight. night critters screech and burble 
in the jungle behind the sand. it's an eerie scene.

sarah is sitting up, her rifle ready in her lap, watching the body. 
john steps in behind and she startles.

john
just me. i'll take the next shift.

he settles easily down beside the woman. the two stare together at 
the shrouded corpse.

sarah
how long do we have to watch him?

john
forever, darlin'. forever. 'til he turns ta 
dust and blows away on the wind.

the body lies silent, rigid under the khaki army blanket that rises 
and falls, rises and falls with the gulf breeze.

suddenly...a loud music chord! a sudden movement!

it's the movement of red letters that spin up off the head of the 
corpse and settle before our eyes.

the letters read: "the end (i promise)"
