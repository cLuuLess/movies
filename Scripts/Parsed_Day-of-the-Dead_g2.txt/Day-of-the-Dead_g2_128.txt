128	int. entrance seven - night

the door to the jungle swing open. julie grant looks over at doc 
logan. the madman struggles to his feet. supporting himself against 
the wall of the control booth, he reaches inside and starts pushing 
buttons.

julie
those buttons won't work! the evacuation 
command overrides them.

julie looks through the open entranceway. barely visible in the dim 
blue moonlight are the hulking shapes of two...no three zombies, 
approaching the open hatch.
