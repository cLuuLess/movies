86	int. the central chambers of the cave - night

montage: as mary walks through huge open areas carved out of natural 
rock. we are stunned at the enormity of the place. jeeps and trucks 
rumble back and forth. storage areas hold mountains of crates, 
cartons, water and gas canisters. fork lifts shift loads from here to 
there.

mary comes to a place where the natural rock surrenders to man-made 
walls. she enters past two security guards, showing her i.d.
