73	int. the cave entrance - evening

there's that giant sound again, the rumble of the elevator. we're 
inside the place called the cave, in a huge under-ground concrete 
bunker. technicians and armed guards bustle around. enormous 
hydraulic pistons are bringing the camouflaged iron plate down from 
the surface. riding on board, rhodes and his platoon prepare to 
unload their paraphernalia.
