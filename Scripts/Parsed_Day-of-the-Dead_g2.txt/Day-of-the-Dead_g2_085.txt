85	int. the hallway outside the conditioning room - night

mary starts down the hall but rhodes grabs her from behind. he leans 
in close, lusting, pressing his lips against the back of her neck.

mary
take your hands off me! right now!

an evil grin returns to rhodes' flushed face. he stares at the woman 
for a long moment, then he lets go. mary walks away, bristling. 
rhodes calls after her.

rhodes
maybe you'll change your mind when it 
starts getting too lonely for you.

mary stops dead. she turns back to see him gloating.

rhodes
i'm not entirely without influence myself, 
miss science. i had your roommate 
assigned...by gasparilla... to my platoon. 
what's his name? tyler? yes. toby tyler.

a bubble of fear pushes up in mary's throat but she is only letting 
her anger show. her stare is fierce, her eyes daggers.

rhodes
i had an unfortunate little run-in with him 
today. in fact...you might say that mr. 
tyler is in big trouble with 
the...authorities.

mary
you better not mess with me, rhodes. i'd 
love to serve your balls to those red coats 
for lunch! think about it!

rhodes
no, miss science. you're the one who needs 
to do some thinking.

he turns and walks away. mary stands still for a time, the sound of 
rhodes' clicking bootheels surrounding her, swallowing her. in the 
deep background we can hear the moans of the caged dead.
