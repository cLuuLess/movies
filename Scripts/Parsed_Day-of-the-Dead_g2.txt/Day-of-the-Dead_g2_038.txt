the two drag miguel to the edge of dry land. they flop him onto his 
back and sarah puts her canteen to his lips.

miguel
no ice, i said!!! nooooo ice!!!

he slams his good hand against the canteen, knocking it away. it 
plops into the marsh water, its contents lost.

miguel
burn the church. kill the priest and burn 
the church. burn....

his mouth keeps on shaping words but no sound comes out. he squirms 
for a moment, then he seems to fall asleep.

chico looks down at him. unable to help, he moves off towards solid 
ground and disappears in the thick brush. after a time, sarah follows 
after him.
