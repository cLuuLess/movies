24	ext. the private dock - day

chico ducks the enemy's ricocheting bullets.

chico
hey ! what are we doin' this for? we can 
stick together. we can use each other's 
guns.

at the trawler, one of the attackers shouts a response.

attacker #1
you could use our guns, maybe. we can't use 
yours. unless you can get yer boat back 
here.

chico
you got a boat.

attacker #1
shit, man. we can drift this tub into the 
bay...tow her around with a dinghy...but 
she ain't gonna get us nowhere. ev'ry boat 
you see here is long dead, soldier...else 
we'd be long gone. can you get your boat 
back here?

chico
i don't know where they went, man. i don't 
know. i swear.

attacker #1
then, like i said...we can't use you. we 
ain't got the food nor the patience to put 
up with you.

the man fires a long burst from his automatic.

chico
you....you motherfuckers!

he reaches around the corner of the shed with his own rifle and fires 
blind in return. sarah clambers out through the shed windows having 
wrapped a large piece of cloth around the end of the axe handle.
	
she reaches into a shirt pocket and produces a wooden match. she 
strikes the match and touches the flame to the thinner-soaked cloth. 
phooooomph! the axe handle becomes an angrily flaming torch.
