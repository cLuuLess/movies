153	int. the gymnasium - night

a woman's face is full screen. she is screaming in agony as she is 
torn apart by zombies. the creatures have invaded the gymnasium. 
they're clawing at the fat-cat councillors, mauling their women.

gasparilla and two other men are rolling around crazily, bumping into 
exercise machines, knocking over wine bottles and tables full of 
hors-d'oeuvres. the single vest they are fighting over rips apart 
into two pieces, its orange circle severed into two useless halves.

gasparilla backs across the floor, his blubber bouncing. he has a 
tattered piece of the vest clutched in his hands. he tries to spread 
it out on his chest but it's too late... and the zombies are too 
hungry...much too hungry.

montage: as all over the room they strike. this is it, gore fans. the 
gross finale. the intestine-tugger. the zombies get their supper. 
they feast among the pillows, like romans at an orgy. music still 
plays over the gymnasium speakers, rock-a-billy in a gleeful tempo.

gasparilla has retreated into his tanning-coffin but a pudgy arm and 
a leg are dangling outside. zombies chew hungrily on the juicy 
morsels. from inside the coffin, where ultraviolet glows brightly, 
come the piercing, agonised screams of the fat general.
