28	ext. the private dock - sunset

the fishing boat is gone. orange light from the western horizon 
paints the scene. figures are moving about on the dock, slumped, 
lumbering figures....zombies.

they're clustering around the trawler, around the corpses of the 
attackers.

they begin pulling those corpses apart and eating them hungrily.

one creature has found miguel's severed forearm. it pulls a big chunk 
off the thing with its teeth. it chews for a time, its drool turning 
red. then it spits out miguel's wristwatch as though it was a 
bothersome bit of bone.
