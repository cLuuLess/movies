11	ext. the marina (at the docks) - day

close on the open gasoline receptacle in the hull of an abandoned 
boat. a woman's hands shove a length of hose down into the hole.

the woman, maria, puts the other end of the hose to her mouth and 
sucks the air out.

at another derelict boat, tony sucks on another hose.

tony

miguel
check them all. and check the tanks under 
the pumps.
	
miguel and the other two guerilleros, sarah and chico, start to walk 
up the dock towards the harbour park, toward the city. miguel has an 
electronic bullhorn in one hand, his automatic rifle ready in the 
other.
