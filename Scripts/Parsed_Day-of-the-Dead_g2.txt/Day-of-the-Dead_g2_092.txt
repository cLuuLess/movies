92	int. the hospital in stalag seventeen - night

we see rows of home-made cots, each with a body lying on top. what 
faces we see are gaunt, showing the boils and lesions of consumptive 
diseases and tropical fever. insects buzz and there is thunder in the 
air.

an oriental orderly, lukey, moves through the maze of bodies. he 
lifts the wrist of a woman who looks dead and he discovers that she 
is dead indeed. he hurries off.
