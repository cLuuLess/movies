112	int. the ritz - night

at a cot near the open wall, in dim light from an overhead bulb 
outside, sarah, john and toby huddle. the din from the street makes

maintenance shafts run behind all the main 
rooms. nobody's in those at night. you can 
use them to get around in. hit the power

computer network and you erase everything 
stored in the memory. then...over in 
here...that's where the cages are...

on the street outside, a puffing bill mcdermott pushes through the 
unruly crowd, his face showing alarm.

mcdermott
the doc's gone. diesel and jack and spider 
with him. they took the guns... and the 
nitro.
