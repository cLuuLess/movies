168	ext. a river on the island - morning

the regugees are all gathered. the children walk, one by one, through 
the shallows as john baptises them. sarah, mary and the nurse carry 
the infants. when the infant in sarah's arms has been touched by 
john's hand, sarah doesn't move on. instead, she looks up into the 
big man's warm eyes.

sarah
me too...please.

john gently cups a handful of river water and pours it on the woman's 
forehead.

the other adults, led by lukey, file into the river, all lining up 
before the baptist, waiting their turns to be blessed into this tiny 
new society.
