90	ext. stalag seventeen main street - night

people wallow in the mud. one man has just taken a shit and is wiping 
his ass. nearby a drunk lies unconscious. several men are fighting. 
it's a brutal fight with bottles and pipes and lengths of chain. the 
men are really hurting each other. people smoke and snort and shoot 
up in wide open disarray.

a huge pregnant woman plants herself right in toby's path.

pregnant woman
how 'bout it, baby. i'm big but i'm 
beautiful.

toby pushes past her and bumps into a surly drunk.

drunk
hey, you fuck! you fuck!

he grabs toby and flings him violently against an upright on one of 
the long huts. the other two prisoners move on, abandoning toby, 
disappearing into the crowd. the drunk pulls a rusted, home-made 
knife.

drunk
i oughta slice you up, you fuck! you can't 
push me around like... push me 
around...like...

suddenly vomit rises in the man's throat and he doubles over. toby is 
aware of sounds behind him. at his back, in the hut, a hairy fat man, 
still wearing his boxer shorts and his muddy boots, is wham-bam-
bamming a whore, who is wearing everything but underwear and boots. 
there are needle tracks on the woman's arms and her face looks as 
though she's been beaten brutally. she purses her deep red, damaged 
lips and blows toby a kiss that's meant to be seductive.

toby moves on down the street. the place is a cesspool full of human 
dregs, stinking with refuse, filled with the fury and desperation of 
man in his last days.
