83	int. mary's office in the cave - night

a 9 by 12 cubicle with a small computer terminal, a desk and three 
chairs. there's a lightbox on the wall displaying groups of cranial 
x-rays.

mary guides julie grant into a chair. rhodes stands cockily in the 
open doorway.

julie
i didn't realise! those were de-caps! i 
didn't know that....de-caps... revived!

rhodes
any dead whose brains are intact will 
revive.

julie
but...we bury the heads. oh. god! it must 
be torture for them!

rhodes
they are brutes without feeling. though i 
admit that i've requested cremation for 
myself. burial is an archaic tradition, 
even more ridiculous now than it ever was. 
to say nothing of the...spacing 
problem...on a small island like this.

julie
i thought the purpose of decapitation was 
to...to...

rhodes
the purpose of decapitation is to preserve 
as much...food...as possible. the purpose 
for feeding is to keep the beasts on our 
side. the fact that they can be taught to 
clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a 
convenient side benefit, not the primary 
goal. the primary goal is to keep ourselves 
from becoming their supper. keep them fed 
and they behave. keep them hungry and they 
revert back to being the animals that they 
have always been. you saw them in there.

mary
you gave them a fresh taste of blood!

rhodes
they will never be satisfied with anything 
else, miss henried. they want human flesh. 
i'm prepared to take whatever steps are 
necessary to see to it they don't get mine! 
not while i'm still using it!

julie has calmed herself down. now she feels angry, betrayed. she 
looks at mary accusingly.

julie
did you know? about the de-caps?

mary
i'd never seen it before.

julie
but you knew.

mary nods in the affirmative. tears form in julie's eyes.

julie
what else is there, doctor? what else do 
you people know that the rest of us don't?

they stare at one another. whatever bond once existed between them 
has been severed forever.
