156	int. a corridor near the dormitory - night

rhodes and his men rush into another corridor where they are met by a 
crowd of drooling zombies. the men open fire but the zombies are too 
close in. they get the upper hand.

rhodes fires his magnum, his eyes insane, his face boiling red with 
disbelief. after two shots blast open the heads of the closest 
zombies, the magnum just click-click-clicks! rhodes is out of lead.

he's grabbed by one zombie, then another. he fights to free himself 
but he's bitten once...twice...

bleeding, he fights on. he struggles to a doorway and pushes through.
