96	int. the ritz (rain) - night

it resembles the hospital. there are rows and rows of cots. some 
people sleep, alone and in pairs. others are awake, drinking, 
screwing, shooting up. sarah finds an empty cot and flops down. 
beyond the open walls she can see the blue-white flashes coming from 
the electrified fence. rain leaks in on her but it doesn't keep her 
from falling asleep.
