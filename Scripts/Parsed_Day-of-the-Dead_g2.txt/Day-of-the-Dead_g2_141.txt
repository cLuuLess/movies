141	int. a corridor in the cave - night

spider is walking along, careful to avoid jolts, support-under her 
arms by the giant diesel. jack walks with them, his nervousness 
irritated by the need to move slowly. citizens run past, none of them 
paying attention to the desperadoes.

suddenly they encounter a troop of soldier who come trotting around a 
corner. nervous jack opens fire. two soldier go down. a gunfight 
erupts as the rest of the troops scatter in the hallway, civilians 
are caught in the crossfire. two are hit.

diesel manages to steer spider around a corner to safety. jack keeps 
firing but he's trapped in a hail of bullets. a red line cuts across 
his chest and he flies back, dead, his gun still firing.

out of the troopers' sight, diesel checks his map and moves into a 
doorway, one of several on the area, guiding spider through beside 
him.
