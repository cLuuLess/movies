i think we should burn the church. kill the 
priest and burn the church. it's the only 
way. the only way.

miguel is sweating profusely yet shivering as though cold. flies are 
buzzing in a cluster around his wrapped stump. he's over the edge 
now, insane. and worse than that, the infection from the original 
bite is spreading. the amputation was not done quickly enough to 
prevent the parasites from racing through his veins to the brain and 
elsewhere.

sarah turns towards the madman once her lover. her heart is too 
callused for emotion to reach it. she just stares, her eyes dead cold 
like the eyes of a shark.

chico
i'm pullin' in.
