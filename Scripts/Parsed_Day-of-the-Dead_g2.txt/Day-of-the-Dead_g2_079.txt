79	int. the cave - night

close on: a television screen. first there is only video noise, then 
an image blinks onto the screen.

montage: other video screens on monitors in various places throughout 
the huge underground facility. zombies watch the screens gathered in 
groups of four, six and eight, like children in ranked classes.

the screens show scenes of zombies taking food from humans in orange 
circle vests. guns are pointed at orange circles then lowered 
harmlessly. guns are pointed at humans without orange circles and 
fired. the images repeat and repeat and repeat. the zombies watch the 
scenes with dumb curiosity.
