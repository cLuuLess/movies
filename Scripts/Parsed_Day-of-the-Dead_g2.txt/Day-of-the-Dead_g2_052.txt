52	ext. the jungle near the clearing - day

sarah watches, repulsed but fascinated. chico is still fighting the 
heaves. without warning, a zombie looms up directly behind chico. the 
man jumps forward, terrified. he crashes into sarah who spins and 
sees the danger.

two more zombies appear. then a third. these have no vests. they're 
rag-tag, bad ass and hungry as hell. one of them grabs sarah. she 
manages to pull away but behind her chico panics. he raises his rifle 
and...rattatattatatt!
