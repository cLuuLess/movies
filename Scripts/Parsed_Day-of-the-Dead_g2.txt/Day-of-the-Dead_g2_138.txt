138	int. entrance seven - night

julie is still screaming wildly. the zombies are tearing her apart, 
literally.

doc logan inadvertently kicks the pistol left by diesel and is 
skitters across the floor. he flops down on his knees.

logan
we will atone. we will be the 
sacrifice...the communion...we offer 
ourselves up...our soul...and our bodies...

julie grant finally loses consciousness. many more zombies are 
pressing in through the entrance now. they reach logan and start to 
tear at him. something clicks in his brain and he realises what's 
happening. he starts to scream. his hands find the pistol on the 
floor.

one zombie takes a bite out of his left arm. he shrieks and brings up 
the pistol, firing. the first shot rips open the creature's skull. 
the next five shots are wasted, fired wildly. the gun clicks emptily 
as the zombies engulf him, tearing, biting, eating him alive.

more zombies come out of the jungle...a lot more...called by the 
siren. in waves they enter the cave looking for food.
