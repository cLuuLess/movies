95	ext. stalag seventeen main street (rain) - night

the street scene is toned down due to the late hour and the rain, but 
just as vile, just as vicious. john and mcdermott escort sarah. john 
speaks softly, and only when others on the street are far enough 
away.

john
they supply us with disinfectant and dope. 
sex, drugs and rock-and-roll. what more 
could anyone ask for? most around here 
ain't interested in changin' their lives. 
the folks you met...me and them and a 
couple others is the whole rebel army. 
nobody else gives a shit...and they're 
afraid o' rhodes.

they pass a structure with an overhead sign that reads: joe's corner 
tavern. if there were walls they'd be pushed out by the mass of 
humanity inside. music blares and voices form a wall of noise louder 
than the thunder. a fight spills out onto the muddy street, pushers 
selling all sort of delights accost john and his group.
	
sarah
they seem to be havin' a good time. some 
punishment.

john
you disappear in here, darlin'. you get a 
knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer 
veins. you get lost out here and nobody's 
gonna notice. rhodes, he counts on that. it 
all makes for food in the freezers.

they come to a long hut with a sign that reads: the ritz.

john
this is your hotel. i'm not gonna stay here 
with you but i'll always be close. you 
gonna hafta take care o' yourself like you 
said you was able to do.

sarah nods. john smiles at her. his warm, trustworthy eyes seem to 
glow in the dark.

john
some may notice that you're new. just deny 
it. you'll get away with it. nobody really 
looks at each other around here. go on in. 
get some sleep.

he squeezes her hand tightly, then he turns away and moves off with 
mcdermott. sarah moves into the ritz.
