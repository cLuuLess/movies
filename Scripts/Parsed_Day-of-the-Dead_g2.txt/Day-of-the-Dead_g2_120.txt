120	int. gasparilla's gymnasium - night

the usual scene here, gasparilla and his courtesans entertaining the 
councilmen and their ladies. the klaxon sounds over the loud rock 
music. mary henried, a prisoner for the evening again, hears the 
sound. her eyes widen. she looks over at rhodes, who jumps to his 
feet. the party gradually goes silent.

rhodes
don't be alarmed. we're impregnable. stay 
where you are. nothing will happen to any 
of you. you're safe here. men.

this last word to a small unit of four troopers standing guard at the 
exit. rhodes goes steaming through the doors. two of the troopers 
follow, the other two unsling their rifles and take up posts just 
outside in the corridor. the steel door slides shut locking 
gasparilla and his court inside the gymnasium...mary henried with 
them.

gasparilla
well, c'mon, ladies and gents. who says we 
gotta let our evenin' get spoiled? simon 
sez...get down!!!

most of the guests are willing to let the party get back to full 
swing. gasparilla grabs a topless courtesan and rocks his fat belly 
around in an attempted dance. mary seems to be the only one concerned 
about the alarm.
