25	ext. the private dock - day

as the gun battle continues, sarah crouches over miguel. blood is 
still fountaining from the stump of his left arm. the woman slaps the 
flaming end of her torch onto the stump. there's a sizzling sound as 
the raw flesh there cooks.

the pain reaches miguel even though his unconscious state. he starts 
to breathe heavily. his head shakes from side to side silently 
pleading "no, no, no." the flames do their job. the flesh crusts over 
and the bleeding stops.

miguel's shirt catches. suddenly his eyes pop open and he screams 
like the man on fire he is. he lurches away from the flame, his body 
slamming against the shed wall. sarah flings the torch into the water 
and dives on top of the man.

sarah
miguelito. mi vida. miguel mio.

miguel, trying to scream but needing to vomit, is doing neither. his 
body is convulsing in the woman's arms. she rubs the sparks on his 
shirt until they disappear then she caresses him, holding his head 
against hers, rocking him back and forth.
