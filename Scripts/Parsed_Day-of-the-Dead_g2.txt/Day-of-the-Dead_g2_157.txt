157	int. another corridor - night

rhodes comes face-to-face with...you guessed it...big bub. the zombie 
faces off, ready to draw those six-guns that hang at his hips. rhodes 
turns and runs.

whap! bub slaps leather. blam! blam! blam! rhodes turns a corner but 
one bullet bites him on the back of his shoulder. terrified, fighting 
pain, he staggers on with the gun-totin' red coat following behind.
