36	ext. the inland jungle - day

the guerilleros hack their way through thick undergrowth with 
machetes. miguel is ineffectual. he lags behind the others who are 
doing trailblazing. the sounds of wildlife, excited by the intruders, 
fill the close, humid air, sometimes beautiful, sometimes grotesque, 
sometimes startling.
