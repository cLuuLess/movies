134	int. nursery corridor - night

the hallway is in chaos. troopers run by, crazed citizens flee in 
both directions. mary henried is stopped by a nurse standing in an 
open doorway.

nurse
what is it? what's happening?

mary
it's an evacuation signal. the radios are 
out. people are panicking.

nurse
what should we do?

mary looks past the nurse into a room where a group of children, a 
dozen or so, ranging from twelve-years-old down to infancy, are 
huddled. some are crying.

mary
god. i, er...i dunno what to say. it could 
be a real evacuation or it could just be a 
glitch in the system. wait here for now. 
i'll...i'll make sure you get the word what 
to do, okay?

nurse
please...hurry...

mary takes off down the hall.
