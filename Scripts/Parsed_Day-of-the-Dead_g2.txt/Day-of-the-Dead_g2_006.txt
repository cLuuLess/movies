6	ext. a main street - day

we are looking down from a high angle. the corner of a tall building 
is in the foreground. a corpse is dangling from a noose. it's been 
dead for some time. it's mostly bone now, its blackened flesh picked 
clean by scavenger birds and harbour rats. a sign flaps against its 
chest cavity. its hurriedly scrawled message reads: take me, lord! i 
love you!

the rope breaks suddenly and the corpse falls out of frame.
