114	ext. the jungle - night

jack and diesel are chopping a path through the undergrowth with 
machetes. behind them doc logan is walking slowly along with spider, 
guiding her carefully around obstacles. spider is in major pain. 
she's sweating rivers, her fists are clenched, she's biting her lover 
lip so that it bleeds.

logan
i know it hurts. but it won't be long. then 
all the pain will be over. oh, i wish you 
could hear me. god, give her the ears to 
hear me so she knows i don't want her to 
hurt so!

diesel
quiet!

logan
oh, yes. quiet. yes. we must be quiet.

suddenly, a zombie lunges from the underbrush, its face badly 
deteriorated and one of its hands; lost during its human life, 
replaced by a mechanical hook. spider stumbles. she holds her breath 
and stiffens all her muscles. miraculously the nitro vials inside her 
do not explode. logan throws himself quixotically in front of the 
zombie.

logan
fallen angel! this is the judgement day 
when you will burn for your sins! the lord 
will cast you down to the lower reaches and 
you shall forever know....

thwok!!! the zombie's steel hook sinks deeply into logan's upper 
chest. the man's eyes reflect no immediate sensation. his speech 
falters but only slightly.

logan
...you shall forever know the pain... the 
pain...

the zombie pulls logan towards its drooling, wide open mouth. it's 
just about to bite when diesel chops his machete into the center of 
the creature's skull. the thing falls, pulling logan, still hooked, 
to the ground with it.

logan
you shall forever know the pain of hell... 
the pain of hell.

diesel frees the doctor's shoulder from the hook. blood flows freely. 
diesel grabs a handful of dressings from logan's pack and goes to 
work on the wound.

logan
...the pain of hell...the pain...the 
pain...
