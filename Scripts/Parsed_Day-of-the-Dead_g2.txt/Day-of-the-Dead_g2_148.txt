148	int. the hallway outside the dormitory - night

mary and her refugees are stopped in their tracks by bub and his 
cadre of red coats. the nurse screams and tries to back away. the 
children cling to her, petrified, shrieking, starting to cry.

bub lumbers up to mary and...salutes. mary returns the formality.

mary
it's alright. i don't think they'll hurt 
us. try to stay calm.
