43	ext. the cave entrance (their p.o.v.) - day

the platoon of soldiers, still obscured by foliage, moves off into 
the jungle carrying a collection of paraphernalia.

there are three soldiers who do not move off with the others. they 
are standing still with their shoulders slumped, their heads lolling 
listlessly from side to side. they have the body attributes of 
prisoners yet there's something menacing about them. we hear a series 
of electronic beeps, something like computer beeps, and, as though in 
response to that signal, the three slumped figures start to walk. 
they move slowly, stiffly, their feet shuffling, their arms dangling 
lifelessly at their sides.
