23	int. the boathouse - day

the place is dark and cluttered (oars, bait buckets, fishing gear, 
life preservers, tools, paints, varnishes). sarah snatches up an axe 
handle.

the zombie that bit miguel lies nearby with its skull laid open. its 
hand is jogged, startingly, when sarah grabs a bottle of paint 
thinner from the floor beside the corpse.

from out of the shadows...a hand! it grabs sarah's ankle. she kicks 
violently and pulls away. another zombie is crawling across the 
floor. one of its legs is missing and the other is badly damaged.

sarah draws her .45 and bullamm! bullamm! she pumps two rounds into 
the creature's brain.
