154	int. the main chamber of the cave - night

diesel guides spider through the huge earthen archways. zombies here 
are scattered now, but they provide for delays. diesel fires and 
zombies are hit but few are hit fatally. diesel's free arm can't fire 
accurately while he's trying to support the walking bomb beside him.

diesel stops to check his map. a zombie looms up behind him and takes 
a huge bite out of his shoulder. diesel screams. he lets go of spider 
who stumbles away from him, almost falling but saving herself. her 
eyes are bugging with pain.

diesel fires point blank at the zombie, blowing its head to bits. 
more creatures are pressing in close. diesel bats at one, kicks 
another, punches a third. then he rushes to spider's side and scoops 
her into his arms again. wincing in pain from the bleeding wound in 
his shoulder he manages to move out of immediate danger.

the zombies lumber after the two, groaning in chorus as they walk.
