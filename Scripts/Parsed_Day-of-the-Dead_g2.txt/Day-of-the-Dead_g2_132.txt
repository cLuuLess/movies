132	int. a holding pen in the cave - night

we see a large pen, its gate swinging open. from inside, moaning 
hungrily, come forty or fifty zombies, blue coats and white.

guards outside the pen start to panic. they open fire. a few zombies 
are hit but there are too many, way too many. the guards turn tail 
and retreat off into the cave.

the zombies are out! free to find their own suppers!
