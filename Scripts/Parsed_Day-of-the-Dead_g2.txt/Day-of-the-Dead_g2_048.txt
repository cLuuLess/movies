48	ext. the jungle near the clearing - day

sarah and chico watch. suddenly the huge, full-throated sound of a 
siren startles them. they look around, up into the trees. sarah spots 
something and points.

close on a siren horn, high in the cypresses, its wires running down 
to the brush and disappearing under ground.
