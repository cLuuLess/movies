89	ext. entrance to stalag seventeen - night

the running fence leads to a gate in a bigger fence. this one is 
electrified. we know this because we see a collection of zombies, 
mostly "civilians" with no vests, clambering there, hands and faces 
sparking when they touch the chain links.

the zombies send up wild moans and gurgles when toby and the other 
prisoners are led through the gate.

inside the compound is a scattering of open-sided military tent-
buildings, resembling those on m*a*s*h. there's a din coming off the 
place, a mixture of music and voices that forms a disturbed blanket 
of noise. the place seems to seethe like a hornets' next.

the soldiers head back for the cave as posted guards shut the gate 
behind the prisoners. toby and the other captives move toward the 
"village".
