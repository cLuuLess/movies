91	ext. entrance to stalag seventeen - night

john leads his followers to within sight of the stalag gates. zombies 
still claw at the electrified fence. blue-white sparks fill the air 
like flashbulbs.

john
this is home, darlin'. home for us that 
don't make the grade. us that ain't...good 
enough to live inside the cave. we grow a 
little food, do a little light 
manufacturin'...like these here vests, we 
make these for the massers. we live in our 
own filth, with bugs and snakes and disease 
and jungle fever...all the time waitin' to 
become breakfast for the bees.

john is doing a sales job on sarah but everything he says is truth. 
she hears it all, softening to john's cause.

spider has silently lifted a large wooden round out of the weeds. 
it's a camouflaged tunnel entrance.

john
it's a tunnel. it's a couple hundred yards. 
just keep goin' 'til you reach the end. 
i'll be right behind you.

sarah starts down into the hole. john and the others prepare to 
follow. jungle sounds cover the noises they make.
