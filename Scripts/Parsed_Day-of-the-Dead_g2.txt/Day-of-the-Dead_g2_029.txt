29	ext. the fishing boat (in deep water) - sunset

the two women hover over their wounded, tony and miguel. chico steers 
the boat. suddenly, tony arches his back and screams in pain.

tony
aaaaaaah...my god...my god...i am heartily 
sorry...for having offended 
thee....offended thee...

maria
shhhhh....tony. rest, rest.

tony
i detest all my sins...because... because 
of thy just punishment... because of 
thy...just...punish...

a coughing fit interrupts his act of contrition. from across the open 
cabin, from within sarah's arms, miguel stares. his eyes have the 
glaze of a madman's eyes. despite that, and despite the physical 
trauma he has endured, he seems remarkably in command.

miguel
he is dying. i will end his pain.

miguel draws his pistol.

maria
nooooooooo!

tony
...but most of all because...they offend 
thee, my god...who art all good...and 
deserving...deserving of all my love...

miguel
he is dying. he knows it.

maria
you are dying, too.

miguel
no. the disease was cut away from me. i 
will live. i will live.

tony
i firmly resolve...with the... with the 
help...the help of...of thy grace...

tony collapses. a long, gurgling breath of surrender spills out of 
him and blood trickles from his lifeless mouth.

maria
tony...tony!

the woman folds tony's corpse into her arms as though trying to give 
it life from her own wounded body. for a long moment there is only 
the chug-chug-chug of the tired engine. then the woman, sensing 
something, turns back towards miguel. his pistol is raised, aimed at 
tony's head.

maria
no! you can't!

sarah
it must be done. you know this. it must by 
done to keep him from...

maria
it won't happen to him! it won't happen to 
him! you heard his prayer. his prayer will 
save him. he could never become one 
of...one of those... devils.

miguel
prayers have no power to save. the knife 
can save. it can cut the disease away. the 
bullet. it can shatter the brain where the 
evil takes seed. these are saviours...our 
new saviours...our only saviours.

maria
we must wait. one day the curse will pass. 
one day a dead man will... will...

miguel
one day a dead man will refuse to return, 
and that man will be a saint. the first 
saint of our century. that's a prayer, too. 
a catechism. something the priests tell us 
to believe.

maria
you can believe this, miguel. i'll kill you 
if you shoot. we must wait. i'll....i'll do 
it....i'll do it myself....when it needs to 
be done.

miguel
no. you won't be able to do it. he will 
rise. he will rise and you... you will die.

that madman's glaze is wet in miguel's eyes again. a grin curls his 
mouth into an odd shape. he freezes, staring, waiting. sarah shows 
concern.
