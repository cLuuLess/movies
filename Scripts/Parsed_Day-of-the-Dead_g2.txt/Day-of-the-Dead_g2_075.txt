75	ext.	the jungle - evening

wham! two big hands grab sarah by her shoulders. she starts to scream 
but one of those hands shoots up to cover her mouth.

john
it's alright. it's alright. don't be 
afraid. we're friends.

sarah looks into the strong, good face of john, a tall muscular man, 
a caribbean islander with shiny black skin and enormous brown eyes 
that seem instantly trustworthy.

john
there are soldiers near here. guards. i'll 
take my hand away if you won't scream.

sarah nods and john lets her go. there are two other humans standing 
behind the big man. there's bill mcdermott, wearing the grease-
covered jump-suit of a mechanic and swilling generous shots of brandy 
from a hip flask, and there's a smallish woman with a sensitive face 
who, apparently out of character, is armed to the teeth. she's a deaf 
mute, nicknamed spider, and she is urgently signing "come on! let's 
get outa here!" with her hands.

john
right. we better get away from that bee. he 
might have friends.

the group starts moving. sarah follows voluntarily. we notice that 
all three strangers are wearing the same pullover vests that we saw 
on the foot soldiers, the ones with big orange circles.
