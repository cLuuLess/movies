close on: julie grant's face, screaming, in agony, on the brink of 
insanity. the zombies have reached her. they're started to pull at 
her arms, her legs. one bites her hand, another her arm, another her 
calf.

doc logan is watching from the control booth, all the while fiddling 
with buttons, dials, levers.

logan
we'll be in heaven soon. we'll all be in 
heaven soon.
(julie's screams penetrate the fog in his 
brain. he frowns.)
pain. god forgive the pain inflicted by 
surgeons. we must atone. we must atone for 
our sins.

his eye is attracted to a large lever seemingly separate from 
everything else. it's marked: siren. he pulls it.

logan
we must...atone. we must.
