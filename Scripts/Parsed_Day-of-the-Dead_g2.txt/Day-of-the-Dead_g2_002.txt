2	ext. the city - day

we hear the sound of a strong wind. debris flutters through the 
streets. a large alligator slithers into frame, stops and looks 
around.

montage: as more gators explore the empty streets, knocking over 
garbage cans, upsetting the mannequins in a department store window. 
a gator crawls out through the open doors of an abandoned bank. loose 
bills are dragged along under the animal's tail. they flutter away on 
the wind.
