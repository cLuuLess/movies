       marco on his phone, the t.v. blaring, under:

                            marco

                 -- but meanwhile, somebody's grandmother,
                 in a small american town, is standing in
                 her kitchen -- she's got her medicine
                 bottle in one hand, she's opening the
                 refrigerator with the other. and she's
                 thinking: i can pay for my medicine, or i
                 can pay for my dinner. i can't do both.
                 in america. in america, our mothers and
                 grandmothers shouldn't have to worry
                 about that.
       voice on the other end of marco's call, but he's slow to
       respond -- mesmerized by the "new" raymond --

                           marco

                     (on the phone)
                 yeah, yeah. i'm here ...
       as he starts to write an address --
