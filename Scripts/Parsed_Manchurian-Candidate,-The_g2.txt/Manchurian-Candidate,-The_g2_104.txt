168   int. rosie's cousin's apartment - night                         168

      rosie asleep. push in rapidly ... then a hand comes down
      hard and efficiently against her throat --
      -- she wakes up, fighting for air --

                          marco

                    (a whisper)
                how does the president die?
      he sits on top of her, pinning her arms down.   she struggles
      to say something. marco shakes his head.




                                            8/18/03   99.








                     marco

          when.   where. how.
he releases her throat, and she gasps for air --

                    marco

          i'm gonna stop this. we'll go to the
          feds. you and me. and tell them a
          story.

                    rosie

          who'll -- believe --

                    marco

          i don't know. i don't care any more.
          it's all i have.
rosie bucks -- gets a hand free -- slugs, marco, and they
tumble off the bed in a tangle of blankets and limbs --

rosie

comes up holding a 9 mm revolver to marco's forehead.

                    rosie

          i am the feds.
she coughs.   marco stares at her, dumbfounded.

                    rosie

          we've been watching you, trying to sort
          this out. i mean, it's either you're
          telling it straight and we've all got
          something big-time to worry about, or
          you're crazy and dangerous -- either way
          we've had to keep you on a short leash,
          'cuz if we lock you up we'll never know.
              (beat)
          and we can't tell anybody because we
          don't know how deep this river runs.
              (beat)
          if there is a river.
              (off his expression)
          you got away from me.

                    marco

          raymond shaw murdered senator jordan and
          his daughter.

                    rosie

              (shaking her head)
          oh ben. the thing is? i want to believe
          you. god help me, ben, i do.

                    marco

          -- he's a time bomb, ticking --




                                                 8/18/03     100.








                           rosie

                 everybody else wants you junked up on
                 thorazine and just not a problem any
                 more.

                           marco

                 i am clearer on this than i've ever been.
                 it's rich guys, funding bad science, to
                 put a sleeper in the white house --

                           rosie

                 listen to yourself. you're a poster boy
                 for paranoid fantasies.
      beat.   silence, broken only by their breathing.

                           marco

                 i screwed up. jordan was my trump card,
                 and i screwed it up.
                     (then)
                 either help me, or shoot me, rosie.
                 there's no middle ground anymore.
      he gets up -- rosie's not going to shoot him --

                                                 smash cut to:


169   noyle                                                         169

      frowning --

                           noyle

                 raymond -- raymond --

                                                           turn:


      dreamscape - as before

      raymond hands a service revolver past noyle, to
      marco -- who primes it, aims --

                           noyle (o.s.)

                 captain marco, would you please shoot
                 private baker so we can move on?

      -- marco shoots baker in the forehead --
