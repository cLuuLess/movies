208     int. security command center - night                          208

        two dozen monitors show different angles of the entrance,
        corridors, security lanes, but --

        rosie

        is off to one side with a couple other feds and a security
        guy, reviewing the entry tapes from earlier --




                                                8/18/03   112.








      on the surveillance monitor

      people whoosh through gates in digitized triple time --

                          rosie

                stop.
      -- there's marco. the image slows. marco moves herky-jerky
      through the security station, stop-action. rosie pretends
      she's interested in somebody else -- then:

                          rosie

                no ...
      the tape resumes triple-time --
