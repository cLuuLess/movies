138   int. skybooth of delp's lab - day                              138

      a caretaker rattling keys impatiently behind him, marco
      stands looking down into the pit of the abandoned lab.
      delp and the monkeys are gone. empty cages and unplugged
      equipment are all that remain of delp and his fear project.
      the utter quiet is deafening.
