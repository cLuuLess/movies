74   int. raymond's hotel suite - night                             74

     anderson and another agent move through the suite, securing
     it -- raymond losing steam:

                         raymond

               the weasel is a weasel.    frog and toad
               are friends.
     -- returning to the door and handing raymond his keycard.
     the phone begins to ring --

                         anderson

               sir, we'll be right outside.

                          raymond

               i know.   good night.
     he closes the door after them. breathes out.    glances at
     his watch. then crosses to answer the phone:




                                                       8/18/03   42.








                           raymond

                 you have thirty seconds, mother.

                           ellie

                 am i this predictable?

                           raymond

                 you have no idea.

                           ellie

                 i'm calling to compliment you, mr.
                 grumpy. i thought you were magnificent
                 tonight. so do all the network campaign
                 experts. "presidential" was a word they
                 used.
     raymond's second line flashes with another call.

                           ellie

                 this compassionate vigilance thing is
                 working quite well for you. i might have
                 to convert.

                           raymond

                 i happen to believe in it.

                           ellie

                 of course you do.    now raymond --

                           raymond

                 goodnight, mother.

                           ellie

                 raymond --
     raymond punches a button and puts his mother on hold.
