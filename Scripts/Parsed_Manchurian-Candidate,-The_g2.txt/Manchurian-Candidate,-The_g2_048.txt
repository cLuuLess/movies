91     int. melvin's room - marco                                     91

       flips compulsively ahead through the notebook, lit by the
       harsh beam of the penlight. endless, repetitive writing.
       feverishly rendered impressions of the dreamscape, medical
       apparatus, choppers, guns -- more and more images of raymond
       shaw -- of raymond strangling mavole --
       -- and a drawing of a man who might be marco, unfinished,
       uncertain except for the eyes -- marco with a gun in his
       hand --

       -- as a bullet hole is punched in his forehead -- falling
       away -- with a look of astonishment on his face -- blood
       just beginning to seep from the wound --

       resume - melvin's room - marco

       he drops the notebook like it's on fire --

       tight - on the floor - the notebook

       -- sketches of bobby baker with a bullet hole in his
       forehead --

       marco

       -- topples the chair as he stands up -- and then:

       the bare, overhead lightbulb in the room

       shudders to life -- dies -- glows again -- brighter -- and

       now marco sees:


       the walls of melvin's apartment

       are covered with drawings and scrawlings and newspaper
       clippings and patterns made with paper plates and empty
       noodle containers -- the crazy patterns of the tiles from
       noyle's dream lab -- it's as if marco has entered the mind
       of a mad man -- everything from the notebooks, and more,




                                                   8/18/03   49.







       much more -- dominated by tormented, repeated images of
       raymond shaw --
       -- marco is stunned --
       pushing in -- as a painstakingly rendered drawing of raymond
       shaw fills the screen: wild-eyed with snakes writhing out of
       his head, medusa-like, evoking the wires and tubes from

       marco's nightmare dreamscape --

       pixels blown out and distorted, streaming insanely -- noyle
       stares right into camera, intent:

tv92                       noyle                                     tv92

                 questions?

                                             scream of a train.
