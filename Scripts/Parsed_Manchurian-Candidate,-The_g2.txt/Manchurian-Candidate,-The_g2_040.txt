                 i'm calling to compliment you, mr.
                 grumpy. i thought you were magnificent
                 tonight. so do all the network campaign
                 experts. "presidential" was a word they
                 used.
     raymond's second line flashes with another call.

                 this compassionate vigilance thing is
                 working quite well for you. i might have
                 to convert.

                           raymond

                 i happen to believe in it.
