      raymond and ellie. through the wavy glass we see a crowded
      dining room, the ever-present secret service.

                          raymond

                no. that'd be political suicide. of
                course not. i want you to help him.

                          ellie

                i can't even imagine why.

                          raymond

                because i feel sorry for him.   because i
                said i would.

                          ellie

                what should we do?   make him a general?

                          raymond

                mother. look. my campaign people are
                getting a restraining order, he's going
                on all the security watch-lists -- but i
                won't lock him up. i'm not pressing
                charges.

                          ellie

                what?

                          raymond

                it's complicated -- i don't know. it's
                just complicated and i don't want to talk
                about it, i want to get back to the
                campaign and focus on --

                          ellie

                you don't actually believe his story?

                          raymond

                no. but he does. and he's a fine
                soldier and ... my friend. and if his
                slim hold on sanity requires that i
                tolerate his delusions until he can get
                help, i'll do it. it doesn't diminish
                me. and i'm not afraid of him.

                          ellie

                this is why voters love you. your
                humanity and everything. i've never
                projected humanity.

                          raymond

                yes i think telling people you want to
                "round up all the towelheads and throw

                          (more)





                                                    8/18/03   71.








                          raymond (cont'd)

                them in a deep pit" probably tips your
                hand.

                          ellie

                    (laughs)
                that was a joke, you dreadful boy.
      a busboy delivers ellie her meal: a thick steak stuffed with
      viscous grey -- off raymond's disgust:

                          ellie

                carpetbag steak.

                           raymond

                stuffed.   with oysters?
      she starts to cut meat into child-like, bite-sized pieces
      and put them on a side plate, for raymond.

                          ellie

                the steak part is mostly for you.
                doesn't it look yummy?

                          raymond

                my god. in the world's literature of
                food could there possibly be a more
                vulgar dish?

                          ellie

                and eating it is an absolute sexual
                experience. try some.

                          raymond

                promise me that you'll help him.
      ellie stops, sighs, puts her fork down and reaches for the
      oversized-satchel that doubles as her briefcase and purse.

                          ellie

                oh, raymond, how much do you really know
                about your friend?
      ellie finds two thick files and plops them down, as
      punctuation, in front of raymond.
