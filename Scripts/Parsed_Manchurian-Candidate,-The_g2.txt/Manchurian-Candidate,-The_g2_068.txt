      raymond and marco in the back seat facing forward. anderson
      and campaign handler mirella freeman sit facing them,
      talking low, on a cell phone, as:

                           raymond

                 i saw mavole's mom and dad in st. louis.
                 i still visit them -- and baker's mom --
                 when i can. do you keep up with anybody
                 from the unit besides al melvin?

                           marco

                 i don't keep up with al melvin.     he found
                 me.

                           raymond

                 why did you ask me about kuwait?

                           marco

                     (pleasantly:)
                 i didn't. i asked you about your dreams.
                 at the fundraiser -- why did you say you
                 needed to talk to me?

                           mirella

                     (covers the phone)
                 mr. shaw, excuse me -- they want to know
                 if you'll do an interview with larry king
                 at six.

                             raymond

                 no.
                     (to marco)
                 what do you want from me, captain?

                            marco

                 major.   forty minutes of your time.

                           mirella

                 no to the interview, or no to six?

                           raymond

                 he wants to talk about my mother.     no.
      he looks at marco --

                           marco

                 private time.

                           raymond

                 well, we've got about five minutes, right
                 now. and this is as private as it gets
                 for me anymore, so ...
      beat.   he waits.   anderson staring at marco.




                                                 8/18/03    63.








                          marco

                there are these dreams that ... some of
                the men in our unit have been having.

                          raymond

                including you?

                          marco

                it's a question of what actually happened
                the night our patrol was attacked --

                          raymond

                that's easy.
                    (almost automatic)
                rpg incoming. mortar fire, we're
                ambushed. total chaos. i can't locate
                baker or mavole. you're knocked
                unconscious -- i find you and pull you to
                safety and then --

                          marco

                    (cuts him off)
                -- yeah, that's how i remember it, too.
                    (beat)
                but i dream something else.
      the limo pulls to a curb --
