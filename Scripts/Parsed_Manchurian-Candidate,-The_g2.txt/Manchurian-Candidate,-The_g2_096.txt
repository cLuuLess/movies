154   int. study - continuous                                       154

      raymond entering, closing the door behind him as ellie
      throws documents across the room at jordan:

                          ellie

                the man is insane, tom -- full-blown
                schizophrenia -- he's been stalking
                raymond -- if you dare to use this --
      now they see raymond, under the imposing andrew wyeth
      painting of tyler prentiss that dominates one whole wall of
      the study, and ellie stops.

                          ellie

                    (to raymond)
                your bipolar buddy has been sharing his
                dreams with senator jordan.

                          jordan

                hello raymond.
      raymond smiles -- it's terrifying -- the fragile, forced,
      frigid smile of a man in pain.

                          raymond

                hello senator. how's jocie?
      jordan picks up a picture of noyle and smoothes it onto the
      desk for raymond to see, as:

                          ellie

                can we please not go down that road?

                          jordan

                do you recognize this man?

                          raymond

                no.

                          jordan

                his name is atticus noyle. he is a south
                african physician, neuropsychiatric
                scientist and mercenary -- someone our
                cia trained for covert mind warfare
                against the soviets in aghanistan --
                someone who has sold technology to and
                done research for terrorist groups, and
                rogue states. major marco claims that
                this man --

                ellie                           jordan

                                      -- brainwashed you --
      -- in his dreams.

                          raymond

                sir, ben marco is sick.   delusional.




                                              8/18/03   92.








                     jordan

           nevertheless he's pulled from his mad hat
           some remarkably lucid connections between
           his dreams of your exploits in kuwait,
           and this dr. noyle, and the private
           equity fund manchurian global --
raymond frowns, looks from jordan to ellie.

                     jordan

           -- your mother's primary political
           benefactor for the past fifteen years.

                     ellie

           christ, tom. they contribute to half the
           senate, for god's sake.
silence.

                     raymond

           i don't understand.

                     jordan

           at the time of desert storm, dr. atticus
           noyle was working under a research grant
           from manchurian global. your mother's
           friend.
the color suddenly drains out of ellie's face.

                     raymond

           what?

                     jordan

           rogue scientists. mind control.
           manchurian global. your mother. you.
           connect the dots, raymond. possibly,
           your mother's blind to them, because they
           pay their way --

                     ellie

           possibly the senator's motives are
           colored by his desperation to get himself
           back on the presidential ticket now that
           the heavy lifting is done --

                     raymond

               (unraveling)
           i don't -- i don't --

                     jordan

           it's not about me. as far as i'm
           concerned, this should never come out --
           it would shred what little remains of the
           fabric of our public trust -- think of
           the nation --




                                            8/18/03    93.








                     raymond

           i don't have the dreams.

                     ellie

           he can't prove anything.

                     jordan

           everything you stand for is upside down!
           if this were to come out, true or no, it
           would be catastrophic for the campaign.
               (beat, a threat?)
           and it will come out.

                     raymond

           what are you saying?
silence.   the question hangs there.

                     raymond

           what do i do?

                     jordan

           you withdraw. you bow out gracefully.
           personal reasons. an obscure illness.
           yield your spot on the ticket, go into
           seclusion ...
he glances coolly at ellie --

                     jordan

           ... and then surrender yourself to
           federal authorities who can help you
           address the damage that may have been
           inflicted on you.
-- and walks out. raymond and eleanor have hardly moved.
sound of the front door opening, closing.

                     raymond

           i feel sick. christ.   what have you done
           to me?

                     ellie

           raymond, remember when --

                     raymond

           no, never mind -- don't bother. don't
           lie. don't say anything. no more lies.
there are actual tears in ellie's eyes.   raymond just stares
at her, coldly.

                     raymond

           i can promise you that whatever you've
           done, i will undo it.




                                                    8/18/03   94.








                          ellie

                i know -- i know, baby --

                          raymond

                i never want to see you or speak to you
                again --

                          ellie

                raymond --

                          raymond

                -- i mean it this time.
      raymond heads for the door --

                          ellie

                sergeant shaw --
      raymond slows -- curious to be addressed like this -- sound
      of the desert wind rises --

                          ellie

                -- sergeant raymond shaw --
      he's turning -- the room coming alive -- light shifting,
      intensifying -- that terrible vividness -- and the wall of
      the zaghareet ...

      extremely close on - ellie


                          ellie

                raymond prentiss shaw --
                    (sad)
                listen:

                                                          crash:
