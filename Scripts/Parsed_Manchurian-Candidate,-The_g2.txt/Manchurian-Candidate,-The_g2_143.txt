        high angle, down on marco, moving across the intricate, sun-
        bleached tile work we remember from noyle's lab.

dissipated trace of a scaffolding superstructure inside
crumbling ruins ...

          you don't develop a technology like that
          and waste it on two guys.
he looks to rosie, who stands in an archway. there are
soldiers here, with weapons -- could be here to guard marco.
could be here to protect him.

                    rosie

          we know that.
marco looks past her, to the water, which stretches out from
here, as if to forever.

                    marco

          i remember running.
his arm is in a simple sling. he moves like a man who's
been shot, and not quite recovered -- moves past rosie, out
of the broken-down ruins ...

                    marco

          i had to get out where the sky was.
... rosie motions the soldiers to stay back, follows him by
herself ...

                    marco

          i had to get to the water.
pull back as they walk down the beach to the sea. a few
tumble-down buildings are all that remains of an ancient
seaside town.

                    marco

          i thought: if i can just get to the
          water, everything will be okay.
marco approaches the water's edge, staring out at the
uncertain horizon.
nothing but water as far as the eye can see.
pull back.   and back.   and back ...
