      he slashes at the lump.   blood blossoms.   slashes again,
      oblivious to pain.

                          rosie


                ben marco!?

      push in as ben presses the blade sharply down into his skin
      ... cutting a slit through which the blunt edge of

      an extremely tiny oblong thing

      appears, like a grain of rice.   it slides out into ben's
      bloody fingers.
107   rosie's pushing against the door, trying to force it open.        107

108   marco                                                             108

      puts his trembling hand under the faucet, grips the thing
      between two fingers, turns on the water --

109   the door - rosie                                               109

      breaks in -- sees the blood smeared down marco's back --

                            rosie

                oh jesus.
      -- and the razor in his hand -- she pushes him away --

      marco

      -- loses his grip on the oblong thing before he can even get
      a good look at it, and it goes into the sink --

                            marco

                shit.    oh no no ...
      -- and down the drain -- marco twists the faucet off, and

                                                     dives to


      floor level - under the sink

      where he puts both hands on the fittings of the u-joint trap
      and struggles to get them loose -- succeeding finally, water
      spewing everywhere --
      -- the trap falls to the floor, disgorging soap chips, slimy
      hairballs and pipe corrosion and water ... but not the thing
      he wants. it's --

                            marco

                -- gone.    shit.
      marco -- rests his head on the cool tile, eyes far away.
      defeated. rosie crouches next to him. a little scared.
      she blots the blood from his back with the towel, and then
      presses her ice pack against it.

                          marco

                tell me you saw that.
      rosie just stares at him.

                          marco

                    (hollow)
                you didn't. you didn't see it.

                            rosie

                see what?
      marco closes his eyes.

                            marco

                proof.




                                                   8/18/03   58.








                           rosie

                of what?

                          marco

                my sanity.
