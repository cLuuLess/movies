175   int. p.s. 16 - special ed. room - day                         175

      small, and private. raymond turns on the light. marco is
      in the corner, waiting. his noyle file in one hand.

                          marco

                how's your back?

                            raymond

                it hurts.

                          marco

                i'm sorry.
      raymond locks the door, turns, takes in the room: tiny
      chairs and tables, walls covered with kids' drawings, and
      nearly every object in the room named and labelled with 3x5
      cards.

                          raymond

                i've been having the dreams, ben.

                          marco

                that's good.

                          raymond

                good? they're inside my head. they got
                inside, the way you said they would --

                          marco

                we'll get 'em out.




                                                    8/18/03   103.








                          raymond

                they're all ... twisted together -- and i
                dream things, terrible things, that can't
                possibly have happened. i'm gone, ben --
                i'm losing it --

                          marco

                no -- you could have had me locked up --
                and you didn't. that's a sign.

                           raymond

                of what?

                          marco

                that they don't control everything. we
                can fight it. i mean -- i'm still out
                here because you decided i should be --
                which means there's a part they can't get
                to, deep inside -- the part where the
                truth is, and they can't touch us there.
                that's what we need to tap into, raymond,
                that's the part where, you and me, we're
                gonna take them out.

                          raymond

                jocie's dead.

                           marco

                i know.

                          raymond

                -- and the senator.

                           marco

                yeah.
      beat.

                          raymond

                did i do it?

                          marco

                i think so, yeah.

                          raymond

                i don't remember.     i don't remember it.
      raymond looks up at ben.     emotionless.   uncomprehending.

176   intercut - corridor - rosie and anderson                       176

      down the hallway, standing sentinel. anderson checks his
      watch, glances uncomfortably back at the door -- then at
      rosie, who just stares him down.




                                                  8/18/03    104.








177   resume - special ed. room - raymond                           177

      tears run down his face, but his voice is normal, he stays
      expressionless. he rubs his eyes with the heel of his hand.

                          raymond

                i'm all inside-out.
      knocking on the door.

                            anderson (o.s.)

                mr. shaw?

                          raymond

                just a minute.
      raymond's cell phone rings.

                          raymond

                all i've ever done is what i was supposed
                to do. what i was told to do --

                          marco

                raymond -- focus --

                          raymond

                -- what others want me to do.

                          marco

                did they tell you what they want you to
                do, ray? we gotta know what's gonna
                happen, we gotta know when's it gonna
                happen -- you can help me do this --

                          raymond

                you don't think they saw this coming?
                you don't think they factored you in?
                    (matter of fact)
                i need to die, ben.

                          marco

                what? no -- no, man, they've got big
                plans for you --

                          raymond

                i'm the enemy, major marco, and the only
                way to stop me is to kill me. i thought
                you were smarter than this.

                          marco

                i can get the feds, the police.   come on,
                ray -- fight it --

                          raymond

                are we friends?




                                                   8/18/03   105.








                          marco

                raymond, you gotta work with me here --
      raymond takes the ringing phone from his inside pocket, and
      checks the number of who's calling.

                          raymond

                i want to believe we're friends.

                          marco

                raymond, stay focused. the irrefutable
                fact is that jocie was a mistake, and
                we're gonna make 'em pay for it.

                          raymond

                i dream you, ben. you kill private
                baker.
                    (into the phone, pleasant:)
                hello?

                          marco

                what are you talking about?

                          raymond

                    (into the phone)
                yes mother.
      a class bell rings --

178   intercut - corridor - day                                      178

      students flood the hallway -- laurent tokar walks right past
      rosie and anderson, heading toward the special ed room --

                           marco

                hang up.

                          raymond

                    (into the phone)
                yes, he's right here.
      raymond extends the phone to marco.

                          raymond

                she wants you.
      marco hesitates.   me?   but takes the receiver --

180   intercut - ellie's plaza hotel suite - morning                 180

      on the phone in her lavish room:

                 is this major marco?

                          marco

                yes it is, senator.

                            marco

                yeah ...?
      marco's eyes flicker to raymond's eyes --

      changing around him -- that terrible luminosity -- as --
      sound of fabric, in the wind -- the sandstorm raging --
