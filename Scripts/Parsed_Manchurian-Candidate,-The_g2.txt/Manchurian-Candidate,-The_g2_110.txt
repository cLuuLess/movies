      a temporary polling place. flags, tables, not too crowded.
      voters stepping out of the way. poll volunteers pressing in
      to shake hands and wish raymond shaw good luck. and

      rosie

      on the edge. she badges anderson, and talks to him. he
      nods, moves over and talks quietly to raymond as raymond
      signs his name in the voter registration log.
      then lets rosie guide him to a booth on the end --
