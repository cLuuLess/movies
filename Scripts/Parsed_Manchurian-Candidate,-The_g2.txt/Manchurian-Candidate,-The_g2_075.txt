130   ext. central park - day                                          130

      marco opens his eyes to the glare of a crisp autumn sun,
      surreal colors: blue sky, shimmering green, the skyline.
      his head is in rosie's lap, he lies curled in the grass.
      a banana-yellow motorized model plane buzzes in tight
      circles overhead.




                                                      8/18/03   80.







        rosie's talking, but ben can't hear her.    just the buzzing.
        she stops, looks at him.

                             rosie

                   blank again?
        marco tries to say something, his mouth is dry.

                             rosie

                   he said this would happen.
        marco stares, trying to orient himself. his arm comes up to
        shade his eyes -- nothing written on it.

                               marco

                   who?

                             rosie

                   your friend.

                             marco

                   i don't remember a friend.
        nothing.

                             rosie

                   kind of like a computer system crash --
                   your brain goes down, then you boot up
                   again, but you lose all your ram.
                       (hesitates)
                   do you remember me?

                             marco

                       (after a beat)
                   eugenie rose.
        rosie smiles.     marco closes his eyes again and --

                                                screen goes black.

        silence.   two beats.
        then the sound of a television fades up:
