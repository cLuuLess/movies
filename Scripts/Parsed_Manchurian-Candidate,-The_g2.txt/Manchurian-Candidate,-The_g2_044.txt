                listen, mrs. wilson -- can you tell me if
                nathan was ever -- preoccupied -- with
                his experience in kuwait? did he ever
                mention dreams or nightmares ... about
                what happened ... the firefight,
                afterward ...

82    marco listening to the phone on the other end of his call      82
      ring, and ring and ring. dull hiss of the city.

                                                          blink.

a84   int. noyle's hidden hotel room - night                         a84

      raymond sits in a chair, rigged up with wires and tubes
      (much like he was ten years ago) -- a translucent box around
      his face overlaid with a metric grid, his head held
      motionless by a semi-circular brace, curved calibration
      offering precise positioning for a micro-drill that noyle
      moves into place -- and then a long, tiny drill bit whirs
      down through sterile latex stretched very tight across
      raymond's head --
      -- and plunges precisely and effortlessly through raymond's
      skull, then stops -- he has no reaction, feels nothing --
      lcd screens -- show a virtual map of raymond's brain, in a
      full range of primary colors -- sections morphing as
      thoughts and memories race through his mind, as
      miniscule, interwoven wires -- are threaded down through the
      hollow core of the surgical drill, deep into raymond's
      brain. noyle plays to one of the cameras:




                                                  8/18/03   46.








                         noyle

               no decay, no slippage. everything
               appears to be in flawless working
               condition.
                   (then)
               raymond can you remember the deaths of
               mavole and baker?

                         raymond

               yes.
     the lcd screens show activity in areas of raymond's brain.

                         noyle

               describe it.
