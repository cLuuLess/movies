45     int. marco's apartment - night                                 45

       marco, on the sofa, stares hard at the televised raymond
       shaw, as:

tv45                       raymond/t.v.                              tv45

                 ... and some of you no doubt remember my
                 father ... the late senator john shaw.
                     (he seems to want to say
                      more, but doesn't)
                 i've been honored to serve my two terms
                 in congress. but i also grew up on the
                 hill. i've seen how the game is played
                 by professionals --
       marco reaches for his steaming cup of coffee, his eyes never
       leaving the screen -- he just doesn't get this at all --
