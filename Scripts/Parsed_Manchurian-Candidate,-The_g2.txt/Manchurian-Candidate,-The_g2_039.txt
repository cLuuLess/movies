     anderson and another agent move through the suite, securing
     it -- raymond losing steam:

                         raymond

               the weasel is a weasel.    frog and toad
               are friends.
     -- returning to the door and handing raymond his keycard.
     the phone begins to ring --

                         anderson

               sir, we'll be right outside.

                          raymond

               i know.   good night.
     he closes the door after them. breathes out.    glances at
     his watch. then crosses to answer the phone:




                                                       8/18/03   42.
