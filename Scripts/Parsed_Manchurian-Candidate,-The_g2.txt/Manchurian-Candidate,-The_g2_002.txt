    a topographical map glows on the lcd screen of a laptop
    portable, faintly lighting the faces of capt. ben marco and
    his big, gentle, french guide, laurent tokar.

                         marco

                   (pointing)
               ... this way --?

                         laurent

               yes, well -- i see the captain enjoys the
               road less travelled.
    marco is seemingly unflappable, completely engaged by life.

                         marco

               the captain enjoys not dragging his ass
               down the highway for every tom, dick and
               qadhafi to take a whack at.
    laurent swings his finger on the arc of approach.




                                            8/18/03   2.








                    laurent

          well. of course it is very bad, here.
          and here. and here, here, here, here --

                     marco

          mines?

                      laurent

          tricky.    swedish-made.

                     marco

          dammit.
he refers to some satellite surveillance maps --

                    marco

          nobody at command said anything about --

                    laurent

          exxon and global petroleum hired private
          contractors to do the work in '86, as
          part of their asset security program.
              (beat)
          hired an iraqi firm, in fact, who, now,
          well -- only they know where the little
          nordic fuckers are planted.

                    marco

              (turns away)
          sgt. shaw!
no response.
and we rush toward: a soldier in a lawn chair, face lifted
to the heavens, sitting directly between the two armored
vehicles. this is sgt. raymond prentiss shaw, late
twenties, haunted and aloof.

                    marco

              (suddenly behind him)
          sergeant.

                     raymond

          sir.

                    marco

          rolling in two minutes.

                     raymond

          yes sir.
beat.

                    marco

          everything okay?




                                                  8/18/03   3.








                         raymond

               yes, captain. everything's fine.   here.
                   (standing up)
               i'll "rally" the troops.
