48   int. convention back room - continuous                       48

     raymond's speech plays, low, on a television, and half a
     dozen delegates and power players with "arthur for
     president" buttons grimly watch ellie breeze in. party
     chairman vaughn utly anticipates her:

                         utly

               the decision is final, senator. tom
               jordan is on the ticket. we don't need
               your blessing, but we'd like it.

                         ellie

                   (smiling:)
               before we get started, i'm dying to know:
               which genius here hatched the scheme of
               pairing a sound bite from nebraska with a
               relic who thinks keeping suicide bombers
               off our busses is unconstitutional?

                         utly

               all the research indicates that an arthur-
               jordan ticket sits quite well with the
               american public and --

                         ellie

               'sits quite well' translates into how
               many votes?

                         senator wells

               your son is largely unknown outside of
               new york. his public service, his
               congressional record, while commendable,
               is --

                         ellie

               my son is a war hero.

                         congressman flores

                   (cheerful)
               governor arthur has agreed to consider
               raymond for a cabinet post.
     a cold silence.   ellie stands --




                                           8/18/03    20.








                    ellie

          we didn't come here to have a discussion.

          utly                            ellie

senator --                          (to her posse)
                                did we come here to have a
                                discussion?

                    senator wells

          ellie, you don't have the votes to block
          this, or even push the nomination to a
          second ballot.

                    ellie

              (ignores him)
          even running against this cut-and-fold
          vice president, with his party's record
          of abysmal failure at home and abroad,
          arthur is still unelectable without help.
              (cold, hard logic:)
          consider. the governor is a corn-belt
          candidate who -- scratch and sniff --
          looks and smells alot like the kind of
          liberal-labor-intellectual dukakis was,
          but without, thank god, the helmet.
              (beat)
          assume our intrepid arthur can carry the
          northeast, plus his home ground, and
          california. we're still dead in the
          south, and southwest, where they win by
          landslides. the mid-central is a toss-
          up. tom jordan actually becomes a
          liability in florida because of his
          castro-appeasement profile, and in the
          carolinas, where he fumbles the military
          vote over his "terrorism isn't a war it's
          a social disease" nonsense.
the room is surreally silent. ellie spins and moves like a
televangelist, preaching to the frightened faithful.

                    ellie

          you know this. your own polls and
          surveys back me up.
              (beat)
          you're counting on jordan to help you get
          the black vote, women, college kids -- my
          gut instinct says he won't -- and arthur
          holding the center -- where he's soft at
          best. and who's to say the president
          won't throw troops into another third-
          world skirmish, pushing his sidekick's
          approval ratings up into the eighties
          again, and the campaign off the front
          pages?




                                                8/18/03    21.








                         utly

               we're confident this is a winning ticket,
               ellie.

                         ellie

               what's your margin of error? five
               points? three?
                   (beat)
               i can swing that, and you know it. i can
               swing seven away from you -- more than
               enough to split the party and --

                         senator wells

                   (over her)
               -- and deny us the white house for four
               more years? no. not even you would do
               that, senator. you're bluffing.
     ellie stares at them. outside, suddenly: the marching band
     begins playing "it's a grand old flag," and hurries out onto
     the roaring convention floor ...

                         ellie

               america is facing the greatest test of
               its history, gentlemen. not just from
               terrorist organizations both outside and
               within our borders, but from covert
               alliances of disaffected nations so
               terrified of winding up on our shit list
               they believe the only way to protect
               themselves is to hit us with everything
               they can find before we get around to
               them. am i the only one in this room
               paying attention to the nsa reports? we
               are on the brink of nuclear cataclysm, on
               our own soil, while our policies remain
               shackled by jordan-style one worlders who
               insist that human beings are essentially
               good ... and that power is something
               shameful, and evil.
                   (then)
               make no mistake, the people of this great
               country are frightened. they know what's
               coming. they can feel it. and we can
               shovel them the same old shit and call it
               sugar, or arm them, with a young,
               vibrant, populist congressman, a war hero
               with heart -- forged by enemy fire, in
               the desert, in the dark, when american
               lives hung in the balance.
