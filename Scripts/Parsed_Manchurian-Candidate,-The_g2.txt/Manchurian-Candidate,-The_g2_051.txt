95     int. train corridor - as before                                95

       -- marco catches himself, hands against the bulkhead wall
       near the bathroom. another passenger squeezes past him,
       headed in the opposite direction. marco tries the bathroom
       door. locked. occupied.




                                                8/18/03   52.







marco reaches into his pocket for a plastic vial of
medicine. tries to shake one of the tiny pills out, but --
a burly passenger in the bathroom emerges and the door
smacks marco hard across the back --
-- the pills scatter onto the floor --

                    marco

          ow dammit --

         big man                               marco

sorry. i didn't know you          it's okay.     it's okay.
were --
-- marco's down on his knees, struggling to gather the pills
together and put them back in the plastic vial. the big man
goes.

rosie

sinks down next to him.   calm.   deftly plucking the pills
from the floor.

                    rosie

          my mother would tell you to wash these.
marco looks up at her blankly.    she takes the vial, caps it,
gives it back.

                    rosie

          i didn't mean to upset you.

                    marco

          it's not you, it's me. i'm not -- my
          head --
              (gestures uselessly)
          -- nothing's ...
              (stares at her)
          i wish i smoked.

                    rosie

          it's way overrated.
they stare at each other.   then:

                    marco

          rosie, i'm gonna go in here, wash my
          face, take my pill, and get myself
          together.
marco ducks into the bathroom and shuts the door.




                                                    8/18/03   53.
