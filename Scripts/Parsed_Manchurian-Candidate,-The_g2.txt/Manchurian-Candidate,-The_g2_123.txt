195   int. grand ballroom - on the giant screen, above the stage      195

      remote-cam images of the empty stage and podium blink to
      life, enormous, finding focus, and --

      at the back of the ballroom - engineering console

      a director and a team of tech guys murmur in headsets,
      commanding a matrix of monitors, control panels and mixing
      boards. on all the screens: different views of the empty
      stage, from various cameras.

      just like anderson's.   pan up:
      marco -- resplendent in dress uniform, hair trimmed, a man
      reborn. he looks so rejuvenated, for a moment even we don't
      recognize him.
