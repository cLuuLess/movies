     at the far end of a long and gloomy hallway, we can see
     marco arrive at the door to melvin's room. he hesitates,
     then knocks --

                          marco

               al?   al melvin, it's marco ...
     nothing. he looks at his watch, turns, walks back down the
     narrow, high-ceilinged corridor -- haunting sounds of radios
     and televisions and broken conversations -- he disappears
     down the stairs --
