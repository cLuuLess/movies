       marco sits at a window, eyes closed, head pressed to the
       glass, the world just a blur beyond him. he opens his eyes,

       sees:


       laurent tokar

       sitting down across from him.   smiling.

                           laurent

                     (french accent)
                 is this seat taken?

                                                             skip
