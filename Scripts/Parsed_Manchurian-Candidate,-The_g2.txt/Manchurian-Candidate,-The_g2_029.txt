63   int./ext. d.c. botanical gardens - day                        63

     festive champagne brunch. lush indoor foliage. the capitol
     dome visible in the b.g. huge, graphic banners declaim the
     campaign slogan: secure tomorrow and the ticket: arthur-

     shaw.

     an elegant all-woman harp orchestra plays new-age patriotic
     music, and a thick crowd of wealthy party inner circle
     members jostle between elegant food stations, or cue up for
     thirty seconds with presidential-hopeful robert arthur.

     moving with - marco

     who has two retired, old bastard generals in his company,
     stars gleaming on their shoulders. marco's eyes scan the
     room; he's a man on a mission:

                         general sloan

               no offense, major, but it chaps my ass we
               gotta have a babysitter.

                         marco

               sir, i'm just here to keep you from
               getting into fist-fights with the navy
               guys.
     the old generals laugh, appreciate this.    marco stops --
     eureka -- he's found his target:

     marco's p.o.v. - across the huge room - raymond

     holding side-show vice-presidential court for some enamored
     young women and their banker husbands. secret service
     agents, including his everpresent anderson, maintaining a
     careful perimeter.

                         general wilson (o.s.)

               major marco --

     marco and the generals

     marco forced to pull his gaze away from raymond:

                         general wilson

               -- this army of two's gonna do some recon
               on the no host bar.




                                             8/18/03    31.








                      marco

            right behind you, sirs.
whereupon

senator eleanor shaw

powers through with gillespie and a couple of our media
flaks, giving them an earful:

                      ellie

            -- billions of dollars, thousands of
            troops, sacrificed on behalf of a
            disastrous foreign policy which has only
            served to galvanize our enemies --

          ellie                             marco

excuse us please --               whoa --
for an instant ellie and marco lock eyes -- then the crowd
swallows her again --

                      general wilson

            they oughta put up a crossing guard.

                      general sloan

            or rig her with an air horn.

with raymond

-- distractedly staring at a pretty young woman (jocelyn
jordan) near the entrance.

                      raymond

                (to the bankers and wives)
            i mean -- that's supposed to be the whole
            point of this great country, isn't it?
            that everybody matters. not just the
            people at this party -- no offense -- but
            the people who can't afford to be here.

                      ellie

                (arriving:)
            raymond --
                (to the couples)
            -- sorry to interrupt --
but she's not.   slipping her arm through his and steering
him away...

                      ellie

            you must learn not to let yourself get
            cornered by the bottom-feeders.

                      raymond

            including you?




                                             8/18/03   32.








                    ellie

          i devour everything in my path, darling,
          top or bottom, you know that.
...to join a lively group of corporate heavyweights. david
donovan is a man possessed of a commanding presence,
radiating charm, brilliance and stealth. j.b. (jay)
johnston is younger than the others, a three-sport letterman
who graduated with distinction from princeton and happily
works until there's no one left in the office to give
instructions to. mark whiting is gracious and warm.

                    ellie

          hello mark.
ellie greets whiting with a fondness she reserves for old
friends -- as a former tyler prentiss protégé, he now stands
comfortably at the fertile crossroads where big industry
meets big government, and profits soar.

                    whiting

          eleanor! congratulations, raymond. your
          grandad would be so goddamn proud of you.

                    raymond

          nice to see you mark.   thanks.
the following flows, overlapping, easy:

                    ellie

          -- raymond, this is j.b. johnston, from
          manchurian global --

                    raymond

          yes, hi --

                    ellie

          -- and david donovan, their managing
          director.

                    raymond

          -- and co-chair of the u.s. international
          policy caucus.

          donovan                           ellie

one and the same.                     (teasing)
                                  they're desperate to be of
                                  service to you, raymond.

                    raymond

          go away, mother. you've earned your fee.
raymond flashes a dazzling kennedyesque smile, as the men
chuckle appreciatively.

                    ellie

          the plucky idealist.




                                              8/18/03   33.







ellie glides off, unfazed.    the men banter on:

                    raymond

          gentlemen, how's business?

                    whiting

          good, raymond. business is good.

                    johnston

          could always be better.

                    raymond

          careful. any better, you'll be a
          monopoly.

                    donovan

          there's the challenge. maximizing the
          market share and potential of a company.

                    whiting

          or a country.
off their shared, collegial laughter --

across the room - marco - monets later

watches raymond take his leave from the manchurian global
guys -- while, at the bar, the generals have established
their beachhead of bloody marys with a couple of younger men
in navy whites:

                    rear admiral glick

          every great civilization has been
          anchored by a great navy.

                    general sloan

          bullshit. you guys are sea chum, ripe
          for some raghead with a rocket launcher
          to put a hole in your bucket.
marco laughs deliberately, trying to diffuse the tension.

                    marco

              (low)
          if you can't behave yourselves, generals,
          we're gonna spend the rest of the day
          watching the orioles game back at the
          hotel.
whereupon raymond parades past, with his secret service
handlers, oblivious to ben until he calls out.

                    marco

          congressman -- sergeant shaw --
raymond turning, but not stopping --




                                                   8/18/03   34.








                          marco

                ben marco.

                          raymond

                i know.
                    (strange, dreamy)
                hello captain.

               marco                              raymond

     it's major, and --                     (as if it surprises
                                             him:)
                                        i need to talk to you.
     but he keeps walking --

                           marco

                -- okay.
     -- marco frowns, watches raymond weave through the crowd
     towards jocie, at the entrance. marco follows, passing:

     ellie and jordan

     locked in fierce, low battle, off to one side, voices hard,
     rising out of the din:

                          jordan

                -- the political extortion you committed
                in order to destroy my vice presidential
                bid so that --

                           ellie

                tom.

                          jordan

                -- so that you might vicariously bask in
                reflected limelight from your son --

                          ellie

                    (overlapping)
                tom, please, just because the party felt
                a younger, more dynamic man could help
                the ticket, i don't think it's fair for
                you to single me out and --

                          jordan

                you know, i have such contempt for you,
                eleanor, that when i think of you, i
                actually fear for this country. raymond
                is nothing. a riddle. a wild card at
                worst. but you, you are the smiler who
                wraps her dagger in the cloak of the flag
                and waits for her chance to strike.
                which i pray will never come.
he wheels away --




                                                 8/18/03   35.
