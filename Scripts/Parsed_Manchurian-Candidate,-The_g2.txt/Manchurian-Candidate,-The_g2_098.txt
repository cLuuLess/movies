159   ext. chesapeake bay - jordan's kayak - day                        159

      the senator rows with confidence, his bow cuts the glassy
      surface of the bay, fog ripples away from him, dreamy.
      up ahead, he can see the ghost of his house.      and a figure
      on the shoreline.

                          jordan

                who's that?

                          raymond

                it's me, sir.

      jordan

      stops paddling, and lets the kayak drift in.      he's breaking
      hard, sweat glistening on his face.

      raymond

      sloshes down into the water, wades out waist-deep --

                           jordan

                wait.   oh, don't do that, i can --

                          raymond

                          jordan

                -- the water must be freezing. what are
                you doing? raymond. don't bother, i
                can --
      raymond catches the bow of the kayak, turns it.

                          raymond

                i'm sorry.

                            jordan

                i am too.    but, your mother must --
      with one motion, raymond rips the two-blade paddle out of
      jordan's hand, and flips the boat over --

                          raymond

                i'm sorry, sir.
      -- jordan goes under, legs trapped in the kayak --

      the cold water --
