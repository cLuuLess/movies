      same. raymond, his handlers, his secret service escort walk
      a gauntlet of news cameras, reporters lob questions from
      behind a barrier:

                          reporter #2

                congressman shaw! why do you and gov.
                arthur oppose deploying troops in
                indonesia?

                          raymond

                we can't clean up the world with dirty
                hands.

      moving with - marco

      as he keeps pace with raymond, walking, moving behind the
      reporters, weaving through the crowd.

                reporter #2                     reporter #3

      what about your mother's        is your mother helping or
      allegation that a nuclear       hurting your campaign?
      attack on this country from
      a secret alliance of rogue
      states is certain within two
      years?

                          raymond

                guys, i gave up a long time ago trying to
                second guess my mother. i'm just
                surprised the rest of you haven't.

                          marco

                do you ever dream about kuwait?
      heads turning to find marco, folder under his arm -- strange
      looks -- secret service poised to react, but raymond slows,
      looks -- sees marco. a cloud passing over his features:

                          raymond

                i can never remember my dreams.
      more questions lobbed out, overlapping, but raymond ignores
      them. marco pushes through as raymond assures anderson:

                          raymond

                -- it's okay. i know him, it's okay.
