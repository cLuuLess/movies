     is in a more formal setting -- lt. col. howard is with
     colonel garret and an enlisted soldier, a woman, taking
     notes --

                         marco

               i don't know, sir.
                   (cautious, now)
               it isn't so much what he said, or didn't
               say -- but his demeanor, his attitude.
               sir, i overheard an exchange he --

                         colonel garret

                   (talks over this)
               i think you hoped congressman shaw would
               say, "yes, major, i've had those same
               dreams. tomatoes and sandstorms. you're
               not nuts, there's some crazy shit going
               down here."
     marco says nothing.

                         colonel garret

               major, we've been down this road with you
               before, yes?

                         marco

               no, sir, not this road, sir. but i hear
               what you're saying, and i want to do this
               through the proper channels.

                         lt. col. howard

               are you back on your meds?

                         marco

               lt. colonel howard -- with respect --
               i've had a dozen years of experts telling
               me i've got gulf war syndrome, or a
               stress disorder. twelve years being a
               good soldier, denying what every nerve
               ending in my body tells me is more real
               than not. one dream, over and over. not
               variations on a dream, the same one,
               night after night after night --

                         lt. col. howard

               -- your guilt and your jealousy require
               you to construct this ... elaborate
               fiction, so that you --

no --                            -- can avoid the truth.

                     marco

           -- no sir. something happened to us, in
           the desert, ten years ago. not what we
           thought it was. and it happened on my
           watch.

                     colonel garret

           have you contacted any other members of
           the unit besides shaw and melvin? asked
           them about the dreams?

                     marco

               (from notes he's made)
           owens died of cancer in '97. villalobos,
           a car crash. atkins committed suicide.
           jamison was at the pentagon, 9-11, body
           never recovered. wilson i'm still trying
           to track down.
garret and howard trade looks.

                     marco

           sir, i know i can't ask you to talk to
           congressman shaw, not yet, but al melvin,
           it's a phone call, a quick q&a -- look at
           his notebooks, hear what he's been
           dreaming -- and either he will support
           the credibility of what i'm saying, or he
           won't. and i'll shut up.

                     colonel garret

           and what is it you are saying, exactly,
           major? that you misrepresented --
           falsified -- what happened in kuwait?
           about the medal of honor? in effect,
           committed perjury.

                     marco

           if you just talk to melvin --

                     colonel garret

               (ignores)
           -- no, no, i'm sorry -- you're saying an
           entire squad of u.s. army soldiers was
           hypnotized into believing that raymond
           shaw deserved the medal of honor. and
           somehow you're the only one who knows the
           truth.

                                                   8/18/03    39.








                            colonel garret

                  major marco. you will stay clear of
                  congressman shaw.

                             marco

                  yes sir.

                            lt. col. howard

                  and you will resume your meds, major.
                  that is an order.

                             marco

                  yes sir.
       beat.   marco stands up, to leave, but --

                            colonel garret

                  major, do you ever take a step back and
                  consider why you've remained at rank for
                  all these years? missed bosnia,
                  afghanistan, iraqi freedom. while men of
                  lesser promise and inferior talent have
                  enjoyed the fruits of those campaigns and
                  moved beyond you?

                            marco

                  every day, sir.
