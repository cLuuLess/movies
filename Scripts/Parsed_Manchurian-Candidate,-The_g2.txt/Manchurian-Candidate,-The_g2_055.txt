      emerges from the bathroom to find an irritated conductor now
      awkwardly trying to extract his key from the door, and rosie
      waiting.

                conductor                         rosie

      are you okay, sir?                ben?

                            marco

                ... yeah.

                         rosie

                jesus. you've been in here twenty
                minutes. i thought you'd fallen off.
      marco stares at rosie.    twenty minutes?   the train shudders
      to a halt --
