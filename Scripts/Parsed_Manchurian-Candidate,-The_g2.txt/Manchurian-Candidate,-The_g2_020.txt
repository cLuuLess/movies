       the same speech continues, largely ignored by congressman
       raymond prentiss shaw. still intense and moody, the new

       raymond shaw's suit is expensive and crisp, his hair
       perfect. he's playing solitaire. and winning.

                     (murmurs)
                 ... i am not a professional politician.
                 i am not a professional politician ...

                 -- because once we start overturning our
                 constitutional protections, our enemies
                 have won.

                           raymond

                 ... i am ... a professional politician.
                 not.
       knocking on his door -- it opens, and secret service agent
       evan anderson removes his key while sen. eleanor shaw,
       pretty and ageless, sweeps in -- closing the door on her
       aide (gillespie) --

                           ellie

                 raymond? darling, what were you going to
                 do, make me stand out there like room
                 service?
       -- soft curves conceal razor claws and titanium backbone --
       she kisses her son on the lips, straightens his collar, his
       tie, lets her hands smooth his shirt to his chest for a
       little too long, and never stops talking:

                           ellie

                 i asked downstairs and miss freeman, your
                 'wrangler' -- helpful ms. freeman -- said
                 you were up here practicing your speech.
                 honestly, i don't understand why you
                 insist upon isolating yourself, people
                 adore you, raymond, they crave your
                 company and yet here you are, holed up,
                 as if you were some kind of emotionally
                 challenged individual like your father
                 instead of raymond prentiss shaw, a
                 handsome, intelligent, people-loving war
                 hero with a great deal to offer to his
                 party and his country.

                           raymond

                 no.

                           ellie

                 no what? baby, i haven't even asked you
                 a question. your hair is too flat. and
                 that tie. the tie is wrong.




                                           8/18/03    16.








                    raymond

          no to the question you're going to ask.
          no to all the questions you pretend to
          want to ask --

                    ellie

              (the tie)
          something a little less busy.

                    raymond

          -- and no you may not engage in your
          usual back-door political thuggery to
          shovel me onto the presidential ticket.

                    ellie

          oh. you're not interested? i thought
          you were. did i miss my cue?

                    raymond

          of course i'm interested -- i wouldn't be
          here if i wasn't -- but not if it means
          attacking the reputation of a statesman
          like thomas jordan, which i'm sure was
          your plan. let democracy run its course,
          mother. let the people decide.
now ellie stares at him, mouth agape.

                      raymond

          what.

                    ellie

          i'm sorry, for a second there i thought
          it was your father speaking -- that
          dreaded shaw blood rising -- and the
          stink of defeat made me nauseous.

                      raymond

          mother --

                    ellie

          and excuse me, when have i ever attacked
          the honorable mr. jordan, despite the
          shameful way his daughter misled you that
          summer at the shore.

                    raymond

          mother, you chased her away --

                    ellie

          if that's how you want to remember it.

                    raymond

          -- you ruined everything.




                                                   8/18/03   17.








                           ellie

                 honey, you're oversimplifying things
                 somewhat -- but, yes, okay -- i promise,
                 promise i will stay out of it. you have
                 my word.
       raymond stares at her.

                           ellie

                 after all, you're young and you have
                 plenty of party conventions ahead of you
                 in which to discover, as your father did,
                 that democracy is an elusive and
                 imperfect science, and the meek do not
                 happily inherit the earth, but simply get
                 eaten by the alpha dogs, chewed up,
                 digested and deposited on the carefully
                 mown parkways of american politics.
       raymond rolls his eyes.   she ruffles his hair again, heads
       into the bedroom.

                           ellie (o.s.)

                 one day, you will, i'm sure, tearfully
                 memorialize me in your acceptance speech.
                 don't you have a different tie in here?
                 your grandfather always let me pick his
                 ties.
       raymond smooths his hair back down.

                           raymond

                 i'm wearing the one i have on.
       no response.

       raymond is speaking. his tie is different. so is he: now
       he exudes a telegenic warmth and vivacity, his manner
       confident, easy, open.

                 i've always said i am not a professional
                 politician, although i hold, and have
                 been held -- well, hugged -- in elected
                 office --
                     (a winning smile:)
                 -- you all know my mother, senator
                 eleanor prentiss shaw ...
       a chorus of cheers, and appreciative laughter -- he's won
       them over already --
