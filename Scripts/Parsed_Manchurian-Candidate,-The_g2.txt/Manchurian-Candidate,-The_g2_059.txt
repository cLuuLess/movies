104   int. bathroom - marco                                             104

      hyper, rummaging through the vanity, searching for -- pair
      of cuticle scissors, tweezers, anything sharp -- a little
      basket of sample perfumes crashes into the sink --

                          rosie (o.s.)

                    (knocking loudly)
                ben, what's going on -- are you okay --?
      marco finds a razor blade -- twisting it clumsily in his
      fingers to reach the slight bump on his back he can only
      barely see in the mirror --

105   intercut - rosie - outside the door                               105

      -- rosie's knocking harder, now.

                          rosie

                ben, i need you to open this door.    okay?
                just for a sec.
                    (beat)
