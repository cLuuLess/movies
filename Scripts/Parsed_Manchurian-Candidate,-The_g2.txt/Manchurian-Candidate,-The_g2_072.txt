      marco with howard, who's visibly upset. he likes marco, it
      breaks his heart to watch him unravelling like this. agent
      volk remains in her chair, on the other side of the room:
      the door opens, and col. garret comes in, with agent
      goldring, who gives marco back his personal effects, and:

                          agent goldring

                goodbye.
                    (to marco)
                get out of here.

                          lt. col. howard

                he's free to go?

                          agent goldring

                shaw won't press charges, and he's got
                juice with important friends. it's
                today's daily double.
      agent volk closes her notebook and moves past goldring as he
      picks up the tape recorder. she glances at howard, and
      leaves the room.

      a beat.   marco, trying to process all this:

                          colonel garret

                major, you have reached the terminal end
                of the army's patience. you're relieved
