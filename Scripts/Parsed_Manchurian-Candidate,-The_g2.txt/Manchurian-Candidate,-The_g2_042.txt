77   int. raymond's hotel suite - night                                77

     raymond stares --

     the phone

     mom on hold, flashing red light.     the second call, light
     fluttering --




                                           8/18/03   43.








raymond

punches the line, lifts the receiver --

                     raymond

          yes?

                    voice on the phone

              (british accent)
          sergeant shaw?

                    raymond

              (irritably)
          who is this?
close on raymond's ear --

                    voice on the phone

          sergeant raymond shaw?
beat. raymond's puzzled. cocks his head, eyes searching
the corners of the room. sound: a distant desert wind,
building. then:

                     raymond

          yes ...?
close on raymond's eye --

                    voice on the phone

          raymond prentiss shaw?
-- raymond's senses appear to quicken now, as the lighting
in the room changes, morphing somehow -- even as sounds of
steady percussion, and the zaghareet -- the wailing cry of
the arab women -- rise out of the wind --

                    raymond

              (eyes alight)
          yes.
-- everything is brighter, sharper, more luminous -- more
etched than it was just moments ago --

                    voice on the phone

          listen:
              (then)
          enter the bathroom, and go to the closet
          there.

wide - the suite

raymond moves with tremendous assurance across the living
room and down the hallway and into the bathroom --




                                                   8/18/03   44.








     the phone

     light flashing, eleanor on hold -- stops --
