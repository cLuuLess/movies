175   int. p.s. 16 - special ed. room - day                         175

      small, and private. raymond turns on the light. marco is
      in the corner, waiting. his noyle file in one hand.

                          marco

                how's your back?

                            raymond

                it hurts.

                          marco

                i'm sorry.
      raymond locks the door, turns, takes in the room: tiny
      chairs and tables, walls covered with kids' drawings, and
      nearly every object in the room named and labelled with 3x5
      cards.

                          raymond

                i've been having the dreams, ben.

                          marco

                that's good.

                          raymond

                good? they're inside my head. they got
                inside, the way you said they would --

                          marco

                we'll get 'em out.




                                                    8/18/03   103.








                          raymond

                they're all ... twisted together -- and i
                dream things, terrible things, that can't
                possibly have happened. i'm gone, ben --
                i'm losing it --

                          marco

                no -- you could have had me locked up --
                and you didn't. that's a sign.

                           raymond

                of what?

                          marco

                that they don't control everything. we
                can fight it. i mean -- i'm still out
                here because you decided i should be --
                which means there's a part they can't get
                to, deep inside -- the part where the
                truth is, and they can't touch us there.
                that's what we need to tap into, raymond,
                that's the part where, you and me, we're
                gonna take them out.

                          raymond

                jocie's dead.

                           marco

                i know.

                          raymond

                -- and the senator.

                           marco

                yeah.
      beat.

                          raymond

                did i do it?

                          marco

                i think so, yeah.

                          raymond

                i don't remember.     i don't remember it.
      raymond looks up at ben.     emotionless.   uncomprehending.
