101   int. rosie's cousin's apartment - night                        101

      rosie lets marco in. it's incredibly cramped, everything in
      one room, window facing a brick wall, lots of play posters.

                          rosie

                -- it's my cousin's apartment. she's in
                cleveland with the road company of 'mamma
                mia.' there's ... a view of the park ...
                if you go out on the fire escape and
                kinda ... tilt your head ...
      marco puts down the suitcases and waits in the middle of the
      room while rosie takes off her coat, turns on some lights.

                          rosie

                i'm nervous. i'm sorry.   i yak when i
                get nervous.

                           marco

                 me, i get quiet.
      another awkward beat.    she stands there.   studying him.

                             rosie

                 you okay?

                           marco

                 dreams, i've been having these --
      catches himself.   that's just how melvin said it.

                           rosie

                 is that what happened on the train?

                             marco

                 sort of.
      beat.

                           marco

                 i could be dreaming you.

                           rosie

                 what if you are?

                           marco

                 you'd be the best dream i've had in a
                 long time, rosie.
      beat.   rosie smiles at him.

                           rosie

                 if that's a line, ben marco, it kinda
                 worked.
