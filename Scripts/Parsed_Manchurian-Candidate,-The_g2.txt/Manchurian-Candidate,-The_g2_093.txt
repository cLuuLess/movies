150   int. small conference room - dusk                             150

      jordan sits behind the table, all of marco's documents and
      evidence arranged tidily in front of him in meager piles,
      marco pacing, watching as jordan finishes examining a thick
      atticus noyle computer print out.

                          jordan

                nobody will believe this.

                          marco

                nobody believed watergate.
      he sits down, opposite jordan.

                          marco

                or oklahoma city, or the world trade
                center. you wouldn't have believed
                oswald before kennedy got shot.

                          jordan

                on the advisory board of manchurian-
                global, should they ever publish a list --
                which they won't -- you would find former
                presidents, deposed kings, retired prime
                ministers, ayatollahs, african war-lords,
                fallen communist dictators and an
                assortment of the fucking rich, who are
                distinguished from the merely filthy rich
                by factors of billions.
      he puts the noyle file down, pushes everything away.

                          jordan

                you bring me rumors and conjecture.

                          marco

                i started with nightmares, sir. rumors
                and conjecture are a giant leap forward.

                          jordan

                nightmares you've interpreted, using as
                primary resources a) your spotty memory,
                b) the internet -- sacred sanctuary of
                idiots and nutters -- and c) random faces
                and coincidences, and evidence you chewed
                out of a man's back -- all neatly
                stitched together with the common thread
                of a powerful, well-connected private
                equity fund -- who will plead ignorance,
                and be shocked, shocked, to learn what

                           jordan (cont'd)

                 some of their subsidiary partners are
                 engaged in.

                           marco

                 sir, i don't give a rat's ass about
                 manchurian global! that's not why i'm
                 here!
                     (beat)
                 i can't touch them, i get that, i'm not
                 stupid, sir.
       a cold silence.   marco stares at jordan.

                           marco

                 i just want to try and stop this one
                 thing -- this raymond shaw bomb -- from
                 going off.
       jordan nods again, slightly.    lost in thought.

                           marco

                 and i'd be lying if i told you i hadn't
                 factored in huge that you've got a vested
                 personal, political, and patriotic
                 interest in how this shakes out.
