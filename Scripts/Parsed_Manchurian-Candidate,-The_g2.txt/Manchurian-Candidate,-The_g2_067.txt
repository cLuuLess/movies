119   int. raymond's private office - campaign hq - dusk             119

      huge posters featuring raymond's face, emblazoned with
      secure tomorrow, stacked against the wall. a desk covered
      with papers and enough take-out chinese food for ten people,
      and raymond sits behind it, nursing a glass of wine, and
      pointedly ignoring melvin's notebook, while:

                          raymond

                i kill mavole?

                          marco

                it's a dream --

                           raymond

                no.

                          marco

                -- could mean something else.

                           raymond

                no.

                          marco

                -- could be i'm just supposed to think
                you did.

                          raymond

                -- i killed the enemy. i didn't know
                them, either. so it was okay. and,
                anyway, i remember what we did in kuwait,
                i remember it perfectly. but now that
                you mention it, i don't remember doing it
                ... exactly.

                          marco

                maybe you didn't.

                           raymond

                no.   what a thought.
      now he picks up the dream book. marco watches. raymond
      flips through the pages for a moment, dismissively. then
      stops at something melvin has drawn. frowns. raises his
      eyebrows. closes it, sets it down:

                          raymond

                life is so bizarre, isn't it? this
                absurd campaign, the sordid world of
                politics, my whole public life and
                persona -- sometimes, occasionally, for
                an instant, the fog clears and i look and
                i think, what am i doing? i mean, what
                the fuck am i doing? posing and grinning
                like a goddamn sock puppet, shaking hands
                with total strangers who must be blind if

                          (more)





                                            8/18/03    66.








                    raymond (cont'd)

          they can't see what i am, at the core.
          what my mother has made me.
raymond looks steadily at marco ... who nods, interested:

                    raymond

          a prentiss. ferociously, a prentiss --
          but not a shaw, god forbid -- i was
          molded by cold hard hands, every detail
          of my existence preordained. can you
          even imagine, ben, how it would feel
          never to have a say in what your life
          would be? i was twenty years old before
          i had a friend -- no, worse, a girlfriend
          -- well, almost -- but, yes, a friend, or
          i thought so -- outside my mother's
          circle of approved encounters -- and it
          didn't -- she wouldn't -- precipitating
          my one act of rebellion, storming off and
          enlisting --
              (grimaces)
          -- in the army. which, ironically, only
          served ultimately to pad my gilded
          prentiss resume. you know: "fluent in
          five languages, phi beta kappa,
          congressional medal of honor, blah blah
          blah."
              (beat)
          and after the war i came back to her.
          and the family legacy. this. mother
          calls it, "fulfilling my manifest
          prentiss destiny."

                    marco

          why did you come back, raymond?   what
          happened?

                    raymond

          what?
seeming startled, raymond's reverie is broken.     his eyes
harden as he refocuses on marco.

                    raymond

          weren't you listening? mother happened.
              (then)
          you know, the truth is, i hate it. i've
          always despised it.

                    marco

              (lost)
          which?

                    raymond

          the medal. the cloying adulation of the
          little people. your pitiful jealousy --




                                 8/18/03    67.








          marco

who said i was jealous?

          raymond

i don't have the dreams, ben.

          marco

how can you not remember saving the unit?

           raymond

i do.   i said i did.

          marco

you said you don't remember doing it.

          raymond

ha ha, don't mix me up, i'm tired, and --
fine. it's like this. it's as if i know
what will happen, ben, but i never get to
the part where i feel that it actually
did happen. but i think that's probably
perfectly normal.

          marco

did you ever talk to anybody about this
little discrepancy?

          raymond

what? no. who would i ask? my old army
"buddies," who love and adore me for
saving their pathetically unimportant --
present company excluded -- asses?

          marco

no.  you ask army intelligence.
    (getting excited)
look, we can go together, tomorrow. you
tell them what you just told me,
everything you do remember, what you
don't "exactly" remember, about kuwait,
let 'em run some tests on you --

          raymond

i'm sure the press would have a field day
with that.

          marco

raymond. they put an implant in me. i
found it yesterday. maybe they put one
in you.

          raymond

    (horrified)
nobody's put anything in me.




                                             8/18/03   68.








                    marco

          great. let's prove it. we can go get an
          x-ray -- we can check it right now --
marco moves toward him, raymond backs away --

                    raymond

          i want to be supportive of you, ben, i
          do, but --

                    marco

          just check your back, raymond --

                    raymond

          -- this can wait until after the
          election.

                    marco

          what are you afraid of?   see if there's a
          bump.

                    raymond

          you should leave.   this is not, this is
          not --

                    marco

          -- just check --

                    raymond

              (without checking)
          there's nothing there!
marco lunges at raymond -- they fall, together, over the
desk, onto the floor -- chinese food scattering.

                    marco

          somebody was in your head, with big steel-
          toe boots, a couple of cable cutters and
          a chainsaw, and they went to town!
          neurons got wasted, circuits rewired,
          brain cells obliterated --
knocking at the door:

                    anderson (o.s.)

          congressman shaw?

                    marco

          -- you don't even know what they did!
          you don't -- you can't conceive what they
          did to you -- and you're worried about
          some lame-ass reporters!?
-- where marco (stronger, better-trained) wraps raymond in a
headlock, rips raymond's shirt from the shoulder --




                                                  8/18/03   69.








                           marco

                 if i'm wrong they can put me the fuck
                 away --

                           anderson (o.s.)

                 -- are you okay?

                           raymond

                 ben --

                           marco

                 -- there -- there's -- something --
       insistent knocking at the door. marco claws at the skin on
       raymond's back -- sinks his teeth in --
       -- raymond shakes him off, and marco slams into the wall.
       the office door bangs open --
       anderson and other agents swarm marco -- there's blood
       smeared on marco's mouth, his jaws are clenched --

                           anderson

                     (disbelief)
                 he bit him.
                     (at raymond)
                 sir, did he bite you?

                           raymond

                 no.
       marco -- shoved to the floor -- twisted -- handcuffed --
       blood smearing across the carpet -- his eyes wild with
       adrenaline and fear --
       raymond -- his hand goes to his back -- his eyes lock with
       marco's for an instant -- then marco is hustled out the
       door.

                           anderson

                 sir --

                           raymond


                 nothing happened!

       horrified campaign workers crane necks to see inside. mute
       with shock, raymond pulls his hand away from his back.
       hides the blood.
