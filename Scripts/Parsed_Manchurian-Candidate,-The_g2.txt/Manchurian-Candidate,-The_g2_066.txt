118   ext. arthur/shaw n.y. campaign office - late afternoon      118

      through the windows see a crowded clutter of desks, phone
      volunteers, stacks of pamphlets. a giant secure tomorrow
      logo looms above, flanked by beaming likenesses of robert
      arthur and raymond shaw. anderson comes out and opens the
      limo door for raymond. marco struggles out behind him:

                          raymond

                am i in your dreams?

                          marco

                yeah.

                          raymond

                doing what?

                          marco

                    (evasive)
                -- you know.
      raymond steps just outside the entrance to his office.

                          raymond

                saving everybody?
      pedestrians pass between them on the crowded sidewalk.




                                             8/18/03   64.








                    marco

          it's more complicated than that.
marco reaches into his folder, pulls out one of melvin's
notebooks --

                    marco

          people just don't have the same dreams
          accidentally --
              (holds out the notebook)
          -- melvin made drawings, he wrote down
          what he dreamed, this is one of his
          notebooks -- it's all in here.
-- and raymond's staring at the notebook without taking it,
the way marco once did with melvin. anderson and mirella --
the staffers in the office -- are all staring at marco the
same way the boy scouts once stared at melvin.

                    raymond

          i don't have dreams, captain.
              (then, gently:)
          maybe you should ... see somebody -- talk
          to somebody who specializes in this kind
          of thing --

                    marco

          i've been to doctors.
... which is exactly what melvin said to him.

                     marco

          okay.   okay, i'm sorry.
marco nods again, numb, makes a vague resigned gesture.

                    marco

          i'm not crazy, shaw.
he jams the notebook back into his folder, starts to walk
away.

                    raymond

              (calls after)
          captain --
              (then)
          -- major.
              (then)
          ben.
marco stops, turns.

                    raymond

          are you hungry?




                                                 8/18/03    65.
