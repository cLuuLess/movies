94     int. bullet train to new york - day                            94

       marco opens his eyes -- head pressed to a window, the world
       a blur beyond him -- sees:
       nothing. an empty seat opposite him. laurent was a dream.
       marco looks around, self-conscious, and --

       through the seats - a woman's face

       staring back at him. not enough to tell much more than
       she's pretty. marco looks away, out the window. then back.
       she's gone. another dream?

                           woman's voice (rosie)

                 maryland's a beautiful state.
       marco jumps -- looks. the pretty woman is sitting down
       opposite him, folding and pushing aside a newspaper with the
       headline: white house insists war on terror is still

       winnable. cost of peruvian campaign hits $100 billion.





                                           8/18/03    50.







below the fold: angry mob kills muslim student at yale.

                    marco

          this is delaware.

                    rosie

          i know. but, maryland, it's a beautiful
          state anyway.
he's staring at her, trying to figure out --

                    rosie

          paper or plastic.

                      marco

          what?

                    rosie

          from the grocery store. you were
          wondering where, we, you know -- and
          right at the check-out stand, "paper or
          plastic," that's me. i see you all the
          time. bennett marco. checks from the
          first national bank, and you always put
          your spare change into the march of dimes
          thing.
              (beat)
          romance novels, instant noodles, no-doz
          and tomatoes.
              (marco frowns)
          anyway, i'm on vacation, holiday in the
          city and so forth, i saw you sitting here
          ... i thought, okay, girl -- it's now or
          never.
beat.

                    rosie

          you headed to new york city?

                      marco

          yeah.

                      rosie

          business?

                    marco

          no. guy i knew ... in the army. he's in
          politics now. we've kinda lost touch.
              (awkward beat, then)
          what's your name?

                      rosie

          eugenie.

                    marco

          'scuse me?




                                                     8/18/03   51.








                             rosie

                  yeah.   crazy french pronunciation and
                  all.

                            marco

                  it's pretty.

                             rosie

                  thanks.

                            marco

                  i guess your friends call you jenny.

                            rosie

                  not yet they haven't, thank god.   but you
                  can call me jenny.

                            marco

                  what do your friends call you?

                            rosie

                  rosie. my full name is eugenie rose.
                  i've always liked the rosie part better.
                  eugenie is, well, fragile.

                            marco

                  still. when i asked you your name, you
                  said it was eugenie.

                           rosie

                  yeah. well. maybe 'cause i was feeling
                  fragile. at the time.
       beat.   their eyes lock.   marco blinks --
fb94   flash: pfc. bobby baker -- stares back at him from where   fb94
       rosie was sitting. bullet hole in his forehead and a small,
       lost smile. reaching out to him --

                                                           blink.

       rosie -- as before.    slight look of puzzlement, because --
       marco -- is on his feet, rattled, moving out to the aisle --

                            marco

                  excuse me.
       -- and lurching toward the back of the train, nearly losing
       his balance as he goes through the sliding doors.
