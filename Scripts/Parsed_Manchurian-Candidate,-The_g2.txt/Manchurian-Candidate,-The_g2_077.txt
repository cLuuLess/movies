129   int. delp's lab - main floor - moments later                   129

      delp freaked and hyper, gathering wires and whatnot from
      shelves -- a veritable armload, as:

                          delp

                you sure you want to do this man?

                          marco

                yes.

                          delp

                -- because i don't.

                          marco

                i'll owe you one.




                                             8/18/03   77.







delp rounds a corner -- monkeys scrambling around their
cages as he comes to the clearing where

marco

sits on one of the experimental gurneys, using a pen to
write on his arm.

                    delp

          no. i'll still owe you for getting my
          sorry ass out of albania.

                    marco

          -- talk to me about the implant.

                    delp

          manchurian global. heard of 'em?
              (off marco:)
          private equity fund, specializes in
          military support services and weapons
          research ... including a certain army
          implant project that went belly-up in the
          early 90s.

                    marco

          you said the army implants were for
          medical emergency data.

                    delp

          the ones they publicized were. but, oh
          man, there was a parallel project of all
          kinds of scary implantable shit the
          clinton watchdogs finally freaked out
          over, and closed down.

                    marco

          how do you know all this?

                    delp

          cuz they funded me to make some of their
          scary shit.

                    marco

          what does it do?

                    delp

          i don't know. i don't want to know. you
          don't want to know -- shit -- it's out of
          you, and you're still alive. that's the
          good news.
              (off his arm)
          what are you doing?

intercut - marco's forearm

he's scrawling words on his palm, with a ballpoint pen:

rosie. raymond shaw. manchurian-global ...





                                           8/18/03     78.








                    marco

          back-up in case this makes me forget some
          stuff i want to remember.

delp

eases marco back on the gurney, deftly puts some i.v. taps
into his arms. marco's legs hang over the edge.

                    delp

          these are built for monkeys, so bear
          with me, man.

series of shots

he's putting thread-thin electrodes into marco's head, just
beneath the skin.

                    delp

          i'm putting you on a cocktail of
          methohexitol to take the edge off.

                    marco

          edge off what?

                    delp

          'getting clarity.' or whatever you want
          to call it -- ect not being the precise
          science that, say, leeching is.
wires snake across the floor to the ect [electro-convulsive
therapy] unit.

                    marco

          you don't think this is going to work.

                    delp

          it's the desperation move, man. but,
          hey. there is a school of thought, says
          a victim of induced abreaction -- or
          ultra-paradoxical brain activity, if
          you're at all correct about what happened
          to you -- can have it effectively
          dispersed by electroshock. unscrambled.

                    marco

          -- but?

                    delp

          but the legions of naysayers will tell
          you that if the initial work's done
          correctly -- if the brain's been not just
          washed, but dry-cleaned --
takes out a bite-guard and puts it in marco's mouth:




                                                 8/18/03   79.








                          delp

                -- fuhgetaboutit. no sale.
                    (then)
                try to relax, okay?
      he throws the switch, sending electric current through
      marco's head --
      -- marco's body arches off the table and he goes into
      seizure --

      images fade in and out:

fb129 -- a man in a gas mask jams his rifle butt down. fade        fb129

      out.

fba129-- black-clad soldiers swarm marco's team. fade out.        fba129
fbb129-- inside of a helicopter, grey light fluttering --         fbb129
      laurent, gas mask down, confers with a pilot. fade out.
fbc129-- jetting low across dark water as dawn breaks. fade       fbc129

      out.

fbd129-- impression of an abandoned village --                    fbd129
fbe129-- an abandoned beach --                                    fbe129
fbf129-- ruins of an ancient caravansary --                       fbf129
fbg129-- float down on the upturned face of noyle. fade out.      fbg129
fbh129-- marco's head slammed down, hard surface, a gun-like      fbh129
      electric implant device fires its package into the skin
      near marco's shoulder-blade. fade out.
fbi129-- impressions of melvin, baker, mavole, drugged, wired     fbi129
      up. fade out.
fbj129-- raymond releasing mavole's throat --                     fbj129
fbk129-- bobby baker, bloody hole in his forehead, falling        fbk129
      away --
fbl129-- the crazy pattern of the tile --                         fbl129
fbm129-- and marco running, rushing forward -- toward daylight,   fbm129
      past other platoon members, wires and i.v. tubes snaking
      upward, watching animated raymond shaw hero footage on a
      plasma screen, patriotic music blaring.
fbn129-- breaking outside, a glimpse of the azure sea waiting     fbn129
      there --
      -- but down, tackled ... fade out.
fbo129-- stumbling from helicopters into a rotor-torn             fbo129
      sandstorm -- the dust clearing to reveal ... weary,
      dazed, exhausted soldiers in the middle of nowhere, under   an
      angry sun ...
      ... the screen blooms white, and completely empty -- like an
      arabian desert --
