8   int. hummer - night - travelling                              8

    marco, bug-like in night goggles, drives the infamous
    highway of death -- a macabre landscape of abandoned cars,
    trucks, minivans, shopping baskets, broken wooden pushcarts
    and festering fires; pots and pans and clothes and personal
    belongings are scattered out into the desert on either side
    of the road. laurent rides shotgun. raymond is in the
    back, facing forward, rifle at ease.

                           raymond

               captain?

                           marco

               sergeant?

                         raymond

               why don't i ever ride in the bradley with
               the other enlisted personnel?




                                                       8/18/03   4.








                         marco

                   (hesitates)
               maybe i enjoy your company, sergeant.

                         raymond

               sir, i don't want to be singled out for
               special treatment because of my mother's
               position --

                         marco

               too late for that, shaw. as a charter
               member of the lucky sperm club your
               benefits include unlimited suck-up from
               high-ranking officers hoping to curry
               congressional favor for their future
               career moves. but. if you want to ride
               in the bradley, hey, i got no objections.

                         raymond

                   (worried)
               trust me, sir, i don't wish to ride in
               the bradley with the others, i'm just ...
                   (beat)
               the men don't care for me very much.

                         marco

               no, they don't. but. on the plus side,
               you don't really like them, either.

                         raymond

               that's absolutely correct, captain.

                            marco

               so.   see?    it, you know.   balances out.

                            laurent

               -- uh-oh.
     marco follows laurent's gaze out the side window --

9    night vision goggles: just over a dune                           9

     soldiers on camels slip along like ghosts, pacing the
     hummer, parallel at maybe fifty yards --

                                                         whip pan

     through the driver's side window: more of the camel cavalry
     tracks with them --

                             marco

               camels.      you gotta be kidding me.

10   back to - hummer - marco                                         10

     glancing to his rear-view mirror --




                                                 8/18/03    5.








11   in the mirror - on the road behind them:                       11

     two dark trucks converge suddenly out of the darkness, on
     either side of the bradley fighting vehicle --
     they slam together in a pincer-wedge just in front of it,
     and the bradley crashes into them -- climbs over them, off-
     balance, and smashes down onto the roof of one of the trucks
     and is effectively low-bridged -- tracks spinning, unable to
     move -- dark figures scurry from the trucks.
12   the hummer -- skids around in a tight 180, stops, facing       12
     back at the helpless bradley. automatic weapons fire in
     bursts, bright, and ricochet harmlessly away --
     in the hummer -- marco scrambles up out of his seat, pops
     the roof hatch and screams at raymond --

                         marco

               take the wheel, sergeant!
