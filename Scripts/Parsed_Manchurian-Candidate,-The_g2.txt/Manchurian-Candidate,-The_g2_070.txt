123   int. federal building - conference room - day                 123

      marco stares, troubled and sad, at bleak photographs of al
      melvin's bloated, waterlogged corpse.

                          marco

                i went to talk to him.   but he wasn't
                there.
      across from him are three impatient fbi agents (ramirez,
      goldring and jonas). ramirez has the notebook marco took
      from melvin's. goldring pushes a tiny digital tape recorder
      closer to marco:

                          agent goldring

                talk about what?
      marco hesitates -- looks to lt. col. howard, who sits
      grimly, off the one side, with col. garret.

                          agent goldring

                dreams?
      a lone woman, special agent volk, sits in a distant corner
      on a folding chair. she's implacable, staring intently at
      marco. ramirez holds up the notebook -- a page of crazy
      drawings and text.

                          marco

                yeah, there are hundreds more of those in
                his apartment. did your people check out
                his place --?

                          agent jonas

                colonel garret kindly showed us the file
                on you, marco, you're the shit: special
                forces. rangers. delta.

                          marco

                i wanted to talk to corporal melvin about
                some unanswered questions involving our
                reconnaissance mission in kuwait, back in

                '91 --


                          agent jonas

                    (talks over him)
                and he wasn't there, so, what -- you
                thought it'd be okay to break in and wait
                for him?
      marco carefully, respectfully stacks the photographs of
      melvin and turns them over. exchanges a glance with the
      female agent.




                                               8/18/03   73.








                     marco

               (at howard)
           i know this game. will you explain to
           them that i know this game?

                     agent ramirez

           oh right. army intelligence.   isn't that
           an oxymoron?

                      marco

           yeah.   kinda like 'special agent.'

                     colonel garret

           cut it out, major.

                     agent goldring

           what's your obsession with raymond shaw?

                     agent ramirez

           man of his dreams.

                     marco

           listen, you might want to advise your me
           to check for an implant in corporal
           melvin's back -- under the skin, just shy
           of the scapula, left side ... if he's not
           looking for it, he won't find it.
implant.   the feds just stare at him.   like he's nuts.

                     marco

           i didn't have anything to do with
           corporal melvin's death.

                     agent jonas

           yeah, well, that's your opinion, but
           judging from your file here, apparently
           you don't know your shit from your
           oatmeal, my friend --
marco snaps, spins out of his chair and lunges at jonas --
lt. col. howard and the other agents step between the two
men -- pull them apart --

                     lt. col. howard

               (re: jonas)
           get this man out of here.

                     agent jonas

               (taunting marco)
           go ahead, nutball. try it.
marco punches the agent so hard it knocks him down to the
floor between the other two.

                     agent jonas

           -- he hit me! fuck!




                                                  8/18/03   74.








                          marco

                he said i could.
      colonel garret shoves marco back into a chair, stays in the
      middle of the fracas, while --

                          lt. col. howard

                okay, okay --! that's enough.
                gentlemen, i need a moment with major
                marco. now.
      the federal agents retreat with their bloodied-nose, cold-
      cocked colleague, door slamming behind them.

                          ellie (v.o.)

                evidently this has been going on for
                years ...
      only agent volk remains, unmoved by what just occurred.
      close on - marco, catching his breath.

                          ellie (v.o.)

                ... sad little tin soldier.
