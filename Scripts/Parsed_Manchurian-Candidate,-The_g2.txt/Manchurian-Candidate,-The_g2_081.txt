      int. rosie's cousin's apartment - dawn

      rosie's purse is dumped out on the table, and now marco's
      going through her suitcase.
      he's dressed, now, even has his coat on.
      pulling out her clothing, discovering, at the bottom:

      file folders, notes, reports

      much of the same material that eleanor shaw showed raymond.
      incriminating stuff about marco, timetables, surveillance
      photographs, psychiatric evaluations and

      audio tapes

      microcassettes, neatly labelled with dates and hours ...

      intercut - subjective: same (b&w) - surveillance


                           rosie

                ben?
      rosie, rolling off the bed, sleepy, crossing to where marco
      is gathering the files --

                          rosie

                what are you ... oh god.
      sees the hard look on marco's face. newspapers over all the
      vents. opens her mouth to explain but marco swings hard,
      and hits her -- she partially blocks it with her forearm --
      backhands her onto the floor --

                          marco

                you're part of it.
      -- then he's moving, out the door --

                           rosie

                don't --




                                                    8/18/03   84.







      she leaps at him -- shoves him hard into the wall, and when
      he whirls to shake her off, slips down and uses his weight
      and momentum to toss marco crashing halfway back across the
      room.
      now she's between him and the door.

                          rosie

                don't do this, ben.    it's not what you
                think.

                          marco

                how can you know what i think?
      he tries to get past her again --

      they fight

      rosie can't beat him, but she's extremely skilled -- marco
      gets stung twice by hard rights -- but whirls, all-defense,
      an improvised rope-a-dope that gives him the opening he
      needs --
      -- he smacks rosie sharply, stunning her -- and as she rocks
      backward he flies out the door --

                          rosie


                ben!
