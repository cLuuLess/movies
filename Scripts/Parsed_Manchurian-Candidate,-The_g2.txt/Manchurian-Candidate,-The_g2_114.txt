176   intercut - corridor - rosie and anderson                       176

      down the hallway, standing sentinel. anderson checks his
      watch, glances uncomfortably back at the door -- then at
      rosie, who just stares him down.

      tears run down his face, but his voice is normal, he stays
      expressionless. he rubs his eyes with the heel of his hand.

                          raymond

                i'm all inside-out.
      knocking on the door.

                just a minute.
      raymond's cell phone rings.

                          raymond

                all i've ever done is what i was supposed
                to do. what i was told to do --

                          marco

                raymond -- focus --

                          raymond

                -- what others want me to do.

                          marco

                did they tell you what they want you to
                do, ray? we gotta know what's gonna
                happen, we gotta know when's it gonna
                happen -- you can help me do this --

                          raymond

                you don't think they saw this coming?
                you don't think they factored you in?
                    (matter of fact)
                i need to die, ben.

                          marco

                what? no -- no, man, they've got big
                plans for you --

                          raymond

                i'm the enemy, major marco, and the only
                way to stop me is to kill me. i thought
                you were smarter than this.

                          marco

                i can get the feds, the police.   come on,
                ray -- fight it --

                          raymond

                are we friends?

                raymond, you gotta work with me here --
      raymond takes the ringing phone from his inside pocket, and
      checks the number of who's calling.

                          raymond

                i want to believe we're friends.

                          marco

                raymond, stay focused. the irrefutable
                fact is that jocie was a mistake, and
                we're gonna make 'em pay for it.

                          raymond

                i dream you, ben. you kill private
                baker.
                    (into the phone, pleasant:)
                hello?

                          marco

                what are you talking about?

                          raymond

                    (into the phone)
                yes mother.
      a class bell rings --
