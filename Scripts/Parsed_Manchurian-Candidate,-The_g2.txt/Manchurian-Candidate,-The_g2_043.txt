80   int. a huge room beside raymond's suite - continuous          80

     -- where raymond is met by technicians in sterile gear,
     surgical gloves.
     he's entered some kind of portable, surreal operating
     theater, filled with monitoring device and computers ... a
     one-way video-conference camera is aimed at a big
     examination chair in one corner, surrounded by i.v. racks
     and more techno-medical equipment.
     the man who is obviously in charge here, starts a digital
     timer and turns to face raymond. it's noyle.

                           noyle

                 hello raymond. do you remember me?

                           raymond

                 no sir.

                           noyle

                 brilliant.
                     (to his group)
                 we have twenty minutes for our little
                 check up from the neck up.
