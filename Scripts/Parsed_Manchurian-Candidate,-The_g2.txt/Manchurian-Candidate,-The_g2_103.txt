        donovan walking beside senator eleanor prentiss shaw.
        whiting just behind them.

                            donovan

                  you trusted us to bring your son back to
                  you, and we deliver. we trusted you with
                  our technology -- and now you turn him
                  into a common hit man.

                oh, don't lecture me --

                          donovan

                you didn't even ask us.   you needed to
                ask.

                tom jordan was going to destroy
                everything we've worked toward, and every
                one of us along with it, and you want me
                to call a meeting?

                          whiting

                david, if jordan had gone public --

                          donovan

                in any endeavor, there are key players
                and role players, and raymond -- or you,
                or me, for that matter -- i'm sorry -- we
                are role players, with fixed values and
                fixed agendas, that get weighed against
                other factors.
      ellie stops, looks at him.

                bullshit.
                    (then)
                you can tell yourself that as you go to
                bed tonight, david, and i hope it helps
                you wake up tomorrow with a clean
                conscience -- but we are talking about my
                son and the future of this country.
                    (beat)
                my father, tyler prentiss, never asked.
                he just did what needed to be done.
