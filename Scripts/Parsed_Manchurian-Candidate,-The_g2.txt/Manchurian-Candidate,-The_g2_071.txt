      ellie eats, while raymond flips through marco's extensive
      file: cross-agency surveillance, army psychological
      profiling, fbi updates. repeated buzzwords like: "mentally
      unstable," "obsessed with raymond shaw," "delusional,"
      "borderline functional," "acute stress disorder ..."

                isn't it disgraceful the way troubled
                individuals are allowed to simply walk
                around with the rest of us until
                something horrible happens? another
                failure of the hmos. i'm thinking of
                sponsoring a bill, with senator friedman
                of rhode island --

                          raymond

                -- i don't care.

                well, imagine how terrified your people
                were yesterday when major marco showed up
                at the airport and you invited him -- my
                god, invited him -- to tag along.
                knowing what they knew.

                          raymond

                i know him. i served under him.   he was
                a good man.

                that's what the neighbors always say
                about serial killers.
      raymond stares at an old photograph of marco: curled up in a
      fetal position, on a v.a. hospital bed.

                    (sighs)
                perhaps we could arrange a promotion to a
                less stressful posting. somewhere
                tropical.
