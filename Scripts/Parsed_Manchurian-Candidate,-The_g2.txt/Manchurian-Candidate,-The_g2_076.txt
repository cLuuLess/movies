132     int. rosie's cousin's apartment - night                       132

        marco wakes up, still in a bed. alone. the room bathed in
        blue light from the small television where the news drones.

        rosie comes out of the bathroom, wearing a long new york
        rangers jersey, bare-legged, barefoot, hair wet from a
        shower. beautiful.

                            marco

                  it's wednesday.

                            rosie

                  yes.

                            marco

                  central park was monday.   i came home
                  friday.

                            rosie

                      (smiles)
                  that's right.
        a long beat. marco stares at the t.v. as she sits on the
        edge of the bed, rubs her hair with a towel.

                            marco

                  how did i get here?

                            rosie

                  you called me.

                            marco

                  el dorado 59970.
                      (beat)
                  i remembered.
                      (beat)
                  i remember, and i didn't dream.

                            rosie

                  it's been weird, talking to you. knowing
                  that you could fall asleep with your eyes
                  open and wake up and have forgotten the
                  whole conversation. i hope to god that
                  part's over.

                            marco

                  what'd we talk about?




                                                   8/18/03   82.








                           rosie

                     (vague)
                 stuff.
                     (then)
                 you said you "loved" me. not to scare
                 you. out of nowhere, but more than once.

                           marco

                 i remember that.
      beat.   she smiles.   she leans in, kisses him lightly.

                             rosie

                 liar.

                           marco

                 what else did we talk about?
      rosie opens her mouth --

                                             screen goes black.

      two beats of silence, then --
