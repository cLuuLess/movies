               int. catacombs - night

               o'connell, jonathan and ardeth ray slosh their way down the 
               watery catacomb, crazies pouring in behind them. up ahead, a 
               light suddenly shines in from another cistern hole, and then 
               more of the infected crowd drop down, screeching like rats.

               o'connell jags right, pushing jonathan and ardeth ray ahead 
               of him, he strikes a match off the wall, lights the nubby 
               fuse on a stick of dynamite, throws it, and runs like hell.

               fire blast incinerates a bunch of crazies.

               street - alley - night

               the explosion blows a cistern cover fifty feet into the air, 
               followed by a mass of flammage...
