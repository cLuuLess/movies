               int. labyrinth corridor - night

               the ground under o'connell, evelyn and jonathan starts to 
               shake. then suddenly, right in front of them, -- hundreds of 
               chittering scarab beetles boil up out of the sand. start 
               scurrying towards them. evelyn screams. jonathan screams.

               even o'connell almost screams. they turn around and haul 
               ass.
