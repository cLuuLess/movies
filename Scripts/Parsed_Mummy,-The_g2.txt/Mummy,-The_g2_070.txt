               ext. evelyn's foyer - day for night

               evelyn and jonathan are pacing the foyer

                                     evelyn
                         we must stop him from regenerating.

               she turns to daniels and henderson.

                                     evelyn
                         who opened that chest?

                                     henderson
                         well, there was me and daniels here 
                         and then poor burns of course, oh 
                         yeah, and that egyptologist fella.

               o'connell turns from the window.

                                     o'connell
                         what about my buddy, beni?

                                     daniels
                         naw, he scrammed outta there,

                                     evelyn
                         we must find the egyptologist and 
                         bring him back here to the safety of 
                         the fort, before the creature can 
                         get to him.

               o'connell looks at evelyn, daniels and henderson.

                                     o'connell
                         okay,... evelyn, you wait here, you 
                         two come with me.

               all three of them pounce on him at once --

                                     henderson
                         the hell with that! i'm not goin' 
                         nowhere! we're safe here.

                                     daniels
                         yeah, i'm not leavin, this fort for 
                         nothin'.

                                     evelyn
                         who put you in charge? you can't 
                         just leave me behind like some old 
                         suitcase. i'm the one responsible 
                         for this mess and i intend to be the 
                         one to clean it up.

               o'connell just shakes his head and sighs. totally put-upon.

               then he takes evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the 
               door and locks it with a skeleton key. from inside her room 
               we can hear evelyn pounding on the door and yelling.

               o'connell throws the skeleton key to daniels.

                                     o'connell
                         keep an eye on her. if you leave her 
                         door, i'll rip your spleen out. c'mon, 
                         jonathan.

               jonathan swallows hard and points to himself.

                                     jonathan
                         me?

               cairo alleyways - bazaar - day for night

               the egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys, looking 
               haunted. he clutches the book of the dead in one hand and 
               his sacred canopic jar in the other. imhotep is stalking 
               him. a street vendor turns and sees imhotep's horribly decayed 
               face.

               he reacts and scurries away. imhotep lifts his robe, covers 
               his face, and moves in on the egyptologist, who is heading 
               into the bazaar. we pan up to --

               the egyptologist's office - day for night

               beni is ransacking the joint, pulling out drawers and files 
               and throwing them on the floor. he finds a silver pocket 
               watch, shakes it, then throws it into his pocket, then he 
               starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves.

                                     o'connell (o.s.)
                         well, well, well.

               beni spins around. o'connell and jonathan stand in the door.

                                     o'connell
                         lemme guess, spring cleaning?

               beni turns and runs for an open window. o'connell grabs a 
               chair, flings it into his path. beni trips and crashes into 
               a wall. o'connell strides over, grabs him and lifts him up 
               the wall. beni's feet dangle off the floor.

                                     o'connell
                         where's your new friend?

                                     beni
                         what friend? you're my only friend.

               o'connell quickly slides his knife up under beni's chin.

                                     o'connell
                         then you got no excuse for living. 
                         what the hell you doin, being buddies 
                         with this creep, beni? what's in it 
                         for you?

                                     beni
                         it is better to be the right hand of 
                         the devil,... than in his path. as 
                         long as i serve him, i am immune.

                                     o'connell
                         immune from what?

                                     beni
                         you shall see.

                                     o'connell
                         what are you looking for? lie, and 
                         i'll slit your throat.

               o'connell shoves the knife deeper into beni's skin.

                                     beni
                         the book! the black book they found 
                         at hamunaptra! imhotep wants it back. 
                         said to me it would be worth it's 
                         weight in diamonds.

                                     o'connell
                         what does he want the book for?

                                     beni
                              (shrugs)
                         something about bringing his dead 
                         girly-friend back to life. he needs 
                         the book...
                              (looks at jonathan)
                         and your sister.

               o'connell looks at jonathan. beni seizes the moment and knees 
               o'connell in the balls. o'connell doubles over and collapses.

               beni leaps out the window. jonathan cringes.

                                     jonathan
                         that looked rather painful.

                                     o'connell
                              (wincing)
                         ya know, ever since i met you, my 
                         luck has been for crap.

                                     jonathan
                         yes, i know, i do that to people.

               and that's when they hear a blood curdling scream coming 
               from down in the bazaar. o'connell and jonathan scramble to 
               the window and look out --
