               int. evelyn's cabin - night

               evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror.

               she gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose 
               over her bare shoulders. then she turns around, right there 
               is one of the hideous mumia! it's hook. he slams his hand 
               over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.

                                     hook
                         where is the map?

               evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. hook looks over, sees 
               the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table.

                                     hook
                         and the key? where is the key?

               evelyn's eyes look confused. she shakes her head. hook grins.

                                     hook
                         then i'll find it myself.

               he cocks his hook, about to kill her. and that's when the 
               door is kicked open. o'connell bursts in, gun in each hand.

               hook spins evelyn around and holds her out in front of him.

               o'connell looks at her.

                                     o'connell
                         friend of yours?

               evelyn's eyes widen. and that's when the candle on the table 
               flickers. everything happens at once, read fast: o'connell 
               spins around just as a window bursts open. a mumia leans in.

               fires a gun. woodchips blast off the wall next to o'connell's 
               head. he returns fire. kills the mumia. the mumia falls back.

               firing blindly. a lantern in the room is blasted. kerosene 
               splashes across the wall. bursts into flames. evelyn grabs 
               the candle on the table and jams it back over her shoulder, 
               right into hook's eye. he screeches in pain and lets her go.

               o'connell grabs her and yanks her out of the flaming room.

               hallway - night

               o'connell pulls evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free.

                                     evelyn
                         the map! we need the map!

               he shoves her up against a wall.

                                     o'connell
                         relax! i'm the map!
                              (taps his forehead)
                         it's all up here.

                                     evelyn
                         oh that's comforting.

               o'connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward.

                                     o'connell
                         c'mon, there's still one more of 
                         those guys around here somewhere.

               evelyn's flaming room - night

               hot melted wax covers hook's face as he holds his sore eye 
               and struggles to the door. then he notices the key/box on 
               the floor. he bends over to pick it up. and that's when the 
               door is kicked open again, it hits him in the ass and knocks 
               him into the fire. jonathan leans in. sees nothing but flames.

                                     jonathan
                         evy!!

               then he sees the key/box on the floor and picks it up. a 
               hand suddenly snatches the key/box away from him.

                                     jonathan
                         hey that's mine --

               it's hook. his backside is now on fire. he lifts his pistol.

               jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as hook opens fire.
