               ext. quonset hut - dunes - minutes later

               o'connell, jonathan and ardeth ray stand before winston 
               havlock, the massive dunes of erfoud as our background.

                                     winston
                         so what's your little problem got to 
                         do with his majesty's royal air corp?

                                     o'connell
                         not a god-damned thing.

               winston looks intrigued.

                                     winston
                         is it dangerous?

                                     o'connell
                         you probably won't live through it.

               this really interests him.

                                     winston
                         by jove, do you really think so?

                                     jonathan
                         everybody else we've bumped into has 
                         died, why not you?

               winston nods his head, he's hooked.

                                     winston
                         so what's the challenge then?

                                     o'connell
                         to save the damsel in distress, kill 
                         the bad guy and steal his treasure.

               a slow grin spreads across winston's face, then he gives 
               them a snappy salute.

                                     winston
                         winston havlock at your service, 
                         sir!

               sahara - day

               way off across the desert, a large sand-devil races over the 
               dunes. the sandy whirlwind comes to a stop and starts to 
               dissipate. evelyn and beni are suddenly ejected out of it, 
               they land in a dune. the swirling sand condenses and forms 
               into imhotep. he looks up into the sky, listening carefully.

               evelyn shakes the sand out of her hair and looks at beni.

                                     evelyn
                         what just happened?

                                     beni
                         all i remember is him turning into a 
                         blast of sand,... and then i remember 
                         nothing.

               then they hear a plane in the sky and look up.
