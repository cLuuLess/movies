               int. passageway - day

               o'connell and ardeth ray are busy digging out a collapsed 
               doorway. jonathan notices an amethyst scarab on the far wall.

                                     jonathan
                         i say, look at that.

               he walks over and tries to jiggle it free. it comes loose in 
               his hand. he looks at the scarab in his palm. it starts to 
               glow. and then something inside it starts to wiggle.

                                     jonathan
                         say, gents! you should come have a 
                         look at this.

               the wiggling continues; a long, agonizing beat, and then the 
               scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly burrows into 
               jonathan's palm. jonathan starts to freak out and scream.

               o'connell runs up and rips the arm off jonathan's shirt. the 
               scarab is now burrowing up jonathan's arm. o'connell whips 
               out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs jonathan's 
               arm. jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in 
               front of his face. jonathan screams louder, obviously being 
               cut open. o'connell's hand flicks something away.

               the scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying 
               back towards jonathan, wanting to finish the job.

               o'connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, -- blam!
