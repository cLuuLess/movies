               int. imhotep's chamber - night

               evelyn's voice is overlaid as we start wide on imhotep's 
               chamber and slowly push in on his sarcophagus. we push in 
               over the lip of the coffin, then closer and closer towards 
               imhotep's rotten, twisted head, until his putrid face fills 
               frame, -- and then suddenly his crusty eyelids pop open!

               revealing empty sockets. -- big scary music sting.
