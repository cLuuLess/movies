               int. biplane - day

               the wind whips at winston in the cockpit. o'connell sits in 
               the gunner's compartment. jonathan is strapped spread-eagle 
               across the left wing, ardeth ray is tied tight to the right.

               both men are scared out of their wits and screaming in fear.
