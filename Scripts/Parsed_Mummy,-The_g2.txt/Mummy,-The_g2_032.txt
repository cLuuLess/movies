               int. imhotep's chamber - day

               three heroes are still digging into the ceiling

                                     o'connell
                         lemme get this straight, they stuck 
                         a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, 
                         cut your brain into small pieces, 
                         then ripped it all out through your 
                         nostrils?

                                     jonathan
                         owch! that's really got to hurt.

                                     evelyn
                         it's called mummification. you're 
                         dead when they do this

                                     jonathan
                         still...

                                     o'connell
                         yeah, that'd bring you back to life.

                                     evelyn
                         you two are worse than a couple of 
                         schoolboys.

               and that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly gives out.

               o'connell grabs evelyn and jerks her clear. jonathan dives 
               for the far wall. a massive stone casement drops out of the 
               ceiling and crashes to the floor. dust flies. fills the room.
