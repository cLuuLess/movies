               ext. alley - night

               a sewer grate is kicked out of a wall. o'connell, jonathan 
               and ardeth ray climb out of the hole and into an alley.

                                     o'connell
                         we gotta get her back.

                                     jonathan
                         i'm with you, old man. no one touches 
                         my sister like that and gets away 
                         with it.

               o'connell looks at ardeth ray.

                                     o'connell
                         you know where he's taking her?

                                     ardeth ray
                         yes. to hamunaptra. to perform the 
                         ritual.

               jonathan looks worried.

                                     jonathan
                         and what ritual would that be?

                                     ardeth ray
                         the ritual to bring the body of anck-
                         su-namun back to life.

                                     jonathan
                         and how does one do that?

                                     ardeth ray
                         by reading the book of the dead.

                                     jonathan
                         oh yes, of course.

                                     ardeth ray
                         and then killing your sister.

                                     jonathan
                         excuse me?

               ardeth ray looks at o'connell.

                                     ardeth ray
                         imhotep is now able to cross the 
                         desert with great haste.

               jonathan taps him in the shoulder.

                                     jonathan
                         begging your pardon, but i wasn't 
                         quite clear on that last part.

               ardeth ray ignores him.

                                     ardeth ray
                         if he arrives before us, it will be 
                         too late.

                                     jonathan
                         did you say 'kill' my sister?

               o'connell smiles.

                                     o'connell
                         i know how to beat him to it.

               and on that we smash cut to -- the erfoud dunes - dawn 

               jonathan's bashed-in convertible steams it's way up to a set 
               of semi-abandoned quonset huts. a single wwi biplane with 
               r.a.f. insignias sits in the sand beside them. a sign reads:

                               his majesty's royal air corp
