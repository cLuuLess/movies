               ext. british fort compound - day

               o'connell angrily strides through the compound. he sees beni 
               coming up the path with a man dressed in hooded robes, his 
               face covered by an ornate death mask. imhotep disguised.

                                     o'connell
                         beni ya little stinkweed, where did 
                         you slink off to?

                                     beni
                         you left me! you left me in the desert 
                         to rot.

                                     o'connell
                         oh yeah,... sorry bout that.
                              (gestures to imhotep)
                         so who's this guy?

                                     beni
                         this is prince imhotep, high priest 
                         of osiris.

                                     o'connell
                         oh, hey, how ya doin'?

               o'connell sticks out his hand, -- imhotep instantly recoils 
               o'connell gives him the once-over. beni quickly covers.

                                     beni
                         the prince does not like to be touched 
                         by other humans. a silly eastern 
                         superstition, i'm afraid.

                                     o'connell
                         yeah, well, we all got our little 
                         problems today don't we?

                                     beni
                         he has come to help mister burns. 
                         somehow i feel responsible.

                                     o'connell
                         don't gimme that, you never had any 
                         scruples.

                                     beni
                         do you know where i can steal some?

               o'connell fake-punches him. beni flinches. o'connell gives 
               imhotep a look as he strides off.

                                     o'connell
                         see ya around, padre.

               imhotep's grotesque new eyes glare out from behind the mask.
