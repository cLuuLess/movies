               ext. base camp - night

               the two camps have now joined together. o'connell and beni 
               are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire. jonathan 
               wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell.

                                     jonathan
                         what is this stuff? it smells like 
                         our late friend, the warden.

               o'connell and beni both grin. jonathan looks horrified.

                                     jonathan
                         you did not!?... we're not!?

                                     o'connell
                         rat gizzards. they smell bad and 
                         taste worse, but that's the best the 
                         desert has to offer.

               the gloating americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars.

                                     henderson
                         say o'connell, whadaya think these 
                         honey's'll fetch back home?

                                     burns
                         we hear you gentlemen found yerselves 
                         a nice gooey mummy. congratulations.

                                     daniels
                         ya know if ya dry him out, you can 
                         sell him for firewood.

               the americans laugh. evelyn walks up, sits down and drops a 
               pile of big dusty bug skeletons onto the ground.

                                     evelyn
                         scarabs, flesh eaters, i found them 
                         inside our friend's coffin. they can 
                         stay alive for years living off the 
                         flesh of a corpse, or in this case...

               she shrugs, then looks at the roasting meat

                                     evelyn
                         famished.

               o'connell and jonathan stare at the bug skeletons, disgusted.

                                     o'connell
                         are you saying somebody threw these 
                         things in with our guy, and they 
                         slowly ate him alive?

                                     evelyn
                         very slowly.

                                     jonathan
                         he certainly was not a popular fellow 
                         when they planted him.

                                     o'connell
                         must of got a little too frisky with 
                         the pharaoh's daughter.

                                     evelyn
                         according to my readings, our friend 
                         suffered the hom-dai, the worst of 
                         all ancient egyptian curses, one 
                         reserved for only the most evil 
                         blasphemers. in all of my research, 
                         i've never read of this curse actually 
                         having been performed.

                                     o'connell
                         that bad huh?

                                     evelyn
                         yes, they never used it because they 
                         feared it so. it's written, that if 
                         a victim of the hom-dai should ever 
                         arise, he would bring with him the 
                         ten plagues of egypt.

                                     o'connell
                         the ten plagues?... you mean all ten 
                         plagues.

                                     beni
                         like what that moses guy did to that 
                         pharaoh guy?

                                     evelyn
                         that's one way of putting it.

                                     jonathan
                         let's see, there was frogs, flies, 
                         locusts...

                                     burns
                         hail and fire.

                                     henderson
                         the sun turning black.

                                     daniels
                         water turning to blood.

                                     jonathan
                         and my personal favorite: people 
                         covered in boils and sores.

               all the men share nervous looks, really spooked. evelyn just 
               laughs at them, then pulls a meat stick out of the fire.

                                     evelyn
                         fried gizzard anyone?
