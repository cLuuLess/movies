               int. scarab chamber - day

               the warden crawls into a dark chamber and lights a torch.

               a mural wall comes alive. embedded into it are dozens of 
               black amethyst scarabs; glittering images of the sacred 
               beetles. awestruck, the warden pulls out a pocket knife and 
               starts prying away at one of the precious bugs.
