               ext. base camp - night

               evelyn and jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire.

                                     evelyn
                         what do you suppose killed him?

                                     jonathan
                         did you ever see him eat?

               o'connell comes up over some rocks.

                                     o'connell
                         seems the americans had a little 
                         misadventure of their own today, 
                         three of their diggers were killed.

                                     evelyn
                         how?

                                     o'connell
                         salt acid. pressurized salt acid. 
                         some sort of ancient booby-trap.

                                     jonathan
                         maybe this place really is cursed.

               a gust of wind blows through the camp.

               the campfire flickers o'connell and jonathan share a nervous 
               look. evelyn laughs.

                                     evelyn
                         you two!

                                     o'connell
                         you don't believe in curses, huh?

                                     evelyn
                         no. i believe if i can see it and i 
                         can touch it, then it's real. that's 
                         what i believe.

               o'connell cocks his rifle, ka-chank! gives her a big grin.

                                     o'connell
                         i believe in being prepared.

               jonathan opens the warden's pouch, the one that held the 
               scarabs. he reaches in, starts scrounging around. we slowly 
               push in. waiting for the attack. the music builds. and then, --
               jonathan screams in pain and rips his hand back out of the 
               pouch. o'connell and evelyn both jump.

                                     o'connell/evelyn
                         what?! what is it?!

               jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch 
               and pulls out a liquor bottle, the top has been chipped off.

                                     jonathan
                         seagrams!

               jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside 
               out and shakes it, nothing but sand is inside it.

                                     jonathan
                         well, he may have been a stinky 
                         fellow,... but he had good taste.

               jonathan takes a swig. o'connell and evelyn laugh, guiltily 
               and then o'connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear 
               to the sand. evelyn and jonathan watch him. a beat. and then 
               a barage of gunfire is heard coming from the american camp.

               o'connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to evelyn.

                                     o'connell
                         stay here!

               he takes off running through the ruins. evelyn immediately 
               gets up and runs after him. jonathan grabs a gun, holds the 
               bottle of seagrams; tight and dashes after her.

                                     jonathan
                         evy! excuse me! but didn't the man 
                         just say -- !
