               int. ramesseum - moments later

               everyone is assembled around the tomb display of seti the 
               first.

               we recognize his chariot and sword. the curator sits on seti's 
               throne.

                                     curator
                         we are part of an ancient secret 
                         society, the cult-of-the-mumia, and 
                         we have a sacred mission, passed 
                         down through thirty-nine generations. 
                         for over four thousand years we have 
                         guarded the city of the dead. we are 
                         sworn at manhood to do any and all 
                         in our power to stop the high priest 
                         imhotep from being reborn into this 
                         world.

                         and because of you, we have failed.

                              (appalled)
                         and you think this justifies killing 
                         innocent people!?

                                     curator
                         to have stopped this creature? yes!

                                     o'connell
                         okay, let's cut to the chase. he's 
                         afraid of cats, what's that about?

                                     curator
                         according to the ancients, cat's are 
                         the guardians at the gates of the 
                         underworld. imhotep will fear them 
                         until he is fully regenerated, and 
                         then he will fear nothing.

               daniels is totally wigged-out, he looks at o'connell.

                                     daniels
                         right! and ya know how he gets fully 
                         regenerated?! by killing everybody 
                         who opened that chest and sucking us 
                         dry! that's how!

                                     curator
                         yes, the creature must first try and 
                         regenerate, and then he will attempt 
                         to resurrect the one he has loved 
                         for more than four thousand years.

                                     evelyn
                         anck-su-namun.

               the curator and ardeth ray look at evelyn, thunderstruck.

                                     evelyn
                         in the necropolis, when i saw him, -
                         alive,... walking, he called me anck-
                         su-namun. and then in mister burns' 
                         quarters he tried to kiss me.

                                     curator
                         it is because it was you who read 
                         from the book. he has chosen you to 
                         be the human sacrifice needed to 
                         regenerate the body of anck-su-namun.

               jonathan scratches his ear with the barrel of his pistol.

                                     jonathan
                         this is not good. not good at all.

               ardeth ray has been staring out a wall of windows.

                                     ardeth ray
                         tonight is the full moon. the moon 
                         of osiris. it will begin tonight.

               everyone follows ardeth ray's eyes, through the windows we 
               can see the sun, -- which is now going into a full eclipse.

                                     jonathan
                         "...and he stretched forth his hands 
                         towards the heavens, and there was 
                         darkness throughout the land of 
                         egypt."
