               int. hamunaptra - day

               evelyn goes ass-over-teacups through the air and crash lands 
               in a sand dune. she sits up, stunned, sandy hair in her eyes.

               o'connell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel.

                                     o'connell
                         never mind.

               the americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside 
               the volcano. o'connell gives them a big, shit-eating grin.

                                     o'connell
                         you boys owe me five hundred dollars.
