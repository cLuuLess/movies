               imhotep turns from the altar as he hears more gunshots echoing 
               out of the passageways. he angrily reaches into another of 
               anck-su-namun's canopic jars, pulls out her crusty liver and 
               crushes it to dust, then quickly starts reading a passage 
               from the book and blows the dust down a passageway.

                                     imhotep
                              (ancient egyptian --

                         kill them! kill them all! and bring
