               int. evelyn's quarters - day

               a steamer trunk is slammed to the floor and thrown open.

               o'connell chucks a load of dresses into the trunk.

                                     o'connell
                         i thought you didn't believe in this 
                         stuff!?

               o'connell heads for the closet. evelyn unpacks the dresses

                                     evelyn
                         having an encounter with a four 
                         thousand year old walking-talking 
                         corpse tends to convert one.

                                     o'connell
                         forget it, we're out the door down 
                         the hall and gone.

                                     evelyn
                         no, we are not.

               o'connell throws a handful of her underthings into the trunk.

                                     o'connell
                         oh yes we are.

               o'connell continues to pack evelyn's clothes as she continues 
               to unpack them:

                                     evelyn
                         no we are not. we woke him up, and 
                         we must try and stop him.

                                     o'connell
                         we?! what we?! you didn't read that 
                         book. i told you not to play around 
                         with that thing.

                                     evelyn
                         alright then, me, i,... i read the 
                         book, i woke him up and i intend to 
                         stop him.

               o'connell angrily stretches a bra between his hands.

                                     o'connell
                         how!? you heard the man, no mortal 
                         weapons can kill this guy.

               evelyn grabs the bra and throws it into a drawer.

                                     evelyn
                         then we'll have to find some immortal 
                         ones.

                                     o'connell
                         there goes that belief again. not 
                         me, i am outta here!

               o'connell stuffs a pile of evelyn's shoes into the trunk.

               evelyn kicks the lid shut, slamming it on his fingers.

               o'connell yelps and angrily storms around the room sucking 
               his fingers as evelyn follows him.

                                     evelyn
                         according to that book, once this 
                         creature has been reborn, his curse 
                         will spread, and as he grows in 
                         strength, so will his curse grow, 
                         infecting the people until the whole 
                         of the earth is destroyed.

                                     o'connell
                         yeah? so? is that my problem?

                                     evelyn
                              (incredulous)
                         it's everybody's problem!

                                     o'connell
                         look lady, i appreciate you saving 
                         my life and all, but when i signed 
                         on, i agreed to take you out there 
                         and bring you back, and i did, now 
                         were even, end of job, end of story, 
                         contract terminated.

                                     evelyn
                         that's what i am to you? a contract?

                                     o'connell
                         you can either tag along with me, or 
                         you can stay here and play around 
                         with mister maggot.

                                     evelyn
                         i'm staying.

                                     o'connell
                         fine.

               o'connell storms out and slams the door. a beat. then the 
               door opens and o'connell's hand reaches back in and throws a 
               handful of frilly panties to the floor. slam goes the door.
