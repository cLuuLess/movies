               ext. bazaar - night

               the convertible hauls ass down the narrow bazaar street.

               crazies start jumping out of stalls and leaping onto the 
               car. o'connell and the others fight them off, throwing them 
               overboard. more people jump on. jonathan swerves the car, 
               crashes through some stalls, knocking them off, but not before 
               they manage to open the back door and yank daniels out. he 
               tumbles across the pavement. gets up shooting. backs into a 
               corner, firing his pistol into the hideous rabble, killing 
               several, keeping them at bay. his gun goes empty, click! 
               click! click! but the mob stays back, looking at him like 
               rabid vultures. daniels eyes them, filled with fear.

               the mob parts like the red sea as imhotep walks through them 
               and up to daniels. daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down 
               his cheeks. then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket, 
               and pulls out his jewel encrusted sacred canopic jar. he 
               holds it out for imhotep. imhotep takes it and grins. through 
               his tears, daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.

               we cut wide: somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased 
               mob, we hear daniels give out a blood curdling scream...
