               ext. camel paddock - night

               o'connell and evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse 
               paddock. people are screaming and shouting, lots of panic.

               blam! a chunk of the wall is blown off next to evelyn's head.

               o'connell pivots and fires back. it's the last mumia, on the 
               other side of the paddock. he and o'connell exchange gunfire.

               another lantern bursts into flames. o'connell shoots off the 
               paddock lock. the horses go nuts. o'connell fires over their 
               heads. they charge forward and crash through the door. the 
               mumia screams as the horses stampede over him. flames sweep 
               up the walls and race across the roof. half the barge is now 
               on fire. o'connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder.

                                     o'connell
                         can you swim?

                                     evelyn
                         well of course i can swim, if the 
                         occasion calls for it.

                                     o'connell
                         trust me.

               he picks her up and throws her over the side.

                                     o'connell
                         the occasion calls for it.

               evelyn splashes into the water. o'connell dives in after 
               her.
