               ext. base camp - night

               the egyptologist sits bolt upright. quickly looks around, 
               sees evelyn reading the book. he gets up and runs for her.

                                     egyptologist
                         no! noooo! you must not!

               he skids to a stop as a strange, piercing whine is heard, 
               coming from out in the desert. o'connell and the others all 
               leap to their feet. the americans run out of their tents.

               the sound gets louder and closer. and then from out of the 
               darkness a huge wall of locusts swirls into camp and envelops 
               everyone. o'connell grabs evelyn, and with jonathan at their 
               side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid 
               vermin as they go. beni and the americans run for the temple.

               the egyptologist is covered in locusts. he stares at the 
               book of the dead, looking haunted.

                                     egyptologist
                         what have we done?

               the campfire is sucked up into the air
