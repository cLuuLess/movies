               ext. visitor's pen - day

               the warden ushers evelyn and jonathan into the holding pen.

                                     evelyn
                         and what is he in prison for?

                                     warden
                         i did not know, so when i heard you 
                         were coming, i asked him that myself.

                                     evelyn
                         and what did he say?

                                     warden
                         he said... he was just looking for a 
                         good time.

               the interior cell door bursts open. o'connell is in chains, 
               dragged by four guards, they shove him up to the cell bars.

               from the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is 
               half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new 
               bruises. evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance.

                                     evelyn
                         but he's just a filthy criminal?

                                     jonathan
                              (cringing)
                         way to go, evy.

               o'connell gives evelyn the once over, then looks at jonathan.

                                     o'connell
                         so who's the broad?

                                     evelyn
                         broad?!

                                     jonathan
                         she's my sister, actually.

                                     o'connell
                         yeah? well,... i'm sure she's not a 
                         total loss.

               evelyn is stunned and furious. the warden heads out the door.

                                     warden
                         i'll be back in a moment.

                                     o'connell
                              (sarcastic)
                         i tremble with anticipation.

               a guard clubs o'connell across the head, o'connell's face 
               bounces off the metal bars. he shows no pain, but just looks 
               back and gives the guard a nasty look. evelyn steps closer.

                                     evelyn
                         we uh,... found... your puzzle box, 
                         and we've come to ask you about it.

                                     o'connell
                         no.

                                     evelyn
                         no?

                                     o'connell
                         no... you came to ask me about 
                         hamunaptra.

               evelyn and jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards 
               didn't hear him. they step closer. evelyn plays coy.

                                     evelyn
                         how do you know the box pertains to 
                         hamunaptra?

                                     o'connell
                         because that's where i found it. i 
                         was there.

               evelyn is dumbstruck. but jonathan looks suspicious

                                     jonathan
                         how do we know that's not a load of 
                         pig swallow?

               o'connell looks closer at jonathan, a glint of recognition.

                                     o'connell
                         hey,... don't i know you?

                                     jonathan
                         um, well, you see...

               o'connell's fist comes flying through the bars, hits jonathan 
               square in the jaw, decks him. he hits the floor. out cold. a 
               guard clubs o'connell. his head bounces off the bars again.

               he shows no pain, but gives the guard another nasty look.

               evelyn looks down at her brother, then back at o'connell.

                                     evelyn
                         you were actually at hamunaptra?

                                     o'connell
                         i just decked your brother

                                     evelyn
                         yes, well...
                              (shrugs)
                         i know my brother.

               o'connell almost smiles. there's a bit of spark to this girl.

                                     o'connell
                         yeah, i was there.

                                     evelyn
                         you swear?

                                     o'connell
                         every damn day.

                                     evelyn
                         no, i mean --

                                     o'connell
                         -- i know what you mean. i was there, 
                         alright. seti's place. the city of 
                         the dead.

                                     evelyn
                         what did you find? what did you see?

                                     o'connell
                         i found sand. i saw death.

               the warden enters. evelyn quickly leans closer to o'connell.

                                     evelyn
                         could you tell me how to get there? 
                         the exact location?

                                     o'connell
                         want to know?

               evelyn leans in even closer.

                                     evelyn
                         yes.

                                     o'connell
                         really want to know?

               she leans her face right up to the bars, nervous and excited

                                     evelyn
                         yes.

               o'connell steps forward and kisses her full on the lips.

                                     o'connell
                         then get me the hell outta here.

               evelyn is stunned. a guard clubs him, his face bounces off 
               the bars again, but before he can react the guards grab him, 
               yanks him away from the bars and drag him out of the room.

                                     evelyn
                         where are they taking him?

                                     warden
                         to be hanged.

               evelyn is shocked. the warden shows-off his green teeth.

                                     warden
                         apparently, he had a very good time.
