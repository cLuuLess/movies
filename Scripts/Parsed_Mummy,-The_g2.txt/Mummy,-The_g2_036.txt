               int. imhotep's chamber - day

               our heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus, 
               revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. evelyn stares at it 
               jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid.

                                     jonathan
                         well?... who is it?

               evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned.

                                     evelyn
                         'he that shall not be named.'

               o'connell dusts off the huge lock

                                     o'connell
                         there's some sort of lock here. you 
                         say these thing's are made of granite 
                         with a steel interior?

                                     evelyn
                         quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

                                     jonathan
                         whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting 
                         out.

                                     o'connell
                         no kiddin', without a key, it'll 
                         take us a month to crack this thing,

                                     evelyn
                         a key! that's it! that's what he was 
                         talking about.

                                     o'connell
                         who was talking about what?

               evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on jonathan's back.

                                     evelyn
                         the man on the barge. the one with 
                         the hook, he was looking for a key.

               evelyn pulls out the key/box. jonathan tries to take it back.

                                     jonathan
                         hey that's mine!

               evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, -- it's 
               now shaped exactly like the lock's keyhole. evelyn smiles.

               and that's when they hear the warden's screams echoing through 
               the labyrinth. all three of them turn and take-off running.
