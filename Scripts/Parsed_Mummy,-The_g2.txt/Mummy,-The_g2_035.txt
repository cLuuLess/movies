               int. scarab chamber - day

               the warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then 
               greedily starts prying away at another. it rips off, he drops 
               it into his pouch, -- only he misses, and this scarab quietly 
               falls to the sandy floor without the warden noticing.

               close on: the scarab on the floor. it begins to transform.

               the amethyst starts to glow. something inside starts to 
               wiggle; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon.

               then it splits open and a real live hideous scarab beetle 
               scurries out. it races over to the warden's shoe, quickly 
               burrows into the leather and vanishes inside.

               the warden's eyes fly open. he starts to scream, drops his 
               knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg, 
               higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a 
               large, hideous lump, burrowing under his skin. it burrows 
               it's way up his fat belly and across his hairy chest. the 
               warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. the 
               lump burrows up his neck. the warden starts gagging and 
               coughing.

               and then the scarab-lump vanishes into his head.
