               ext. barge - night

               evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river.

               the gunny-sack drops onto the table, startling her.

                                     o'connell
                         sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

                                     evelyn
                         the only thing that scares me, mister 
                         o'connell, are your manners.

                                     o'connell
                         still angry that i kissed ya, huh?

                                     evelyn
                         if you call that a kiss.

               o'connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out 
               revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun, 
               and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.

                                     evelyn
                         did i miss something? are we going 
                         into battle?

                                     o'connell
                         the last time i was at that place 
                         everybody i was with died.

               this takes the smile off evelyn's face. o'connell starts 
               dismantling and cleaning the guns.

                                     o'connell
                         there's something out there, you 
                         know, something under that sand.

                                     evelyn
                         yes, i'm hoping to find a certain 
                         artifact, a book, actually, my brother 
                         thinks there's treasure. what do you 
                         think is out there?

               o'connell looks into evelyn's eyes.

                                     o'connell
                         evil. the tuaregs and the bedouin 
                         believe that hamunaptra is cursed, 
                         they call it, "the doorway to hell."

                                     evelyn
                         ahmar is ossirion. "passageway to 
                         the underworld", actually.

               she gives him a know-it-all grin.

                                     evelyn
                         i don't believe in fairy tales and 
                         hokum, mister o'connell, but i do 
                         believe that one of the most famous 
                         books in history is buried out there, 
                         the book of the living. it's what 
                         first interested me in egypt as a 
                         child. it's why i came here, sort of 
                         a life's pursuit.

                                     o'connell
                         and the fact that they say it's made 
                         out of pure gold, makes no nevermind 
                         to you, right?

               evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.

                                     evelyn
                         you know your history.

                                     o'connell
                         i know my treasure.

               evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns 
               back to o'connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says:

                                     evelyn
                         by the way,... why did you kiss me?

               o'connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders.

                                     o'connell
                         i was about to be hanged, seemed 
                         like a good idea at the time.

               evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off.

               o'connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed.

                                     o'connell
                         what?... wha'd i say?

               then he hears someone snickering under the table. he quickly 
               reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. it's beni.

                                     beni
                         my very good friend! what a surprise.

                                     o'connell
                         why if it ain't my little buddy, 
                         beni. i oughta kill you.

               o'connell sticks a knife under beni's throat. beni swallows 
               hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.

                                     beni
                         you never were any good with the 
                         ladies, o'connell.

                                     o'connell
                         so you're the one leading the 
                         americans, i shoulda figured. so 
                         what's the scam? you get 'em out in 
                         the middle of the desert then leave 
                         'em to rot?

                                     beni
                         unfortunately no, these americans 
                         are smart, they pay me only half 
                         now, half when i get them back to 
                         cairo, so i must go all the way.

               o'connell pulls the knife away. beni relaxes, rubs his neck.

                                     beni
                         you never believed in hamunaptra, 
                         o'connell. why are you going back? 
                         the devil himself lives out there.

               they look as they hear evelyn yelp. a single camel in the 
               horse paddock takes another bite at her. she yelps again and 
               backs away. o'connell grins as evelyn flees down the deck.

                                     o'connell
                         the girl saved my life, figured it 
                         was the least i could do, keep her 
                         out of trouble.

                                     beni
                         you always did have more balls than 
                         brains.

               o'connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at beni.

                                     o'connell
                         let's make us even, shall we?

                                     beni
                         even?

               o'connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge.

               beni splashes into the river. o'connell takes his gunny-sack 
               and starts walking off down the deck.

                                     beni (o.s.)
                         o'connell! i am going to kill you 
                         for this!

                                     o'connell
                         sounds familiar.

               and that's when he spots three sets of wet footprints, coming 
               up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck.

               o'connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.
