               int. casbah - day

               three shot glasses clink together. o'connell, jonathan and 
               henderson slug 'em down, -- all three of them instantly spit 
               out the liquid. half the bar spits out their drinks as well.

                                     henderson
                         sweet jesus! that tasted just like,... 
                         like...

                                     o'connell
                         blood.

               they all look at each other, even more nervous.

                                     jonathan
                         "and the rivers and waters of egypt 
                         went red and were as blood."

               a look passes over o'connell's face, a realization.

                                     o'connell
                         he's here.

               he suddenly jumps away from the bar and runs for the door.

                                     jonathan
                         who's here!?

                                     o'connell
                         the guy! the priest! the mummy!
