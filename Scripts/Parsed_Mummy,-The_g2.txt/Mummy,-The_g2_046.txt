               int. anubis' chamber - day

               the vapor is settling. the americans have their guns aimed 
               at the chest. the egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches 
               inside, and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. everyone's eyes 
               widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and 
               slowly pulls out the black book of the dead, the same book 
               imhotep used in his attempt to bring anck-su-namun back to 
               life.

                         i have heard told of this book, but 
                         i never truly believed it existed. 
                         this, good gentlemen, is a most 
                         priceless treasure.

                         yeah! it's supposed to be made outta 
                         pure gold!

               daniels kicks the chest. it breaks open, unfolding to reveal 
               a lower compartment. inside, are anck-su-namun's five jewel 
               encrusted canopic jars (one is shattered and without jewels)
