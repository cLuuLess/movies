               ext. base camp - night

               jonathan falls into frame. hits the ground. eyes wide open.

               mouth agape. clearly dead. a beat. and then his eyes close 
               and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. shit-faced drunk.

               o'connell and evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves, 
               the bottle of seagrams is almost gone. o'connell offers the 
               bottle to evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly --

                                     evelyn
                         unlike my brother, sir, i know when 
                         to say no.

               o'connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away.

                                     o'connell
                         unlike your brother, miss, you i 
                         don't get. you're a whole new brew.

                                     evelyn
                         i know, you're wondering, what's a 
                         place like me doing in a girl like 
                         this?

                                     o'connell
                         something like that.

                                     evelyn
                         egypt is in my blood. my father was 
                         a famous explorer, he loved egypt so 
                         much that he married an egyptian. my 
                         mother! who was quite an adventurer 
                         herself

                                     o'connell
                         okay, i get your father, i get your 
                         mother and i get your brother, but 
                         what are you doing here?

               evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet.

                                     evelyn
                         i may not be an explorer, or an 
                         adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or 
                         a gunfighter! mister o'connell but 
                         i'm proud of what i am.

                                     o'connell
                         and what is that?

               evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins 
               and proudly lifts her head high.

                                     evelyn
                         ...i am a librarian!

               she leans in, very close to his face, looks him in the eyes,

                                     evelyn
                         i'm going to kiss you, mister 
                         o'connell.

                                     o'connell
                         no you're not.

                                     evelyn
                         i'm not?

                                     o'connell
                         not unless you call me rick.

                                     evelyn
                         why would i do that?

                                     o'connell
                         because that's my name.

               she gives him a goofy smile. he leans forward and kisses 
               her. evelyn's eyes slowly close. and then she passes out, 
               slumping into his arms. o'connell looks down at her, and 
               just smiles.
