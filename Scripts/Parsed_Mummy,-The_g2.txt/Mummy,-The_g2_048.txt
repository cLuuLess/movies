               ext. camp - later that night

               having just freshened up for bed, evelyn exits the temple 
               and steps past the sleeping diggers. she spots the 
               egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, 
               the book of the dead laying loose under the other. evelyn 
               stares at the book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks 
               over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip-toes away.

               lying on some blankets by the campfire, o'connell rolls over 
               and sees evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the book.

                                     o'connell
                         you sure you outta be playin, around 
                         with that?

                                     evelyn
                         it's just a book, no harm ever came 
                         from a book.

               evelyn opens the cover. the fire flickers. she and o'connell 
               share a nervous look, then evelyn shrugs and starts reading.

                                     evelyn
                         ahm kum ra. ahm kum dei.

               evelyn continues reading the book aloud in ancient egyptian.
