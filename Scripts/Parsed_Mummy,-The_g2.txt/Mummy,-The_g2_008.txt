               ext. ridge - day

               up on a ridge, a group of riders watch o'connell stumble 
               clear of the decrepit city. o'connell feels their presence 
               and looks up. very different from the tuaregs, they have 
               blue tinted skin and faces covered in strange puzzle-tattoos.

               the mumia. still watching imhotep's grave after all this 
               time.

               the mumia leader is a huge, fierce man in black robes, with 
               dual scimitars across his waist. his face is both handsome 
               and horrible, blue and tattooed. meet ardeth ray. his dark 
               eyes watch o'connell stagger off into the open desert...
