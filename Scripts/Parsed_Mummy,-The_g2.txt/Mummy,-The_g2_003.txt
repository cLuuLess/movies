               ext. sahara desert - night

               chariots race out into the moonlit desert. imhotep leads the 
               way. a "hearse" carries anck-su-namun's mummy. the map of 
               ancient egypt fades up. the chariots race across the map.

                                     imhotep
                         but there was another book, the book 
                         of the dead, which was never to be 
                         opened, never to be read, for it 
                         contained the incantations that could 
                         bring a dead body back to life a 
                         most unholy thing.

               the chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic. 
               they race up the stone ramp and in through the city gates.

               superimposed across the screen are the words:

                              hamunaptra - city of the dead

                                     imhotep
                         it was hidden at hamunaptra, city of 
                         the dead, inside the statue of anubis, 
                         so that no such sacrilege might ever 
                         disgrace egypt.
