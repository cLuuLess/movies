               ext. british fort courtyard - day

               evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of 
               books. a blast of thunder and lightning scares her. she drops 
               half the books. then a hand grabs her! she jumps again and 
               drops the rest of the books. it's o'connell, breathing hard.

                                     o'connell
                         we got problems.

               and that's when a barrage of hail and fire slams into the 
               courtyard. o'connell and evelyn jump back. a water fountain 
               bursts into steam. a wooden trellis catches fire. o'connell 
               and evelyn run under the eaves as soldiers, servants and 
               camels run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom.

                                     o'connell
                         he's here! i saw him! that thing is 
                         here!

                                     evelyn
                         the creature!? are you sure!?

               o'connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the 
               hail and fire.

                                     o'connell
                         pretty sure!

               the hail and fire come to a stop. everything goes dead quiet.

               o'connell and evelyn freeze. and then a blood curdling scream 
               is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them.

               o'connell and evelyn race up the stairs.
