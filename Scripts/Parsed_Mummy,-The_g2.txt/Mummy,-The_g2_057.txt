               several mumia drag burns up, he stares out with vacant 
               sockets. daniels and henderson are especially horrified.

                                     daniels
                         you bastards!

                                     henderson
                         what did you do to him!?

                                     ardeth ray
                         we saved him! saved him before the 
                         creature could finish his work. now 
                         leave, all of you, quickly, before 
                         he finishes you all.

                                     jonathan
                         you're not going to kill us?

               evelyn elbows jonathan in the ribs.

                                     ardeth ray
                         we must now hunt him down, and try 
                         and find a way to kill him, before 
                         he consumes the earth. allah be with 
                         us.

               ardeth ray and the mumia start heading down into the crevice.

               o'connell yells at them, trying to convince himself.

                                     o'connell
                         i told ya, i already got him!

               ardeth ray stops and looks back, deadly serious.

                                     ardeth ray
                         know this, the creature will be coming 
                         for you. he must consummate the curse. 
                         and until he does, he will never 
                         eat, he will never sleep, and he 
                         will never stop.

               ardeth ray turns and jumps down into the crevice,
