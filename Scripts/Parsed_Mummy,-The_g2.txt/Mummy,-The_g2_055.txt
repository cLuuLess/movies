               ext. crevice - night

               sand and wind whip through the ruins as o'connell and evelyn 
               stumble up out of the crevice and come face-to-face with ten 
               armed mumia. the mumia quickly raise their guns. o'connell 
               and evelyn quickly raise their hands. jonathan, henderson, 
               daniels and the egyptologist are already on their knees, 
               hands over their heads. ardeth ray steps forward.

                                     ardeth ray
                         i told you to leave or die, you 
                         refused, and now you may have killed 
                         us all. for you have unleashed the 
                         creature that we have feared for 
                         more than four thousand years.

                                     o'connell
                         relax, i got him.

                                     ardeth ray
                         no mortal weapons can kill this 
                         creature. he is not of this world.

                                     o'connell
                         are we talkin, about the same 
                         creature? the walking corpse? really 
                         big mouth? really bad breath?
