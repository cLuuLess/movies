               int. museum of antiquities - day

               o'connell, jonathan, henderson and daniels follow evelyn 
               across the ramesseum.

                                     evelyn
                         there's only one person i know who 
                         can possibly give us some answers.

               they round a corner and come upon the curator, -- who is 
               talking with ardeth ray. everybody stops.

                                     everybody
                         you!

               o'connell and the american's quickly draw their guns. ardeth 
               ray just scowls. the curator nods his head.

                                     curator
                         miss carnavon. gentlemen.

                                     evelyn
                         what is he doing here?

                                     curator
                         do you truly wish to know? or would 
                         you prefer to just shoot us?

               everybody tenses, guns up. then o'connell uncocks his .38.

                                     o'connell
                         i just saw my fist vanish into some 
                         guy's head.

               he slides his gun back into his shoulder-holster.

                                     o'connell
                         i'm willin, to go on a little faith, 
                         here.

                                     curator
                         you will not believe it.

                                     o'connell
                         try me.
