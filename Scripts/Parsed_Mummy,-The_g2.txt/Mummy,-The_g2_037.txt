               int. labyrinth - day

               the warden is screaming and dancing insanely around the 
               labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head.

               o'connell, evelyn and jonathan run up just as the warden 
               starts ripping his own hair out of his head. o'connell and 
               jonathan grab at the warden's hands, but he's far too crazed, 
               he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the 
               labyrinth and slams his head straight into a rock wall. the 
               warden drops to the ground. dead as lead. eyes wide open.

               o'connell, evelyn and jonathan just stand there staring, 
               breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves...
