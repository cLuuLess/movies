               int. anubis' chamber - day

               beni and the americans hover around the egyptologist, who's 
               found the secret compartment inside anubis. the egyptologist 
               brushes sand away from the seam. henderson steps forward and 
               grabs the seam, -- the egyptologist quickly stops him.

                                     egyptologist
                         seti was no fool.

               henderson sees the intense look in the egyptologist's eyes

                                     henderson
                         yeah, sure...

               he looks back at the native diggers.

                                     henderson
                         we'll let him open it.

               the egyptologist nods, then yells in egyptian at the diggers.

               the diggers hesitate, filled with fear. daniels pulls out 
               his gun, aims it at three of the diggers. the three diggers 
               hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into 
               the seams. the other diggers back away, scared shitless.

               beni and the americans exchange looks, and then they back 
               away as well.
