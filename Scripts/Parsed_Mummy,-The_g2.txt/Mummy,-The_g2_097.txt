               int. horus' chamber - day

               o'connell and jonathan are digging away at the seams of the 
               secret compartment, it starts to give. and that's when ardeth 
               ray spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the 
               dark passageway, heading right for them. o'connell looks up.

                                     o'connell
                         these guys just don't quit.

               ardeth ray grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells 
               and runs off towards the mummies.

                                     ardeth ray
                         keep digging!

               o'connell and jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder 
               on the seam. the compartment starts to loosen. about to give.

               the last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember?

               our heroes keep tugging. the tension mounts...

               and that's when a skeletal hand bursts up out of the ground 
               and grabs o'connell's ankle. several more moldy hands burst 
               up out of the ground. o'connell and jonathan struggle with 
               the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor.

               one of the mummies violently shoves o'connell away. another 
               grabs jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him. a 
               third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard.

               an intense burst of acid sprays out of the seam and hits all 
               three of the mummies. the one strangling jonathan gets it in 
               the back and drops him. all three mummies melt horribly.
