               int. treasure chamber - day

               a dusty breeze blows into the chamber as o'connell, jonathan 
               and ardeth ray back away from the mummy pieces. the floor 
               where they were just standing suddenly starts to move. two 
               more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor. more 
               mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of 
               the piles of gold. all the mummies head for our heroes.

               o'connell lifts the elephant gun. ardeth ray stops him.

                                     ardeth ray
                         my turn.

               ardeth ray opens up with the lewis gun. blasting the shit 
               out of the mummies. they keep on coming. even more now.

               o'connell opens fire with the elephant gun, pumping and firing 
               as all three of the men back away and haul ass. the mummies 
               and mummy pieces follow them into the passageway.

               then beni creeps into the chamber. he stares in wonder at 
               all the treasure. then falls backwards into a pile of jewels 
               and rolls about.
