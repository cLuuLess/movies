269	int.  chapel

	korben and cornelius turn the stones every which way.  all to no avai1.
loc rhod is discouraged.

						loc rhod
				...we'll never make it.

	he sighs.  three hooks pop off the stone.  loc rhod can't believe his
eyes.

						loc rhod
				it... it moved! korben! korben!

	korben rushes over, looks at the stone.  hooks are undone.

						korben
				what did you say? what did you do?

						loc rhod
				nothing! swear to god, i didn't do
				nothing!

						korben
				look, you did something that set it off.
				try to remember. concentrate. tell me
				exactly what you did!!

	loc rhod tries to duplicate the same movement.

						loc rhod
				i was like this... with my hands here and...
				i said, "we'll never make it!" that's all!

	nothing happens.

						korben
				is that all?

						loc rhod
				yeah... then i sighed... like this.

	loc rhod sighs, really depressed this time.  the stone opens even more.
	korben's got it.

						korben
				the wind! the wind blows...

	korben blows on the stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of
blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside.  a yellow beam
pops up like a ray of sunlight, like korben's smile.

						korben
				quickly, everyone on a stone!
				water for water!  fire for fire!
				earth for earth!

	the two men move fast.  korben on the 4th stone: earth.  he grabs a
fistful of earth  and throws it on the stone.  a miniature patch of green
appears and immediately forms a green beam.  cornelius wipes his forehead
with a scarf and wrings it out over the stone.  it opens revealing a patch of
miniature raging sea.  a blue beam appears.

	loc rhod has a problem.

						loc rhod
					(shaking)
				i don't have a light.  i stopped smoking
				last week! if we'd come a bit sooner...

	korben pats his pockets, he comes up with a box of matches.  there's only
one left.

						korben
				don't breathe.

	loc rhod and cornelius hold their breath.  korben strikes the match.  a
small flame appears on the tip.  a breeze goes through the room.  korben
feels like he's got tnt in his hands.  he approaches the flame to the stone.
the flame twists, dims, flickers ...but holds on.  the stone opens.  a patch
of miniature fire appears. korben sighs, snuffs out the match.  the fourth
beam, a red one, immediately forms.
