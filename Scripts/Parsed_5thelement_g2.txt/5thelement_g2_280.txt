283	int.  laboratory

	we are in the nucleological laboratory that gave birth to leeloo in the
beginning of our story.  the president enters the lab followed by a group
of officials in ceremonial dress.

						munro
				mr. president, let me introduce you to
				professor mactilburgh, who runs the center.

						mactilburgh
				it's an honor to receive you. mr. president.

						president
					(beaming)

						mactilburgh

				we put them in the reactor this morning..

				professor..

						professor
				of course.. let me see if they're revived.

						aide
				we go live in one minute, mr. president.

	mactilburgh goes to the reactor and opens a small slot which allows him
to see what is going on under the blue shield.

	leeloo and korben are naked, arms wrapped around each other, kissing and
probably engaged in hoppi hoppa.
	mactilburgh looks troubled.

						mactilburgh
				i.. uh.. they need five more minutes,
				mr. president.

	the president, pressed for time, looks over to his aide who in struggling
with a phone call.

						aide
				no ma'am... i tried... no ma'am...

						president
				who is it?

						aide
				some woman... claims she's korben's
				mother...

	the president takes the phone and goes to the window.

						president

				on behalf of the entire federation,
				i would like to thank...

						mother (v.o.)
				don't pull that crap with me, finger...
				i'd recognize that trash can voice of
				yours in a dark alley during a rain storm.
				you tell that worthless no account son
				of mine he should plotz for the way he's
				ignored his mother... when i think of all i
				sacrificed for him...
