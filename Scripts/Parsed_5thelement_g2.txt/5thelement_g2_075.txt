				i don't like warriors!  they're too
				narrow-minded, no sublety.  worse,
				they fight for hopeless causes..for honor!
				honor has killed millions of people but
				hasn't saved a single one.
					(pause)
				you know what -- do i like though, i like killer.
				  a real dyed in the wool killer.  cold-blooded.
				clean.  methodical.  thorough.  a killer, when
				he picked up the zf1, would've immediately
				asked about the little red button on the bottom of
				the gun.
