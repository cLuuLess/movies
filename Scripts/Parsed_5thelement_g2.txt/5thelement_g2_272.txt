275	int.  chapel

	the heat in the temple is unbearable.  all the walls start to ooze the
same horrible black slimy liquid seen at zorg's.  a drop of liquid falls to
the temple floor and begins to smoke, eating away at it like acid.  loc
rhod has to dodge another drop of the stuff.  korben quickly straightens
leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams.

						korben
				leeloo! if you don't get on with the
				program we're all gonna die! and that's
				not on my agenda for today.

	leeloo wraps her arms around korben's neck.

						leeloo
					(weak)
				what's the use of saving lives...
				when you see what you do with them!

						korben
				you're right but there are lots of good
				things... beautiful things...

						leeloo
				...like love...

						korben
				exactly.

						leeloo
				but i don't know love... i'm like a machine
				programmed to save other people's lives but
				never to have one of my own.
