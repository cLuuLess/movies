56	ext.  ledge  laboratory - dawn

	she has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the
middle of manhattan, which we discover for the first time.  the city has
become monstrous. buildings rise 600 stories.  cars fly.  subways run
vertically...the girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height.
the chief leans out the vent, looking out into the void.

						chief
					(to his men)
				go on follow her!

	the cops stare into the gaping void.

						cop
				...no way.

	the chief angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks
around the corner of the building.  unfortunately the other side in full of
cops as well.  a flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens
blaring.

						voice (o.s.)
				this in the police.  your status is illegal.
				please put up your hands and follow our
				instructions!

	the girl feels trapped.  she looks down into the endless 450 below and
all the cars flying underneath her.  then she raises her arms... and dives
off.
