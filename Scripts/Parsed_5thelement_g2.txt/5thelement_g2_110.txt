111	int.  landing  korben's  building

	a group of policemen bursts into the hallway.  one of the cops enters a
code on the police wall box.  a device descends from the ceiling, a
flashing light-siren,
	a voice fills the air.

						voice
				this is not an exercise.
				this is a police control.

	cornelius starts to panic.  korben takes charge.

						cornelius
				oh my god oh my god..

	korben pushes a button sending the fridge to the next floor.  a shower
takes it's place.

						korben
				leeloo, hide in here and don't move!

	leeloo hops in.  korben tosses cornelius on the bed.

						cornelius
				what are you doing?

						korben
				trying to save your ass so you can
				save the world.

	..and hits a button on the wall.  the bed disappears into the wall.

	korben grabs his tickets and slides them in his belt.
