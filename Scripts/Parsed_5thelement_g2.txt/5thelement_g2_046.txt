						captain
				we've been hit! general alert!!!

	blast after blast hits the defenseless ship.

						captain
				we're losing control! we have to land fast!

	the huge ship veers oft course and heads for a small red planet, taking
hit after hit.

						captain
				send out a distress signal!!! activate
				the emergency landing procedure!

	the huge ship approaches the planet at blinding speed.

						first officer
				impact in less than ten seconds!

	the red planet looms ever closer.

						captain
				time is of no importance...

	the ship crashes in a gigantic explosion.

46a	int.  korben's  apartment - day

	a thermo nuclear explosion fills a t.v. screen..which korben's cat
watches with interest.

	korben is about to exit the apartment.

						korben
				don't watch it all day, it'll rot your
				mind. bye sweetie..

	in response, the cat meows.  korben opens the door to..a huge
	gun, brandished by a nervous mugger, pointing right in his face.

						mugger
				the cash man!

						korben
				been here long?

						mugger
				don't fuck with me man or i'll blow
				you into tomorrow!

	unperterbed, korben looks at the mugger's fearsome weapon.

						korben
				isn't that a z140? alleviated titanium.
				neuro charged assault model?

						mugger
					(off balance)
				uh..

						korben
				you know you could hurt someone with
				this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..

	the mugger is lost.  he looks at his weapon.

						mugger
				it's not?

						korben
				you gotta push the little yellow button...

	korben points to the button on the side of the gun.  the mugger takes his
advice.

						mugger
				thanks..

						korben
				you're welcome..

	and with lightning speed, korben blasts the mugger with a straight right
hand, sending him down for the count.  korben retrieves the gun.

						korben
				..you know these things are very illegal..
				you could get in a shit load of trouble..
				i better hang onto it for you..

	as the mugger clears his head, korben opens a drawer next to him which is
full of similar guns! the mugger's eyes pop out of his head.  he scampers
to his feet and runs off.

	korben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door.  the cat watches
a nuclear holocaust on t.v.,  uninterrupted.

46b	int.  korben's  garage - day

	korben enters his taxi.  a robotic voice greets him.

						voice
				please enter your license..

	korben complies, and starts to push a series of buttons on the dash.

						voice
				welcome on board mr. dallas..

						korben
				how you doing this morning?  sleep ok?
				i didn't.

	korben hits a button.  the garage door starts to open.

						voice
				fuel level 6.03..propulsion 2x4...

						korben
				i had the worst goddamn nightmare.

						voice
				you have nine points left on your license..

						korben
				thanks for reminding me..

	as the garage door lifts, the megalopolis that is new york city in the
23rd century comes into view.  startling in it's height, and breath.

						voice
				have a nice day..

	korben lets the propulsion build.

						korben
				right..

	he lets the gear slip.  the taxi rockets off into the city.
