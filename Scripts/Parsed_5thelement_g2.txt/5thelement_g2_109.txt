110	int.  korben's  apartment - day

	c.u. the most disgusting dessert ever made.  korben looks at it shimmying
on a plate as the thai serves it to him proudly.

						thai
				stewed jellyfish cake.. my speciality..

	korben forces a weak, polite smile as the thai looks on expectantly.  the
phone rings.

						korben
				saved by the bell.

	korben rises to get his cigarettes, and answer the phone.

						korben
				...hello?

						mother (v.o.)
				you're the nastiest dirtbag i know in
				this stinking city!

						korben
					(resigned)
				hi ma...

						mother (v.o.)
				i've been playing twice a week for 20 years,
				20 years i've been eating those shitty croquettes.

	korben goes to light his cigarette.  there are only two matches left in
the match box.
	korben strikes one and it fizzles.

						mother (v.o.)
				you wouldn't even eat one to help your
				poor mother, and you win the big prize?
				know something? the whole thing makes
				me sick!

	the thai starts to clean up.  just as korben goes to strike the second
match..

						mother (v.o.)
				are you listening to me, you ingrate!

						korben
					(resigned)
				yes ma..

	korben sighs and puts the match back in the box.

	korben enters his code on the keypad the thai is holding.

						korben
					(to the thai)
				go on... this is gonna take a while!

the thai casts oft.  korben closes the window.

						korben
				other than that... you all right?

						mother (v.o.)
				...and now you're making fun of me?
				i'm warning you! if you don't take me
				after all these years of sacrifice, i'll
				never forgive you!!

	the thai flies off.  in the hall, the cat meows-for more food.

						korben
					(to the cat)
				i'm coming!. ma, what're you talking
				about?

						mother (v.o.)
				i get it! you want to make me beg,
				is that it?

						korben
				all i want is an explanation! i just got
				in, i lost my job. i smashed my cab.
				i got mugged, but other than that
				everything's peachy, ma, thanks for asking!!
				now settle down and explain to me calmly..

	a message drops in his tube.  the red light goes on.

						mother (v.o.)
				you just won a trip, you dolt!
				ten days in fhloston paradise for two!

						korben
				ma. if i'd won, i'd know about it.
				someone would have notified me.

						mother (v.o.)
				they've been blaring out your name on
				the radio for the last hour, blockhead!

	he eyeballs the message still in the tube.  the doorbell rings.-

						korben
				ma.. it's the door. i'll call you back.

	korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the
door.  before he gets there it opens, general munro enters followed by a
captain and a major.
	major iceborg is a woman. all she needs to become a man is a mustache.
	munro opens a file.

						munro
					(clipped)
				major dallas, if our calculations are correct
				you still have 57 hours owed to the federal
				army on your enlistment which is more than
				you will need for a mission of the utmost
				importance.

						korben
				what mission?

						munro
				to save the world.

						korben
				where have i heard this song before?

						munro
				you're to leave immediately for fhloston
				paradise. retrieve four stones from the
				diva plavalaguna. and bring them back with
				the utmost discretion as possible.
				any questions'?

						korben
					(a little bewildered)
				just one... why me?

						munro
				three reasons... one: as part of the elite
				special forces unit of the federated army
				you are an expert in the use of all weapons
				and spacecraft needed for this mission.

	munro pulls out a long list of documents.

						munro
				two: of all the members of your unit
				you were the most highly decorated.

						korben
				and the third one?

						munro
				you're the only one left alive...

	munro removes the message korben hasn't bothered to look at.

						munro
				don't you open your messages?

						korben
				i've had enough good news for today

						munro
					(by rote)
				you have won the annual gemini contest
				and a trip to fhloston paradise. for two.
				congratulations.
				here are your tickets.

	he hands korben the tickets.  korben gets it.

						korben
				you rigged the contest?

	munro nods.

						munro
				major iceborg will accompany you...
				as your wife...

	the idea of taking a trip with iceborg makes him sick.

						korben
					(sarcastic)
				you couldn't come up with something
				a little more discreet?

						munro
				old tricks are the best tricks eh?

						korben
				i'm not going.

						munro
				why not?

						korben
				one reason... i want to stay the only
				one left alive.

110a	int.  korben's  hall

	leeloo and cornelius search for korben's apartment. leeloo carries the
card korben gave her.  cornelius finds the apartment, and yanks the.
number off the door.  he waves leeloo over as his hand goes to the bell.

110b	int.  korben's  apartment

	the doorbell rings.

						korben
				...scuse me.

	korben goes to the door and looks out the peephole: the beautiful leeloo.
	korben panics, overcome with happiness.

						korben
				...shit!

						munro
					(worried)
				what is it?

	korben has two seconds to make up something to get rid of munro.

						korben
				it's my wife.

						munro
				i thought you were divorced.

						korben
				i mean my future.. my ex.. my future ex..
				if she sees you here i'm finished.  she hates
				you guys. it's what killed us in the first place.
				please...

	he puts them in the fridge, shoving the jellyfish cake in iceborg's
hands.

						korben
				...sorry, general, but we've got no choice!
				it'll only take a minute! let me set up
				another meeting and i'll be back.

						munro
				three of us will never fit in there!

						korben
					(pushing him)
				oh, yes you will...

	korben slams the fridge door.  the doorbell rings again.

						korben
				...coming!

	he whips through his place in ten seconds, gathers up things laying
about,
	shuts drawers, rolls up his laundry in the folding bed. he brushes his
hair back
	and opens the door with a big smile only to discover a gun stuck between
his
	eyes held by cornelius.

						leeloo
				apipoulai!

						korben
				i suppose that means "hi" ?

						cornelius
				i'm sorry to have to resort to such
				methods, but we heard about your
				good luck on he radio and we need
				the tickets to fhloston.

						korben
				is that the usual way priests go on
				vacation?

						cornelius
				we're not going on vacation..we're
				on a mission..

						korben
				what kind of mission?

						cornelius
					(sincere)
				we have to save the world.

						korben
					(skeptical)
				good luck..

						cornelius
				of course.

						korben
				father, i was in the army for awhile
				and every time they told us we were
				on a mission to save the world the
				only thing that changed was i lost a
				lot of friends. so thanks for the offer..
				but no thanks.

	cornelius is disappointed.  leeloo looks crestfallen.

						korben
				i'm sorry..

						voice
				this is a police control action..

	everyone freezes as the whole building resounds with the electronic
voice.
