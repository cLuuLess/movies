69	int.  corridor.  zorg's  warehouse - day

	close on: a pair of feet limping heavily.  a man comes alongside them.

						right arm
				excuse me sir, the council is worried about
				the economy heating up.  they wondered if
				it would be possible to fire 500...

	they reach a door at the end of the corridor.  zorg enters a code.

						zorg
				fire 1000.

						right arm
				but... 500 is all they need, sir.

	zorg turns slowly.  a small scar across run across his face, his eye
stutters.
	this is not a man to cross, or contradict.

						right arm
				1000! fine, sir!
				sorry to have disturbed you.

	the door opens...
