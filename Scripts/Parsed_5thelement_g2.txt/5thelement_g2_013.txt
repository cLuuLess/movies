13	int.  room 2  temple - day

	the kommander opens a case.  his men come and put the four, precious
stones in it, one by one.

						priest
					(moved)
				will the elements be gone now forever
				from this place?

						kommander
				when mankind comes to its senses.
				we will return.

						priest
				knowing mankind as i do, that could take
			centuries!

						kommander
				time is of no importance, only life
				is important.

	the priest nods and lowers his eyes.

	angle on:  billy staggering forward, raising his pistol, blinking his
eyes to focus..

	a mondoshawan puts the fourth element in the case the kommander shuts the
	case and looks at the priest.

						kommander
				when evil returns so shall we.

						priest
					(head lowered)
				we will be ready, lord.

	billy suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun.

						billy
				stop.

	billy trips, the gun goes off.  he empties the clip.  the mondoshawan
carrying the case crumples to the ground.  the wall immediately begins to
close.  billy fires wildly, unable to control the powerful kicking gun.

						priest
				no!!!  don't!!!

	the priest rushes billy.  the weapon has such a kick to it that billy
starts shooting into the air, backs up, then stumbles and knocks himself
out.  the priest is on the ground, seriously wounded.  so is the kommander.
the warriors are in a panic.

						clerk
				hurry, kommander!  the wall's closing!!!

	the wall continues to close.  sand pours in from everywhere.  the vast
room fills up like an hourglass.

						kommander
				a mission is a mission, savoia.
				you'll learn that.

	the kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but can't get
through it.  his
	armor is too bulky, the opening too small.  he manages to get his arm and
the case through.

						kommander
				my apologies to general kroi -- and my wife..

	the wall closes, crushing his arm.  the clerk scoops up the case and runs
	through the huge piles of sand.
