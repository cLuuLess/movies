	korben and his flying taxi are absolute masters of the air.  the cops
have trouble following him but then another cop car comes to join in the
fun.  korben drives like a man possessed, nothing can stop him. except the
dead-end he's just come up against.

				it there's one thing i don't need advice on,
				it's how to drive.

	korben turns his cab sideways and scrapes through a narrow passageway,
	ripping his taxi light from the roof.  the police car smashes into the
wall.  the other one brakes just in time.

						cop
				shit! attention all-patrol cars!

	the car makes a u-turn, looking for a wider passageway.
