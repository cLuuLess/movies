	an arm, on a surgical cart, moves down the hall of the nucleological
center, the most sterile of environments.

	professor mactilburgh, age 60, hurries alongside general munro.

						munro
				this is all that survived?

						mactilburgh
				actually only one cell survived..

						munro
				have you identified it?

						mactilburgh
				it's not that easy..we've never encountered
				anything like it before..you see normal human
				beings have 40 dna memo groums..which is
				more than enough for any species to perpetuate
				itself..this one has 200,000.

						munro
				talk english doc.

						mactilburgh
				this cell is like a huge library. it has infinite
				genetic knowledge stored inside.
				almost like it was...engineered.

						munro
				sounds like a freak of nature to me.

						mactilburgh
				yes... i can't wait to meet him.

	they pass into the lab.
