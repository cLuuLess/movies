23	int.  control  room / president's  office

						captain
				president on line sir..

	general staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see the
room but not the president.

						president (o.s.)
				staedert, do you read me?

						staedert
				i can hear you, mr. president, but i
				can't see you .

	the president grabs the mini-camera on his desk and yanks it around to
face him.
	his face fills the screen.

						president
					(exasperated)
				is that better?

						staedert
				perfect, mr. president.

						president
				i have to address the supreme council
				in 10 minutes.
				just the facts, general.

						staedert
				there are no results from the chemical
				and molecular analysis as of yet, all the
				calibers are overshot..we're hoping a
				thermo nucleatic imaging..

						president
				(exasperated)
				what you are saying is you don't know
				what this..thing..is.

	consternation reigns in the president's office.

						staedert
				not yet sir..the only thing we know is
				it just keeps getting bigger!

						president
				options.

						staedert
				wait or act.

						president
				recommendations.

						staedert
				my philosophy mr. president is shoot first
				ask questions later.
				i don't like uninvited guests.

						president
				gentlemen?

						head chemists
				i think it would be foolish to shoot at an
				organism that seems alive, without first
				taking the time to study it more!
				besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.

						president
					(worried)
				no... it's just getting bigger.

						head chemists
				so do people, but that's no reason to shoot
				them.

						president
					(exasperated)
				the security of the federated territories is
				and remains number one priority.
					(to the military)
				i suppose general staedert's "philosophy" is
				acceptable to you?

	all the generals nod "yes"

						president
				all right, then! staedert?

						priest (o.s.)
				mr. president?

	the president scans the room. staedert remote controls the camera toward
the room.

						president
				...yes?

	the camera moves up the priest and we finally discover his face.  he is
in his sixties, a shrewd look in his eyes.
	around his neck hangs the kommander's finger, the key to the temple.

						priest
				cornelius, vito cornelius. 50th level parish.
				i have a different theory to offer you,
				mr. president.

						president
				i'm listening.

						cornelius
				imagine for a moment that this. thing is not
				anything that can be identified because it prefers
				not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are.
				because it is evil.. total evil.

						president
					(a little sarcastically)
				one more reason to shoot first eh?

	all the generals nod in agreement.

						cornelius
				evil begets evil, mr. president.
				shooting would only make it stronger.
