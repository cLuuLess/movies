181	int.  concert  hall

	korben is tense.  the curtain rises.  the diva, in a stunning gown,
stands in the center of the stage, head bowed.  behind her, a star filled
window.  the music begins.  the diva looks up, a rare beauty, but an alien.
and then she begins to sing.  her voice is divine, unmatched.  korben is
swept up in the tears.
