	korben is finishing a thai meal, cooked by a thai on his mini restaurant
anchored at the window. the cat eats next to korben, contented.

						korben
				so you forgive me?

	the cat meows just as a red light blinks, announcing the arrival of a
message in a glass tube.  korben ignores it.

						thai
				not going to open?

						korben
				i've never gotten a message that wasn't
				bad news.

						thai
				how someone strong like you scared from
				a message? is good news i sure!

						korben
				the last two messages i got?  the first one
				was from my wife telling me she was leaving!
				and the second was from my lawyer telling me
				he was leaving too... with my wife.

						thai
				you right that is bad.. but mathematically
				luck must change!
				grandfather say: "it never rain every day."
				this is good news guarantee.. i bet you lunch!

	korben hesitates, then gives the envelope to the thai, who opens it with
a big smile that fades as reads the contents aloud.

						thai
				...you're fired. oh!

	korben smiles at him.

						korben
				at least i won lunch.

						thai
				good philosophy..see good in bad..

				special for you and pussy..
