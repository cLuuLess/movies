125	int.  shuttle - day

	korben makes his way in the plane  looking for his seat. no more seats in
modern planes, just individual travel boxes lined up like microwaves.  he
passes steward holding his bloodied nose. he has found what he is looking
for. he enters to.... leeloo quietly stretched out in front of a computer
screen.  korben slips in beside her.  leeloo in concentrating on the words
that scroll rapidly  past her on the screen.  he doesn't understand what she
is doing.

						leeloo
				apipoulai!

						korben
				not hard to find you...just follow the
				chaos...

	leeloo smiles, as if complimented.

						korben
				leeloo, listen to me... these tickets...
				they're not mine... i mean they are, but
				not for vacation like everyone thinks...
				i'm on an operation... and if i didn't come
				get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble...
				i'd love to be on vacation with you...
				but now.... now i've got to work...
				and leeloo... i would love to work in peace.

	leeloo types in "love" on the keyboard.

						leeloo
				love...

						korben
				yes! but "love" isn't the operative word
				here, peace is!

	leeloo types in this new word.

						leeloo
					(rather pleased)
				peace... and love...

	she brings up a picture of a 60's style hippie flashing a peace sign.
korben sighs and switches off the screen.

						korben
				sometimes you can't learn everything
				from a screen..sometimes it's better to
				ask someone who has experience..

						leeloo
					(quite happy)
				what is... make love?

	korben just stares at her for a few minutes.

						korben
				know what? on that subject maybe you'd
				be better off asking the screen.

	he turns the computer back on.

	angle on:

	a stewardess walks up the aisle of the shuttle pushing the red buttons on
top of each individual box.

						voice (o.s.)
				...to make your flight as short and agreeable
				as possible, our flight attendants are switching
				on the timing sleeper which will regulate your
				sleep during the trip...

	angle on:

						leeloo
					(switching off the screen)
				ok! finished!

						korben
				finished what?

						leeloo
				learning language.

						korben
				which one?

						leeloo
				all 900.

	korben doesn't know if he should laugh or not.

						korben
				you learned 900 languages in five
				minutes?!

						leeloo
					(pleased)
				yes! now it's your turn! i learned your
				language, you have to learn mine!

						korben
				i know how to say "hello". teach me how
				to say "good-bye", that's all i need.

						leeloo
				apipoussan!

						korben
				apipoussan?

						leeloo
				good! do you know how we say "make love"?

						korben
					(fumbling)
				uh...

						leeloo
				...hoppi-hoppa.

	korben literally melts.

						korben
					(to himself)
				help...

	luckily, a stewardess smiles at him through the box window.

						stewardess
				sweet dreams, mr. dallas!

	the stewardess sets the timing sleeper.  korben and leeloo immediately
fall asleep.

	a stewardess at the other end of the shuttle has a problem.

						stewardess 2
				mr. loc rhod you have to assume
				your individual position.

						loc rhod
					(hugging her)
				i don't want an individual position,
				i want all positions!

						stewardess 2
					(resisting somewhat)
				we're going to take off soon, mr. rhod!

						loc rhod
				now you're talking!
