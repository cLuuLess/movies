36	int.  president's  office

	the office is emptied, only a few army officers remain.  an ancient
manuscript, billy's drawings, sits in front of the president.  cornelius
turns page after page, illustrating his
	point.

						cornelius
					(to the president)
				we have forty-eight hours, the time it needs
				to adapt itself to our living conditions.

						president
					(worried)
				and then?

						cornelius
				and then it will be too late. the goal of
				evil is to wipe out life! all forms of life.
				for all eternity...life upsets it.

	the president appears upset himself by this image.

						president
				is there anything that can stop it?

						cornelius
					(knowing)
				yes..thank god..
