	korben leans over leeloo.

						korben
				leeloo? the stones! we have to open
				them! how does it work?

						leeloo
					(feeble)
				the wind blows... the fire burns...

						korben
				i know all that, leeloo! i'm talking
				about the stones.

						leeloo
				...the rain falls...

	korben is desperate.  leeloo's too weak, he won't get anything more out
of her.
	he darts over to a stone and turns it over and over.

						korben
				the rain falls... the wind blows?

	loc rhod stands in front of his stone looking at korben.

						korben
				try and figure out how this fucking thing
				opens, instead of staring at me like that!

	loc rhod starts feeling the stone all around.

						loc rhod
					(afraid)
				i'm looking, i'm looking.
