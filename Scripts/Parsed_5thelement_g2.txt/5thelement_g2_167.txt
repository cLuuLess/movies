170	int.  korben's  stateroom

	korben finishes putting on his tux, still on the phone.

						korben
				listen, ma! i've only got a few days
				vacation and i'll be damned if i'm
				gonna spend them on the phone.

	the door rings.

						korben
				...hang on, it's the door. no!
				i told you i didn't bring anybody!
				i'm all alone... as usual!

	korben opens the door.  it's not the champagne.  even better. it's
leeloo.

						korben
					(to his mother)
				...i'll call you back.

	leeloo heads right for her suitcase and starts to undress.  korben has to
turn away once more.

						korben
				here we go again...

						leeloo
					(by rote)
				you know women normally change five
				times more than men.

						korben
				you get that off the screen?

						leeloo
				yes... you know there's a lot of
				differences between men women.

						korben
				you noticed..

						leeloo
				ok, you can turn around!

	korben turns around.  leeloo has put on a very simple dress which is sexy
to the max.  he is smitten.  so much so that leeloo wonders if something
isn't quite right.

						korben
				where you going?

						leeloo
				i'm going to see the diva sing. what's
				the matter?... do i look bad?

						korben
				no, not at all!  i mean, just the opposite,
				you're... you're beautiful!

	leeloo smiles at him, his compliment pleases her.  she turns, revealing
her unzippered back.  korben cannot help but stare at her bare flesh.  her
perfect bottom.

						leeloo
				do you know how this works?

	korben's blood boils.  she wriggles, pressing her hands together close to
the zipper.

						korben
				i have an idea.

	but instead of pulling on the zipper he slips a bracelet on her wrist.  a
flourescent beam bursts out of the bracelet and forms a vertical bar going
from the floor to the ceiling.
	stunned, leeloo is held captive.

						korben
				i told you i need to work in peace.
				remember? i need to concentrate.

						leeloo
				and you can't concentrate with me
				around?.

						korben
				it's difficult.

	she tries to breakout.

						korben
				army issue. i'm sorry.

	leeloo tries desperately to get out of the handcuffs. impossible.

	korben sets the radio down in front of her and turns it on.
	leeloo looks like she'd like to break his head.

						leeloo
					(seething)
				you're nothing but a... a...

						korben
				the words you're looking for weren't
				in the dictionary you studied. i won't
				be long.

	the door flies open.  loc rhod barges in.

						loc rhod
				hey stud we gotta...

	then he sees the scene, leeloo cuffed, in a low cut dress.  his mind goes
to the obvious.

						loc rhod
				korben my man what's happening here?
				who's the chick? what's the gig?
				we free forming here? getting funky
				with the monkey? can i get in on this?

	korben grabs him by the collar..

						korben
				no..to all of the above.

	and yanks loc rhod out of the room.  leaving leeloo looking extremely
unhappy.
