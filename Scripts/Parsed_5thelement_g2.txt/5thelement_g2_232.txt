	leeloo sticks her fingers out one of the bullet holes and lets some of
her blood drip down.

	the blood splats on korben's hand.  he snaps his head up and knows
immediately who is up there.  he forgets about the bomb.

						loc rhod
				hey! what are you doing? the bomb!

	korben drags the desk over, jumps on it and pokes his head in the torn up
airshaft he spots leeloo who gives him a weak smile.

						korben
				don't worry, i'm here now!

	he pulls her toward him, helps her out of the shaft and stretches her out
on the desk.

						korben
				just relax. i've got the stones.
				everything's going to be fine.

	30 seconds left on the timer.

						loc rhod
					(falling to pieces)
				like korben, can i have 30 seconds of
				your time here?

						korben
					(to leeloo)
				i'll be right back.

	korben dashes over to the bomb.  he is stopped by the barrel of the zf1.
zorg, in person, holding a magnetic card.

						zorg
					(smiling)
				allow me...

	zorg slips a small magnetic card in the bomb, it starts to count down
from 5 minutes.

						zorg
				just for the fun of it.

						zorg

				section sent by old lindberg himself.

	korben doesn't reply.

						zorg

						zorg

						korben

						korben
				two! that's for firing me! three!
