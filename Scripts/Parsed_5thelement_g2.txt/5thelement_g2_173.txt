				we have just walked into what is probably
				the most beautiful concert hall in the universe.
				totally awesome! magnificent paintings on the
				ceiling. i don't know who painted them, but he
				must have busted his balls! i see a row of former
				ministers, more sinister than minister! a few generals
				practicing how to sleep. and there's baby ray, star
				of stage and screen, drowning in a sea of nymphets.
				he's not gonna get much out of this concert, he's
				stone-deaf!

	angle on:

	baby ray bending his ear to a girl asking for an autograph.

				...and over there is roy von bacon, the king
				of laserball and the best paid player in the league.
					(shakes hands as he goes by)
				...and over there is the emperor kodar japhet
				whose daughter aachen is still at the bar.
				"i love to sing, too, but in the shower", she
				recently confessed to me. she will no doubt
				prove to be as generous tonight as she always is.
