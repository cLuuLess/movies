68	int.  cornelius'  apartment - day

	leeloo has a towel wrapped around her, it looks like she just took a
shower.  she sits  in front of a computer wolfing down some chicken.  data
scrolls by on the screen.  david watches from the corner, in awe.

						david
				what's she doing?

						cornelius
				learning our history!
				the last 5000 years that she missed!
				she's been out of circulation a while,
				you know.

	leeloo breaks into her childish laughter.

						cornelius
				what're you laughing about?

						leeloo
					(pronouncing badly)
				napoleon... small.

	she laughs again and tosses some capsules into the microwave.

						david
					(hesitant)
				uh father, i know she's been through a lot...
				but the sacred stones..we don't have much
				time..

						cornelius
				yes. of course..

	leeloo takes her plate out of the microwave.  a steaming plate heaped
with chicken and exotic vegetables.

						cornelius
				leeloo..i'm sorry to interrupt you but..

	she sits back down in front of the screen and chomps away heavily on her
second chicken.  cornelius sits opposite her. and holds up the case
handle.

						cornelius
					(serious)
				the case..with the stones...
				where is it?

						leeloo
				san agamat chay bet... envolet!

						cornelius
				the case was stolen?

	leeloo nods her head, quite unperturbed and continues to devour the food
in front of her.

						cornelius
					(shocked)
				who in gods name would do such
				a thing?
