	the police car roars up, sirens screaming then slows down and checks out
a dead-end flanked by a large vertical neon billboard. the dead-end is empty .
korben's cab is hidden vertically behind the billboard.  seeing nothing, the
	police drive away.

	the girl grabs his shirt collar and pulls him close, whispers in his ear.
