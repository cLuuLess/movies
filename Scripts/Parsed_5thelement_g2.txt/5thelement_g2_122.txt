123	int.  hall

	korben is led down the hall by a stewardess.

						stewardess
				you are so lucky... loc rhod is the
				coolest dj in the universe.

						korben
				listen... i don't want to be interviewed.
				i'd prefer to remain anonymous.

	the stewardess stops in the corridor.

						stewardess
				forget anonymous.  you'll be doing loc
				rhod's live show every day from 5 to 7!

						korben
					(expression changes)
				you gotta be kidding!

	the stewardess smiles and shakes her head.  the door next to him suddenly
swings open and smashes him in the face.

	in walks loc rhod amidst a tornado of music and security guards.  he is
young, good-looking, eccentric, charming as an elf or sly as a fox.  a
bundle of energy.  he is the 24th century's most popular dj.

						loc rhod
					(speedy, in rhythm)
				korben dallas! here he is the most hated
				man in the universe. the one and only winner
				of the gemini croquette contest! ladies, start
				melting 'cause the boy's hot! hot! hot! the boy
				is perfect..
					(he feels his muscles)
				...the right size, right build, right hair.  right on!
				say something-to those 50 billion pair of ears out
				there d-man!

	an assistant hands a totally lost korben a mike.

						korben
					(hesitant)
				...hi.

						loc rhod
				does it get any better or what!

	loc rhod grabs korben's arm and leads him down the hallway, as fast as
the music.

						loc rhod
				...quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on
				fire right here from 5 to 7! you'll know
				everything there is to know about the d-man.
				his dreams, his desires, his most intimate of
				intimates.  and from what i'm looking at
				intimate is the stud muffin's middle name.
				so tell me my main man... you nervous in the
				service?

						korben
				uh... not really.

	loc rhod lets go of korben's arm and grabs the stewardess.

						loc rhod
				freeze those knees, my chickadees, 'cause
				korben is on the case with a major face...

	loc rhod rubs up against the stewardess.

						loc rhod
				...start drooling, ladies! my man here is a
				sharp-tongued sire who's gonna stroke your
				every desire.

	they come to an intersection.  the airline company has prepared drinks
for them.  loc rhod pushes on, grabs a glass of champagne, scribbles his
autograph.

						loc rhod
				yesterday's unknown will be tomorrow's prince
				of fhloston paradise, the hotel of a thousand and
				one follies, home of luxury and beauty.  a magic
				fountain flowing with non-stop wine, women and
				bootchie koochie koo...

	he tosses away his champagne glass.

						loc rhod
				beware out there puppy dogs my man is on
				the prowl. owwww!

	howling, loc rhod grabs another stewardess by the arm.

						loc rhod
				...and start licking your stamps little girls,
				this guy's gonna have you writing home to
				momma! tomorrow from 5 to 7, i'll be your
				voice, your tongue and i'll be hot on the tail
				of the sexiest man of the year... d-man...
				your man... my man.

	the stewardess shivers.  a beep is heard.

						vocoder (o.s.)
				end of transmission.

	the music suddenly stops.  several assistants come and compliment loc
rhod who sighs, lights up a cigarette, and drops his pretense.

						loc rhod
				korben sweetheart do me a favor i know this
				is probably the biggest thing that ever happened
				to you in your inconsequential life. but i've got
				a show to do here and it's got to pop. so tomorrow,
				when we're on air, give me a hand... try to make
				believe you have more than a one word vocabulary.
				ok pal?

	that does it.  korben grabs him by the collar and drags him into a
corner.
	loc rhod's feet don't touch the ground.

						korben
					(pissed)
				i didn't come here to play dumbo on the radio.
				so tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a
				hand, that clear pal?

						loc rhod
					(petrified)
				crystal.
