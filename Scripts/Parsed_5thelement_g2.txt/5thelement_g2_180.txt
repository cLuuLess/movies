183	int.  diva's  suite

	the manager couldn't care less about the concert.  his main problem is
the bottle of scotch he can't seem to open.  the doorbell rings.

						manager
					(ugly mood)
				yeah!?

						voice (o.s.)
				flowers for the diva.

						manager
				she's allergic to flowers!!!

						voice (o.s.)
				there's champagne as well...

	the manager takes one look at the stubborn bottle and opens the door. and
finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun. a dozen mangalores rush
in. one of them, with a human face, closes the door and waits out in the hall.

	angle on:

	cornelius watching from around the corner.

						cornelius
				...my god!
