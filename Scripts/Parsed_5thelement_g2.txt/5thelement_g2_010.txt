10	int.  temple  room

	the kommander holds out his hand to the priest.

						priest
				what did i do wrong?

	the priest jumps to his feet excitedly.

						kommander
				servant, you and the thousand guards
				before you... you have done your work well,
				but we have to recover the elements. war will
				soon engulf your planet. we must keep them safe.

	the kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock.
he finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate
than a key to a safe.  he turns his hand, activating a mechanism that opens
the wall.

						professor
				unbelievable!!!

	the kommander turns around and crooks a finger.  one of the mondoshawans
	waves his hand, puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway
revealed by the opening.  he is followed by his men.  the priest slips in
behind them.
