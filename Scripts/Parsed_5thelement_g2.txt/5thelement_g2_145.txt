147	int.  zorg's office

	picasso purrs contentedly on zorg's lap.  the phone rings.

						secretary (o.s.)
				mr. shadow on the line.

	zorg shoots to his feet.  picasso tumbles to the floor.  zorg picks up
the phone, both excited and uneasy. he stands there, almost coming to
attention.

						zorg
				yes... zorg here.

	the voice is feeble.  it comes from the far reaches of time, from the
bowels of the universe.

						shadow
				am i disturbing you?

						zorg
				no... not at all.  where are you?

	shadow's breathing is awesome.

						shadow
				...not far, now.

						zorg
				really? maybe i can get you on my screen
				and see you at last!

	zorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons.

	in the middle of an electronic snowstorm, a blackish, vaguely human,
quiverinq form appears. two eyes, like lava, give an idea where the head is.
zorg feels sick.

						shadow
				do you have the picture now mr. zorg?

						zorg
				got it.

						shadow
				how's our deal coming along?

						zorg
					(ill at ease)
				fine, just fine!  i'll have the 4 pieces you
				asked for any time now.  but it wasn't easy.
				my costs have tripled.

	shadow pauses an instant.  a black slimy liquid starts to ooze from the
top of the screen.  zorg is feeling worse all the time.

						shadow
				money is of no importance...
				i want the stones!

	the black liquid oozes all over the screen which starts to melt.  zorg
sweats profusely,  his legs tremble.

						zorg
				the stones will be here. i'll see to it
				personally!

						shadow
				...i can't wait to be among you.

	zorg sighs and sits down totally freaked.
