150	ext.  fhloston  paradise

	the spaceship descends through some clouds and glides over a vast
turquoise sea.  fhloston paradise looms into view.  an enormous oceanliner
floating a dozen yards above the water.  on closer inspection it is more
modern than a traditional oceanliner.  the shuttle draws near, looking
ridiculously small next to the monster.  like a sardine next to a whale.
