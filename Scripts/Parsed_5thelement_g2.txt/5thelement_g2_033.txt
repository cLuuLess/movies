33	int.  apartment

	... wakes up a man trying to escape from a nightmare. korben dallas rubs
his head.  thirty five years old, short hair, powerfully built,
unquestionable charm, good looking in spite of the scars here and there.
the alarm clock is still ringing, it shows the date as march 18, 2359.  it
in two in the morning. ha grabs a cigarette, and stops to look for a
light.  he shuts oft the alarm.  he hears a cat mewing in the hall.  but it
	still rings.  korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone
that is ringing.

						korben
					(to the cat)
				i'm coming.

	he grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment (27 feet long by 6 feet
wide) heading for the door, patting himself for a light.  behind him, the
bed makes itself automatically.

						korben
					(on the phone)
				yeah?

						finger (v.o.)
				hey bud! finger here.

	he opens the door for the cat and starts to rummage through a drawer for
a match. out come a handful of war decorations, a hero's collection.

						korben

					(to the cat)
				hi sweetie!

	...a medal of honor certificate to major dallas

						finger (v.o.)
				i love you too major, but you haven't called
				me that since basic training.

						korben
				i was talking to the cat.

						finger (v.o.)
				oh, yeah, i forgot.you still prefer
				your cat to the real thing.

	...a picture of korben and his ex-wife on their wedding day.

						korben
				at least, the cat comes back.

						finger (v.o.)
					(ironical)
				you still pining for that two timing bitch.
				forget her.
				there are a million women out there.

						korben
				i don't want a million - i just want
				one.  a perfect one.

						finger (v.o.)
				don't exist bud.

	...a picture of korben and finger in uniform next to a space fighter.

						korben
				i just found a picture of you.

						finger (v.o.)
				how do i look?

						korben
				like shit.

	korben finds a box of matches with three matches.  he strikes one. it
does not light.  korben opens the fridge, bare, except for an empty can of
gemini croquettes.
	on the packet is an ad:
	win a dream trip for 2 to fhloston paradise.

						finger (v.o.)
				 must be an old picture.. listen, you gotta bring
				me your hack for the 6 month overhaul.  a.s.a.p.

	korben heats up some brackish water.

						korben
					(sighs)
				i don't need one.

						finger (v.o.)
				you forgetting who sat next to you for
				a thousand missions.
				i know how you drive.

						korben
				finger!  i'm driving a cab now, not a
				space fighter!!

						finger (v.o.)
				how many points you got left on your
				license?

						korben
					(lying)
				uh... at least fifty.

						finger (v.o.)
				in your dreams! see you tonight!

	finger has hang up.  korben sighs and does the same.  he gets the heated
brackish water and sits down.  the cat pounces on the table and meows for
its food.  korben pours half the coffee in the cat's cup.

	the cat meows.  korben taps his cup to the cat's saucer.

						korben
				cheers!
