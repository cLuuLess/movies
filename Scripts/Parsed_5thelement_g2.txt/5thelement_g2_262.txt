265	int.  temple

	lit by torches, korben sets leeloo delicately on the altar in the exact
center of the four elements.  cornelius looks over the four stones every
which way.

						cornelius
					(panic-stricken)
				uh, this one... must be water!

	it's obvious he doesn't know where to put it.

						korben
				don't tell me you don't know how all
				this works?

						cornelius
				theoretically, yes! the four stones form
				the beam and the fifth element is supposed
				to stand in the middle there, but...
				i don't have the reference book.
				i've never seen the stones work!

	korben can't believe his ears.  he tears the stone out of cornelius' hand
and studies the inscriptions.  he goes over to one of the four bases the
stones rest on and tries to figure it out.  the symbol of air is on the stone,
the same as on the base.

						korben
				match the symbols!

	korben places the first stone and picks up another one.  cornelius has
found the symbol for water.  loc rhod sits down.  he is very tired.

						loc rhod
				what is this some kinda game? like
				chess?

	korben pulls him to his feet and sticks a stone in his hands.

						korben
				no. it's much simpler. if we don't figure
				out where these stones go in five minutes,
				we're all dead! think you got it?

	loc rhod's got it and runs over to put in his stone.  the four stones are
all in place but nothing happens.

						korben
				there's no light! you told me there were
				supposed to be four beams of light.

						cornelius
					(lost)
				yes, of course, but... the stones are shut!
				they have to be open for it to work.

						korben
				and you don't know how they open,
				is that what you are saying?

						cornelius
				that's what i'm saying.
