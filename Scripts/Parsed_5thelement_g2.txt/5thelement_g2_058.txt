58	int.  cab - night

	korben tries to control his car, reeling from the impact.

						voice (o.s.)
				you have just had an accident.
				seven points have been temporarily
				removed...

	korben manages to stop his cab, pulls over to the side.

						voice / korben
				you have one point left on your license.
				have a good day.

	korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are.  the
girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn't be), emerges from the debris and sits up.
there's some blood on her face.  korben is stunned. the girl's still alive
and... so beautiful.  his heart heads for a meltdown.

						girl
				akina delutan, nou-shan.

						korben
					(lost)
				...'scuse me?

	a police car with wailing sirens halts in front of korben.

						cop
					(over a loudspeaker)
				you have an unauthorized passenger in your
				vehicle.  we are going to arrest her.
				please leave your hands on the wheel.
				thank you for your cooperation.

						korben
					(obeying)
				sorry, hon, but i only got one point left
				on my license and i gotta get to the garage!

	the police car presses up against the cab.  doors slide open.  huge guns
point at her.  korben feels lousy.  the girl's helpless, there are tears in
her eyes, she looks exhausted.
	korben glances at her in the rear view mirror. she's looking all around
to find something to help her communicate with him.

	her pov: an ad on the back of the seat. an 800 number to help an
orphanage. a teary photo of a kid over the words please help.  she shoots
to korben a look of pure distress.

						girl
					(irresistible)
				please... help...

	korben can't resist her plea.

						korben
				don't put me in this position...
				i can't... i'm late as it is...

	but he cannot say no to her eyes.

						korben
				finger's gonna kill me.

	korben shuts oft the meter and floors it, sideswiping the police car as
he roars away.

						voice (o.s.)
				your license has been revoked.
				would you please....

	korben whips out a gun and shatters the loudspeaker.

						korben
				i hate when people cry...
				i got no defense...

	the police car takes out after him, sirens screeching.  an insane chase
ensues.
