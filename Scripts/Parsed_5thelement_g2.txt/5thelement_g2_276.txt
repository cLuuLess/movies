				now you're allowed to kiss me.

	- korben wraps his arms around her and kisses her like he's never kissed
anybody before.  - the white beam, the divine light, immediately forms
around leeloo and korben. - the stopwatch hits zero.  - the absolute beam
explodes from the top of the pyramid and heads straight into the sky zapping
the fireball smack in the middle, slowing it down.  - korben and leeloo kiss
like there was no tomorrow.

	- the beam hardens and slowly solidifies the evil planet.  inaudible
screeches escape from the dying planet.  screeches of terrifying pain as if a
million souls were dying.

	- streams of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like
brilliant stalactites.
