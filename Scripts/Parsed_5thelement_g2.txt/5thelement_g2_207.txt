210	int.  concert  hall

	korben wastes two more mangalores.

						diva
				she needs you. she needs your help and
				your love. she's more fragile than she seems...

	korben looks around, ready for another attack.

						korben
				...yeah, so am i.

	the diva takes his hand.

						diva
				she was taught to love the life of others...
				but not her own. you have to teach her
				to love if you want her to truly live!

						korben
					(uncomfortable)
				i'll help her, i promise, but i think you
				should tell me where the stones are!

						diva
				do you love her?

						korben
				i... i don't know! we hardly know
				each other... it takes time!

						diva
				i don't have time... i need to know.

						korben
				listen, the last time i admitted to a woman
				i loved her ... i never saw her again.

						diva
				i would like to have died in peace...

	the diva's eyes close.
