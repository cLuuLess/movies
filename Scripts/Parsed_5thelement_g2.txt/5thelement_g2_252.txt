	leeloo smiles, weakly, feverish.

						leeloo
				i'm so very sad.

						korben

				money...
				everything you create is used to destroy...

						korben
				i told you not to read all that crap!

						leeloo
				protect life... until death.

	her eyes close and she falls back asleep.  korben is worried.  she seems
so depressed.  cornelius enters.
