214	int.  concert  hall

	korben slaps the diva soundly.  she comes around somewhat.

						korben
				i'm sorry, but... the stones...

						diva
					(very weak)
				they are... with me...

	the diva dies.  blue blood streams from her mouth.  korben frisks the
diva but doesn't find anything.  the shooting slowly stops in the theatre.
the mangalores are now in total control.

						mangalore 2
				stay calm and nobody will get hurt!
				hands on your head and into the hall!

	the guests comply

						korben
					(to himself)
				...the stones are with me?

	and then it occurs to him.

						korben
				...in me?

	he touches the diva's stomach and senses something hard.  girding
himself, he sticks his hand in the wound and pulls out a sacred stone.
then another.  and another.  korben pulls out all four stones, covered in blue
blood.  everyone has left the theater.  the mangalores check the aisles one
by one.

	loc rhod peeks out from under a seat.

						loc rhod
				don't you think we'd better be going?

	a mangalore spots korben kneeling alongside the diva.  he grabs korben by
the shoulder and pokes him with his gun.

						mangalore
				hey, you! with the others!

	korben spins and, in one swift motion, breaks his arm.  just for
starters.  another warrior rushes over.  korben punches him into oblivion
and snatches the gun.

						korben
				that's it... i've had... all day people
				have been sticking guns in my face...

	korben wraps up the four stones in his shirt.

						loc rhod
				korben man... these dudes are going
				to waste us if we don't do what they say.

	korben gives him the package and grabs his mike.

						korben
				you don't do what i say... i'll waste
				you myself. got it?

						loc rhod
				got it...
