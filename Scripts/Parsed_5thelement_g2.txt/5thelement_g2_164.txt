167	int.  corridor  fhloston paradise - day

	leeloo watches the diva's arrival.  a door opens and two policeman clear
the way for diva plavalaguna, her manager, her bodyguards and a gaggle of
	porters carrying trunks.

	not wanting to draw attention to herself, leeloo feigns interest in a
painting that is obviously upside down. a white chiffon veil covers the face
of the diva, she stops in front of leeloo.  the diva reaches out and
strokes leeloo's face, without touching her. the diva removes her hand
making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on.  leeloo is groggy.
the diva's assistant comes up to her.

						diva's assistant
				please forgive this little incident. she wants
				you to know that she senses great powers in
				you... in the service of a noble cause... she
				will give you what you have come to get, but
				she wants to sing first...
				one last time...

	the diva's assistant turns the painting right side up.

						diva's assistant
					(nodding)
				miss.

	leeloo looks at the painting, seems to understand it better.
