8	int.  temple  room - day

	the professor reads the wall.

						professor
				and this divine light they talk
				about.. what is divine light?

	at that moment, the reflection from aziz's mirror drops again.  the light
fails.

						professor
					(without turning)
				aziz light!

	the room is flooded with light all of the sudden.

						professor
				better.. this is the most unbelievable thing
				i have ever seen..

	the professor turns around, and is stunned speechless to find himself
face to face with two mondoshawans.  a dozen others fill the hall manning
the source of the light, large luminous globes.  aziz is fast asleep.

						professor
					(uncomprehending)
				...uh, yes?

	the professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens.
the kommander stops in front of the priest who is still on his knees, face
to the ground.

						priest
				master... he was about to discover everything,
				but i had the situation under control.

	the two mondoshawan guards hold the professor three feet off the ground.

						professor
					(in a panic)
				who are you?  are you germans?  sprechen
				sie deutsch?
