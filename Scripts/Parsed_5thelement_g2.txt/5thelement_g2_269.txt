	korben helps leeloo onto her feet where the four beams and four colors
crisscross.

						korben
				it's up to you now, angel!

						leeloo
				i'm so tired...

						korben
				you can sleep tomorrow... come on...

						leeloo
				i want to sleep... forever...

						korben
				leeloo! listen to me! i'll take you on
				a vacation afterwards! a real vacation,
				this time, for as long as you want.
				come on! you can do it!

	korben slowly releases leeloo and steps back from the altar.
	leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams.
	an indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise.

						cornelius
				come on leeloo! come on!

	the beam loses its intensity.  leeloo crumples to the floor.
