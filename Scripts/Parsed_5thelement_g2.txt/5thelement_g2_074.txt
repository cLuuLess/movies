75	int.  zorg's  warehouse - day

						zorg
				i'm fucked!

	zorg calmly closes the case and gives aknot a blood-chilling stare.

						aknot
				you asked for a case.
				we brought you a case.

						zorg
					(shouting)
				a case with four stones in it. not one!
				not two or three! but four!!! four stones!!!
				what the fuck am i supposed to do with an
				empty case?!!

aknot's men grow edgy.

						aknot
					(tense)
				...we are warriors, not merchants!

						zorg
					(humored)
				but you can still count.  look...
				my fingers.

	he holds up four fingers.

						zorg
				...four stones, four crates... zero stones...
					(yelling)
				zero crates!!!
					(to his men)
				put everything back, we're outta here.

	aknot's warriors turn their weapons on zorg.

						aknot
					(icily)
				we risked our lives. i believe a
				little compensation is in order.

						zorg
					(smiling)
				so, you are a merchant, after all.
					(to his men)
				leave them one crate.  for the cause!

	zorg's men leave a crate and exit with the other three.
