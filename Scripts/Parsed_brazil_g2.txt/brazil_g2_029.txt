38  int.   buttle flats				  day		   38
	
	cut to sam hesitantly walking into the semi-derelict lobby
	of the big block of flats. graffiti, vandalism are in
	evidence everywhere. he walks up to the lift. pushes the
	button. nothing happens. he pushes again. this time the
	lift door shudders and sparks. sam tries to pull the doors
	apart. they jam open with a three-inch gap between them -
	still shuddering and grinding. in the sparking light, sam
	can make out an interior crammed with garbage, junk, old
	furniture, dead cats. yechhhh. resignedly, he turns
	towards the stairs.
