15  int.   buttle flat				   night		 15
	
	helpmann and interviewer are on the tv, the end credits
	rolling over them to the beat of a mozart theme tune.
	pulling back we reveal that the tv is in a conventional
	sitting room, conventionally decorated for christmas; out
	the room is oddly encumbered by huge metal conduits that
	snake unpleasantly across and through the walls. smaller
	conduits radiate from the main one connecting the various
	services that central services (the name emblazoned on the
	metal) supply to this household. a conventionally poor but
	proud family occupies the room. mrs buttle is reading
	dickens' christmas carol to girl buttle who is about six.
	boy buttle plays quietly with a toy machine gun and some
	action men dressed in security gear. mr. buttle is putting
	the final touches to a neatly wrapped christmas present
	which looks identical to the "executive toy" we have just
	seen in he technician's office.

	faintly from outside comes a burst of laughter. a tilt of
	the camera indicates that the laughter is coming from the
	floor above.
