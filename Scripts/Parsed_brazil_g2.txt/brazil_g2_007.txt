16  int.   jill's flat				   night		 16

	the flat is very bare and basic. the laughter is coming
	from a cheap portable television showing "sgt. bilko. from
	bilko's pov we look through an open door of a bathroom
	straight at a mirror propped up by the bath, to enable the
	person in the bath to watch the tv. the person in the bath
	is jill layton, washing the grime off herself while she
	watches bilko in the mirror. from her pov in the mirror,
	the t.v. screen is suddenly obscured by part of the body
	of a man in uniform.
