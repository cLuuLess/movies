152 ext.   beautiful valley			   day		 152
	
	half hidden in the heart of the valley is the truck with
	the house on its back. creepers and wild roses have grown
	up over the truck and some of the house. a curl of smoke
	rises from a makeshift chimney which has been attached to
	one of the walls. a small piece of ground around the truck
	has been cleared and made into a pretty garden with a
	vegetable plat. there is also a pretty cow, and some
	chickens. jill appears locking like crusoe carrying a
	basket of eggs.
