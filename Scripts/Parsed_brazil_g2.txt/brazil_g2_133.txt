	sam finds himself in a strange little house empty of
	furniture except a few fitted cupboards and a fitted bed
	frame. he tries to lock the door behind him but there is
	no key. he puts his weight against the door to keep it
	shut. from outside there is the general noise of pursuit
	but this fades and resolves itself into a fairly quiet
	uniform engine-sound. sam lets go of the door carefully.
	he looks around but there is only one window and it is
	shuttered. he carefully opens the door a crack and he sees-
	
	sam's pov: a rapidly receding street.
