71  int.   room 500l					day		   71
	
	inside there is a connecting door to he next door room but
	the only person in the immediate room is a pleasant-
	looking female typist, wearing headphones, chewing gum and
	typing with great facility. sam approaches the typist who,
	busily typing, twinkles a greeting (mimed) and silently
	mouths the words ...
	
					   typist
			it won't be long now.
				(she carries on typing)
				
	sam nods, and stands quietly by her. he can hear tiny
	sounds coming through her headphones. he looks down at the
	piece of paper in the typewriter. he reacts a bit
	strangely, perhaps even winces. we see he close up of the
	words being struck crisply on paper.
	
					on typewriter
			ahhhh, oh god ... no, don't ... uhh,
			please ... i ... stop!! i can't stand
			... aiieeee.
	
					   typist
				(quietly, still typing)
			can i help you?
	
	she is looking at sam helpfully, holding one of the
	earphones away from her ear. from this earphone we can
	just hear quietly ...
	
					  earphone
			oooooooh ... aaaaaahhh ... please ...
			arrrrrghhhh no ... please ... oh god,
			no ... no, stop, i don't know ...
	
						sam
			i'm looking for officer 412/l.
	
	the typist nods smiling. she puts back the earphone and
	carries on typing.
	
					   typist
			i'm sure he won't be long now.
	
	she types a little more but suddenly stops.
	
					i thought so!
	
	she takes off the earphones and takes the paper and
	carbonums out of her typewriter and starts collating all
	the different copies.
	
	through the frosted glass door leading into the next area,
	sam can see a figure come through a double door and turn
	left, making a silly 'hi' sign to the typist as he exits
	from sight. she is charmed. almost immediately after them,
	a white-coated technician exits, but to the left.
	
					   typist
			you can go in now.
