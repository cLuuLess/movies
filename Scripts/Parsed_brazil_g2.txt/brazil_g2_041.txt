50  int.   sam's flat					evening		50
	
	sam enters. the place is in a state of turmoil. servicing
	panels are off the walls. conduit, ducting, pipes, unknown
	mechanical horrors spew from the wall as if the place was
	disemboweled. spoor stands in the middle of it all trying
	to direct two other workmen who are poring over wiring
	plans which seem to make little sense to them. dowser is
	not visible but there is a great deal of clunking and
	banging going on somewhere behind the wall.
	
						sam
			what the - ? how did you - ?
	
						spoor
			emergency procedures.
	
					dowser (o.s.)
				(muffled)
			...ergency procedures.
	
						sam
				(angrily)
			i haven't got an emergency. get out
			of here.
	
	for reply spoor whips a small tape-recorder out of his bag
	and plays back sam's original phone call to central
	services, claiming "an emergency". spoor shuts off his
	machine, puts back into his bag and comes out with what
	looks like a quite thin phone hook with carbon paper
	between each page. spoor indicates the bottom of page 1.
	
						spoor
			sign here please.
	
						sam
			what is it?
	
						spoor
				(surprised)
			it's a 27b/6, what did you think it
			was?
	
	sam takes out kurtzman's old-fashioned fountain pen from
	his pocket, signs where indicated. spoor registers that
	sam's signature has hardly penetrated through he first
	carbon let alone the other 43
	
						spoor
				(sourly)
			haven't you got a ballpoint?
	
	sam resignedly starts signing all the other pages one by
	one. spoor realises that dowser's echo has gone missing.
	
						spoor
			now where's he got to?
				(shouts)
			dowser!
	
	dowser bursts through a panel in the wall. this is the
	panel which tuttle had removed and replaced. a few of the
	flat's intestines have come out with dowser. dowser has
	made a find - tuttle's spare part.
	
						spoor
			what have you got there?
	
					   dowser
				(highly excited)
			got there!
	
	dowser points to tuttle's spare part which is hanging out
	of the wall attached to rubber tube. spoor examines this
	closely. sam watches alarmed. the two men go into a
	mumbling huddle.
	
						spoor
			mumble ... mumble ... mumble ...
			tuttle
	
					   dowser
			mumble ... tuttle ...
	
						spoor
			tuttle! ... mumble!
				(to sam)
			you've had that scab tuttle here,
			haven't you?
	
					   dowser
			...aven't you?
	
						sam
			what?
	
						spoor
			who fixed your ducts?
	
					   dowser
			...your ducts?
	
						sam
			i fixed it myself.
	
						spoor
			oh yeh? where'd you get this from eh
				(he holds up tuttle's spare
				part)
			out yer nostril?
	
					   dowser
			...yer nostril?
	
						spoor
			central services don't take kindly to
			sabotage!
	
					   dowser
			...sabotage!
	
	spoor and dowser and the other workmen gather up their
	tools - put them in the bag, grab everything else that
	belongs to them and are leaving. spoor grabs the form-book
	out of sam's hands, rips out the last page, thrusts that
	page at sam, shoves the book into his bag. the workmen
	begin leaving the flat.
	
						sam
			hang on! wait a minute! you can't
			just go and leave it like this!
	
						spoor
				(mock innocent)
			why not? all you've got to do is blow
			yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
	
					   dowser
			...ven't you?
	
						spoor
				(leaving)
			you're putting your talents to very
			odd use mr lowry - yes, odd use - to
			pit wits against central services -
	
					   dowser
			...sod you, stupid twit.
	
	they go, slamming the door behind hem, leaving sam in the
	ruins of his flat.
	
	sam stands in the maimed sitting-room. wall panels are
	off. tubes, ducting wires etc. spill out into the room
	like greasy intestines. sam more or less collapses onto a
	couch. he stares at the ceiling. the room is gently
	hiccoughing and belching around him. he stares at the
	print-out of jill's face. slowly it dissolves into the
	dream girl.
