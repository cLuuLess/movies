	sam watches jill walk away from the lorry and enter the
	despatcher's hut. he looks around uneasily and then he
	start examining the inside of the lorry and opens a
	compartment which seems to be full of maps, rags, etc. he
	gets grease on sleeve of his suit. in the space behind the
	seats he finds the pieces of luggage which jill had
	carried away from the flat. he starts to examine this
	cautiously and is startled by the sudden opening of the
	cab door.
	
						jill
			don't act guilty. act like me. i'm
			just getting on with my job. or, are
			you just getting on with yours?
	
	jill gets into the cab and closes the door and drives to a
	forward looking position.
	
						sam
			what's going on here?
	
						jill
			what does it look like ... i'm
			collecting empties.
			
	the lorry stops and jill gets out. from sam's p.o.v., the
	house suspended from the crane starts moving through the
	sky towards the lorry. he glances back to see jill slip a
	package out from behind the seat. she glances
	surreptitiously over her shoulder and slipping the parcel
	inside her jacket she walks away.
