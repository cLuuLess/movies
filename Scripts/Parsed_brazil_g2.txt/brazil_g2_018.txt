27  int.   doctor's office				day		   27
	
	cut to an old woman's face reflected in triplicate in a
	three-panelled mirror. a pair of man's hands have a grip
	on her flabby cheeks, pulling them out several inches on
	either side of her face. when i say several inches that's
	just what i mean. not only are her jowls being stretched
	like silly putty but they are also being wrapped around to
	the back of her neck to demonstrate how tight and smooth
	her face can be made by doctor who is prattling on over
	this freak show.
	
					   doctor
			now, when you come in tomorrow, mrs
			lowry, we'll make a little tuck here
			... and there ...
	
	cut to wide shot of doctor's surgery. it looks a bit like
	a cross between an operating theatre and a boudoir. the
	cold steel, glass and plastic surfaces are badly disguised
	with pastel coloured chintz and satin. at the dressing
	table sits the old woman, sam's mother. behind her stands
	the doctor. he is much like his surgery. he has tailored
	his surgical garments like a gigolo's dressing gown. it
	seems that he has done a bit of tuck-taking on himself.
	there is a certain plastic smoothness to his skin, but all
	in all he has been fairly successful. sam is pacing
	around, raving.
	
						sam
				(angrily)
			i just wish you would stop
			interfering, mother! i don't want
			promotion. i'm happy where i am.
	
					   mother
			no you're not. jack lint is a lesson
			to you - he never had your brains but
			he's got the ambition. you haven't
			got the ambition but luckily you've
			got me. and mr helpmann. mr helpmann
			was very close -
	
					   doctor
			now, mrs lowry, don't get upset
				(so sam)
			please wait in reception, mr lowry,
			you're giving her wrinkles.
	
					   mother
			you see!
	
						sam
				(groans)
	
					   doctor
			now mrs lowry, try to relax. you must
			trust me. i'll make you twenty years
			younger ...
						 
						sam
			huh!
						 
					   doctor
				(giving sam a dirty look)
			... twenty-five if we just drain the
			excess fluid from the pouches ...
	
					   mother
			dr jaffe, you're a genius. would you
			like to be surgeon general? four
			star. i know everybody.
						 
					   doctor
			well they won't know you when i've
			finished with you.
			
	the doctor reaches into his smock pocket for a coloured
	marker. he starts colouring up her face with strokes of
	different coloured markers.
	
					   doctor
			first we must eliminate the excess
			derma ... so! ... then the flaccid
			tissues under the eyes ... and now
			the forehead ... zip! i lift the
			wrinkles and worry lines right up
			into the wi- into the hairline, comme
			ca ...
	
	sam looks disgusted.
	
					   doctor
			and now the template ... there ...
			there ... there ... now a bit of
			sticky ... there we go!
				(triumphantly)
			already she is twice as beautiful as
			she was before - voila!
	
	the doctor moves his body aside, revealing mrs lowry's
	face, covered with coloured lines and wrapped in
	cellophane held in shape by cellotape. sam stares at her.
	
						sam
			my god, it works.
