126 int.   mr helpmann's office			night		126
	
	sam steps out of lift into an ante-room. no-one is there.
	tentatively he knocks on the connecting door into the
	office. no reply. he slowly opens door.
	
	
						sam
			mr helpmann? are you there? hello?
	
	the office is empty. sam looks around - not sure what he
	wants to do. he notices his mother's picture on helpmann's
	desk. he is just about to leave when his eye is caught by
	an elaborate computer console in a side room. it
	occasionally chatters away. paper print-outs fill a large
	bin. hesitantly sam approaches it. looking around to make
	sure the room is still empty he punches the on key and the
	machine lights up.
	
	he cautiously pushes a couple more keys. the teleprinter
	machines have paused but one starts chattering now. he
	looks at the one which is busy. a close up shows us the
	message coming through: total - total -total - car 15
	request feedback status on subject benjamin george
	trollope - vagrant - detained terrorist/suspect/associate.
	this is followed by a code number. the teleprinter falls
	silent.
	
	sam returns to the keyboard and switches it off. he turns
	to leave.
	the teleprinter starts chattering again. sam stops and
	goes back to it and looks at the page again. a close up
	shows us: update - subject trollope deceased - cause of
	death gunshot resisting arrest. please delete from special
	category. the computer spool revolves back and forth for
	two or three seconds and then stops. sam ponders this for
	a moment and then heads back to the keyboard and swtiches
	on the machine. he has he answer.
