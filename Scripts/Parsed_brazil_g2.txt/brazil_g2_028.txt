37  ext.   buttle flats				  day		   37
	
	beautiful utopian block of high-rise flats gleam in the
	sunlight. pulling back we reveal it to be an architect's
	model in a protective perspex case standing in the centre
	of a decorative fountain that has long ceased to work -
	graffiti and junk are now the only decorations. in the
	background is the grim reality of the massive housing
	tower. sam's messerschmidt is just puling up in the shadow
	of the building which is grey, decrepid, vandalised. huge
	conduits, pipes, and tubing frame the scene. sam gets out
	of the car under the cool and none-too-friendly gaze of a
	few locals. self-consciously, sam looks around him, then
	at the paper in his hand. a little group of kids sit
	pitching pennies against a wall. sam goes over to them.
	
						sam
				(super polite)
			excuse me. can you tell me ...
	
	but before he can finish, the smallest, tiny kid looks up.
	
						kid
			eff off.
	
	sam, uncomfortably, effs off.
	
	he is watched, at some distance, imapassively by the
	little girl butttle. as sam enters the buildings one of
	the kids gets out a can of something and approaches the
	car. another is fiddling, with a box of matches.
