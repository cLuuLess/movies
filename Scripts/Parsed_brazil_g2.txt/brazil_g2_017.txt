26  int.   mr kurtzman's office			day		   26
	
	sam is busily working at the console, unraveling a problem
	while kurtzman looks on anxiously and ineffectually.
	
					  kurtzman
			perhaps the machine's on the blink!
			it keeps picking up old films. that
			can't he right, can it?
	
						sam
			it's not the machine. there's a
			mismatch on the personnel code
			numbers... ah there we go! that's a
			b58/732 when it should be a t47/215
			... tuttle ... he should have Â£31.06,
			debited against his account for
			electrical procedures, not buttle.
	
					  kurtzman
			oh my god, a mistake!
	
						sam
			it's not our mistake!
	
					  kurtzman
				(eagerly)
			isn't it? whose is it?
	
						sam
			information retrieval.
	
					  kurtzman
			oh, good!
	
						sam
			expediting has put in for electrical
			procedures in respect of buttle,
			archibald, shoe repair operative, but
			security has invoiced admin for
			tuttle, archibald, heating engineer
	
	sam is still punching keys.
	
					  kurtzman
			what a relief! i don't know what i'd
			do if you ever got promoted.
	
						sam
			don't worry.
	
					  kurtzman
			but if they did promote you
	
						sam
			i've told you before. i'd turn it
			down.
	
					  kurtzman
			would you really, sam?
	
						sam
			really.
	
					  kurtzman
				(churned up)
			you've been promoted.
	
	kurtzman hands sam a sheet of printed paper. sam takes the
	paper, not pleased, and glances at it.
	
	close up of paper: "lowry, s. (records. min of inf.)
	transfer to information retrieval - (expediting, security
	level 3).
	
					  kurtzman
			it's your mother isn't it? pulling
			strings again.
	
						sam
				(explodes)
			what a bitch!
