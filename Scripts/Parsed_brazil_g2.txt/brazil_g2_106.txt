	sam's face is reflected in the puddle of oil. he is
	staring wide-eyed. a church bell tolls in the distance.
	sam is definitely spooked. he scrambles to his feet. he's
	got to get out of here. he heads off down the passageway
	but is brought quickly to a halt. there, in the shadows,
	is someone smoking a cigarette. he hesitates and reverses
	direction but, before he manages 2 paces a familiar voice
	comes from behind him.
	
						jill
			you're late.
	
	sam spins around. stepping out from the shadows is jill -
	cigarette in her mouth.
	
						sam
				(stunned)
			jill! what are you do ... i mean ...
			how did you ... are you alright?
	
						jill
			yes.
	
						sam
			what happened to you after ...
	
						jill
			your face ... are you hurt?
	
						sam
			no. no. i'm fine. i was worried sick
			about you ... i thought ...
	
	a patrol car approaches. quickly sam grabs jill and goes
	into a kiss to explain their presence. the car hesitates
	for a moment and drives on.
	
						jill
				(through kiss)
			they're gone.
	
						sam
				(through kiss)
			are you sure?
	
						jill
				(through kiss)
			yes.
	
	they resume passionate kiss. after a moment
	
						sam
				(urgently)
			c'mon, we've got to get you off the
			streets.
	
	they head off clutching one another.
