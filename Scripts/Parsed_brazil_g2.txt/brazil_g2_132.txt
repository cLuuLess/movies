145 ext.   maze-like dark passages		 night		145
	
	cut to sam, really dashing madly, tripping over things,
	hurting himself, getting up running.
	he is in a maze of machinery. every way he turns his path
	seems blocked by either troops or figures from his dreams.
	the walls of the maze become more simplified as he goes
	deeper into it. more rectangular, higher. we see a top
	shot of the maze with sam separate from the pursuing
	forces but they are closing in on him from all sides. the
	maze extends as far as we can see. sam turns left and
	right through it, always there is a chance of turnings.
	until ... he rounds a corner and for the first time there
	is nowhere to go. the maze leads straight ahead to a dead
	end.
	at the end of the maze is a great pile of detritus from
	the consumer society. televisions, washing machines, hair
	dryers, junk. sam can do nothing but try to dig through
	this pile.
	
	
	maybe he can defend himself with something here. he
	scrabbles away. looking back he sees the massed agents,
	troops, forces of darkness heading toward him. no escape.
	he digs, harder, faster. junk flies everywhere. he
	actually reaches the end wall. back to it, he turns to
	face the foe. but as he moves against the wall his hand
	touches something. a door knob. he turns. it's a door. the
	knob turns easily. the door swings open. sam dives through
	it.
