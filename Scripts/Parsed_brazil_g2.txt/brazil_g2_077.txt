87  ext.   power plant		  day (late afternoon)	 87
	
	the power plant is an extensive, brutal, dante's inferno
	of a landscape made mainly of steel ... towers, chimneys,
	huge pipes, buildings which look like bomb shelters ... it
	is still daylight but the whole scene is murky and
	forbidding because of the swirling steam and smoke. in the
	murk can be seen sinister-looking figures in protective
	clothing and hard hats.
	
	this is the world which is now entered by jill's lorry ...
	the lorry halts at a despatching hut near the crane and
	jill jumps down from the cab. sam stays inside, looking
	around. something catches his eye.
	
	cut to facade of house. window boxes with flowers and
	shrubbery surrounded by a white picket fence provide
	domestic charm, however, in the doorway stands a man with
	protective clothing and something like a gas-mask over his
	face. he is waving to someone. slowly the house rises out
	of frame.
	
	in a wider shot we can see the house is suspended from and
	a giant crane that swings it through the air - air filled
	with stead, smoke, evil-smelling fumes. it is lowered onto
	the back of a lorry and we can see that the house is one
	of many prefabricated houses used in the construction of
	the power plant.
