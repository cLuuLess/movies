	cut to sam struggling with the forces of darkness. he is
	overwhelmed by the black hordes. they fill the screen. sam
	disappears under their onslaught. a pause. then sam is
	raised, spread-eagled, above the black sea of the forces.
	strong hands hold him. the maniacal laughter starts up.
	sam is turned in its direction.
	
	cut to a shot over the top of the mass of robed figures.
	rising from the ruins of the stone columns, the black
	cloth thing flaps menacingly towards camera. we can see
	the towering filing cabinet skyscrapers of the storeroom
	of knowledge in the background.
	
	sam looks terrified. as the thing hovers above sam in all
	its huge twisting awfulness, it slowly begine to unfold
	like some deadly flower blooming in stop motion.
	
	sam freezes as the interior becomes invisible. there in
	the billowing blackness is the girl. she is beckoning.
	
						girl
			sam.
	
	but the voice is no longer the mysterious feminine voice
	of before - it is the voice of the maniacal laughter.
	
	sam struggles with the restraining hands. he twists and
	turns, but to no avail. from the darkness above him
	descends the jolly gent looking just like mr helpmann) on
	his window washer's platform. however he is now dressed as
	father christmas.
	
						gent
			sam, what are we going to do with
			you?
	
						girl
			ha ha ha ha ha.
