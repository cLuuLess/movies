	slightly unnerved, sam gets in the lift, pushes the button
	for his floor - the 30th - and immediately begins perusing
	jill's dossier. the lift descends. but unnoticed by sam
	continued past his floor without stopping. it stops at the
	lobby mezzanine. sam looks up and realizes he is on the
	wrong floor. angrily he pushes the correct floor number
	but before the doors close he hears an angry woman's voice
	echoing through the massive lobby. he looks in the
	direction of the porters desk. there stands jill arguing
	with the porter.
	
						jill
			but you've stamped this form before!
			why won't you stamp it now?
	
					   porter
			you've just said yourself, miss,
			we've already stamped it. why should
			we stamp it twice?
	
	sam is frozen. he can't believe what he sees. the lift
	doors close. sam is too slow to stop them. madly he pushes
	the buttons - to no effect. the lift descends. (at this
	point we had better describe the lift. it is a cross
	between the old metal grille lifts with accordion grille
	doors and the super-sleek modern lifts that rise and fall
	in glass tubes so that one can have panoramic views of
	dramatic architectural spaces such as the lobbies of the
	ministry.)
	
	sam can see jill and if jill were to look up she could see
	sam descending. he is shouting and rattling the bars of
	the lift cage but no sound escapes to catch her attention.
	sam sinks below the floor of the lobby desperately trying
	to stop the demon lift. from his pov we see jill
	disappearing from view still arguing with the porter.
