34  int.   kurtzman's office			  day		   34
	
	kurtzman is pacing anxiously. sam walks into the office.
	during the brief opening and closing of the door we just
	manage to hear the piano player in "casablanca" singing,
	"... a kiss is just a kiss ...". kurtzman is too worried
	to notice. he is holding a piece of paper gingerly as if
	it were contagious. he waves it frantically as sam enters.
	
					  kurtzman
				(hysterically)
			thank god you're here! we're in
			terrible trouble! look at this! look
			at this!
	
	he thrusts the piece of paper at sam.
	
						sam
				(taking the paper)
			a cheque.
	
					  kurtzman
			the refund for tuttle!
	
						sam
				(startled)
			tuttle?
	
					  kurtzman
			i mean, buttle! it's been confusion
			from the word go! he's been wrongly
			charged for electromemorytherapy and
			someone somewhere is trying to make
			us carry the can!
	
						sam
			i've never seen a ministry cheque
			before.
	
					  kurtzman
			we've got to get rid of it! there's
			been a balls-up somewhere, and when
			the music stops they'll jump on
			whoever's holding the cheque!
	
						sam
			send it to somebody else. send it to
			buttle. it's his cheque.
	
					  kurtzman
			i've tried that! population census
			have got him down as dormanted, the
			central collective storehouse
			computer has got him down as deleted,
			and the information retrieval have
			got him down as inoperative ...
			security has him down as excised.,
			admin have him down as completed
	
						sam
			hang on.
	
	sam sits down at the console and punches keys. he does
	this very efficiently, muttering to himself and generally
	demonstrating an expertise which obviously leaves kurtzman
	way out of his depth, until -
	
						sam
			he is dead.
	
					  kurtzman
			dead! oh no! that's terrible! we'll
			never get rid of the damned thing!
			what are we going to do?
	
						sam
			try next of kin.
	
					  kurtzman
				(a revelation)
			next of kin!
	
	sam punches more keys.
	
						sam
			there we go. mrs. veronica buttle.
			what's the number on the cheque?
	
					  kurtzman
				(reading it)
			27156789/074328/k.
	
	sam has been efficiently punching this in.
	
						sam
			into memory. now ... central banking
			... buttle, veronica ... deposit
	
	sam rips off a print out, rapidly stuffs it and the cheque
	into a cannister and then into a vacuum tube. a job well
	done.
	
					  kurtzman
				(fervently)
			please don't come back! please don't
			come back!
	
	unfortunately kurtzman's prayers are not answered and the.
	vacuum tube returns almost immediately. sam opens it up.
	from the computer screen comes a voice "play it again,
	sam" - sam and kurtzman look at the screen. we get a quick
	glimpse of humphrey bogart before the screen reverts to
	numbers.
	
						sam
			problem. she doesn't have a bank
			account.
	
					  kurtzman
				(hysterically)
			well, that's it! i may as well go and
			hang myself! this sort of thing
			couldn't have happened before the
			stupid seventh tier reorganization!
			that was simmons doing! and he and
			jeffries always sit together at
			lunch! the bastards!
				(he thumps his hand hard on
				the desk top)
			ow!
				(he picks up the offending
				cheque)
			perhaps we can lose it ... behind the
			filing cabinet ... or destroy it ...
			burn it ... eat it ...
	
	under this tirade sam has begun to hum "brazil" - not
	entirely sure what inspired him.
	
						sam
			you'd never get away with it.
			besides, you can't do that to
			somebody's refund. it's christmas.
			there is one more option.
	
					  kurtzman
				(depressed. not really
				believing it)
			what?
	
						sam
			drive out to mrs buttle, give her the
			cheque, tell her to sign her name on
			the back, cash it at the corner sweet
			shop.
	
	kurtzman is dumbfounded by the audacity of this.
	
					  kurtzman
			that's brilliant!
	
	sam takes over. in no time at all he has battered away at
	the keyboard, slammed a cannister into a vacuum tube and
	received almost immediately a cannister containing a sheaf
	of different coloured papers.
	
						sam
			i'll do it for you. authorise the
			cheque. what's the address?
	
	kurtzman scribbles it down for him.
	
					  kurtzman
			here. what do i do next?
	
						sam
			call the motor pool and authorise
			personal transport.
	
					  kurtzman
			of course, of course. leave it to me.
			how do i authorize a cheque?
	
						sam
				(separating the and blue
				sheets)
			here we are. pink and blue receipts.
			all you've got to do is sign these
			and the back of the cheque.
	
	kurtzman takes out his pen and tries to sign the papers
	but his hand is giving him trouble.
	

					  kurtzman
				(exhausted after all the
				emotion)
			oh god! i think i've broken a bone.
			what a pathetic thing i am.

						sam
			(taking the pen from him)
			here.

	sam signs the cheque and receipts. a big close up shows
	that he is scribbling kurtzman's signature. sam pockets
	the papers and the pen.

						sam
			that's it.

					  kurtzman
			you are good to me sam.

						sam
				(leaving)
			don't mention it. see you later.
