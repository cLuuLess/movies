	the camera skims along over an icy sea. this is sam's pov
	as he wings his way over the water with his new gleaming
	wings. in the distance rises a strange massive ship.
	
	as he gets closer we can see that the snip is listing
	heavily to one side. in fact it is barely afloat. closer
	still, it becomes apparent that the ship is made of stone.
	dark, evil, grey blocks of granite form not only the hull,
	but the super-structures and smokestacks. it looks like a
	massive medieval fortress gone to sea. the screen is
	engulfed in stone. the camera heads up the side of the
	ship. higher and higher we climb - past course after
	course of mammoth stones. reaching the first deck, we
	continue upwards. there appears to be no entrance. sam is
	looking frustrated and angry. but then he spots an
	opening. a few stones have come loose - one of them juts
	out forming a ledge. as the cage passes, sam jumps and
	managed to gain a foothold on the outcropping. squeezing
	thru the gap in the rocks, he makes his way thru a dark
	passage. emerging from the opening he finds himself
	teetering over an enormous abyss formed by the outer hull
	and the inner stone core of the ship. great stone ribs
	curve downwards thru the darkness broken only by narrow
	shafts of brilliant light streaming from occasional cracks
	and fissures in the stone core. for a brief moment sam
	gets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of the openings but
	his attention is distracted by a distant moan. huddled far
	below him at the bottom of the dark abyss are hundreds of
	grey shrouded prisoners. their moan blends with the creaks
	and groans of the stones as the ship slowly wallows back
	and forth. suddenly a great boom resounds throughout the
	ship. sam is unsure where it comes from. and then another
	boom reverberates about him. he has to steady himself as
	the ship quivers from the noise. another book. he clutches
	at the wall.
