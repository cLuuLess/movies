59  int. information retrieval lobby		day		   59
	
	cut to wide shot of massive imposing lobby - much like the
	records lobby - but this one is very austere. no crowds.
	no statues. no decoration. not even the ever-present
	security checks. impressive. and a bit unnerving. framed
	in the doorway is a lone tiny figure. cut to close up.
	it's sam. he hesitates and then enters. cut to video
	screen. the video camera follows sam across the lobby -
	til he stops in tight profile at reception desk. we tilt
	up revealing sam standing facing us just beyond the
	monitor which is on the desk.
	
						sam
				(diffidently to the porter)
			my name is sam lowry. i have to
			report to mr warren.
	
					   porter
				(looking down his nose at
				sam's unsleek clerk's suit
				and then handing him an
				i.d. badge)
			thirtieth floor, sir. you're
			expected.
	
						sam
			er, don't you want to search me?
	
					   porter
			no, sir.
	
						sam
				(taken aback. reaching into
				his pocket)
			my i.d. cards.
	
					   porter
			no need, sir
	
						sam
				(nonplussed)
			but i could be anybody.
	
					   porter
			no you couldn't, sir. this is
			information retrieval.
				(indicating to the right)
			the lift's arrived, sir.
