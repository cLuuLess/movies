32  int.   sam's flat					night		 32
	
	sam is grabbing the walls of the fridge. water from the
	defrosted freezer compartment drips on his head. he wakes
	up. before he can really take in where he is the phone
	rings. he staggers over to it.
	
						sam
			hello ... hello ...
	
					 phone voice
			hello. mr lowry?
	
						sam
			who's that?
				(pause)
	
	a sound at the kitchen door turns sam's head - and ours -
	just in time to half see a quick blurred movement, but
	then a rapid voice in his ear-piece brings his head back.
	
					 phone voice
			put the phone down and your hands up.
	
						sam
				(into the phone)
			what? who is this?
	
	sam realises that the voice is also in the room behind
	him. he turns round and sees tuttle. tuttle is middle-
	aged, a short tough figure dressed in dark clothes
	suggesting a cross between a cat burglar and a night-raid
	commando. in one hand he holds a gun pointed at sam. the
	other hand is holding a telephone receiver which tuttle is
	in the act of placing in the large capacious bag at his
	feet. sam puts down his phone, and his hands up.
	
					   tuttle
			nice and easy now. keep your hands
			where i can see them.
	
						sam
			what is this?
				(indignantly)
			who the hell are you?
	
	tuttle, keeping the gun on sam, goes to different doors,
	leaning backwards into bedroom, bathroom and closet.
	
	tuttle suddenly relaxes and pockets his gun.
	
					   tuttle
			harry tuttle. heating engineer. at
			your service.
	
						sam
			tuttle! are you from central
			services?
	
					   tuttle
			ha!!
	
						sam
			but ... i called central services.
	
					   tuttle
			they're a bit overworked these days.
			luckily i intercepted your call.
	
						sam
			what?
	
	by now, both are pouring with sweat.
	tuttle heads across the room and swiftly begins to undo a
	wall panel.
	
						sam
			wait a minute, what was that business
			with the gun?
	
	tuttle hands sam the panel and plunges his arm into the
	space behind it.
	
					   tuttle
			a little precaution, sir. i've had
			traps set for me before now. there
			are people in central services who'd
			love to get their hands on harry
			tuttle.
	
						sam
			are you saying this is illegal?
	
	by now tuttle has managed to pull out some sections of
	flexible ducting from the welter of mechanical offal
	behind the removed panel. it is all very complicated and
	greasy and it looks as though there is a lot more where
	that came from. tuttle is amazingly neat and deft as he
	works. a real pro. as he works he hums a wee tune ... yes
	... brazil!!
	
					   tuttle
			well, yes ... and no. officially,
			only central service operatives are
			supposed to touch this stuff ...
			could you hold these.
	
					   tuttle
				(he hands sam a bunch of
				wires that he has detached)
			... but, with all the new rules and
			regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon
			... they can't get decent staff any
			more ... so ... they tend to turn a
			blind eye ... as long as i'm careful.
				(he hands sam a torch)
			... mind you, if ever they could
			prove i'd been working on their
			equipment ... well, that's a
			different matter ... up a bit with
			the torch, sir.
	
						sam
			sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to
			work for central services?
	
					   tuttle
			couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're
			getting warm -
	
						sam
			the pace?
	
					   tuttle
			the paperwork, couldn't stand the
			paperwork.
				(indicating the torch)
			over to the left please, if you don't
			mind sir. hold it there. yes, there's
			more bits of paper in central
			services than bits of pipe - read
			this, fill in that, hand in the other
			- listen, this old system of yours
			could be on fire and i couldn't even
			turn on the kitchen tap without
			filling in a 27b/6.... bloody
			paperwork.
	
						sam
				(mildly)
			well i suppose one has to expect a
			certain amount
	
					   tuttle
			why? i came into this game for
			adventure - go anywhere, travel
			light, get in, get out, wherever
			there's trouble, a man alone. now
			they've got the whole country
			sectioned of and you can't move
			without a form. i'm the last of a
			breed. ah ha! found it!
				(he holds up a small
				charred gadget)
			there's your problem.
	
						sam
			can you fix it?
	
					   tuttle
			no. but i can bypass it with one of
			these
	
	he pulls another gadget from his bag.
	
						sam
			fine.
	
	the door bell. tuttle grabs for his gun.
	
					   tuttle
			are you expecting anyone?
	
						sam
			no. wait here.
	
	he goes out closing the immediate door and goes to the
	front door which he opens. he is confronted by two
	officious little men in boiler suits who are standing
	outside his door. their names are spoor and dowser. dowser
	is spoor's echo.
	
						sam
			yes?
	
						spoor
			central services.
	
					   dowser
			...ervices.
	
						sam
			uh - what? - i ...
	
						spoor
			you telephone, sir.
	
					   dowser
			...elephoned sir.
	
						spoor
			trouble with your air-conditioning.
	
					   dowser
			...ditioning.
	
						sam
				(gulps)
			no, not at all. i mean, it's all
			right. it's fixed.
	
						spoor
			fixed?
	
					   dowser
			fixed?
	
	they don't like that.
	
						sam
			i mean it fixed itself.
	
						spoor
			fixed itself.
	
					   dowser
			...ixed itself.
	
						spoor
			machines don't fix themselves.
	
					   dowser
			... fix themselves.
	
						spoor
			he's tampered with it, dowser.
	
					   dowser
			...ampered. with it, spoor.
	
						sam
			look, i'm sorry about your wasted
			journey
	
	sam tries to close the door but spoor prevents this.
	
						spoor
				(to dowser)
			i think we'd better have a look.
	
					   dowser
			... have a look.
	
						sam
			no you can't.
	
	he is pushed aside. spoor followed by dowser, heads for
	the door behind which is mr tuttle. sam is paralysed.
	spoor approaches the door as if it is dangerous. he turns
	the handle quietly and gives the door a little nudge. the
	door begins to swing slowly open. sam suddenly finds
	inspiration.
	
						sam
			just a minute!
	
	spoor and dowser turn round as the door continues to swing
	open. when the door is open, behind their backs tuttle is
	seen holding his pistol in a two-handed grip, his knees
	slightly bent. tuttle freezes like that, pointing his
	pistol through the open door.

						sam
			have you got a 27b/6?
	
	dowser looks very angry. veins stand out on his forehead
	and he goes into what looks like some sort of fit. spoor
	knocks him to the ground.
	
						spoor
				(to sam)
			now look what you've done to him.
	
						sam
			have you got one or haven't you?
	
						spoor
			not ... as such ...
	
	dowser moans and begins to get back on his feet.
	
						spoor
			but we can get one.
	
						spoor
				(worried about dowser)
			it's all right, terry, it's all
			right, everything's all right.
	
						sam
				(ushering them to the door)
			i'm sorry, but i'm a bit of a
			stickler for paper work. where would
			we be if we didn't follow the correct
			procedures?
	
						spoor
			we'll be back.
	
					   dowser
			...be back.
	
						sam
				(closing the door on them)
			thank you.
	
	sam turns back to tuttle who is coming forward pocketing
	his gun.
	
					   tuttle
			thanks, lowry, you're a good man in a
			tight corner.

	tuttle returns to work, fitting in the new by-pass gadget
	and tightening the nuts, and happily humming "brazil".
	
						sam
			listen .. um ... i don't want to get
			involved in any of this. but i work
			at the ministry of information, and i
			happen to know that information
			retrieval have been looking for an
			archibald tuttle, heating engineer.
			you wouldn't by any chance be -
	
					   tuttle
				(pleased)
			my friends call me harry. information
			retrieval, eh? interesting!
	
						sam
			what do they want you or?
	
					   tuttle
			time to go.
	
	tuttle finishes the job and throws his tools into the bag.
	
						sam
			thank you very much. how much will
			it...?
	
					   tuttle
			on the house. you did me a favor.
			check the corridor.
	
	sam goes to the front door, opens it and looks out.
	
						sam
			all clear.
	
	tuttle slips out and heads off down the balcony corridor.
	
						sam
			hey that's a dead end.
	
	but tuttle merely undoes a pre-arranged rope and swings
	tarzan-like off the end of the balcony and across a multi-
	story void to a neighboring block. sam is amazed - not to
	say - stunned.
