132 int.   cell						day/night	132
	
	the filing cabinets of the storeroom of knowledge dissolve
	squares of padding that form the walls of a cell. the
	laughter echoes round the cell. sam sees that mr helpmann,
	in his wheelchair is watching him. he is dressed as father
	christmas. they are alone in the cell. sam scrunches up
	into the corner.
	
					  helpmann
			sam, what are we going to do with
			you? can you hear me, sam?
	
						sam
				(in a hoarse urgent
				whisper)
			where's jill? what have you done to
			her? where is she?!
	
					  helpmann
			gillian layton?
	
						sam
			yes, you've got to get me out of
			here. i've got to find her.
	
					  helpmann
			i understand, sam, i know exactly how
			you feel. so i brought you a bottle
			of barley water.
			
	helpmann holds up a bottle of barley water.
	
						sam
				(desperately)
			help me!
	
					  helpmann
			i assure you, sam, i'm doing
			everything within my power. but the
			rules of the game are laid down, and
			we all have to play by them - even
			me.
	
						sam
			this is all a mistake! don't you
			understand?!
	
					  helpmann
			yes, well, from the department's
			point of view you're certainly a bit
			of an own goal, but ...
	
						sam
			i'm not a terrorist! you must know
			that! i'm not guilty! get me out of
			here!
	
					  helpmann
			sam, if you've been going out there
			and playing a straight bat, all the
			way down the line, you've got
			absolutely nothing to worry about.
	
						sam
			please, i've got to find jill.
	
					  helpmann
			sam, i think i ought to tell you ...
			i'm afraid she's upped stumps and
			retired to the pavilion.
	
				   sam looks blank.
	
			thrown in the towel.
	
						sam
				(takes a moment to work
				this out)
			dead?
	
	helpmann nods.
	
					  helpmann
			yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it
			seems she was killed resisting
			arrest.
	
						sam
				(relieved)
			no, no ... i did that...
	
	helpmann looks surprised. sam shuts up.
	
					  helpmann
			the odd thing is it appears to have
			happened twice ... a bit of a
			disputed call, i'm afraid.
	
	sam has gone catatonic.
	
					  helpmann
				(starting to go)
			so, there you are. all i can say is,
			don't fall at the last fence. the
			finishing post's in sight. see you in
			the paddock. good luck. keep your eye
			on the ball. got to go .... can't
			keep the orphans waiting.
	
	helpmann goes. a guard helps him out and then returns with
	another to help put the restraining bag over sam.
	
						guard
			don't fight it, son .... confess
			quickly ... before they get into the
			expensive procedures. if you hold out
			too long you could jeopardise your
			credit rating.
	
	the bag blacks everything out.
