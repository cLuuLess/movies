	sam comes running around corner. he is suddenly bathed in
	a strange blue light. he halts and looks up. there
	opposite him is a large blue neon cross above the entrance
	to a chapel of dully modernistic design. holy music from
	an electric organ can be heard. sam rushes up the stops
	and through the door.
