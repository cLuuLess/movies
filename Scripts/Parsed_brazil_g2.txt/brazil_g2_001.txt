	a beautiful golden sun is setting. the sky is on fire. the
	camera starts to move downwards. a large neon sign rises
	into shot. it rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the
	frame. the building is neither past nor future in design
	but a bit of both.
	
	slowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads
	below ... a glittering conglomeration of elevated
	transport tubes, smaller square buildings which are merely
	huge, with, here and there, the comparatively minuscule
	relics of previous ages of architecture, pavement level
	awnings suggesting restaurants and shops ... transparent
	tubes carry whizzing transport cages past us ... an
	elevated highway carrying traffic composed primarily of
	large transport lorries passes thru frame. as we descend,
	the sunlight is blocked out and street lights & neon signs
	take over as illumination. eventually we reach the upper
	levels of a plush shopping precinct.
