24  int.   sam's bedroom				 morning		24

	tight shot of telephone. the ringing continues. a hand
	grapples with the receiver. sam is in bed in a darkened
	room. sleepily he drags receiver to his ear.

						sam
			hello ... what ... what? oh ... mr
			kurtzman! ... you're up late. oh, is
			it?

	there is an electronic box of tricks by his bed,
	incorporating an alarm. sam thumps it. the alarm goes off.
	this sets of a series of other things ... the window
	shutters roll up letting in the morning light. both taps
	turn on in the bathroom ...

						sam
				(into phone)
			the electronics here are up the
			spout. yours too, sir? don't worry
			sir - i'll be there.

	sam puts down the phone and gets into his suit which is
	moving towards him. noticing one of his film posters is
	loose he pushes the pin in firmly.
	
	in the kitchen a coffee maker starts up. in the sitting
	room the television switches on. back in the bedroom a
	cupboard door springs open and a rack slides out with
	sam's clothes neatly hanging - ready to be put on. sam
	comes out of the bathroom, having turned off the bath
	taps, and starts to get dressed. in the kitchen the coffee-
	maker has finished making s small pot of coffee. sam pours
	a quick cup and is gone at the door. throughout all this
	we have had a chance to get a glimpse of sam's flat. it is
	functional, soulless and, though neat, has not been
	assembled with a loving hand. most of the furnishings are
	built in. the walls are divided into two-foot square metal
	panels painted a non-committal colour. certain of the wall
	panels have central services logos on them with the
	admonition "do not obstruct or remove" below. sam has
	livened his bedroom up with large and colorful film
	posters. the sitting room sports several framed pictures
	of wide beautiful vistas.
