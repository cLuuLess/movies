107 ext.   domestic street				dusk		107
	
	a security vehicle in full banshee howl roars through the
	streets. we roar along with it as it rounds a corner and
	skids to a halt at a safe but striking distance from
	jill's lorry. heavily armed security police pour out and
	take up firing positions behind parked cars or whatever
	other cover is available. searchlights are played on the
	lorry. the officer in charge appears with a loud-hailer.
	
				   officer in charge
			come out, we know you're in there!
			you cannot possibly escape. throw
			your weapons from your vehicle and
			come out slowly with your hands on
			your heads. obey my instructions and
			no harm will come to you. but if you
			force us to shoot we'll shoot to
			kill.
	
	during the above speech a small boy on a tricycle "roars"
	around a corner behind the security police. he rides into
	a gap between them, rolls his tricycle over and "takes
	cover" behind it. he points his toy rifle at jill's lorry
	and takes shot. in reaction to the noise made by the kid's
	rifle the officer in charge dives for cover and the
	security troops open fire and pepper jill's lorry cab with
	holes. a few of the security troops then rush forward and
	fling open the cab door. the cab is empty. the officer in
	charge gets to his feet and looks about. his uniform is
	covered with dust, oil and shit from the street. he just
	misses seeing the back of the boy as he disappears round
	the corner on his tricycle.
