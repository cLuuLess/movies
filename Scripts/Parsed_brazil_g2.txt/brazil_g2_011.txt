20  int.   jill's flat				   night		 20
	
					   charlie
				(starting back from the
				hole with bill and jill)
			eh! eh! eh! we're department of
			works! department of works up here!
			careful with those bloody things!
	
	jill, charlie and bill are hustled aside by a security man
	who clears the fireman's pole from the hole. we can see
	the troops in the room below leaving. a second security
	man has untied a rope hanging out of the open window. he
	coils the rope up neatly and the two security men leave
	the flat.
	
						bill
				(to jill as they watch this
				highly efficient operation)
			don't take any notice, love, it's
			their training makes them like
			animals. best in the world, though.
	
						jill
			who are you?
	
					   charlie
			don't you worry love, we'll have
			everything shipshape in a jiffy.
	
						bill
			that's it. nothing to worry about.
	
					   charlie
			it's buttle downstairs who can worry,
			eh?
	
						jill
			there must be some mistake ... mr
			buttle's harmless...
	
						bill
			we don't make mistakes.
	
	so saying, he drops the manhole cover, which is faced with
	same material as the floor, over the hole in the floor. to
	his surprise it drops neatly through the floor into the
	flat below.
					   charlie
			bloody typical, they've gone back to
			metric without telling us
			

20a int.   buttles' flat				 night		20a
	
	mrs buttle stands stunned in the middle of her decimated
	flat. the kids wail. slowly mrs buttle collapses -
	slumping to the floor with the receipt in her hand: we
	tighten into close up of "receipt".

				   jill (off camera)
			mrs buttle? mrs buttle?
