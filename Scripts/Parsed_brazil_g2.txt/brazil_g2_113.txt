125 int.   basement					 night		125
	
	sam creeps along the corridor to the lift door - avoiding
	a group of security men who are singing carols in close
	harmony. one guard is conducting and giving instruction.
	they are all incredibly big and brutal looking.
	
					choir master
				(stopping them)
			no, no, no, arthur, you're going flat
			on that g. it's your breathing. take
			a breath on the end. of the previous
			line, after noel. right, one, two,
			three.
	
	the choir begins singing again. sam reaches the lift and
	looks at the small panel of letters set into the wall.
	close up of sam's face concentrating. he hears, we hear, a
	reprise of mr helpmann talking to sam in mother's
	bathroom.
	
					helpmann (v/o)
			of course, jeremiah was senior to me,
			but we were close friends, and i keep
			his name alive at the office every
			day. it's as though he's there
			speaking to me. "'ere i am, j.h."
	
	sam is already typing the letters ereiamjh into the
	keyboard. the lift judders and star s to ascend.
