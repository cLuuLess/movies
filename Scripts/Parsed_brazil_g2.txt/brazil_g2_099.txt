109 int.   black maria				   evening	  109
	
	the baggees hang from a track on the ceiling of the black
	maria. sam is lying on the floor, covered by his jacket,
	with his badge prominently displayed. he is dazed and
	mumbling ... the only baggee in the wagon apart from two
	guards who have removed their helmets and are relaxing
	while travelling back to base.
	
					   guard a
				(scratching his head)
			these helmets don't half make your
			scalp itch.
	
					   guard b
			ooh, don't mention it.
				(beginning to scratch his
				head)
			and they make you sweat. half the
			time i can't see where i'm going -
			there's a great niagara of
			perspiration coming down.
	
					   guard a
			i'm lucky, i've got thick eyebrows.
			that keeps it up and channels it out
			to my ears.
	
	sam stirs and groans
	
					   guard b
			who's he?
	
					   guard a
			someone from information retrieval
			they're always hanging about in
			lingerie.
	
	sam is coming to his senses. he takes in the situation,
	sees all the baggees and staggers to his knees.
	
						sam
			jill! jill! are you there?!
	
	he begins rummaging through the baggees. one of which is
	dressed as father christmas. sam opens the "face vent" of
	the baggee's' hoods. a pair of strange eyes look out.
	
					   guard a
			excuse me, sir - that's government
			property.
	
						sam
			is here a girl here? tall, fair hair,
			blue eyes?
	
					   guard a
			dunno sir. they check all that at the
			depot.
	
	sam continues fumbling about the baggees.
	
					   guard 3
				  (pulling sam back)
			we can't allow you to do that sir,
			it's more than our job's worth.
	
						sam
				(shaking guard off)
			i've got to find her! jill! jill!
	
					   guard a
			you can always fill in an application
			form, if you're a relative, sir.
			please stop, sir.
	
	sam takes no notice.
	
						sam
			jill! jill!
	
	guard a hits sam, knocking him out again.
	
					   guard a
			sorry about that sir. regulations.
			we'll have you safely back in your
			office in no time.
