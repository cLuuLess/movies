						sam
				(climbing in)
			well done, that's it ... let's go!
			vrmmm. vrmmm.
	
	sam looks up and down his side of the street anxiously
	before realizing that jill has switched off the engine and
	is sitting glaring at him. they are stopped, right in
	front of the ministry building.
	
						sam
				(frantic)
			what are you doing? for christ's
			sake! get moving!
	
						jill
			who are you?
	
	desperately sam pulls roller blind down over window.
	
						sam
				(hurriedly)
			sam lowry. hello. this sounds insane,
			i know, but i've been dreaming about
			you. even before i saw you you were
			in my dreams. weird isn't it. i mean
			... i don't know what it means ...
			but it might mean something ...
			mightn't it? i hope so. anyway you're
			in danger and i think we should get
			out of here, now, quick! come on!
	
	still jill does nothing. sam pulls down roller blind over.
	window.
	
						sam
				(desperate)
			bloody hell! do as i say!
	
						jill
				(hard, icy cool)
			no.
	
						sam
				(beginning to lose his
				bottle)
			please!
	
	jill continues to sit, glaring.
	
	sam delves into his pockets and drags out a handful of
	i.d. cards and papers, most of which fall onto the floor.
	he then remembers that the badge he's looking for is
	pinned to his jacket. he thrusts it forward at jill.
	
						sam
				(beside himself with panic)
			alright! alright! alright! i'm
			information retrieval officer -
				(he checks the number
				somewhere. on the badge?)
			dz/015, and i'm arresting you for -
			your own good! now start up and get
			moving before i hand you back to
			them!
				(indicating m.i. building)
	
						jill
			them?
	
						sam
			us. them. i don't know ... just get
			going.
	
	jill starts up and moves off, very cool, in her own time.
	by now sam has got the shakes.
	
						jill
				(indicting the papers that
				sam has dropped)
			don't litter my cab!
	
						sam
				(picking them up)
			oh, sorry.
