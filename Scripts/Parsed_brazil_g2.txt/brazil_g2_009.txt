18  int.   hallway and children's bedroom	night		 18

	girl buttle enters her bedroom. there is little or no
	light there, and she sees a bulky figure apparently
	lowering himself into the room from the direction of the
	ceiling.

				(unalarmed)
			you've come ...

	as she moves, the light from the hallway shows us the
	figure of what looks like a commando on a night raid,
	slowly sliding down a pole in he middle of the room. the
	pole at the top end disappears through a hole in the
	ceiling. things become immediately clearer
