72  int.   jack's office				 day		  72
	
	sam goes through the glass door and is about to push open
	the double doors in front of him. he is halted by a noise
	from the typist - she indicates that he is to go to the
	left. he does so and enters an office. an antique desk
	with a large collection of executive toys and other
	tastefully reassuring furniture fill the room which is a
	rather oddly shaped ... distorted as it by the curved wall
	of the much larger room that sam was stopped from
	entering. nevertheless the feel of the room is confidently
	successful. a buzzing noise draws sam's attention to the
	wash basin in the far corner. the information retrieval
	technician is standing by a sink massing his temples with
	old-fashioned scalp vibrators. his back to us.
	
						sam
			excuse me. are you officer 412/l?
	
	the technician makes no sign of having heard this. he
	continues vibrating his temples.
	
						sam
				(a bit louder)
			er, excuse me!
	
	getting no response sam walks over to the technician. as
	he passes the desk he notices a strange mask lying face
	down on the desk top. it seems strangely familiar - but as
	it is a negative concave image sam isn't sure. he
	continues over to the technician.
	
						sam
				(louder)
			excuse me.
	
	he touches the technician on the shoulder, who jumps with
	a start. he spins around and turns out to be none other
	than jack lint. he is amazed to see sam.
	
						sam
				(surprised)
			jack!!
	
						jack
				(recovering slightly)
			sam! what a surprise!
	
						sam
				(even more surprised)
			are you officer 412/l?
	
	jack looks confused. he pauses, and then removes ear
	plugs.
	
						jack
				(shaking sam's hand)
			sorry about that ... mr helpmann told
			me you were coming aboard -
			congratulations!
	
						sam
			thanks. are you officer 412/l?
	
						jack
			for my sins. are you settling in
			alright?
	
						sam
			yes, thanks.
	
						jack
			terrific. i'm really glad you dropped
			by. unfortunately, i don't have any
			time right now i've got a queue of
			customers to deal with - er, why
			don't we have a drink tonight?
	
						sam
				 (diffidently)
			ah ...
	
						jack
			what?
	
						sam
			i don't want to take up your time
			now, but i was hoping you could give
			me some information on somebody. it's
			a security level three matter and
			information retrieval records says to
			refer to you.
	
						jack
			ok. come back this afternoon, about
			four o'clock. if you give me the
			number of the case, i'll have the
			dossier here waiting.
				(he pulls card from his
				pocket - pushes it towards
				sam)
			my tailor,... well worth the
			investment.
	
						sam
				(taking print-out sheets
				from his pocket)
			i've got numbers all over these - i'm
			not sure which is the one you want.
	
						jack
				(looking at the print-out
				picture of jill over sam's
				shoulder)
			layton! oh shit!
	
						sam
			what is it?
	
						jack
			you clever bastard! i might have
			guessed. you only moved in today and
			you're already hot on the bloody
			trail.
	
						sam
	am i?
	
						jack
	please, sam, we're going to have to be open to each other
	on this one. if you make a reputation with this case,
	it'll be at my expense.
	
						sam
			how do you mean?
	
						jack
			how much do you know?
	
						sam
			not much.
	
						jack
			enough though, eh?
	
						sam
				(getting sucked into this
				exchange)
			not really, no.
	
	jack goes over to the sink and turns on the taps full
	blast, splashing the water noisily into the basin.
	
						jack
			ok. ok. let's not fence around ...
			this is the situation. some idiot
			somewhere in the building, some
			insect, confused two of our clients,
			b58/732 and t47/215.
	
						sam
			b58/732, that's a. buttle isn't it?
	
						jack
			christ! you do know it all!
	
						sam
			no, no, i don't. i'm just beginning
			honestly. sorry, carry on.
	
						jack
			well, your a. buttle has been
			confused with t47/215, an a. tuttle.
			i mean, it's a joke! somebody should
			be shot for that. so b58/732 was
			pulled in by mistake.
	
						sam
			you got the wrong man.
	
						jack
				(a little heated)
			i did not get the wrong man. i got
			the right man. the wrong man was
			delivered to me as the right man! i
			accepted him, on trust, as the right
			man. was i wrong? anyway, to add to
			the confusion, he died on us. which,
			had he been the right man, he
			wouldn't have done.
	
						sam
			you killed him?
	
						jack
				(annoyed)
			sam, there are very rigid parameters
			laid down to avoid that event but
			buttle's heart condition did not
			appear on tuttle's file. don't think
			i'm dismissing this business, sam.
			i've lost a week's sleep over it
			already.
						 
						sam
			i'm sure you have
	
						jack
			there are some real bastards in this
			department who don't mind breaking a
			few eggs to make an omelette, but
			thank god there are the new boys like
			me who want to maintain decent
			civilized standards of terrorist
			eradication. we've got the upper hand
			for the moment, but they're waiting
			for us to slip up, and a little slip-
			up like this is just the chance
			they're looking for.
	
						sam
			so how ...?
	
						jack
			what i've got to do now is pick up
			tuttle, interrogate him at the same
			voltage as buttle, to the same meter
			reading to the last penny, and juggle
			the books in electrical banking.
	
						sam
			what has tuttle done?
	
						jack
			we suspect him of freelance
			subversion.
	
						sam
				(dumbly)
			he's a freelance subversive?
	
						jack
			he's a compulsive heating engineer. a
			maverick ex-central service repair
			man with a grudge against society.
			now, fortunately, we're nearly out of
			the wood, i think. at least we will
			be when i get this layton woman under
			arrest.
	
	jack turns off taps and goes behind screen.
	
						sam
				(agitated)
			what's she done?
	
						jack
			you didn't know as much about this
			business as you pretended to, did
			you?
	
						sam
			er ... no.
	
						jack
			very smart.
	
						sam
			er ... but i would've found out
			anyway.
	
						jack
			yes. i'm impressed.
	
						sam
				(playing the game)
			tell me about layton.
	
						jack
			she witnessed the tuttle arrest - the
			buttle arrest - and since then she's
			been making wild allegations,
			obviously trying to exploit the
			situation - she's working for
			somebody, and she's not working for
			us.
	
						sam
			a terrorist?
	
	jack comes from behind the screen with a look confirming
	just what sam fears, and hands him a suit.
	
						sam
			ah ... thanks.
	
	sam begins to put the suit on.
	
						sam
				(hesitantly)
			but surely, i mean, perhaps she just
			happened to live above the buttles,
			and ...
	
						jack
				(picking up photograph of
				wife and kids from his
				desk)
			look after that suit, eh. barbara
			chose it for me.
	
						sam
			right. er, you're not going to keep
			calling her barbara, are you?
	
						jack
			barbara's a perfectly good name,
			isn't it?
	
						sam
				(preferring to let his
				drop)
			look, about the layton woman - maybe
			she's just trying to help the buttle
			family.
	
						jack
			why?
	
						sam
			why? hell, not for any reason ...
	
						jack
				{baffled)
			i don't follow you.
	
						sam
			out of kindness.
	
						jack
				(utterly baffled)
			kindness? what's the purpose behind
			this line of enquiry?
	
						sam
				(deciding to abandon this
				line of country)
			so what are you going to do about
			her?
	
						jack
			get her out of circulation - i've put
			her on the detention list.
	
						sam
				(thinking fast)
			you mean you're going to invite her
			in so that she can spill the beans
			inside the department?
	
						jack
				(taken aback)
			well, i ... good point. what do you
			suggest?
	
						sam
			let me try to get to her. i'll
			deactivate her.
	
						jack
			what does that mean? i don't want to
			be involved in anything unsavoury.
	
						sam
			trust me. you do trust me, don't you?
	
						jack
			of course. we went to school
			together. you're my oldest friend.
	
						sam
			and you're mine.
	
						jack
			you're the only person i can trust.
	
						sam
			then we'd better keep this business
			just between the two of us.
	
						jack
			right! just between as and the
			security forces.
	
						sam
			they weren't at school with us.
	
						jack
			but, i've already put her on the
			search and detain list.
	
						sam
			take her off the list.
	
						jack
			there's no procedure for that until
			she's been arrested.
	
						sam
			say it was a mistake.
	
						jack
			we don't make mistakes.
	
						sam
			well, i'd better get out there and
			try to get to her before security
			does. let me borrow her dossier for a
			while.
	
						jack
			er ... alright. for christ's sake
			don't lose it. here, you'd better
			sign for it.
	
	jack presents sam with something to sign. he then gives
	him the dossier.
	
						sam
			thanks, jack. i'll be in touch.
	
						jack
			do you know what you're doing.
	
						sam
				(about to say no, then
				pauses)
			trust me.
	
						jack
				(admiring sam's new look)
			sam ... we're proud to have you at
			information retrieval. merry xmas.
				(he hands sam another
				executive package)
