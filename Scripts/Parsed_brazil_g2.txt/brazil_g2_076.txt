	we pull back and lift off to see that the beautiful
	countryside through which we've been travelling is in fact
	a solid wall of giant bill-boards, advertising all sorts
	of wonders like pine scented lavatory paper, sea spray
	flavored cigarettes - you name it - these advertisements
	form an unbroken corridor down which the road travels.
	from a bird's eye pov we see that the land behind the
	hoardings is blasted and blighted with garbage etc.
