119 int.   sam's corridor				night		119
	
	the elysian fields train arrives clattering. sam and jill
	are the only passengers to emerge. they can't keep their
	hands off one another. this is young love at its freshest
	and most exciting. sam looks up and down the platform
	cautiously but there is no-one in sight as the train
	clatters off again into the darkness. sam and jill
	approach sam's front door. he puts a key in the door and
	tries to open the door but has some difficulty. something
	creaks. he gives the door a heavy shove and the door opens
	and a shower of white powdery ice falls on his head..
