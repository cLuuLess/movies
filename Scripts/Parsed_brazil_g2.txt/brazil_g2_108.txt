120 int.   sam's flat					night		120
	
	sam enters, followed by jill. his breath immediately
	starts come out of his mouth like clouds of steam. the
	flat looks as though it has been disembowelled and then
	deep frozen. icicles are hanging down from everywhere. the
	flat looks like a scrap dump. every wall has spilled out
	its disgusting steel and rubber entrails, filling most of
	the available space and making progress through the flat
	difficult. half a dozen men are at work. they are
	impossible to identify because they wear arctic clothing
	and look more like spacemen. their voices however belong
	to spoor and dowser.
	
						sam
			for god's sake, what's happened?
	
						spoor
			thermostat's gone. and then some.
	
					   dowser
			... and then some.
	
						sam
			what have you done to my flat?
	
						spoor
			sign here, please.
	
					   dowser
			... ere please.
	
	spoor offers a clipboard and pencil. he bangs the
	clipboard against the furniture to knock the ice off it.
	
						sam
			what is it?
	
						spoor
			it's a 27b/6 of course.
	
					   dowser
			...b/6 of course.
	
						jill
				(to dowser)
			do you repeat everying?
	
					   dowser
				(nods)
			... everything.
	
						spoor
				(indicating the mess)
			this is what you get when you have
			cowboys round yer ducts.
	
					   dowser
			... yer ducts.
	
						spoor
			i think you've got your t41 crystal
			inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin-
			threaded-solenoid-control. it's
			either that or a new washer.
	
					   dowser
			... new washer.
	
						spoor
			sign the form so we can get to it.
	
					   dowser
			... get to it.
	
	sam grabs the clipboard and smashes it over spoor's head.
	the board is so cold that it snaps in two. the paper on it
	also snaps in two.
