56  int.   mother's flat				 night		 56
	
	sam steps inside, where the flunky proceeds to search him.
	the place is full of sleek people - smartly but less
	formally dresses than sam. it is an elegant baroque room -
	lavishly appointed but still violated by the ubiquitous
	central service ducts that thrust through antique
	tapestries and gilt mirrors with little regard for
	aesthetics or the interior decorator's feelings.
	
						sam
				(bewildered)
			mother? is that you?
	
					   mother
				(taking his arm - looking
				slightly askance at his
				clothes)
			of course. isn't it wonderful? the
			bandages came of this afternoon. come
			and join the fun. everybody's here.
	
						sam
			is mr helpmann here?
	
					   mother
			yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
	
						sam
			i want to talk to him.
	
	sam pushes away the flunky who is by now passing a metal
	detector over him.
	
					   mother
			it seems you're the first person ever
			to turn down a promotion. he thinks
			you should see a doctor.
	
						sam
			actually, i've decided ...
	
	dr jaffe hoves into view.
	
					   mother
			oh, louis! you know sam.
	
	dr jaffe is no longer suave. he has been transformed by
	drink and success. mostly by drink.
	
					  dr jaffe
				(as high as a kite)
			can you believe it?! just me and my
			little knife! snip - snip - slice -
			slice - can you believe it?
	
						sam
				(repelled)
			congratulations ...
	
					  dr jaffe
			and this is just the beginning!!
	
						sam
			really?
	
					  dr jaffe
			chirst yes, you've seen her with her
			clothes off. faces are a doddle
			compared to tits and arse.
				(explains)
			no hairline.
	
					   mother
				(primly)
			really, louis.
	
	a handsome young piece of beefcake delivers a drink to
	mother.
	
					  beefcake
			i've been looking everywhere for you,
			ida.
	
	the beefcake takes mother away.
	
					  dr jaffe
			ah, dear boy ... and what do you
			think of your mother now?
	
				  voice (off camera)
			it will never last.
	
	sam and dr jaffe turn to see who is speaking. it is dr
	chapman a tall, pipe-smoking, professional-looking gent.
	
					  dr jaffe
				(a trifle haughtily)
			excuse me, dr chapman, did you say
			something?
	
					 dr chapman
			that technique ... i've tried it. a
			nice effect. but highly unstable. in
			six months she'll look like grandma
			moses.
	
	sam wishing to escape from this bitchery turns away but
	suddenly freezes - the reflection in the large wall mirror
	next to him is not that of the party guests - but of the
	grey prisoners in his dream - they are massed in the room
	looking pleadingly towards him.
	
					  dr jaffe
				(unsuave again)
			now see here, chapman. at least mine
			don't look like they've been mugged.
	
	through the grey prisoners pushes mrs terrain.
	
					 mrs terrain
				(calls)
			sam!
	
	sam turns around to see her pushing through the party
	guests.
	
	mrs terrain is limping and is even more heavily swathed in
	bandages than the last time.
	
	dr chapman hastily moves away as mrs terrain comes up. she
	claims sam, taking his arm.
	
						sam
				(looking at her worriedly)
			whatever happened to you?
	
					 mrs terrain
			there was a slight complication. dr.
			chapman says it often happens with a
			delicate skin like mine. nothing to
			worry about. he's promised me i'll
			have these bandages off in a ...
						 
						sam
				(trying to disengage)
			actually, there's someone i want to
			meet ...
	
					 mrs terrain
				(roguishly)
			i know, i know ...!
			
	she drags sam through the party and we arrive at her
	daughter, shirley, who is, of course, a wallflower.
	
					 mrs terrain
			here we are! i'm going to leave you
			two lovebirds in peace.
	
						sam
			i ... uh ...
	
	but he is alone with shirley, standing at the entrance to
	his mother's embarrassingly rampant boudoir style bedroom.
	in amongst the diaphanous curtains enclosing the bed
	mother is playing hide and seek with a young stud.
	
						sam
			can i get you a drink, shirley?
	
	shirley looks at him terrified.
	
						sam
			look ... shirley ... your mother ...
			and my mother ... they seem to have
			got the idea ... i mean, i'm terribly
			flattered, of course, but, um, the
			thing is, i don't want you to be
			under any false ...
						 
					   shirley
				{struggling into speech
				shyly)
			it's ... it's ... all right ... i
			don't like you either ...
	
	this isn't what sam expected. he smiles weakly at her.
	
				  voice (off camera)
			sam!
	
	sam turns round, to see jack lint a few paces away.
	
						sam
			hello, jack!
	
						jack
			you remember alison?
	
	he indicates his cute blonde perfect junior executive's
	wife
	
						sam
			hello, alison. you look different.
	
					   alison
			well, i'm two years older.
	
						jack
			and she's been to dr. jaffe!
	
	alison locks displeased.
	
						jack
				{winking at sam)
			she doesn't like me telling anyone
			but she's pleased as anything really.
	
						sam
			er, i knew you looked different.
						 
						jack
			remember how they used to stick out?
	
						sam
			what? - oh, yes - vividly. i used to
			wonder if they were real.
	
					   alison
			what, my ears?
	
						sam
			your ears?
	
						jack
			dr. jaffe has pinned her ears back.
	
						sam
				(covering up hopelessly)
			quite, absolutely - i always thought
			they were false.
	
						jack
				(looking past sam)
			mr helpmann!
	
	sam spins round and sees a very pleasant-looking
	distinguished old man moving in their direction. he is in
	a wheelchair.
	
					  helpmann
			hello, jack.
	
						jack
			you remember my wife ... alis -
	
					  helpmann
			of course. barbara isn't it? how are
			you?
					   alison
			um ...
	
						jack
				(instantly. conveying to
				alison that she mustn't
				object)
			barbara's very well, thank you, sir.
			how are you?
	
					  helpmann
			fine, thank you. hello, sam. ida said
			you might be here. have you got a
			minute?
				(to jack)
			would you excuse us?
	
	jack is taken aback, envious and eager to please.
	
						jack
			of course .... of course ... come on
			alison - barbara
	
	jack propels his wife away.
	
	helpmann i need your help, sam.
