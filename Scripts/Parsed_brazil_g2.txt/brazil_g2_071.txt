81  ext.   information retrieval building	day		   81
	
	sam marches jill out of the main door and down the front
	steps of the information retrieval building. as he
	struggles with her some of the papers in the dossier slip
	out unbeknownst to sam and leave a trail of litter behind
	them.
	
						jill
			who are you? let go!
	
						sam
			don't look back! act naturally!
	
						jill
			how can i act naturally, when you've
			trying to break my arm?
	
	cut to the pov of the ministry of information front door
	guards. they are looking down the steps at the retreating
	backs of sam and jill who are jostling each other. the
	guards see jill elbow sam in the ribs.
	
						sam
				(wincing)
			ow! that hurt!
	
						jill
			good!
	
				   voice from behind
			stop! come back here!
	
						sam
			oh, god ... no!
	
	he turns around, knowing that the game is up. but instead
	of one of the guards shouting - it's an old lady angrily
	glaring at him and pointing to a "keep your city tidy"
	sign above a litter bin.
	
					  old lady
				(screaming)
			can't you read english? you
			illiterate foreign pig! you come here
			from your own filthy country and
			think you can mess our streets up!
			you should be fried alive, you dirty
			verminous ... etc. etc.
	
	sam sees the trail of dossier litter blowing about the
	pavement. he lets go of jill for a moment to grab at the
	papers. the lady continues screaming at him, her little
	pekinese dog (who incidentally wears a plaster over his
	bum hole) yaps at his ankles, ripping sam's new trousers.
	sam is torn between trying to regain the pages of the
	dossier and following jill who has disappeared round the
	corner. he gives up retrieving the paper and rushes after
	jill.
	
	cutting back to the two guards, who have been observing
	all this bizarre activity, we see one of them reading one
	of the pieces of paper.
	
					 other guard
			hey, you shouldn't be reading that
			it's classified.
