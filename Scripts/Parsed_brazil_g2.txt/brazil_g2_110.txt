122 int.   mother's corridor			  night		122
	
	a venerable porter carrying a single key on a large ring
	is preceding sam and jill along the corridor which we have
	seen before. the porter's name is matthews.
	
						sam
			my mother said it would be all right.
	
					  matthews
			she didn't say anything about it to
			me.
	
						sam
			well, she's my mother, not yours.
	
					  matthews
			i won't be held responsible.
	
						sam
			how long will she he away?
	
					  matthews
				(darkly)
			there are some who go to dr. jaffe's
			clinic who never come back at all.
	
	matthews unlocks mother's door.
	
					  matthews
				(to jill)
			you're not a professional, are you?
	
						jill
			no, amateur.
	
						sam
				(firmly)
			thank you, matthews.
	
	with which he ushers jill through the door and closes the
	door in matthews' face.
