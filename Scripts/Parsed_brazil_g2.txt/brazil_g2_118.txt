	in absolute inky darkness, sam and the camera move through
	space and time marked only by voices and sounds
	encountered on the way. this sound-sequence fades in and
	out a few times, indicating that the journey is longer
	than the real-time period of the blacked-out sequence. we
	hear:
	
	footsteps of sam and guards.
	
	distant howl of pain.
	
	muzak.
	
	iron gate.
	
	footsteps again.
	
	lift doors opening and closing.
	
	muzak.
	
	typing pool.
	
					female voice
			a wonderful gift, i changed it at the
			chemist for some antibiotics and
			bathroom scales and there's enough
			left on the voucher for a
			tonsilectomy if i want to treat
			myself ...
	
	office door opens and closes.
	
					guard's voice
			christmas parcel for you, sir ...
			sign here please ...
	
	what looks like a rectangular hatch in the blackness
	opens. it is the eyeslit on the front of sam's bag being
	opened by a security guard.
	
	the security guard peers in for a moment and then steps
	back to reveal two smart officials sitting at a desk. they
	are looking up at sam/us.
	
					 official a
			93/hks/608, you are charged with the
			following:
			passing confidential documents to
			unauthorized personnel - viz ir
			dossier/gillian layton. destroying
			government property - viz an
			indeterminate number of personnel
			carriers. taking possession under
			false pretences of said personnel
			carriers. forging the signature of
			the head of records, third
			department. attempting to misdirect
			ministry funds, in the form of a
			cheque to a. buttle, through
			unauthorized channels. tampering with
			central services supply ducts.
			employing unqualified suspected
			persons for this purpose. attempting
			to conceal a fugitive from justice.
			obstructing the forces of law and
			order in the exercise of their duty.
			giving aid and comfort to the enemies
			of society.
			bringing into disrepute the good name
			of the government, and the standing
			within the community of the
			department of information retrieval.
			attempting to disrupt the ministry of
			information retrieval's internal
			communicating systems. wasting
			ministry time and paper.
	
					 official b
			we would advise you that a plea of
			guilty will save you and the tax
			payer money, and will always be
			looked upon more favourably than a
			plea of not guilty. all you are
			requested to do at this stage is to
			sign this form.
	
	official b waves a sheet of paper. we hear sam's voice.
	
						sam
			where's jill?
	
					 official a
			not interested?
	
						sam
			what have you done with jill?
	
					 official a
			right. next!
	
	the security guard appears briefly and zips up the hood
	again plunging us back into darkness. we get more muffled
	shouts, heavy breathing and subterranean son et lumiere.
	
	another security guard opens the flap on sam's hood. we
	see another two officials.
	
						sam
				(more hysterical)
			where's jill? what's happened to
			jill?
	
					 official c
			93/hks/608, you've got quite a list
			of misdemeanours here, haven't you?
			all this is going to take time and
			money, and i'm afraid, according to
			your bank statement and credit rating
			here, you're likely to be in deep
			financial trouble by the end of it.
			now, either you plead guilty to say,
			seven or eight of these charges,
			which'll bring the costs down to
			within your reach, or you can borrow
			a sum to be negotiated, from us, at
			very competitive rates. we can offer
			you something at say, eleven and a
			half per cent, over thirty years. but
			you will have to buy insurance to
			qualify for his scheme.
	
					 official d
			all you have to do is to agree to
			sign the appropriate boxes on these
			forms. yes or no?
	
						sam
			i'm not guilty! not guilty you stupid
			bastar...
	
	the guard closes the flap. once again darkness and
	confusion. until another security guard opens the flap
	again to reveal another two officials.
	
					 official e
				(examining forms)
			now, since you've elected to plead
			not guilty on all these charges,
			you'd be well advised to take some
			sort of insurance cover. preferably
			comprehensive, or if you'd prefer,
			something more specific - say,
			against electrical charges over
			f70.00. and for food and
			accommodation costs of say, Â£800.00.
			detention can be a very expensive
			business.
	
					 official f
			now, before we bore you with the
			small print perhaps you'd like to
			tell us whether you'd like to sign
			this insurance acceptance form or
			not. think carefully before you
			decide. thinking ahead in financial
			matters is always the wise course.
	
	the flap is closed and opened again very quickly - new
	officials are revealed. this process repeats again and
	again - getting faster and faster. the officials' faces
	seem to become a changing blur. their voices overlap in a
	growing cacophony. the desk and the other items in the
	room remain static. to add to this disturbing effect the
	forces of darkness begin to gather in the room behind the
	officials. as they increase in number they begin to press
	forward unseen by the officials. soon they fill the view
	through the flap.
	
					  official
			we're here to save you and the tax
			payer money.
	
					  official
			would you like to pay the premium for
			a single room with a shower and a
			soft bed?
	
					  official
			for a small charge we can keep visits
			from friends and relatives down to to
			a minimum.
	
					  official
			plead guilty, it's easier, quicker,
			and cheaper for everyone.
	
					  official
			we're doing a survey ... aimed at
			providing a better service.
	
					  official
			do you think the present system is a.
			efficient, b. inefficient?
	
					  official
			as a taxpayer are you a. impressed,
			b. unimpressed
