			i'm afraid you're right, mr.
			helpmann. he's gone.
	
	a wide shot of the room shows us helpmann and lint turn
	away and leave. sam is left alone. he is humming.. the
	camera pulls back and back. the information retrieval room
	with sam in it floats away into the most beautiful
	glorious sky ever.
	
	sam's humming into a full orchestra, and we hear ......
	
	
			"brazil, where hearts were entertained in june,
			we stood beneath an amber moon,
			and softly murmured 'some day soon'
			we kissed and clung together,
			then, tomorrow was another day.
			the morning found me miles away,
			with still a million things to say,
			now, when twilight beams the sky above,
			recalling thrills of our love,
			there's one thing i'm certain of,
			return, i will,
			to old brazil."
