25  int.   ministry of information lobby	day		   25

	this is a gigantic, vaguely 30's monumental-style
	building. the lobby is a vast impressive space containing
	reception desks, fountains, statues etc. prominent are the
	security measures, which include automatic mobile cameras,
	video screens and groups of security men who search all
	who enter. sam is finishing going through security when he
	meets jack who is on his way out of the building.

						jack
			sam!

						sam
			jack!

						jack
			long time no see!

						sam
			well, since you disappeared up the
			ladder of information retrieval ... i
			don't expect to see you slumming in
			records - what's the problem?

						jack
			problem? - no problem - yes,
			everything's going fantastically
			well, wonderful, marvelous, great
			career prospects, alison in great
			shape, kids fine, beautiful home, i'm
			on security level five now, and mr
			helpmann relies on me more and more,
			yes, couldn't be better, i feel
			terrifically motivated and job-
			rewarded -
			
						sam
			you sound worried.

						jack
			me? - if i'm worried about anyone,
			it's you. what happened to you, sam?
			you were the brightest of us -

	as they have been talking, a nearby bank of closed circuit
	tv screens has been displaying shots of people entering
	the lobby. as each one enters the camera zooms in tight on
	their faces for a frozen close-up. jill has just entered
	and the camera zooms in and freezes on her face. sam
	happens to glance up at this moment. he is startled - the
	over-exposed tv image is the face of the girl from the
	dream. the face is only there a few seconds before being
	replaced by another picture. sam looks about to see where
	the girl is, but jill, in overalls, has her back to him as
	she stands in the queue for the information desk and so
	there is no-one even vaguely reminiscent of the dream
	girl. sam decides he must have imagined it. over this jack
	has been talking.

						jack
			what's the matter?
						 
						sam
			sorry. nothing.
				(snapping out of it)
			see you - i'm going to be late.

						jack
				(looking at his watch)
			you are late.

						sam
			even later.

						jack
			sam, your life is going wrong - let
			your friends tell you - records is a
			dead end department, no security
			level worth a damn, it's impossible
			to get noticed -

						sam
			yes, i know, fantastic, marvellous,
			wonderful - remember me to alison -
			and the - er - twins.

						jack
			triplets.
	
						sam
			really? - god, how time flies!
	
	as sam heads off to the lift, he passes a group of men
	standing around a temporary tv monitor. several of them
	are dressed in white lab coats. they are being explained
	the benefits of a new surveillance system by a salesman
	type. his assistant is operating the controls. on the
	monitor we can see jill standing in the queue for the
	information desk. the camera appears to he tracking in on
	her.
	
	cut to jill at top of queue with several forms in her
	hand. a strange prototype radio controlled camera on a
	wheeled base is whirring and clicking as it approaches
	her. throughout the next sequence it pokes around jill in
	an annoying manner - thrusting itself at her face, trying
	to see what is written on the forms, peering over her
	shoulder. jill hands a form to the information porter.
	
						jill
			i want to report a wrongful arrest.
	
					   porter
				(looking at form)
			you want information adjustments.
			different department.
	
						jill
				(exasperated but
				controlled)
			i've been to information adjustments.
			they sent me here. they told me you
			had a form i had to fill in.
	
					   porter
			have you got an arrest receipt?
	
						jill
			yes.
	
					   porter
			is it stamped?
	
						jill
				(producing buttle receipt)
			stamped?
	
					   porter
				(examining receipt)
			no, there's no stamp on it. you see!
			i can't give you the form until it's
			stamped.
	
						jill
			where do i get it stamped?
	
					   porter
			information adjustments.
	
	the radio-controlled camera noses right up to jill's face
	as she turns. she swats the annoying thing with her stack
	of forms as she storms off. the camera overbalances and
	crashes into the desk - sparking and spluttering.
	
	cutting back to the group around the monitor we see a
	deeply hurt salesman and several sceptical white-coated
	technicians.
