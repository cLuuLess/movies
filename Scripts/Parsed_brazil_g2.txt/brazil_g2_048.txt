57  int.   bathroom					 night		 57
	
	it's the sort of bathroom you would expect of mother, an
	adjunct to her boudoir. the pink or purple lavatory is in
	the process of flushing, while sam holds mr helpmann
	vertical, grasping him under the armpits, while mr
	helpmann is zipping his fly.
	
					  helpmann
			thanks very much sam.
	
						sam
			that's all right mr helpmann. glad to
			help.
	
	he is lowering helpmann into the wheelchair.
	
					  helpmann
			if i can help you ...
	
						sam
				(broaching the subject)
			well, i ...
	
	in maneuvering helpmann sam clumsily knocks over one of
	the pretty pots which fussily decorate mother's bathroom
	shelf. a thin layer of powder is spread over the wash-
	stand.
	
						sam
			sorry ...
	
					  helpmann
			your father and i were very close. of
			course jeremiah was senior to me but
			we were close friends ... especially
			after the bombing
				(he indicates his legs)
			and i
				(chuckles)
			keep his name alive at the office
			every day.
	
	with his finger helpmann is tracing letters in the
	powdered surface.
	
					  helpmann
			it's as though he's there speaking to
			me - "'ere i am, j.h.!" the ghost in
			the machine.
	
	we see that helpmann has traced the letters ereiamjh in
	the powder.
	
					  helpmann
			i know he would have wanted me to
			help you ... and i promised your
			mother i'd take you onto the team at
			information retrieval. but i gather
			that ...
	
						sam
			mr helpmann. i've changed my mind.
			i'd like to accept the transfer - am
			i too late?
	
					  helpmann
			too late? that's for me to say.
						 
						sam
			well ... well, i ...
	
	helpmann puts out his hand. sam takes it.
	
					  helpmann
			welcome to information retrieval!
	
	helpmann blows away the spilled powder and ereiamjh with
	it.
