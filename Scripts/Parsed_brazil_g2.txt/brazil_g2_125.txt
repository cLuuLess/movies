137 ext.   forecourt					night		137
	
	the forecourt is suddenly illuminated by huge arc lights.
	machine gun installations open fire. the rescuers are
	totally exposed.
	
	they are cut down left and right.
	desperately they battle their way across the open space.
	time running out. sam, knowing the way, leads tuttle
	towards a shielded spot. will they make it? as the last
	rescuer is cut down sam and tuttle dive for cover.
	kowblammpow! a massive explosion. then another. and
	another. security troops caught unprotected are decimated.
	sam looks up. christ! the building is being blown to bits.
	certain windows are lit. they spell out merry xmas. with a
	final massive haemorrhage the building erupts in a geyser
	of masonry, steel, paper and dozens of t.v. consoles and
	visual aid apparatus including, in large chunks, mr
	helpmann's masterpiece. but also tons and tons of paper.
	
	every file in the building has burst its seams and ejected
	its load skywards. the night sky is full of white
	rectangular wisps. ashlike they flutter down over the
	city. sam looks around and can't see tuttle anywhere. he
	shouts for him. but the remaining troops have spotted sam
	and sam runs.
