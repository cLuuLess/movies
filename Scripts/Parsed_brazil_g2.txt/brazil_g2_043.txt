	cut to sam plummeting down through dense clouds, his cape
	twisting around him. somehow he manages to wrestle it
	clear of his body. gripping the corners he whips the cape
	up and over his head. the wind catches it and fills it out
	until it acts as a parachute slowing sam's descent.
	suddenly the clouds thin out and sam can see below him.
