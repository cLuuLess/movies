124 int.   information retrieval foyer	  night		124
	
	sam arrives at the ministry of information retrieval
	reception it's late. groups of cleaners are operating
	cleaning machinery. sam approaches the desk porter who is
	playing with the executive toy sam gave him.
	
						sam
			excuse me, dawson, can you put me
			through to mr helpmann's office?
	
					   porter
			i'm afraid i can't, sir. you have to
			go through the proper channels.
	
						sam
			and you can't tell me what the proper
			channels are, because that's
			classified information?
	
					   porter
			i'm glad to see the ministry's
			continuing its tradition of
			recruiting the brightest and best,
			sir.
	
						sam
			thank you, dawson.
	
	sam crosses the foyer, checks to see that dawson is no
	longer watching him engrossed as he is with the executive
	toy, and slips past the lift which, at that moment,
	disgorges a leg-bandaged, be-crutched lime who hobbles
	across the lobby without seeing sam, who slips down the
	stairs which he knows lead to helpmann's private lift.
