54  int.   sam's flat					night		 54
	
	sam wakes up. his feet are entangled in some wiring and
	ducting. he is still in his devastated sitting room. as he
	untangles himself the door bell rings. it takes a moment
	for sam to recognise it as the door bell. annoyed and
	still disturbed by the dream he gets up and goes to the
	door. he opens it. in bursts a girl dressed in a silly
	bell-boy costume with lots of glitter, net stockings and
	big-bowed tap dancing shoes. she launches into a terrible
	song and dance routine.
	
					girl (singing)
			mrs ida lowry requests the pleasure
			  of your companyyyy
			  at her apartment tonight,
			from eight thirtyyyy
			  midnight
			to celebrate the completion
			  of her recent cosmetic surgeryyyy
			the guest of honour will be
			  mr conrad helpmann,
			dep. under minister of state
			  for public information,
			r.s.v.p. by singing telegram.
	
	sam and the girl stand looking at each other uneasily for
	a moment.
	
						sam
			er ... thanks ...
	
						girl
			it's reply paid.
	
						sam
			oh ...
				(he sings uncertainly)
			thank you very much, mother, but
			actually -
	
						girl
			you don't have to sing it.
	
						sam
			oh, right ...
	
	the girl begins to dance again - but this time in a rather
	strange strangled fashion.
	
						sam
				(he looks at his watch)
			aren't you a bit late? - the party
			started half an hour ago.
	
						girl
			yes, i know. it's the backlog,
			everybody complains. was it all right
			otherwise?
	
						sam
			yes, it was ... very nice ... thank
			you.
