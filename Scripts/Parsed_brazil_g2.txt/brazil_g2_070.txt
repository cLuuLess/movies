80  int.   lobby						day		  80
	
	alarm bells start ringing and from secret doors heavily
	armed guards leap out, their guns trained on jill as she
	appears to be the only person around.
	
						guard
				(shouting)
			drop it!!
	
	jill has only the form in her hand - which she dutifully
	drops. she is terrified by the suddenness and size of the
	response to her hitting the desk. the guards close in.
	
	sam rushes out of the door leading to the stairs. he can't
	believe the sight that greets him. he responds
	instinctively,
	
						sam
			stop! let her go!
	
	he rushes over to the porter's desk just as the guards
	behind him come through the door. he doesn't have a clue
	what he is going to do but, as he reaches the group of
	guards they snap attention. confused he looks around and
	then realizes his i.d. badge, is on his lapel and the
	guards are responding as trained. the guards chasing him
	screech to a halt when they see the others snapping to
	attention. everyone looks confused, embarrassed, hesitant
	to make the next move. sam breaks the silence.
	
						sam
			well done ... uh ... excellent work
			... quick thinking. i'll take charge
			of her now ...
	
	realising he has jill's dossier, he shows it to everyone -
	her print-out pictures are on the front page.
	it's a classified matter ... i'll include your fine
	handling of the situation in my report
	
	sam is suddenly aware he is still holding the executive
	toy present - he hands it to the porter.
	
						sam
				(grabbing jill)
			come with me, please.
	
	he hustles her towards the door.
