61  int.   corridor					 day		   61
	
	sam gets to the corner of the corridor and finds a similar
	corridor at right angles. he hesitates and continues. then
	he starts to hear the sound again. it is coming up from
	behind. mr warren has circumnavigated the building. the
	same sort of business is being enacted at the same pace.
	as the scrum reaches sam he gathers his nerve and jumps
	right in beside warren, and keeps going.
	
						sam
				(in a hurry)
			i'm lowry, mr warren ... sam lowry.
	
					   warren
				(putting arm around sam)
			ah. lowry ... yes.
				(still dealing with
				expediters)
			... no, cancel that ... glad to have
			you aboard ... yes ... no ... don't
			be ridiculous jenkins ... yes, yes,
			yes ... you'll like it up here ...
			send that back ... we've got a crack
			team of ... are they kidding? ...
			decision makers ... no, in triplicate
			... i'm expecting big things ... two
			copies to finance ... of you ... send
			that to security ... uh, uh, uh.
				(poring over forms)
			uh, don't let progress see this ...
			between you and me, lowry, this ...
			no, no ... department ... tell
			records to get stuffed ... is about
			to be upgraded and ...
	
	warren suddenly pivots around, swinging sam 240 degrees in
	the direction they came from plus a bit.
	
					   warren
			ah, here we are!
				(they are standing facing a
				door - one of the hundreds
				of identical doors lining
				these corridors)
			what do you think?
	
	the door says: officer dz/015.
	
	sam has no idea what he ought to say.
	
					   warren
				(solemnly)
			your very own number... on your very
			own door ... and behind that door
				(he turns the knob and
				opens the door)
			... your very own office.
			congratulations, dz/015, welcome to
			the team.
	
	warren whirls off in a flurry of paperwork and expediters
	leaving sam standing dumfounded at the entrance to his
	office.
	
	cut to sam's pov of the office. it is about four feet
	wide. a small blacked-out window high on the far wall is
	bisected by what looks like a recently constructed side
	wall. the room is bare except for a chair and a desk which
	is also bisected by the new wall. pneumatic tubes hang
	from the ceiling. sam slowly enters the room.
