22  int.   mr kurtzman's office			day		   22
	
	mr kurtzman also has a t.v. console. he sits behind his
	desk, reaches for his in-tray, and without looking at the
	console he turns his screen on. he looks through a number
	of files in his in-tray. he is surprised to hear a voice
	say, "turn around real slow, amigo". mr kurtzman turns
	around real slow, his expression relaxes, he thumps his
	t.v. console with a large fist, and the screen obediently
	flicks to a display of figures. he picks up a file which
	we see as marked "buttle, archibald". he opens the file
	and starts punching the keyboard of the console. the t.v.
	starts bleeping in an alarmed way. mr kurtzman is puzzled.
	he punches more figures. the screen starts to flash
	"error, error, error". mr kurtzman sighs with frustration.
	he presses an intercom.
					 mr kurtzman
				(into intercom)
			mr lowry, will you step in here
			please?
			
	he returns his attention, puzzled to the file. nobody
	comes into the office. mr kurtzman gets up and walks over
	to his door and opens it. beyond the door the room full of
	clerks is obediently concentrating on the bleeping and
	whirring consoles. from mr kurtzman's pov we see that in
	the centre of the room is an unoccupied desk.

					 mr kurtzman
			does anyone know where lowry is?

	nobody knows. mr kurtzman closes his door again. a moment
	later it seems to him, and to us, that he has heard the
	crash of six guns blazing away at each other. he re-opens
	the door. the only sound again. he goes back to his desk.
	he punches a few keys. the machine starts emitting even
	more alarming beeps, then horse whinnies, then "admit
	you're whupped, you drygulching scum". kurtzman explodes
	with anger, and presses the intercom again.

					 mr kurtzman
				(shouting into intercom)
			where the hell is sam lowry?!
