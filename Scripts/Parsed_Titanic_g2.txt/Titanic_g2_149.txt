223 int. grand staircase

tracking with jack as he bangs through the doors to the foyer and sprints
down the stairs. he sees her coming into a-deck foyer, running toward him,
cal's long coat flying out behind her as she runs.

they meet at the bottom of the stairs, and collide in an embrace.

                                   jack

rose, rose, you're so stupid, you're such an idiot--

and all the while he's kissing her and holding her as tight as he can.

stairs.

hockley steps on the skittering head of the cherub statue and goes
sprawling. the gun clatters across the marble floor. he gets up, and
reeling drunkenly goes over to retrieve it.
