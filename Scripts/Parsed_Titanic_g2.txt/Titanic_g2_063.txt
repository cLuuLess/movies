95 int. bridge / chartroom - day

harold bride, the 21 year old junior wireless operator, hustles in and
skirts around andrews' tour group to hand a marconigram to captain smith.

                                   bride

another ice warning, sir. this one from the "baltic".

                                   smith

smith glances at the message then nonchalantly puts it in his pocket. he

speeding up. i've just ordered the last boilers lit.

andrews scowls slightly before motioning the group toward the door. they
exit just as second officer charles herbert lightoller comes out of the
chartroom, stopping next to first officer murdoch.

                           first officer murdoch

haven't seen them since southampton.

                                                                   cut to:
