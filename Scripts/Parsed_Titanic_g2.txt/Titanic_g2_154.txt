229 int. stairwell

jack and rose pound up the steps as white water swirls up behind them. pull
back to reveal that a steel gate blocks the top of the stairs. jack slams
against the fate, gripping the bars.

a terrified steward standing guard on the landing above turns to run at the
sight of the water thundering up the stairs.

                                   jack

wait! wait! help us! unlock the gate.

the steward runs on. the water wells up around jack and rose, pouring
through the gate and slamming them against it. in seconds it is up to their
waist.

                                   rose

help us! please!

the steward stops and looks back. he sees jack and rose at the gate, their
arms raching through... sees the water pouring through the gate onto the
landing.

                                  steward

fucking 'ell!

he runs back, slogging against the curretn. he pulls a key ring from his
belt and struggles to unlock the padlock as the water fountains up around
them.

the lights short out and the landing is plunged into darkness.

the water rises over the lock and he's doing it by feel.

                                   jack

come on! come on!

jack and rose are right up against the ceiling...

suddenly the gate gives and swings open. they are pushing through by the
force of the water. they make it to stairs on the other side of the landing
and follow the steward up to the next deck.

                                                                   cut to:
