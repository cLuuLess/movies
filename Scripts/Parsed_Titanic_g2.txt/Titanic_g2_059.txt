91 int. first class dining saloon

at the divine service, captain smith is leading a group in the hymn
"almighty father strong to save." rose and ruth sing in the middle of the
group.

lovejoy stands well back, keeping an eye on rose. he notices a commotion at
the entry doors. jack has been halted there by two stewards. he is dressed
in his third class clothes, and stands there, hat in hand, looking out of
place.

                                  steward

look, you, you're not supposed to be in here.

                                   jack

i was just here last night... don't you remember?

                    (seeing lovejoy coming toward him)

he'll tell you.

                                  lovejoy

mr. hockley and mrs. dewitt bukater continue to be most appreciative of
your assistance. they asked me to give you this in gratitude--

he holds out two twenty dollar bills, which jack refuses to take.

                                   jack

i don't want money, i--

                                  lovejoy

--and also to remind you that you hold a third class ticket and your
presence here is no longer appropriate.

jack spots rose but she doesn't see him.

                                   jack

i just need to talk to rose for a--

                                  lovejoy

gentlemen, please see that mr. dawson gets back where he belongs.

                   (giving the twenties to the stewards)

and that he stays there.

                                  steward

yes sir!

                                 (to jack)

come along you.

end on rose, not seeing jack hustled out.

                                   rose

                                 (singing)

o hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea.

                                                                   cut to:
