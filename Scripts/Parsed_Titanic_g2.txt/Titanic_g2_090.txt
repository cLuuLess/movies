129 ext. forward well deck and crow's nest - night

rose and jack, fully dressed, come through a crew door onto the deck. they
can barely stand, they are laughing so hard.

up above them, in the crow's nest, lookout fleet hears the disturbance
below and looks around and back down to the well deck, where he can see two
figures embracing.

jack and rose stand in each others arms. their breath clouds around them in
the now freezing air, but they don't even feel the cold.

                                   rose

when this ship docks, i'm getting off with you.

                                   jack

this is crazy.

                                   rose

i know. it doesn't make any sense. that's why i trust it.

jack pulls her to him and kisses her fiercely.

130 in the crow's nest fleet nudges lee.

                                   fleet

cor... look at that, would ya.

                                    lee

they're a bloody sight warmer than we are.

                                   fleet

well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, i'd rather not, if
it's all the same.

they both have a good laugh at that one. it is fleet whose expression falls
first. glancing forward again, he does a double take. the color drains out
of his face.

fleet's pov: a massive iceberg right in their path, 500 yards out.

                                   fleet

bugger me!!

fleet reaches past lee and rings the lookout bell three times, then grabs
the telephone, calling the bridge. he waits precious seconds for it to be
picket up, never taking his eyes off the black mass ahead.

                                   fleet

pick up, ya bastard.

                                                                   cut to:
