299 ext. lifeboats / ocean / carpathia montage - day

images dissolve into one another: a ship's hull looming, with the letters
carpathia visible on the bow... rose watching, rocked by the sea, her face
blank... seamen helping survivors up the rope ladder to the carpathia's
gangway doors... two women crying and hugging each other inside the ship...
all silent, all in slow-motion. there is just music, so gentle and sad,
part elegy, part hymn, part aching song of love lost forever.

the images continue to music... rose, outside of time, outside of herself,
coming into carpathia, barely able to stand... rose being draped wtih warm
blankets and given hot tea... bruce ismay climbing aboard. he has the face
and eyes of a damned soul.

as ismay walks along the hall, guided by a crewman toward the doctor's
cabin, he passes rows of seated and standing widows. he must run the
gauntlet of their accusing gazes.
