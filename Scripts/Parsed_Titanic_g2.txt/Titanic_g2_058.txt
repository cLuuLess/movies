90 int. ruth's suite - day

rose is dressed for the day, and is in the middle of helping ruth with her
corset. the tight bindings do not inhibit ruth's fury at all.

                                   ruth

you are not to see that boy again, do you understand me rose? i forbid it!

rose has her knee at the base of her mother's back and is pulling the
corset strings with both hands.

                                   rose

oh, stop it, mother. you'll give yourself a nosebleed.

ruth pulls away from her, and crosses to the door, locking it. clack!

                                   ruth

                             (wheeling on her)

rose, this is not a game! our situation is precarious. you know the money's
gone!

                                   rose

of course i know it's gone. you remind me every day!

                                   ruth

your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good
name. and that name is the only card we have to play.

rose turns her around and grabs the corset strings again. ruth sucks in her
waist and rose pulls.

                                   ruth

i don't understand you. it is a fine match with hockley, and it will insure
our survival.

                                   rose

                              (hurt and lost)

how can you put this on my shoulders?

rose turns to her, and we see what rose sees-- the naked fear in her
mother's eyes.

                                   ruth

do you want to se me working as a seamstress? is that what you want? do you
want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to
the winds? my god, rose, how can you be so selfish?

                                   rose

it's so unfair.

                                   ruth

of course it's unfair! we're women. our choices are never easy.

rose pulls the corset tighter.

                                                                   cut to:
