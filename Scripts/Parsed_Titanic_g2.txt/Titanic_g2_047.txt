77 int. molly brown's stateroom

men's suits and jackets and formal wear are strewn all over the place.
molly is having a fine time. jack is dressed, except for his jacket, and
molly is tying his bow tie.

                                   molly

don't feel bad about it. my husband still can't tie one of these damn
things after 20 years. there you go.

she picks up a jacket off the bed and hands it to him. jack goes into the
bathroom to put it on. molly starts picking up the stuff off the bed.
