175 ext. / int. titanic hull and master at arms office

tracking along the rows of portholes angling down into the water. under the
surface, they glow green. pushing in on one porthole which is have
submerged. inside we see jack, looking apprehensively at the water rising
up the glass.

inside the master at arms' office jack sits chained to the waterpipe, next
to the porthole. lovejoy sits on the edge of a desk. he puts a .45 bullet
on the desk and watches it roll across and fall off. he picks up the
bullet.

                             (crosses to jack)

he punches jack hard in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him.

lovejoy flips the handcuff key in the air, catches it and puts it in his
pocket. he exits. jack is left gasping, handcuffed to the pipe.
