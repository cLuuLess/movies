93 ext. aft well deck, b-deck and a-deck - day

jack, walking with determination, is followed closely by tommy and
fabrizio. he quickly climbs the steps to b-deck and steps over the gate
separating 3rd from 2nd class.

                                   tommy

she's a goddess amongst mortal men, there's no denyin'. but she's in
another world, jackie, forget her. she's closed the door.

jack moves furtively to the wall below the a-deck promenade, aft.

                                   jack

it was them, not her.

                        (glancing around the deck)

ready... go.

tommy shakes his head resignedly and puts his hands together, crouching
down. jack steps into tommy's hands and gets boosted up to the next deck,
where he scrambles nimbly over the railing, onto the first class deck.

                                   tommy

                                 fabrizio

amore is'a not logical.
