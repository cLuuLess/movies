85 int. third class general room

crow led and alive with music, laughter and raucous carrying on. an ad hoc
band is gathered near the upright piano, honking out lively stomping music
on fiddle, accoridon and tambourine. people of all ages are dancing,
drinking beer and wine, smoking, laughing, even brawling.

tommy hands rose a pint of stout and she hoists it. jack meanwhile dances
with 5 year old cora cartmell, or tries to, with her standing on his feet.
as the tune ends, rose leans down to the little girl.

                                   rose

may i cut in, miss?

                                   jack

you're still my best girl, cora.

cora scampers off. rose and jack face each other. she is trembling as he
takes her right hand in his left. his other hand slides to the small of her
back. it is an electrifying moment.

                                   rose

i don't know the steps.

                                   jack

just move with me. don't think.

the music starts and they are off. a little awkward at first, she starts to
get into it. she grins at jack as she starts to get the rhythm of the
steops.

                                   rose

wait... stop!

she bends down, pulling off her high heeled shoes, and flings them to
tommy. then she grabs jack and they plunge back into the fray, dancing
faster as the music speeds up.

                                                                   cut to:
