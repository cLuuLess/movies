41 ext. aft well deck / poop deck - day

jack and fabrizio burst through a door onto the aft well deck. tracking
with them as they run across the deck and up the steel stairs to the poop
deck. they get to the rail and jack starts to yell and wave to the crowd on
the dock.

                                 fabrizio

you know somebody?

                                   jack

of course not. that's not the point.

                              (to the crowd)

goodbye! goodbye!! i'll miss you!

grinning, fabrixio joins in, adding his voice to the swell of voices,
feeling the exhilaration of the moment.

                                 fabrizio

goodbye! i will never forget you!!

                                                                   cut to:
