66 ext. poop deck - night

a few minutes later. jack is being detained by the burly master at arms,
the closest thing to a cop on board. he is handcuffing jack. cal is right
in front of jack, and furious. he has obviously just rushed out here with
lovejoy and another man, and none of them have coats over their black tie
evening dress. the other man is colonel archibald gracie, a mustachioed
blowhard who still has his brandy snifter. he offers it to rose, who is
hunched over crying on a bench nearby, but she waves it away. cal is more
concerned with jack. he grabs him by the lapels.

                                    cal

what made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! look at me,
you filth! what did you think you were doing?!

                                   rose

cal, stop! it was an accident.

                                    cal

an accident?!

                                   rose

it was... stupid really. i was leaning over and i slipped.

rose looks at jack, getting eye contact.

                                   rose

i was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. and i slipped and i
would have gone overboard... and mr. dawson here saved me and he almost
went over himself.

                                    cal

you wanted to see the propellers?

                                  gracie

                            (shaking his head)

women and machinery do not mix.

                              master at arms

                                 (to jack)

was that the way of it?

rose is begging him with her eyes not to say what really happened.

                                   jack

uh huh. that was pretty much it.

he looks at rose a moment longer. now they have a secret together.

                              colonel gracie

well! the boy's a hero then. good for you son, well done!

                                 (to cal)

so it's all's well and back to our brandy, eh?

jack is uncuffed. cal gets rose to her feet and moving.

                                    cal

                            (rubbing her arms)

let's get you in. you're freezing.

cal is leaving without a second thought for jack.

                                  gracie

                                   (low)

ah... perhaps a little something for the boy?

                                    cal

oh, right. mr. lovejoy. a twenty should do it.

                                   rose

is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?

                                    cal

rose is displeased. mmm... what to do?

cal turns back to jack. he appraises him condescendingly... a steerage
ruffian, unwashed and ill-mannered.

                                    cal

i know.

                                 (to jack)

perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with
your heroic tale?

                                   jack

                        (looking straight at rose)

sure. count me in.

                                    cal

good. settled then.

cal turns to go, putting a protective arm around rose. he leans close to
gracie as they walk away.

                                    cal

this should be amusing.

                                   jack

                            (as lovejoy passes)

can i bum a cigarette?

lovejoy smoothly draws a silver cigarette case from his jacket and snaps it
open. jack takes a cigarette, then another, popping it behind his ear for
later. lovejoy lights jack's cigarette.

                                  lovejoy

you'll want to tie those.

                         (jack looks at his shoes)

interesting that the young lady slipped so mighty all of a sudden and you
still had time to take of your jacket and shoes. mmmm?

lovejoy's expression is bland, but the eyes are cold. he turns away to join
his group.

                                                                   cut to:
