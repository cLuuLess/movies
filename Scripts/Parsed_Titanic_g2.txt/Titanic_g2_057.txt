89 int. orse and cal's suite / private promenade - day

sunday april 14, 1912. a bright clear day. sunlight splashing across the
promenade. rose and cal are having breakfast in silence. the tension is
palpable. trudy bolt, in her maid's uniform, pours the coffee and goes
inside.

                                    cal

i had hoped you would come to me last night.

                                   rose

i was tired.

                                    cal

yes. your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.

                                   rose

                               (stiffening)

i see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.

                                    cal

you will never behave like that again! do you understand?

                                   rose

i'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! i am your
fiancee--

cal explodes, sweeping the breakfast china off the table with a crash. he
moves to her in one shocking moment, glowering over her and gripping the
sides of her chair, so she is trapped between his arms.

                                    cal

yes! you are! and my wife... in practice, if not yet by law. so you will
honor me, as a wife is required to honor her husband! i will not be made
out a fool! is this in any way unclear?

rose shrinks into the chair. she sees trudy, frozen, partway through the
door bringing the orange juice. cal follows rose's glance and straightens
up. he stalks past the maid, entering the stateroom.

                                   rose

we... had a little accident. i'm sorry, trudy.

                                                                   cut to:
