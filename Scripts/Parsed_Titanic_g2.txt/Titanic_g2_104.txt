163 int. bride / chartroom

andrews unrolls a big drawing of the ship across the chartroom table. it is
a side elevation, showing all the watertight bulkheads. his hands are
shaking. murdoch and ismay hover behind andrews and the captain.

                                   ismay

when can we get underway, do you think?

smith glares at him and turns his attention to andrews' drawing. the
builder points to it for emphasis as he talks.

                                  andrews

water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all
three holds... and in boiler room six.

                                   smith

that's right.

                                  andrews

five compartments. she can stay afloat with the first four compartments
breached. but not five. not five. as she goes down by the head the water
will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at e deck... from one to the
next... back and back. there's no stopping it.

                                   smith

the pumps--

                                  andrews

the pumps buy you time... but minutes only. from this moment, no matter
what we do, titanic will founder.

                                   ismay

but this ship can't sink!

                                  andrews

she is made of iron, sir. i assure you, she can. and she will. it is a
mathematical certainty.

smith looks like he has been gutpunched.

                                   smith

how much time?

                                  andrews

an hour, two at most.

ismay reels as his dream turns into his worst nightmare.

                                   smith

and how many aboard, mr. murdoch?

                                  murdoch

two thousand two hundred souls aboard, sir.

a long beat. smith turns to his employer.

                                   smith

i believe you may get your headlines, mr. ismay.

                                                                   cut to:
