179 ext. ocean / titanic / boat 6

the hull of titanic looms over boat 6 like a cliff. its enormous mass is
suddenly threatening to those in the tiny boat. quartermaster hitchins, at
the tiller, wants nothing but to get away from the ship. unfortunately his
two seamen can't row. they flail like a duck with a broken wing.

                                 hitchins

keep pulling... away from the ship. pull.

ain't you boys ever rowed before? here, gimme those oars. i'll show ya how
it's done.

she climbs over ruth to get at the oars, stepping on her feet.

around them the evacuation is in full swing, with boats in the water,
others being lowered.

                                                                   cut to:
