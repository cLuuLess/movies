69 ext. launch area/keldysh deck - day

as the big hydraulic jib swings one of the mir subs out over the water.
lovett walks as he talks with bobby buell, the partners' rep. they weave
among deck cranes, launch crew, sub maintenance guys.

                                   buell

the partners are pissed.

                                   brock

bobby, buy me time. i need time.

                                   buell

we're running thirty thousand a day, and we're six days over. i'm telling
you what they're telling me. the hand is on the plug. it's starting to
pull.

                                   brock

well you tell the hand i need another two days! bobby, bobby, bobby...
we're close! i smell it. i smell ice. she had the diamond on... now we just
have to find out where it wound up. i just gotta work her a bit more. okay?

brock turns and sees lizy standing behind him. she has overheard the past
part of his dialogue with buell. he goes to her and hustles her away from
buell, toward a quite spot on the deck.

                                   brock

hey, lizzy. i need to talk to you for a second.

                                   lizzy

don't you mean work me?

                                   brock

look, i'm running out of time. i need your help.

                                   lizzy

i'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and

                                  (more)

                              lizzy (cont'd)

one year old grandmother. i came down here to tell you to back off.

                                   brock

                      (with undisguised desperation)

lizzy... you gotta understand something. i've bet it all to find the heart
of the ocean. i've got all my dough tied up in this thing. my wife even
divorced me over this hunt. i need what's locked inside your grandma's
memory.

                          (he holds out his hand)

you see this? right here?

she looks at his hand, palm up. empty. cupped, as if around an imaginary
shape.

                                   lizzy

what?

                                   brock

that's the shape my hand's gonna be when i hold that thing. you understand?
i'm not leaving here without it.

                                   lizzy

look, brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. don't forget,
she contacted you. she's out here for her own reasons, god knows what they
are.

                                  lovett

maybe she wants to make peace with the past.

                                   lizzy

what past? she has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on
the titanic until two days ago.

                                  lovett

then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.

                                   lizzy

                            (looks at him hard)

you think she was really there?

                                  lovett

oh, yeah. yeah, i'm a believer. she was there.

                                                                   cut to:
