176 ext. boat deck / starboard side, forward

at the stairwell rail on the bridge wing, fourth officer boxhall and
quartermaster rowe light the first distress rocket. it shoots into the sky
and explodes with a thunderclap over the ship, sending out white starbursts
which light up the entire deck as they fall.

whip pan off the starbursts to ismay. the managing director of white star
line is cracking. already at the breaking point from his immense guilt, the
rocket panics him. he starts shouting at the officers struggling with the
falls of boat 5.

                                   ismay

there is no time to waste!

                       (yelling and waving his arms)

lower away! lower away! lower away!

fifth officer lowe, a baby-faced 28, and the youngest officer, looks up
from the tangled falls at the madman.

                                   lowe

get out of the way, you fool!

                                   ismay

do you know who i am?

lowe, not having a clue nor caring, squares up to ismay.

                                   lowe

you're a passenger. and i'm a ship's bloody officer. now do what you're
told!

                                  (more)

                               lowe (cont'd)

                              (turning away)

steady men! stand by the falls!

                                   ismay

                          (numbly, backing away)

yes, quite right. sorry.

                                                                   cut to:
