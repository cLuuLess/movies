114 int. f-deck corridors / fan room

a functional space, with access to a number of machine spaces (fan rooms,
boiler uptakes). jack and rose are leaning against a wall, laughing.

                                   jack

                                   rose

he's an ex-pinkerton. cal's father hired him to keep cal out of trouble...

lovejoy has spotted them from a cross-corridor nearby. he charges toward
them. jack and rose run around a corner into a blind alley. there is one

115 they enter a roaring ran room, with no way out but a ladder going down.
jack latches the deadbolt on the door, and lovejoy slams against it a

                                   jack

after you, m'lady.
