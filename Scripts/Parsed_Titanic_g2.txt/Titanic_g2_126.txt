186 int. master at arms office / corridor

jack is hopelessly pulling on the pipe again, straining until he turns red.
he collapses back on the bench. realizing he's screwed. then he hears her
through the door.

                                   jack

rose!! in here!

187 in the hall rose hears his voice behind her. she spins and runs back,
locating the right door, then pushes it open, creating a small wave.

she splashes over jack and puts her arms around him.

                                   rose

jack, jack, jack... i'm sorry, i'm so sorry.

they are so happy to see each other it's embarrassing.

                                   jack

that guy lovejoy put it in my pocket.

                                   rose

i know, i know.

                                   jack

see if you can find a key for these. try those drawers. it's a little brass
one.

she kisses his face and hugs him again, then starts to go through the desk.

                                   jack

so... how did you find out i didn't do it?

                                   rose

i didn't.

                            (she looks at him)

i just realized i already knew.

they share a look, then she goes back to ransacking the room, searching
drawers and cupboards. jack sees movement out the porthole and looks out.

a lifeboat hits the surface of the water, seen from below.

                                                                   cut to:
