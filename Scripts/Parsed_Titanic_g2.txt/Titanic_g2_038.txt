68 int. keldysh imaging shack

without a cut the wrinkled, weathered landscape of age has appeared around
her eyes. but the eyes themselves are the same.

                                 old rose

after all these years, feel it closing around my throat like a dog collar.

the camera pulls back to show her whole face.

                                   rose

i can still feel its weight. if you could have felt it, not just seen it...

                                  lovett

well, that's the general idea, my dear.

                                  bodine

so let me get this right. you were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the
titanic?

                               (he guffaws)

that's great!

                                  lovett

                                (warningly)

lewis...

but rose laughs with bodine.

                                  bodine

                             (still laughing)

all you had to do was wait two days!

lovett, standing out of rose's sightline, checks his watch. hours have
passed. this process is taking too long.

                                  lovett

rose, tell us more about the diamond. what did hockley do with it after
that?

                                   rose

im afraid i'm feeling a little tired, mr. lovett.

lizzy picks up the cue and starts to wheel her out.

                                  lovett

wait! can you give us something go on, here. like who had access to the
safe. what about this lovejoy guy? the valet. did he have the combination?

                                   lizzy

that's enough.

lizzy takes her out. rose's old hand reapears at the doorway in a frail
wave goodbye.

                                                                   cut to:
