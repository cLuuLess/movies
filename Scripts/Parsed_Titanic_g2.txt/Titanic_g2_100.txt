159 ext. b-deck forward / well deck

the gentlemen, now joined by another man, leans on the forward rail
watching the steerage men playing soccer with chunks of ice.

                                 gentleman

i guess it's nothing too serious. i'm going back to my cabin to read.

a 20ish yale man pops through the door wearing a topcoat over pajamas.

                                   yaley

say, did i miss the fun?

rose and jack come up the steps from the well deck, which are right next to
the three men. they stare as the couple climbs over the locked gate.

a moment later captain smith rounds the corner, followed by andrews and
carpenter hutchinson. they have come down from the bridge by the outside
stairs. the three men, their faces grim, crush right past jack and rose.
andrews barely glances at her.

                                   smith

can you shore up?

                                hutchinson

not unless the pumps get ahead.

the inspection party goes down the stairs to the well deck.

                                   jack

                               (low, to her)

it's bad.

                                   rose

we have to tell mother and cal.

                                   jack

now it's worse.

                                   rose

come with me, jack. i jump, you jump... right?

                                   jack

right.

jack follows rose through the door inside the ship.

                                                                   cut to:
