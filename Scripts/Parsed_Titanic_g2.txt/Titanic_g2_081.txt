120 int. hold #2

jack and rose enter and run laughing between the rows of stacked cargo. she
hugs herself against the cold, after the dripping heat of the boiler room.

they come upon william carter's brand new renault touring car, lashing down
to a pallet. it looks like a royal coach from a fairy tale, its brass trim
and headlamps nicely set off by its deep burgundy color.

rose climbs into the plushly upholstered back seat, acting very royal.
there are cut crystals bud vases on the walls back there, each containing a
rose. jack jumps into the driver's seat, enjoying hte feel of the leather
and wood.

                                   jack

on jack as her hands come out of the shadows and pull him over the seat
into the back. he lands next to her, and his breath seems loud in the quiet
darkness. he looks at her and she is smiling. it is the moment of truth.

                                   jack

are you nervous?

put your hands on me jack.

he kisses her, and she slides down in the seat under his welcome weight.

                                                                   cut to:
