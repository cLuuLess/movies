235 int. first class smoke room

thomas andrews stands in front of the fireplace, staring at the large
painting above the mantle. the fire is still going in the fireplace.

the room is empty except for andrews. an ashtray falls off the table.
behind him jack and rose run into the room, out of breath and soaked. they
run through, toward the aft revolving door... then rose recognizes him. she
sees that his lifebelt is off, lying on a table.

                                   rose

won't you even make a try for it, mr. andrews?

                                  andrews

                       (a tear rolls down his cheek)

i'm sorry that i didn't build you a stronger ship, young rose.

                                   jack

                                 (to her)

it's going fast... we've got to keep moving.

andrews picks up his lifebelt and hands it to her.

                                  andrews

good luck to you, rose.

                                   rose

                               (hugging him)

and to you, mr. andrews.

jack pulls her away and they run through the revolving door.

                                                                   cut to:
