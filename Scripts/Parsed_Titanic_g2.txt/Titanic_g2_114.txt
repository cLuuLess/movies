173 int. steerage berthing aft / corridors and stairwell

it is chaos, with stewards pushing their way through narrow corridors
clogged with peopel carrying suitcases, duffel bags, children. some have
lifebelts on, others don't.

                                steward #2

                              (to steward #3)

i told the stupid sods no luggage. aw, bloody hell!

he throws up his hand at the sight of a family, loaded down with cases and
bags, completely blocking the corridor.

fabrizio and tommy push past the stewards, going the other way. they rech a
huge crowd gathered at the bottom of the main 3rd class stairwell. fabrizio
spots helga with the rest of the dahl family, standing patiently with
suitcases in hand. he reaches her and she grins, hugging him.

tommy pushes to where he can see what's holding up the group. there is a
steel gate across the top of the stairs, with several stewards and seamen
on the other side.

                                  steward

stay calm, please. it's not time to go up to the boats yet.

near tommy, an irishwoman stands stoically with two small children and
their battered luggage.

                                little boy

                                   woman

boats, they'll be startin' with us, and we'll want to be all ready, won't

                                                                   cut to:
