74 int. reception room / d-deck - day

ruth is having tea with noel lucy martha dyer-edwardes, the countess of
rothes, a 35ish english blue-blood with patirician features. ruth sees
someone coming across the room and lowers her voice.

                                   ruth

oh no, that vulgar brown woman is coming this way. get up, quickly before
she sits with us.

molly brown walks up, greeting them cheerfully as they are rising.

                                   molly

hello girls, i was hoping i'd catch you at tea.

                                   ruth

we're awfully sorry you missed it. the countess and i are just off to take
the air on the boat deck.

                                   molly

that sounds great. let's go. i need to catch up on the gossip.

ruth grits her teeth as the three of them head for the grand staircase to
go up. tracking with them, as they cross the room, the shot hands off to
bruce ismay and captain smith at another table.

                                   ismay

so you've not lit the last four boilers then?

                                   smith

no, but we're making excellent time.

                                   ismay

                               (impatiently)

captain, the press knows the size of titanic, let them marvel at her speed
too. we must give them something new to print. and the maiden voyage of
titnaic must make headlines!

                                   smith

i prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.

                                   ismay

of course i leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a
glorious end to your last crossing if we get into new york tuesday night
and surprise them all.

                    (ismay slaps his hand on the table)

retire with a bang, eh, e.j?

a beat. then smith nods, stiffy.

                                                                   cut to:
