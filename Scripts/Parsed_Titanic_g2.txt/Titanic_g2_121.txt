180 int. master at arms office / corridor

jack pulls on the pipe with all his strength. it's not budging. he hears
gurgling sound. water pours under the door, spreading rapidly across the
floor.

                                   jack

shit.

he tries to pull one hand out of the cuffs, working until the skin is
raw... no good.

                                   jack

help!! somebody!! can anybody hear me?!

                               (to himself)

this could be bad.

181 the corridor outside is deserted. flooded a couple of inches deep.
jack's voice comes faintly through the door, but there is no one to hear
it.

                                                                   cut to:
