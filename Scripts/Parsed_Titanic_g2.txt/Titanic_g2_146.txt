219 ext. boat deck, port

jack, rose et al burst out onto the boat deck from the crew stairs just aft
of the third funnel. they look at the empty davits.

                                   rose

the boats are gone!

she sees colonel gracie chugging forward along the deck, escorting two
first class ladies.

                                   rose

colonel! are there any boats left?

                                  gracie

                     (staring at her bedraggled state)

yes, miss... there are still a couple of boats all the way forward. this
way, i'll lead you!

jack grabs her hand and they sprint past gracie, with tommy and fabrizio
close behind.

angle on the band... incredibly they are still playing. jack, rose and the
others run by.

                                   tommy

                                                                   cut to:
