2 ext./ int. mir one / north atlantic deep

pushing in on one of the falling submersibles, called mir one, right up to
its circular viewport to see the occupants.

inside, it is a cramped seven foot sphere, crammed with equipment. anatoly
mikailavich, the sub's pilot, sits hunched over his controls... singing
softly in russian.

next to him on one side is brock lovett. he's in his late forties, deeply
tanned, and likes to wear his nomex suit unzipped to show the gold from
famous shipwrecks covering his gray chest hair. he is a wiley, fast-talking
treasure hunter, a salvage superstar who is part historian, part adventurer
and part vacuum cleaner salesman. right now, he is propped against the co2
scrubber, fast asleep and snoring.

on the other side, crammed into the remaining space is a bearded wide-body
named lewis bodine, sho is also asleep. lewis is an r.o.v. (remotely
operated vehicle) pilot and is the resident titanic expert.

anatoly glances at the bottom sonar and makes a ballast adjustment.
