303 int. imaging shack / keldysh

old rose sits with the group in the imaging shack, lit by the blue glow of
the screens. she holds the haircomb with the jade butterfly on the handle
in her gnarled hands.

we never found anything on jack. there's no record of him at all.

no, there wouldn't be, would there? and i've never spoken of him until now,
not to anyone.

not even your grandfather. a woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets. but
now you all know there was a man named jack dawson, and that he saved me,
in every way that a person can be saved.

                            (closing her eyes)

i don't even have a picture of him. he exists now only in my memory.
