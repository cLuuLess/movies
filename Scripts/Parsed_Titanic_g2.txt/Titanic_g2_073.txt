109 ext. atlantic - night

titanic glides across an unnatural sea, blakc and calm as a pool of oil.
the ships lights are mirrored almost perfectly in the black water. the sky
is brilliant with stars. a meteor traces a bright line across the heavens.

110 on the bridge, captain smith peers out at the blackness ahead of the
ship. quartermaster hitchins brings him a cup of hot tea with lemon. it
steams in the bitter cold of the open bridge. second officer lightoller is
next to him, staring out at the sheet of black glass the atlantic has
become.

                                lightoller

i don't think i've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.

                                   smith

yes, like a mill pond. not a breath of wind.

                                lightoller

it's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.

                                   smith

mmmmm. well, i'm off. maintain speed and heading, mr. lightoller.

                                lightoller

yes sir.

                                   smith

and wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree
doubtful.

                                                                   cut to:
