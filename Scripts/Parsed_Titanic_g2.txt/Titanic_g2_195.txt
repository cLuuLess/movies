309 int. rose's cabin / keldysh

a graceful pan across rose's shelf of carefully arranged pictures:

rose as a young actress in california, radiant... a theatrically lit studio
publicity shot... rose and her husband, with their two children... rose
with her son at his college graduation... rose with her children and
grandchildren at her 70th birthday. a collage of images of a life lived
well.

the pan stops on an image filling frame. rose, circa 1920. she is at the
beach, sitting on a horse at the surfline. the santa monica pier, with its
rollercoaster is behind her. she is grinning, full of life.

we pan off the last picture to rose herself, warm in her bunk. a profile
shot. she is very still. she could be sleeping, or maybe something else.

                                                                   cut to:

blackness

310 the wreck of titanic looms like a ghost out of the dark. it is lit by a
kind of moonlight, a light of the mind. we pass over the endless forecastle
deck to the superstructure, moving faster than subs can move... almost like
we are flying.

we go inside, and the echoing sound of distant waltz music is heard. the
rust fades away from the walls of the dark corridor and it is
transformed... we emerge onto the grand staircase, lit by glowing
chandelier. the music is vibrant now, and the room is populated by men in
tie and tails, women in gowns. it is exquisitely beautiful.

in pov we sweep down the staircase. the crowd of beautiful gentlmen and
ladies turn as we descend toward them. at the bottom a man stands with his
back to us... he turns and it is jack. smiling he holds his hand out toward
us.

in a side angle rose goes into his arms, a girl of 17. the passengers,
officers and crew of the rms titanic smile and applaud in the utter silence
of the abyss.
