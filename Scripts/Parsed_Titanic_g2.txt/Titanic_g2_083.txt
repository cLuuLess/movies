122 int. / ext. wireless shak / freighter californian

wireless operater cyril evans pulls his earphone off his ear as the
titanic's spark deafens him. he translates the message for third officer
groves.

                                   evans

stupid bastard. i try to warn him about the ice, and he says "keep out.
shut up. i'm working cape race."

                                  groves

now what's he sending?

                                   evans

"no seasickness. poker business good. al". well that's it for me. i'm
shutting down.

as evans wearily switches off his generator, groves goes out on deck. pan
off him to reveal the ship is stopped fifty yards from the edge of a field
of pack ice and icebergs stretching as far as the eye can see.

                                                                   cut to:
