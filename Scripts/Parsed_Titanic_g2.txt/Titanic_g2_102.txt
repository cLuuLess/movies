161 int. rose and cal's suite

cal and ruth wait in the sitting room, along with the master at arms and
two stewards (steward #1 and barnes). silence as rose and jack enter. ruth
closes her robe at her throat when she sees jack.

                                   rose

something serious has happened.

                                    cal

that's right. two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. now that
one is back...

                       (he looks from rose to jack)

... i have a pretty good idea where to fine the other.

                            (to master at arms)

search him.

the master at arms steps up to jack.

                              master at arms

coat off, mate.

lovejoy pulls at jack's coat and jack shakes his head in dismay, shrugging
out of it. the master at arms pats him down.

                                   jack

this is horseshit.

                                   rose

cal, you can't be serious! we're in the middle of an emergency and you--

steward barnes pulls the heart of the ocean out of the pocket of jack's
coat.

                              steward barnes

is this it?

rose is stunned. needless to say, so is jack.

                                    cal

that's it.

                              master at arms

right then. now don't make a fuss.

he starts to handcuff jack.

                                   jack

don't you believe it, rose. don't!

                                   rose

                                (uncertain)

he couldn't have.

                                    cal

of course he could. easy enough for a professional. he memorized the
combination when you opend the safe.

flashback: rose at the safe, looking in the mirror and meeting jack's eyes
as he stands behind her, watching.

                                   rose

but i was with him the whole time.

                                    cal

                        (just to her, low and cold)

maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.

                                   jack

they put it in my pocket!

                                  lovejoy

                           (holding jack's coat)

it's not even your pocket, son.

                                 (reading)

"property of a. l. ryerson".

lovejoy shows the coat to the master at arms. there is a label inside the
collar with the owner's name.

                              master at arms

that was reported stolen today.

                                   jack

i was going to return it! rose--

rose feels utterly betrayed, hurt and confused. she shrinks away from him.
he starts shouting to her as lovejoy and the master at arms drag him out
into the hall. she can't look him in the eye.

                                   jack

rose, don't listen to them... i didn't do this! you know i didn't! you know
it!

she is devastated. her mother lays a comforting hand on her shoulder as te
tears well up.

                                   ruth

why do women believe men?

                                                                   cut to:
