220 ext. boat deck, starboard, forward

water pours like a spillway over the forward railing on b-deck. camera
sweeps up past a-deck to the boat deck where murdoch and his team are
loading collapsible car the forward-most davits.

note: there are four so-called collapsibles, or engelhardts boats,
including two which are stored on the roof of the officer's quarters.

the crowd is sparse, with most people still aft. cal slips his hand out of
hte pocket of his overcoat and into the waist pocket of murdoch's
greatcoat, leaving the stacks of bills there.

                                    cal

so we have an understanding then?

                                  murdoch

                             (nodding curtly)

as you've said.

cal, satisfied, steps back. he finds himself waiting next to j. bruce
ismay. ismay does not meet his eyes, nor anyone's. lovejoy come sup to cal
at that moment.

                                  lovejoy

i've found her. she's just over on the port side. with him.

                                  murdoch

women and children? any more women and children?

                             (glancing at cal)

any one else, then?

cal looks longingly at his boat... his moment has arrived.

                                    cal

god damn it to hell! come on.

he and lovejoy head for the port side, taking a short-cut through the
bridge.

bruce ismay, seeing his oppurtunity, steps quickly into collapsible c. he
stares straight ahead, not meeting murdoch's eyes.

                                  murdoch

                            (staring at ismay)

take them down.

                                                                   cut to:
