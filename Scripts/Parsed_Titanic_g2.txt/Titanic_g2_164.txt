251 ext. a-deck / b-deck / well deck, aft

jack and rose clamber over the a-deck aft rail. then, using all his
strength, he lowers her toward the deck below, holding on with one hand.
she dangles, then falls. jack jumps down behind her.

they join a crush of people literally clawing and scrambling over each
other to get down the narrow stairs to the well deck... the only way aft.

seeing that the stairs are impossible, jack climbs over the b-deck railing
and helps rose over. he lowers her again, and she falls in a heap. baker
joughin, now three sheets to the wind, happens to be next to her. he hauls
rose to her feet. jack drops down and the three of them push through the
crowd across the well deck. near them, at the rail, people are jumping into
the water.

the ship groans and shudders. the man ahead of jack is walking like a
zombie.

                                   jack
