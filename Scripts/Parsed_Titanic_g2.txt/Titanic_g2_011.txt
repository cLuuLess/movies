21 ext. keldysh - day

brock and bodine are watching mir 2 being sweng over the side to start a
dive.

                                  bodine

she's a goddamned liar! a nutcase. like that... what's her name? that
anastasia babe.

                                   buell

they're inbound.

brock nods and the three of them head forward to meet the approaching helo.

                                  bodine

she says she's rose dewitt bukater, right? rose dewitt bukater died on the
titanic. at the age of 17. if she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.

                                  lovett

a hundred and one next month.

                                  bodine

okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. i traced her as far back as the
20's... she was working as an actress in l.a. an actress. her name was rose
dawson. then she married a guy named calvert, moved to cedar rapids, had
two kids. now calvert's dead, and from what i've heard cedar rapids is
dead.

the sea stallion approaches the ship, bg, forcing brock to yell over the
rotors.

                                  lovett

and everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead... or on
this ship. but she knows about it. and i want to hear what she has to say.
got it?
