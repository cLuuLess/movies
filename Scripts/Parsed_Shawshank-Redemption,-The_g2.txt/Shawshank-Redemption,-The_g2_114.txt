				heywood 
		couldn't play somethin' good, huh? 
		hank williams? 

				andy 
		they broke the door down before i 
		could take requests. 

				floyd 
		was it worth two weeks in the hole? 

				andy 
		easiest time i ever did. 

				heywood 
		shit. no such thing as easy time in 
		the hole. a week seems like a year. 

				andy 
		i had mr. mozart to keep me company. 
		hardly felt the time at all. 

				red 
		oh, they let you tote that record 
		player down there, huh? i could'a 
		swore they confiscated that stuff. 

				andy 
			(taps his heart, his head) 
		the music was here...and here. 
		that's the one thing they can't 
		confiscate, not ever. that's the 
		beauty of it. haven't you ever felt 
		that way about music, red? 

				red 
		played a mean harmonica as a younger 
		man. lost my taste for it. didn't 
		make much sense on the inside. 

				andy 
		here's where it makes most sense. 
		we need it so we don't forget. 

				red 
		forget? 

				andy 
		that there are things in this world 
		not carved out of gray stone. that 
		there's a small place inside of us 
		they can never lock away, and that 
		place is called hope. 

				red 
		hope is a dangerous thing. drive a 
		man insane. it's got no place here. 
		better get used to the idea. 

				andy 
			(softly) 
		like brooks did? 

	fade to black 

151 	an iron-barred door 151

	slides open with an enormous clang. a stark room beyond. 
	camera pushes through. seven humorless men sit at a long 

	table. an empty chair faces them. we are again in:
