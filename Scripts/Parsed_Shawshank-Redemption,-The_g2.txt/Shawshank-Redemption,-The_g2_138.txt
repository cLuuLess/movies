	tommy regales the old boys with his exploits: 

				tommy 
		...so i'm backin' out the door, 
		right? had the tv like this... 
			(mimes his grip) 
		big ol' thing. couldn't see shit. 
		suddenly, here's this voice: 
		freeze kid! hands in the air! 
		well i just stand there holdin' on 
		to that tv, so the voice says: "you 
		hear what i said, boy?" and i say, 
		yes sir, i sure did! but if i drop
		this fuckin' thing, you got me on 
		destruction of property too!

	the whole table falls about laughing.
