	we find andy giving an impassioned reading: 

				andy 
		...and the lamplight o'er him
		streaming throws his shadow on the
		floor...and my soul from out that
		shadow that lies floating on the
		floor, shall be lifted nevermore! "

	andy slaps the book shut, immensely pleased with himself.

				tommy 
		so this raven just sits there and 
		won't go away? 

				andy 
		that's right. 

				tommy 
			(beat) 
		why don't that fella get hisself a 
		12-gauge and dust the fucker?
