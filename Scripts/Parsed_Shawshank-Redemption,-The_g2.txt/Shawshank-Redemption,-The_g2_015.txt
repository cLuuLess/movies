17	int -- cellblock five -- night (1947) 17

	three tiers to a side, concrete and steel, gray and imposing. 
	andy and the others are marched in, still naked, carrying 
	their clothes and bibles. the cons in their cells greet them 
	with taunts, jeers, and laughter. one by one, the new men are 
	shown to their cells and locked in with a clang of steel. 

				red (v.o.) 
		the first night's the toughest, no 
		doubt about it. they march you in 
		naked as the day you're born, fresh 
		from a bible reading, skin burning 
		and half-blind from that delousing 
		shit they throw on you... 

	red watches from his cell, arms slung over the crossbars, 
	cigarette dangling from his fingers. 

				red (v.o.) 
		...and when they put you in that 
		cell, when those bars slam home, 
		that's when you know it's for real. 
		old life blown away in the blink of 
		an eye...a long cold season in hell 
		stretching out ahead...nothing 
		left but all the time in the world 
		to think about it. 

	red listens to the clanging below. he watches andy and a few 
	others being brought up to the 2nd tier. 

				red (v.o.) 
		most new fish come close to madness 
		the first night. somebody always 
		breaks down crying. happens every 
		time. the only question is, who's 
		it gonna be? 

	andy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier. 

				red (v.o.) 
		it's as good a thing to bet on as 
		any, i guess. i had my money on 
		andy dufresne...
