	red finds andy sitting in the shadow of the high stone wall, 
	poking listlessly through the dust for small pebbles. red 
	waits for some acknowledgment. andy doesn't even look up. 
	red hunkers down and joins him. nothing is said for the 
	longest time. and then, softly: 

				andy 
		my wife used to say i'm a hard man 
		to know. like a closed book. 
		complained about it all the time. 
			(pause) 
		she was beautiful. i loved her. but 
		i guess i couldn't show it enough. 
			(softly) 
		i killed her, red. 

	andy finally glances to red, seeking a reaction. silence. 

				andy 
		i didn't pull the trigger. but i 
		drove her away. that's why she 
		died. because of me, the way i am. 

				red 
		that don't make you a murderer. bad 
		husband, maybe. 

	andy smiles faintly in spite of himself. red gives his 

	shoulder a squeeze. 

				red 
		feel bad about it if you want. but 
		you didn't pull the trigger. 

				andy 
		no. i didn't. someone else did, and 
		i wound up here. bad luck, i guess. 

				red 
		bad luck? jesus. 

				andy 
		it floats around. has to land on 
		somebody. say a storm comes 
		through. some folks sit in their 
		living rooms and enjoy the rain. 
		the house next door gets torn out 
		of the ground and smashed flat. it 
		was my turn, that's all. i was in 
		the path of the tornado. 
			(softly) 
		i just had no idea the storm would 
		go on as long as it has. 
			(glances to him) 
		think you'll ever get out of here? 

				red 
		sure. when i got a long white beard 
		and about three marbles left 
		rolling around upstairs. 

				andy 
		tell you where i'd go. zihuatanejo.

				red 
		zihuatanejo? 

				andy 
		mexico. little place right on the 
		pacific. you know what the mexicans 
		say about the pacific? they say it 
		has no memory. that's where i'd 
		like to finish out my life, red. a 
		warm place with no memory. open a 
		little hotel right on the beach. 
		buy some worthless old boat and fix 
		it up like new. take my guests out 
		charter fishing. 
			(beat) 
		you know, a place like that, i'd 
		need a man who can get things. 

	red stares at andy, laughs. 

				red 
		jesus, andy. i couldn't hack it on 
		the outside. been in here too long. 
		i'm an institutional man now. like 
		old brooks hatlen was. 

				andy 
		you underestimate yourself. 

	-

				red 
		bullshit. in here i'm the guy who 
		can get it for you. out there, all 
		you need are yellow pages. i 
		wouldn't know where to begin. 
			(derisive snort) 
		pacific ocean? hell. like to scare 
		me to death, somethin' that big. 

				andy 
		not me. i didn't shoot my wife and 
		i didn't shoot her lover, and 
		whatever mistakes i made i've paid 
		for and then some. that hotel and 
		that boat...i don't think it's too 
		much to want. to look at the stars 
		just after sunset. touch the sand. 
		wade in the water. feel free. 

				red 
		goddamn it, andy, stop! don't do 
		that to yourself! talking shitty 
		pipedreams! mexico's down there, 
		and you're in here, and that's the 
		way it is! 

				andy 
		you're right. it's down there, and 
		i'm in here. i guess it comes down 
		to a simple choice, really. get 
		busy living or get busy dying. 

	red snaps a look. what the hell does that mean? andy rises and
	walks away. red lunges to his feet. 

				red 
		andy? 

				andy 
			(turns back) 
		red, if you ever get out of here, 
		do me a favor. there's this big 
		hayfield up near buxton. you know 
		where buxton is? 

				red 
			(nods) 
		lots of hayfields there. 

				andy 
		one in particular. got a long rock 
		wall with a big oak at the north 
		end. like something out of a robert 
		frost poem. it's where i asked my 
			(more) 



				andy (cont.) 
		wife to marry me. we'd gone for a 
		picnic. we made love under that 
		tree. i asked and she said yes. 
			(beat) 
		promise me, red. if you ever get 
		out, find that spot. in the base of 
		that wall you'll find a rock that 
		has no earthly business in a maine 
		hayfield. a piece of black volcanic 
		glass. you'll find something buried 
		under it i want you to have. 

				red 
		what? what's buried there? 

				andy 
		you'll just have to pry up that 
		rock and see. 

	andy turns and walks away.
