10	ext -- exercise yard -- shawshank prison -- dusk (1947) 10

	high stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire, set off at
	intervals by looming guard towers. over a hundred cons are 
	in the yard. playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each 
	other, making deals. exercise period. 



	red emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the 
	activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing 
	minor business. he's an important man here. 

				red (v.o.) 
		there's a con like me in every prison 
		in america, i guess. i'm the guy who 
		can get it for you. cigarettes, a 
		bag of reefer if you're partial, a 
		bottle of brandy to celebrate your 
		kid's high school graduation. damn 
		near anything, within reason. 

	he slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleight-of-hand.

				red (v.o.) 
		yes sir, i'm a regular sears & 
		roebuck. 

	two short siren blasts issue from the main tower, drawing 
	everybody's attention to the loading dock. the outer gate 
	swings open...revealing a gray prison bus outside. 

				red (v.o.) 
		so when andy dufresne came to me in 
		1949 and asked me to smuggle rita 
		hayworth into the prison for him, i 
		told him no problem. and it wasn't. 

				con 
		fresh fish! fresh fish today! 

	red is joined by heywood, skeet, floyd, jigger, ernie, snooze. 
	most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but red and his 
	group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably.
