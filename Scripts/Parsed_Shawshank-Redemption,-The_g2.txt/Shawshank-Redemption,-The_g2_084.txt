108	ext -- shawshank prison -- main gate -- day (1954) 108

	two short siren blasts herald the opening of the gate. it 
	swings hugely open, revealing brooks standing in his cheap 
	suit, carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat. 

	brooks walks out, tears streaming down his face. he looks 
	back. red, andy, and others stand at the inner fence, seeing 
	him off. the massive gate closes, wiping them from view.
