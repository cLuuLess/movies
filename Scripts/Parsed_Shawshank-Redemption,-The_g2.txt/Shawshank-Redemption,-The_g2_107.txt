	cons all over the prison stop whatever they're doing, freezing 
	in mid-step to listen, gazing up at the speakers. 

137 	the stamping machines in the plate shop are shut down... 137 

138 	the laundry line goes silent, grinding to a halt... 138

139 	the wood shop machines are turned off, buzzing to a stop... 139

140 	the motor pool...the kitchen...the loading dock...the exercise 140
	thru yard...the numbing routine of prison life itself...all grinds thru
143 	to a stuttering halt. nobody moves, nobody speaks. everybody 143

	just stands in place, listening to the music, hypnotized.
