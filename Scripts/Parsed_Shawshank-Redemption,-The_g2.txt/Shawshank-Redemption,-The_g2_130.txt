	tilt up from pie to find red munching away as he helps andy 
	sort books on the shelves. 

				red 
		got his fingers in a lot of pies, 
		from what i hear. 

				andy 
		what you hear isn't half of it. 
		he's got scams you haven't dreamed 
		of. kickbacks on his kickbacks. 
		there's a river of dirty money 
		flowing through this place. 

				red 
		money like that can be a problem. 
		sooner or later you gotta explain 
		where it came from. 

				andy 
		that's where i come in. i channel 
		it, funnel it, filter it...stocks, 
		securities, tax free municipals... 
		i send that money out into the big 
		world. and when it comes back... 

				red 
		it's clean as a virgin's whistle? 

				andy 
		cleaner. by the time norton retires, 
		i will have made him a millionaire. 

				red 
		jesus. they ever catch on, he's 
		gonna wind up wearing a number 
		himself. 

				andy 
			(smiles) 
		i thought you had more faith in me 
		than that. 

				red 
		i'm sure you're good, but all that 
		paper leaves a trail. anybody gets 
		too curious -- fbi, irs, whatever -- 
		that trail's gonna lead to somebody. 

				andy 
		sure it will. but not to me, and 
		certainly not to the warden. 

				red 
		who then? 

				andy 
		peter stevens. 

				red 
		who? 

				andy 
		the silent, silent partner. he's 
		the guilty one, your honor. the man 
		with the bank accounts. that's 
		where the filtering process starts. 
		they trace it back, all they're 
		gonna find is him. 

				red 
		yeah, okay, but who the hell is he?

				andy 
		a phantom. an apparition. second 
		cousin to harvey the rabbit. 
			(off red's look) 
		i conjured him out of thin air. he 
		doesn't exist...except on paper. 

				red 
		you can't just make a person up. 

				andy 
		sure you can, if you know how the 
		system works, and where the cracks 
		are. it's amazing what you can 
		accomplish by mail. mr. stevens has 
		a birth certificate, social 
		security card, driver's license. 
		they ever track those accounts, 
		they'll wind up chasing a figment 
		of my imagination. 

				red 
		jesus. did i say you were good? 
		you're rembrandt. 

				andy 
		it's funny. on the outside, i was 
		an honest man. straight as an 
		arrow. i had to come to prison to 
		be a crook.
