296	ext -- traveling shot -- day (1967) 296

	a gorgeous new england landscape whizzes by, fields and trees 
	a blur of motion. angle shifts to reveal a greyhound sceni- 
	cruiser barreling up the road, pulling abreast of us. camera 
	travels from window to window, passing faces. we finally come 
	to red gazing out at the passing landscape. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i find i am so excited i can barely 
		sit still or hold a thought in my 
		head. i think it is the excitement 
		only a free man can feel, a free 
		man at the start of a long journey 
		whose conclusion is uncertain... 
		297 the bus 297

	roars past camera, dwindling to a mere speck on the horizon. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i hope i can make it across the 
		border. i hope to see my friend 
		and shake his hand. i hope the 
		pacific is as blue as it has been 
		in my dreams. 
			(beat) 
		i hope.
