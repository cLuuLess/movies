29	int -- cellblock -- night (1947) 29

	the place goes nuts. fat-ass throws himself screaming against
	the bars. the entire block starts chanting: 

				voices 
		fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh 
		fish...fresh fish... 

				fat-ass 
		i wanna go home! i want my mother.' 

				voice (o.s.) 
		i had your mother! she wasn't that 
		great! 

	the lights bump on. guards pour in, led by hadley himself.

				hadley 
		what the christ is this happy shit? 

				voice (o.s.) 
		he took the lord's name in vain! 
		i'm tellin' the warden! 

				hadley 
			(to the unseen wit) 
		you'll be tellin' him with my baton 
		up your ass! 

	hadley arrives at fat-ass' cell, bellowing through the bars:

				hadley 
		what's your malfunction you fat 
		fuckin' barrel of monkey-spunk? 

				fat-ass 
		please! this ain't right! i ain't 
		supposed to be here! not me! 

				hadley 
		i ain't gonna count to three! not 
		even to one! now shut the fuck up 
		'fore i sing you a lullabye! 

	fat-ass keeps blubbering and wailing. total freak-out. hadley 
	draws his baton, gestures to his men. open it. 

	a guard unlocks the cell. hadley pulls fat-ass out and starts 
	beating him with the baton, brutally raining blows. fat-ass 
	falls, tries to crawl. 

	the place goes dead silent. all we hear now is the dull
	thwack-thwack-thwack of the baton. fat-ass passes out. hadley
	gets in a few more licks and finally stops. 

				hadley 
		get this tub of shit down to the 
		infirmary. 
			(peers around) 
		if i hear so much as a mouse fart 
		in here the rest of the night, by 
		god and sonny jesus, you'll all 
		visit the infirmary. every last 
		motherfucker here. 

	the guards wrestle fat-ass onto a stretcher and carry him off. 
	footsteps echo away. lights off. darkness again. silence.
