	norton pockets the envelopes. andy crosses to the wall safe 
	and shoves the ledger and sundry files inside. norton locks 
	the safe, swings his wife's framed sampler back into place. he 
	cocks his thumb at some laundry and two suits in the corner. 

				norton

		suits for dry-clean and a bag of 
		whatnot. tell 'em if they over- 
		starch my shirts again, they're 
		gonna hear about it from me.
