215	int -- cellblock five -- morning (1966) 215

	ka-thump! the master lock is thrown. the cons emerge from 
	their cells and the headcount begins. red looks back to see if 
	andy's in line. he's not. suddenly the count stalls: 

				guard 
		man missing on tier two! cell 12! 

	the head bull, haig, checks his list: 

				haig 
		dufresne? get your ass out here, 
		boy! you're holding up the show! 
			(no answer) 
		don't make me come down there now! 
		i'll thump your skull for you! 

	still no answer. glaring, haig stalks down the tier, clipboard 
	in hand. his men fall in behind. 

				haig 
		dufresne, dammit, you're putting me 
		behind! you better be sick or dead 
		in there, i shit you not! 

	they arrive at bars. their faces go slack. stunned. softly: 

				haig 

	oh my holy god. 

216 	reverse angle 216

	reveals the cell is empty. everything neat and tidy. even the 
	bunk is stowed. they wrench the door open and rush in, tossing 
	the cell in a panic as if andy might be lurking under the 
	kleenex or the toothpaste. camera rockets in on haig as he 
	spins toward us, bellowing at the top of his lungs: 

				haig 
		what the fuck!
