246	int -- andy's cell -- night (1966) 246

	the lights go out. andy places the last chess piece. gazes up 
	at racquel. smiles. pulls the rope from under his pillow. 
	he stands and unbuttons his prison shirt, revealing norton's 
	gray pinstripe suit underneath. a flash of lightning floods the 
	cell, throwing wild shadows.
