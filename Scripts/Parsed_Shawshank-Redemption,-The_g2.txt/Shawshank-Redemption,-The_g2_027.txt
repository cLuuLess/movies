32	int -- mess hall -- morning (1947) 32

	andy goes through the breakfast line, gets a scoop of glop on
	his tray. we pan andy through the noise and confusion...and 
	discover bogs diamond and rooster macbride watching andy go 
	by. bogs sizes andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye, 
	mutters something to rooster. rooster laughs. 

	andy finds a table occupied by red and his regulars, chooses
	a spot at the end where nobody is sitting. ignoring their 
	stares, he picks up his spoon -- and pauses, seeing something
	in his food. he carefully fishes it out with his fingers. 

	it's a squirming maggot. andy grimaces, unsure what to do with
	it. brooks hatlen is sitting closest to andy. at age 65, he's
	a senior citizen, a long-standing resident. 

				brooks 
		you gonna eat that? 

				andy 
		hadn't planned on it. 

				brooks 
		you mind? 

	andy passes the maggot to brooks. brooks examines it, rolling
	it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine 
	cigar. andy is riveted with apprehension. 

				brooks 
		mmm. nice and ripe. 

	andy can't bear to watch. brooks opens up his sweater and 
	feeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket.
	andy breathes a sigh of relief. 

				brooks 
		jake says thanks. fell out of his 
		nest over by the plate shop. i'm 
		lookin' after him till he's old 
		enough to fly. 

	andy nods, proceeds to eat. carefully. heywood approaches.

				jigger 
		oh, christ, here he comes. 

				heywood 
		mornin', boys. it's a fine mornin'. 
		you know why it's fine? 

	heywood plops his tray down, sits. the men start pulling out
	cigarettes and handing them down. 

				heywood 
		that's right, send 'em all down. i 
		wanna see 'em lined up in a row, 
		pretty as a chorus line. 

	an impressive pile forms. heywood bends down and inhales
	deeply, smelling the aroma. rapture. 

				floyd 
		smell my ass... 

				heywood 
		gee, red. terrible shame, your 
		horse comin' in last and all. 
		hell, i sure do love that horse of 
		mine. i believe i owe that boy a 
		big sloppy kiss when i see him. 

				red 
		give him some'a your cigarettes 
		instead, cheap bastard. 

				heywood 
		say tyrell, you pull infirmary duty 
		this week? how's that winnin' horse 
		of mine, anyway? 

				tyrell 
		dead. 
			(the men fall silent) 
		hadley busted his head pretty good. 
		doc already went home for the 
		night. poor bastard lay there till 
		this morning. by then... 

	he shakes his head, turns back to his food. the silence
	mounts. heywood glances around. men resume eating. softly:

				andy 
		what was his name? 

				heywood 
		what? what'd you say? 

				andy 
		i was wondering if anyone knew his 
		name. 

				heywood 
		what the fuck you care, new fish? 
			(resumes eating) 
		doesn't matter what his fuckin' 
		name was. he's dead.
