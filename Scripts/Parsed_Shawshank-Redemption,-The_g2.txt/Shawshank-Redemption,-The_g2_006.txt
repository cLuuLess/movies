6	int -- courtroom -- day (1946) 6

	the d.a. holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation:

				d.a. 
		ladies and gentlemen, you've heard 
		all the evidence, you know all the 
		facts. we have the accused at the 
		scene of the crime. we have foot 
		prints. tire tracks. bullets 
		scattered on the ground which bear 
		his fingerprints. a broken bourbon 
		bottle, likewise with fingerprints. 
		most of all, we have a beautiful 
		young woman and her lover lying 
		dead in each other's arms. they had 
		sinned. but was their crime so 
		great as to merit a death sentence? 

	he gestures to andy sitting quietly with his attorney. 

				d.a. 
		i suspect mr. dufresne's answer to 
		that would be yes. i further 
		suspect he carried out that 
		sentence on the night of september 
		21st, this year of our lord, 1946, 
		by pumping four bullets into his 
		wife and another four into glenn 
		quentin. and while you think about 
		that, think about this... 

	he picks up a revolver, spins the cylinder before their eyes 
	like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune. 

				d.a. 
		a revolver holds six bullets, not 
		eight. i submit to you this was not 
		a hot-blooded crime of passion! 
		that could at least be understood, 
		if not condoned. no, this was 
		revenge of a much more brutal and 
		cold-blooded nature. consider! four 
		bullets per victim! not six shots 
		fired, but eight! that means he 
		fired the gun empty...and then 
		stopped to reload so he could shoot 
		each of them again! an extra bullet 
		per lover...right in the head. 
			(a few jurors shiver) 
		i'm done talking. you people are 
		all decent, god-fearing christian 
		folk. you know what to do.
