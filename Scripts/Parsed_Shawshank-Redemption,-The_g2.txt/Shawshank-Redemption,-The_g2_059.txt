	a huge detergent box is filled with rocks, hidden in the 
	shadows behind a boiler furnace. 

				red (v.o.) 
		...and by the week andy was due 
		back, we had enough rocks saved up 
		to keep him busy till rapture. 

	angle shifts to red as he plops a bag of "laundry" on the 
	floor. leonard and bob toss a few more down. red starts 
	pulling out contraband, giving them their commissions. 

				red (v.o.) 
		also got a big shipment in that 
		week. cigarettes, chewing gum, 
		shoelaces, playing cards with naked 
		ladies on 'em, you name it... 
			(pulls a cardboard tube) 
		...and, of course, the most 
		important item.
