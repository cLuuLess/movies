119	int -- brooks' room -- shortly later (1954) 119

	brooks is dressed in his suit. he finishes knotting his tie, 
	puts his hat on his head. the letter lies on the desk, stampe3 
	and ready for mailing. his bag is by the door. 

				brooks (v.o.) 
		i don't like it here. i'm tired of 
		being afraid all the time. i've 
		decided not to stay. 

	he takes one last look around. only one thing left to do. he 
	steps to a wooden chair in the center of the room, pulls out s 
	pocketknife, and glances up at the ceiling beam. 

	he steps up onto the chair. it wobbles queasily. now facing
	the beam, he carves a message into the wood: "brooks hatlen
	was here." he smiles with a sort of inner peace. 

				brooks (v.o.) 
		i doubt they'll kick up any fuss. 
		not for an old crook like me. 

120 	tight on chair 120

	his weight shifts on the wobbly chair -- and it goes out 
	from under him. his feet remain where they are, kicking feebly 
	in mid-air. his hat falls to the floor. 

	angle widens. brooks has hanged himself. he swings gently, 
	facing the open window. traffic noise floats up from below.
