259	ext -- prison -- day (1966) 259

	police cruisers everywhere. a media circus. reporters jostle
	for position. a colorless district attorney steps forward into
	closeup, flanked by a contingent of s.ate troopers. 

				d.a. 
		byron hadley? 

	angle shifts to reveal captain hadley. staring. waiting. 

				d.a. 
		you have the right to remain 
		silent. if you give up that 
		right, anything you say will be 
		used against you in court... 

	troopers move in, cuffing hadley's hands behind his back. the
	d.a. drones on. flashbulbs pop. hadley says nothing. his face
	scrunches up. he begins to cry. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i wasn't there to see it, but i hear 
		byron hadley was sobbing like a 
		little girl when they took him away. 

	hadley sobs all the way to the car. the d.a. snaps a gaze up
	toward norton's window, motions his men to follow.
