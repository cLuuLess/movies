	angle looking straight down. below us, tommy williams lies 
	facedown at norton's feet. blood is spreading, fanning out oa 
	the pavement. norton turns, strolls out of frame. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i guess after tommy was killed, 
		andy decided he'd been here just 
		about long enough. 

	again we see: andy working. norton pokes his head in. 

				norton 
		lickety-split. i wanna get home. 

				andy 
		just about done, sir. 

	norton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial, his back 
	turned. this time, though, we stay on andy: 

	he pulls up his sweater, yanks out a large black book and a 
	stack of files, lays them on the desk. he then grabs the real 
	ledger and files, jams them down his pants and smoothes his 
	sweater down. he picks up the bogus stack, crosses to norton, 
	and shoves everything in.
