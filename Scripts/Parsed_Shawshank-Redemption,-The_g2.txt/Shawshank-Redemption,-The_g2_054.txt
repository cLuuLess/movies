65	int -- auditorium corridor -- night (1949) 65

	andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. two dark 
	figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. rooster and 
	pete. andy turns back -- and runs right into bogs. instant 
	bear hug. the sisters are on him like a flash. they kick a 
	door open and drag him into -- 

66 	the projection booth 66

	-- where they confront the startled projectionist, an old con
	blinking at them through thick bifocals. 

				bogs 
		take a walk. 

				projectionist 
		i have to change reels. 

				bogs 
		i said fuck off. 

	terrified, the old man darts past and out the door. pete slams 
	and locks it. bogs shoves andy to the center of the room. 

				bogs 
		ain't you gonna scream? 

	andy sighs, cocks his head at the projector. 

				andy 
		they'd never hear me over that. 
		let's get this over with. 

	seemingly resigned, andy turns around, leans on the rewind 
	bench -- and curls his fingers around a full 1.000 foot reel
	of 35mm film. rooster licks his lips, pushes past the others.

				rooster 
		me first. 

				andy 
		okay. 

	andy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc, smashing
	it into rooster's face and bouncing him off the wall. 

				rooster 
		fuck! shit! he broke my nose! 

	andy fights like hell, but is soon overpowered and forced to his
	knees. bogs steps to andy, pulls out an awl with a vicious 
	eight-inch spike, gives him a good long look at it. 

				bogs 
		now i'm gonna open my fly, and 
		you're gonna swallow what i give 
		you to swallow. and when you 
		d mine, you gonna swallow 
		rooster's. you done broke his nose, 
		so he ought to have somethin' to 
		show for it. 

				andy 
		anything you put in my mouth, 
		you're going to lose. 

				bogs 
		you don't understand. you do that, 
		i'll put all eight inches of this 
		steel ii your ear. 

				andy 
		okay. but you should know that 
		sudden serious brain injury causes 
		the victim to bite down. hard. 
			(faint smile) 
		in fact, i understand the bite-reflex 
		is so strong the victim's jaws have 
		to be pried open with a crowbar. 

	the sisters consider this carefully. the film runs out of the 
	projector, flapping on the reel. the screen goes white. 

				bogs 
		you little fuck. 

	andy gets a bootheel in the face. the sisters start kicking 
	and beating the living shit out of him with anything they can 
	get their hands on. in the theater, the convicts are chanting 
	and clapping for the movie to come back on. 

				red (v.o.) 
		bogs didn't put anything in andy's 
		mouth, and neither did his friends. 
		what they did do is beat him within 
		an inch of his life...
