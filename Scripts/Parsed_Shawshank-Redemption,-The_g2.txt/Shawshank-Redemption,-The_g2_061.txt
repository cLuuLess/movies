82	int -- andy's cell -- night (1949) 82

	andy finds the cardboard tube lying on his bunk. 

				guard (o.s.) 
		lights out! 

	the lights go off. andy opens the tube and pulls out a large 
	rolled poster. he lets it uncurl to the floor. a small scrap 
	of paper flutters out, landing at his feet. the poster is the
	famous rita hayworth pin-up -- one hand behind her head, eyes
	half closed, sulky lips parted. andy picks up the scrap of 
	paper. it reads: "no charge. welcome back." alone in the dark,
	andy smiles.
