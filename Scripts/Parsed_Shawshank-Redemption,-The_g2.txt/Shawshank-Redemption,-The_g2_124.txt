	flashbulbs pop as norton addresses members of the press: 

				red (v.o.) 
		that was also the year warden norton 
		instituted his famous "inside-out" 
		program. you may remember reading 
		about it. it made all the papers 
		and got his picture in life magazine. 

				norton 
		...a genuine, progressive advance 
		in corrections and rehabilitation. 
		our inmates, properly supervised, 
		will be put to work outside these 
		walls performing all manner of 
		public service. cutting pulpwood, 
		repairing bridges and causeways, 
		digging storm drains... 

	angle to red and the boys listening from behind the fence. 

				norton 
		these men can learn the value of an 
		honest day's labor while providing 
		a valuable service to the community 
		-- and at a bare minimum of expense
		to mr. and mrs. john q. taxpayer! 

				heywood 
		sounds like road-gangin', you ask me. 

				red 
		nobody asked you.
