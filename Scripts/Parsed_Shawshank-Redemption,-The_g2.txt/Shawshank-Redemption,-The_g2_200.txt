250	int -- sewer pipe -- night (1966) 250

	andy peers down through the hole, playing his penlight aroun5,
	the inside diameter is no more than two feet. tight squeeze. 
	coated with crud. it seems to go on for miles. 

	no turning back. he wriggles into the pipe and starts 
	crawling, plastic bag dragging behind. 

				red (v.o.) 
		andy crawled to freedom through 
		five hundred yards of shit-smelling 
		foulness i can't even imagine. or 
		maybe i just don't want to.
