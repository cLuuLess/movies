251	ext -- field -- night (1966) 251

	rain is falling in solid sheets. shawshank is half a mile 
	distant. boom down to reveal the creek...and push in toward the 
	mouth of the sewer pipe that feeds into it. 

				red (v.o.) 
		five hundred yards. the length of 
		five football fields. just shy of 
		half a mile. 

	fingers appear, thrusting through the heavy-gauge wire mesh 
	covering the mouth of the pipe. andy's face looms from the 
	darkness, peering out at freedom. he wrenches the mesh loose, 
	pushes himself out, and plunges head-first into the creek. he 
	comes up sputtering for breath. the water is waist-deep. 

	he wades upstream, ripping his clothes from his body. he gets 
	his shirt off, spins it through the air over his head, flings 
	the shirt away. he raises his arms to the sky, turning slowly, 
	feeling the rain washing him clean. exultant. triumphant. a 
	flash of lightning arcs from horizon to horizon.
