162	ext -- highway construction site -- day (1963) 162

	a road-gang is grading a culvert with picks. there's dust and 
	the smell of sweat in the air. guards patrol with sniper rifles,
	a pushy woman reporter in an ugly hat bustles up the grade, 
	trailed by a photographer. 

				woman reporter 
		you there! you men! we're gonna 
		take your picture now! 

				heywood 
		give us a break, lady. 

				woman reporter 
		don't you know who i am? i'm from 
		life magazine! i was told i'd get 
		some co-operation out here! you 
		want me to report you to your 
		warden? is that what you want? 

				heywood 
			(sighs) 
		no, ma'am. 

				woman reporter 
		that's more like it! now i want you 
		all in a row with big bright smiles 
		on your faces! grab hold of your 
		tools and show 'em to me! 

	she turns, motioning her photographer up the grade. heywood 
	glances around at the other men. 

				heywood 
		you heard the lady. 

	heywood unzips his pants, reaches inside. the others do 
	likewise. the woman turns back and is greeted by the sight of 
	a dozen men displaying their penises and smiling brightly. her
	legs go wobbly and she sits heavily down on the dirt grade. 

				heywood 
		c'mon! we're showin' our tools and 
		grinnin' like fools! take the damn 
		picture!
