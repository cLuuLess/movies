jesus hangs from the cross. a magnificent stained glass
window. in the ornate pulpit, the bishop of hereford,
bedecked in ermine.
                       bishop
         we beseech thy blessing, lord, on
         all your people, but most
         especially on our noble lord
         nottingham. grant him the wisdom
         to guide and protect our glorious
         city.
nottingham and gisborne sit piously among the congrega-
tion of nobles and wealthy merchants.
                       bishop
         grant him also the strength to
         bring to justice the lawless men
         who threaten its safety. help
         him to stamp out the curse of the
         dread druids who would seize from
         us our children, even as wolves
         steal the lambs from their mothers.
the rear of the church. standing crushed together, the
poor and afflicted. old and young. starving children.
among them, robin.
the sermon ends. as the nobles file out, the poor are
galvanized. begging hands reach out.

         2.   have mercy, milady.
         3.   pity, fine sir.
         4.   for my baby.
         5.   etc.
the rich drop a few mites, sparking a mad scramble.
church officials roughly keep order. marian passes some
coins to the mother of a small child. a hand grabs her
wrist.
                       robin
         alms for a blind man. for one
         who cannot see your beauty.

                       marian
                (recognizing him)
         this is dangerous.
                       robin
         so you care for my safety?
                       marian
         no, for mine. i do not wish
         to be seen with an outlaw.
                       robin
         under the sheriff's law, that's
         a badge of pride.
                       marian
         he's put a price on your head.
                       robin
         how much?

                       marian
         a hundred gold pieces.
                       robin
         is that all? i have not annoyed
         him enough. soon he will offer
         ten thousand.
                       marian
         for ten thousand i would turn you
         in myself.
                (glances back at
                 the sheriff)
         nottingham is mounting an army.
                       robin
         how do you know?
                                           (continued)

                                                     56.
continued:
                       marian
         he has rounded up every blacksmith
         in the county. he has them holed
         up in the castle making swords and
         armor.
                       robin
         what is he planning?
                       marian
         i don't know, but there's no limit
         to the man's ambitions.
                (as sheriff heads
                 towards them)
         go!

                       robin
         if you need me, i will be with
         the woodsmen. send for me as
         'robin hood.'
                        marian
         robin!   do something for me.
                        robin
         what?
                        marian
         take a bath.
                       robin
         care to join me?
with a grin, he slips into the crowd as nottingham
arrives.

                       nottingham
         you shine like the sun, my lady.
he raises her hand, as he did the girl's in the castle.
kisses it.
                       nottingham
         you have been meeting with young
         robin of locksley.
                (as she tries to
                 hide her shock)
         my cousin tells me the knave
         deprived you of some horses.
                       marian
                (recovering)
         yes. a most disagreeable
         experience.
                                            (continued)

                                                     57.
continued:
                       nottingham
         i deeply regret it, and i promise
         you he will be brought to justice.
         for subjecting you to such
         treatment, i will hang him from
         the walls with his own entrails.
that gleam of insanity.   robin watches from a distance.
                       marian
         i would like to see that, my lord.
the sheriff places his hand possessively on her shoulder.
                       nottingham
         my dear, a woman of your refinement
         is not safe living alone. if you
         would consent to bring your
         household within the city walls,
         i could give your needs my most
         personal attention.
                       marian
         i thank you, lord nottingham, from
         the heart, but for now i prefer to
         stay in my family's ancestral home.
         my cousin, king richard, will be
         deeply moved to hear of your
         concern for my welfare.
                       nottingham
         alas, the king has many enemies
         both abroad and at home. i fear
         for his safe return.
                       marian
         fear not, my dear sheriff. he will
         return. when he does, he will
         wish to reward his faithful subjects.
the sheriff smiles sourly and takes his leave. marian
deflates with relief. the sheriff walks alone towards
a side door.
                       beggar
                (robin)
         alms, my lord.
nottingham makes to shove the man aside. with a swift
move, the beggar grabs the sheriff in a headlock.
slides nottingham's own dagger to his throat and drags
him out of sight.
                                           (continued)

                                                      58.
continued:
                       robin
         a hundred crowns, sheriff?   you
         insult me.
nottingham starts to struggle.   robin draws blood.
                       robin
         remember young robin of locksley,
         sheriff? meet robin hood. your
         nemesis. your avenging angel.
                       nottingham
         if you kill me, you will hang.
                       robin
         if i kill you, i will hang happy.
                       nottingham
         what do you want?
                       robin
         i want to give you a chance. a
         chance you do not deserve. a
         chance to right your wrongs.
                       nottingham
         i'm listening.
                       robin
         from this day forward you will
         cease to tax my people. you will
         renounce the charges against my
         father, and you will return his
         lands to me.
                         nottingham
         why should i?
                       robin
         because for every harm you do,
         i swear by god i shall visit on
         you threefold in return.
                         nottingham
         empty words.
                       robin
         i am here with a blade at your
         throat. as long as i live, you
         will always know that i could be
         here again.
a yell from across the church. gisborne has spotted them.
robin digs the knife a little deeper.
                                            (continued)

                                                     59.
continued:
                         robin
         your answer?
                         nottingham
         never, fool.
                       robin
         then it will begin..
gisborne yells orders.   robin hurls nottingham against
the wall.
