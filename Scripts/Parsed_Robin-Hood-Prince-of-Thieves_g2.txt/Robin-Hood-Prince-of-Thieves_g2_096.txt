int. castle chapel - day
sweating, fearful, the bishop rushes through the service.
                       bishop
         ...your bodies to be bound in
         immortal wedlock. do you, marian
         dubois, take...
the chapel doors shatter inward.
robin backs in, bloodied, fencing with four remaining
soldiers. he smashes one by swinging the heavy door into
him, hurtles a pew at another. he springs off another
pew, taking down a third.
                        robin
         marian, run!   it's me, robin.
         run!
marian remains immobile. mortianna moves to her side.
robin is struck in the thigh. like a vulture, the
sheriff waits. tiring, blood pouring from his leg, robin
prepares to fight him.
                                          (continued)

                                                         124.
continued:
                       robin
         i warned you, i would find you no
         matter what.
                       nottingham
         no companions? no army? you rush
         to your death for the sake of a
         woman. lust has turned you into a
         fool... recognize this, locksley?
he raises his sword to reveal its handle. a crucifix
sculpted into the hilt... robin's father's sword.
                       nottingham
         appropriate i should use it to
         kill you with, don't you think?
he lunges. a savage, accomplished swordsman, with fire
in his eyes. exhausted, robin is driven back, parrying
desperately.
