ext. woodsmen's camp - day (later)
hands tighten a girth. will confidently jokes with his
cronies. woodsmen form a primitive circle of spectators.
little john and his wife, fanny, keep to themselves,
while wulf openly talks with robin, aslan and duncan.
robin is stripped to the waist, his muscled skin ravaged
with scars.
                       aslan
         this man has true purpose.    he
         means to kill you.
                       duncan
         and you have given him the means.
                       wulf
         will is ruthless, robin.    guard
         your back.
                       robin
         i am grateful for your concern,
         friends, but i have to prove to
         them it is possible to overcome
         unequal odds.
                (shouts)
         i am ready, will.
will bends, as if checking the horse's legs. secretly
grabs a handful of sand. swings into the saddle and digs
in his heels.
closing in, will flings the sand in robin's eyes. robin
clutches his hands to his face, blinded. will spins
back to the attack.
his sword slashes. reacting to the sound, robin rolls
aside. the men cheer like a big fight crowd.

robin's pov is blurred. ducking the blade, he grabs
will's arm. a blow glances off his shoulder.
robin falls to his knees, still blinded. will rides
right at him, to trample him. robin scrambles away.
will wheels his horse. a flashing hoof grazes robin's
chest.
robin leaps to his feet and yells at the top of his
lungs. panicked, the horse rears, whinnying wildly.
will struggles to stay in the saddle. loses his sword.
robin seizes the moment and runs to a water trough.
douses his face. yells at will.
                                             (continued)

                                                     63.
continued:
                       robin
         come on, you little piss pot.
         do your worst!
will grabs a spear from a bystander. robin stands his
ground. will lunges, robin sidesteps.
                       robin
         the horse is smarter than you are,
         will.
some of the men laugh. will is incensed. robin ducks
and weaves, easily evading will's repeated charges.
robin ducks right under the horse's belly.

                        robin
         here, will!   you aim like a girl,
         will!
will stabs wildly, more and more frustrated. laughter
spreads, as robin plays hide and seek around the horse's
legs. grabbing the end of the spear, he clowns a tug
of war.
enraged, will strains and tries to kick robin away.
suddenly, robin lets go. unbalanced, will flies back-
wards off his mount.
robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen
adversary. the crowd falls silent. robin strikes. the
point quivers in the ground below will's crotch. will
wriggles in terror. impaled, his pants rip open.
                       robin
         thank the lord you are not endowed
         like bull.

the crowd is convulsed with laughter. robin catches his
breath. does not see will, who grabs a heavy staff and
runs at him. a strong hand grasps will's arm as he is
about to strike.
                       little john
         bollocks, will. jus' bugger off,
         eh?
overpowered, will relents.   with a defiant glance, he
skulks away.
                       little john
         ya got us by the short and curlies,
         robin hood. now let's hear what ya
         got to bleedin' say.
                                           (continued)

                                                         64.
continued:
robin scans the faces.     he has their attention.
                          robin
            nottingham has taken from us
            everything we own. now we are
            going to start taking from him.
                          little john
            'ow in bloody blazes are we gonna
            do that?
                          robin
            we are going to tax him.
                                                dissolve to:
