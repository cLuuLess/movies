ext. castle battlements - night
torches illuminate nottingham's face. chilling cruelty
in manson-like eyes. seated, his manicured hand dis-
tractedly strokes a semi-naked girl. she sits at his
feet like a frightened dog. when gisborne enters, she
covers up.
                       nottingham
         who bade you cover up?
he smashes his fist into his chair.   she timidly
uncovers.
                       nottingham
         cousin, i trust you justify your
         intrusion with news of profound
         value.
his attention is riveted on a dark niche in the corner of
the courtyard. unearthly sounds emanate from the black-
ness.
                       gisborne
         i met a hooded man today. he bade
         me warn you not to harm his
         people.
                        nottingham
         his name?
                       gisborne
         robin of locksley.
                                            (continued)

                                                     25.
continued:
                      nottingham
         ha! the prodigal son returns. he
         is a whelp. this girl could best
         him.
                       gisborne
         this whelp bested five of my men
         in the blink of an eye.
                       nottingham
         your men were probably drunk.   yet
         you survived, cousin?
heavy scorn. the sheriff pats gisborne's hand like a
child's. the voice from the darkness becomes a loud
chant. a wrinkled, monkey-like figure dances into view,
wearing a necklace of human fingers. you might think
she was a hundred years old, if not for her incredible
agility. mortianna.
                       gisborne
                (stunned)
         you brought her here?
                       nottingham
         quiet!
the crone's fingers dart into a bag. emerge with a
writhing, squealing mass... a piglet. a knife flashes.
blood spurts into an ornate, sacred platter.
the girl flinches in horror. mortianna shakes the con-
tents of a pouch across the bloody dish. carved bone
dice -- runes.
she rattles the platter. the rune symbols dance in
trails of blood. eyes vacant, mouth frothing, she hisses
out her incoherent visions. nottingham follows her every
move. a connoisseur.
                       nottingham
         what do you see?
                       mortianna
         change the seat of power.
                       nottingham
         london?
                       mortianna
         change it.
                       nottingham
         move the capitol to nottingham?
         excellent. how?
                                            (continued)

                                                           26.
continued:
                       mortianna
         ally with royal blood.
                       nottingham
         put someone on the throne and rule
         through him? who?
                       mortianna
         that is not revealed.
the idea takes shape in nottingham's mind.      mounting
intensity.
                       nottingham
         ally with royal blood. what else
         do you see?
                         mortianna
         armies.
                         nottingham
         whose?
                      mortianna
         yours. men and weaponry in great
         numgers.
                         nottingham
         and victory?
                       mortianna
         much blood will be spilled.
                         nottingham
         whose?


close shot
a dice splashes blood. lands -- a death's head symbol.
mortianna hammers the platter. the dice spins and lands
again. again the grinning skull.

back to scene
the tray smashes to the ground.      the hag runs at
gisborne.
                       mortianna
         who have you seen?!
she shakes him.    screams spittle in his face.
                                              (continued)

                                                         27.
continued:
                       gisborne
                (freaked)
         no one. i have seen no one.
                          mortianna
         you lie!     a man... a painted man.
                       nottingham
         what is wrong?
                       mortianna
         i have seen my death.
she whimpers.   spins, as if fearing invisible intruders.

                       mortianna
         the painted man. he haunts my
         dreams.
                       gisborne
         locksley has a companion. a dark-
         skinned foreigner. he had the
         marked skin of islam.
mortianna trembles like an epileptic.    eyes wide with
terror.
                          mortianna
         kill them!     kill them!
she throws herself at nottingham for protection.    he
caresses her. gisborne is thunderstruck.
                       nottingham
         cousin. prove to locksley that
         your survival was his last mistake.

                       mortianna
                (frantic)
         and the painted man! kill him.
                       nottingham
         kill them both.
he continues to stroke her.    her trembling subsides.
                       nottingham
         you have done well, mortianna.
         exceedingly well. no one shall
         harm you, i swear it.
mortianna reaches out bloodied fingers towards the young
girl, who shrinks away. nottingham gently takes the
girl's hand.
                                            (continued)

                                                     28.
continued:
draws it to his mouth, as if to kiss it... and bites down
viciously, drawing blood. the girl screams.
                       nottingham
         now, my child, mortianna's kisses
         will seem soft, like an angel's.
                (to mortianna)
         take her. you have earned her.
mortianna grabs the terrified girl's wrist.   drags her
away.
                       gisborne
         it is madness bringing the hag
         here.

                       nottingham
         fear not for my sanity, guy. for
         in madness, there is great power.
