int. cave - day
robin's eyes  -- he wakes. squints around him, the dark
smoke-filled  recesses of the caves. the walls weave.
eerie watery  sounds, like the cries of drowning men.
he tries to  stand.
                       voice (o.s.)
         robin!... robin!

a figure in a flowing white robe. angelic. floating
towards him... marian. he tries to speak her name.
reaches out his hand.
                       marian
         death is not to be feared,
         robin. embrace it.
her laugh echoes around the cave, as if hundreds of lost
souls are laughing with her. robin crawls away, cover-
ing his ears. marian lifts his face to hers.
                        marian
         drink this.
weakly, robin tries to push away the cup.   her hand
grips his chin, forcing his mouth open.
                        marian
         drink.

the liquid trickles over his lips. he tries to focus.
her features are blurred, her voice hypnotic.
                       marian
         look at me. listen to me. you
         belong to me. your soul is mine.
         you will obey my every word. do
         you understand?
her face is inches from his. he tries to pull away, his
subconscious sounding alarms.
                        robin
         why, marian?
                                            (continued)

                                                       91.
continued:
                       marian
         because you love me. say it.
         you love me.
                (as robin struggles)
         say it!
                       robin
                (sinking)
         i love you.
                       marian
         kiss me.
he gives himself to her. their lips meet... something
changes in his vision. her eyes glow red. her face
starts to shrivel -- he is kissing the wrinkled lips of
mortianna.
he pulls away... strong arms grab him. he shakes his
head, trying to make sense. through his blurred vision,
we see he is surrounded by masked men.
                       robin
                (slurred)
         where is marian?
                       mortianna
         she is with friends.
                (cackles)
         your resistence is strong, but
         useless. sign this.
                (as quill is forced
                 into his hand)
         you are a druid like your father.
         you consort with the devil. your
         confession will be witnessed by
         the bishop of hereford.
a guard forces robin's hand across the page... then
cries out, clutching his back... an arrow lodged be-
tween his shoulders.
in the cave mouth are wulf, bow in hand, bull kneeling
beside sarah's corpse, and aslan.
                       mortianna
                (horror)
         the painted man!
aslan's war cry richochets off the cave walls. a    curved
scimitar in one hand, a straight english sword in   the
other, his arms are lethal windmills. the masked    guards
are cut down left and right. mortianna retreats,    scurry-
ing into the depths of the cave.
                                          (continued)

                                                     92.
continued:
bull joins the fray, charging like his namesake, howling
in rage, flailing at heads with his quarterstaff. wulf
stays in the mouth, picking off men with deadly accuracy.
a furious melee. bull and aslan mow down the enemy like
hay, battling far superior odds. soon they are the only
two left standing. bull peers cautiously into the dark-
ness. behind him, one of his victims crawls back to his
feet... and lunges.
                          aslan
         behind you!
too late. a sword is driven through bull's gut. aslan
grabs the attacker by the neck and pile-drives him into
the cave wall. the man's skull cracks against the rocks.
aslan runs to robin's side, as wulf hurries to bull's.
robin is slumped against a rock.
                       robin
                (groggy)
         marian?
aslan runs to the back of the cave, searching. wulf is
crouched beside bull, who murmurs his dying words.
                       bull
         ya be sure sarah gits a christian
         burial. promise me, boy.
                          wulf
         i promise.
aslan stumbles at the edge of a deep crevasse. far be-
low he sees mortianna, clambering down the steep rock.
for a second their eyes meet. she hisses -- venom,
hatred, fear -- then is gone.
