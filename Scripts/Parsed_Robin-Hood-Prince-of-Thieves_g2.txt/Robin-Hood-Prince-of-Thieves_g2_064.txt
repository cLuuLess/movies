aslan reins in. in the valley below, the forest is
ablaze. the sheriff's armed hordes swarm over the em-
battled woodsmen.

         wulf, stay here. i need your
         horse.
he climbs onto wulf's horse, steers it right at the heart
of the enemy... aslan blocks his way, grabbing his reins.

                       robin
         what are you doing?    out of my
         way!
                       aslan
         i saved your life. i will not
         let you give it away for no
         purpose.
                       robin
         out of my way, damn you!
                       aslan
         does the witch still have
         possession of your senses? if
         we meet up with the survivors we
         may yet give them some help. and
         do some damage to the enemy.

robin debates.   relents.   they urge their horses into
a gallop.
