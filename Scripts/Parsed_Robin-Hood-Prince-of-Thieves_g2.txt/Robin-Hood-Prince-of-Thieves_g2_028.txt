ext. city gate - day
robin taps his way through the crowd. past the piercing
stare of the armored guard at the gate.
                         guard
         hey, you!
robin keeps going.   a hand clasps his shoulder.    spins
him 'round.
                                              (continued)

                                                     54.
continued:
                       guard
         do i know you?
robin gazes into space, trying to look blind.   the guard
sniffs his soiled hand.
                       guard
         my god, you stink!
                       robin
         pardon my blindness, sir.    i'm
         always falling down.
                        guard
         yeech!   get away from me.

he launches a kick in robin's rear. robin hobbles away,
hiding a smile. the guard tries to wipe off his hand on
the wall.
