ext. city square - day
the scaffold is impregnable. celts and their chieftain
guard the platform itself. the sherriff's men surround
the base.
the executioner encircles wulf's neck with the noose.
sparks! tuck ignites a fuse-cord leading to one of the
barrels.
a hand tightens the noose... another grasps an arrow.
the executioner's eyes glint through the slits.
nottingham intently watches wulf.
the chieftain stands, impassive.
fingers close on a bowstring... the fuse-cord burns.
wulf steps to the trap, ready to plunge.   his eyes close.
an arrow flies... slices through the executioner's eye
slit.
the executioner falls. little john celebrates... but
the chieftain leaps forward... releases the trap.
wulf's body plunges.   the rope snaps tight.
little john yells.   fanny screams.
a figure leaps onto the platform... the wounded soldier
throws aside his crutch... robin!
wulf dangles, strangling.   his hands wrench at the
choking cord.
                                           (continued)

                                                      117.
continued:
the burning fuse-cord reaches the barrel. tuck hurls the
smoking barrel thundering towards the sheriff... spotting
it, nottingham urges his horse over his own men in his
effort to escape.
the chieftain smites at robin... his blow is blocked...
by the celt with the boar's head.
kaaboom! the gunpowder in the barrel explodes. spewing
smoke and wood. screams of panic. soldiers fly. mass
confusion.
amidst the smoke... robin's sword slashes through wulf's
rope. he hauls him onto the platform.

another figure on the platform... the old woman. slashes
the ropes of the other prisoners. whips off her wig...
it's hal. he passes out weapons from a bundle under his
arm.
                       hal
         here... by god... let's fight 'em!
                      woodsman
         hal! what happened to your
         stutter?
                       hal
         it's gg... ggg... g..oh crap!
a guard attacks, hal fells him.
                       hal
         take that, ya mug.
no stutter this time!    the woodsmen join battle with the
guards.
the chieftain cudgels his celt attacker across the head.
the boar's head helmet tumbles... revealing aslan.
                        chieftain
         impostor!   you dishonor the clan.
aslan retreats, fending off the chieftain's shattering
blows.

from parapet
john and fanny peer down as the smoke clears. they watch
wulf struggle to his feet. a celt sneaks up behind him.
                         little john
         fight fair...
                                            (continued)

                                                        118.
continued:
he aims.   grits his teeth... picks off the celt with a
shaft.
                         little john
           ...or don't fight at all.

on scene
robin leaps and swings from gallows to gallows, kicking
out, slashing down. sends two celts hurtling down the
trap hole.
will battles the sheriff. a reprise of his own fight
with robin, the roles reversed. the sheriff, armed and
mounted, flails at will, who, unarmed, dodges in and
around the horse's legs.
aslan and the chieftain are locked in mortal combat.
aslan stumbles back and falls. the chieftain swipes at
his head. aslan rolls aside. the sword smashes wood.
tuck surrounded, rolls another smoking barrel... it
explodes.
the greybeard baron spots little john and fanny on the
parapet.
                          greybeard baron
           up there!   no mercy, shoot them!
crossbowmen on the opposite parapet fire.      bolts ricochet
all around little john and fanny.

on scaffold

wulf guards the steps, beating back all comers.

on scene
aslan evades the charging chieftain. drop-kicks a
soldier, takes his sword, and whirls back at the
chieftain. his blows have no effect on the scot's black
armor.
the sheriff rears his horse... hooves flail.. knocking
will to his knees. the sheriff lunges... desperate, will
grasps the sword, ignoring the pain... a tug of war.
blood pours from will's hands, where the blade cuts in.
he suddenly lets go... nottingham topples from his
horse. will leaps on him.
                                               (continued)

                                                       119.
continued:
                       will scarlet
         pain or death, you butcher?
the sheriff's men drag will off before he can choke him.
raging, nottingham climbs to his feet. will is held by
four men.
                       nottingham
         here's another message to robin
         hood, written in your blood.
he drives his sword repeatedly, insanely, into will's
belly.
                       will scarlet
         it's over, fool. you can kill my
         body, but you cannot kill our
         spirit.
he finally drops... nottingham heads for the castle.
robin attempts to follow. he swings from the noose,
using the rope to vault over the surrounding soldiers.
as he lands, he is waylaid by one of the barons and his
men.
                        redhead baron
         it's hood!   get him!
the chieftain knocks aslan down.   aslan loses his sword.
                        chieftain
         i am iron.   i am rock. i am your
         death.
aslan spots one of john's arrows protruding from a dead
celt's back. scrambles over and tears it out.
                       aslan
         you talk too much!
he leaps... rams the arrow through the chieftain's
mouthpiece... out the back of his neck. the chieftain
grabs his helmet, trying to rip it off. he topples,
his life's blood gushing from both sides of his neck.
aslan plants a foot on the slain warrior.
                       aslan
         englishmen! i am not one of you,
         yet i fight for you. against a
         tyrant. join me now. join robin
         hood.
the onlookers are inspired. grabbing weapons from fallen
soldiers, many join the fray.
                                          (continued)

                                                      120.
continued:
nottingham runs through the castle gate.   angry peasants
pursue.
                       nottingham
         lower the portcullis! now!
a guard winds down the giant gate.   nottingham hurls him
aside.
                       nottingham
         too slow, fool!
he hacks at the ropes. the gate slices down like a
guillotine, pinning soldiers and peasants alike.

fighting his way towards the gate, robin sees   with dismay
that the portcullis is closed. weakening, he    staves off
the redhead baron's vicious assault. suddenly    peasants
are swarming over his attacker. the baron is    dragged off
and trampled down.
                        robin
         friends!   we must raise the gate.
