ext. castle forecourt - day

a crossbow bolt strikes hal between his shoulder blades.
he falls. the sheriff's soldiers are regaining the
advantage. the peasants are giving up, dropping their
weapons.
                        hal
         no!   fight on. fight!
he sees a familiar pair of holy sandals marching towards
him. tuck leading a barefoot army. dozens of ragged
prisoners, armed with chains and torture implements.
                       friar
         sinners, beware! god's avengers
         are at hand.
dying, hal manages a weak smile.
                       hal
         go' bless ya, tuck.

tuck flails a chain at a celt.
                       friar
         repent, heathen!
the man spins to strike back... freezes... grinning...
aslan!
