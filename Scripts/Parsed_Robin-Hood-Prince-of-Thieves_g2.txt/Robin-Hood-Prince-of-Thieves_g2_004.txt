int. sewers - night
they wade through foul water up to their waists. the
saracen leads... a snake lashes out for his face. robin
lops off its head.

                       saracen
         you are fast, my friend.
                       robin
         five years i've waited for the
         smell of free air. that makes a
         man fast.
guards drop down from above, carrying torches.    blocking
the way.
                       saracen
         you will need to be yet faster.
a narrow opening to their left... they splash through.
half running, half crawling in the dank water. fire
arrows land around them. the orange smoke is choking.
                                             (continued)

                                                     5.
continued:
                        saracen
         poison air.   hold your breath.
flames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass
of crawling slime. peter falls. a pursuer descends on
him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. the saracen
intercepts the blow. grabs the man's neck, snapping it
with one mighty twist.
                       peter
                (coughing)
         thanks. i misjudged you.
                       saracen
         save your breath.

gasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down-
ward. a slippery, granite tube. losing purchase, they
slide headlong. sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the
walls ahead.
robin grabs at the walls to break the fall. no use.
they're picking up speed. he turns his sword crossways,
bracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake.
sparks fly. the sword cuts into robin's chest... but it
works.
                       saracen
         allah be praised.
                       robin
         amen, brother.
a bloodcurdling scream. a pursuing guard tumbles down
the sewer chute. the three men press themselves against
the wall. the man hurtles by... is impaled on the
spikes.
a draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. using
the spiked guard as a ladder, robin climbs. removes a
grating.
