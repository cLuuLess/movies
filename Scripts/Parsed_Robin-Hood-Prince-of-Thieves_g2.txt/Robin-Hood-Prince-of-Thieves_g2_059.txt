ext. country lane - day
distant thunder. three horses. first wulf's, leading
another with the bodies of bull and sarah draped across
its back. aslan rides the third, with robin propped up
in front of him.
                       robin
         you have fulfilled your vow.   now
         you can leave.
                       aslan
         your gratitude warms my heart.
                       robin
         you ignored my request.
                       aslan
         it is fortunate that i did.
                       robin
         because of you, another good man
         is dead.
                       aslan
         he urged me to bring him. he was
         a brave man and i grieve for him.
         praise be to allah that i do not
         grieve for you also. or for my
         broken vow.
                       robin
         to hell with your damn vow.
                       aslan
         i am glad you are feeling
         better.
ahead of them, wulf shouts and reins in. he points into
the distance. a huge cloud of smoke is darkening the
sky.
                        robin
         the forest!   ride!
