ext. gregor caves - day
aslan carries robin outside. robin is staggering,
glassy-eyed, mumbling incoherently. his arm blocks
the light from his eyes.
                       aslan
         they have poisoned you. there
         are herbs that can alter a man's
         brain. i know of only one cure.
he drops to one knee, slams robin violently across the
other. slaps him on the back and forces his fingers
down his throat.

         it worked for me this very
         morning.

         you will thank me for this later.
