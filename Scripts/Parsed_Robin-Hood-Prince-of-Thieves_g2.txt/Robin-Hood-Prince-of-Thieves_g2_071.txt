ext. sherwood forest - dawn
in the troubled human realm, tuck says his morning
prayer.
                         friar
           lord, grant us the courage to
           endure, and if you're as smart as
           i believe you are, grant us
           victory... and the victuals to
           celebrate it with.

aslan is crushing charcoal into a mixture of yellow
powder, which is turning black. tuck approaches.
                         friar
           will you pray with me, son of
           allah?
                         aslan
           i have prayed for you, often, my
           brother. but, let us put prayer
           aside and help our gods in a more
           practical manner. i must reveal
           to you the mysteries of the black
           powder.
tuck takes a bowl of the powder close to the fire to
examine it. aslan snatches it back... before tuck can
react, robin walks up.
                                             (continued)

                                                    108.
continued:
                         robin
         will it work?
aslan throws a handful of powder into the firel a fire-
ball rips ten feet in the air... tuck falls on his ass
in terror.
                       robin
                (impressed)
         you are truly a wizard.
                       aslan
         there is no such thing. but if
         there was...
                (chuckles)
         ... i would surely be one.
robin reaches out and shakes aslan's hand. a moment of
bonding. he moves on to the others, clasping each man's
hand as he speaks.
                       robin
         we have no armored knights, no
         glorious banners. but i am
         honored to be going to battle in
         this company. today we fight not
         just for the lives of our friends,
         but to save all england.
a moment of tension before will takes the proferred hand.
                       robin
         we may be only six men, but...
                         fanny
         seven!

she strides towards them from the trees.
                       little john
         what in blazes ya doin', woman?
         where's the little 'uns?
                       fanny
         them's safe, wi' my mother.
                (pushes past little
                 john)
         robin, i been to town an' seen the
         scaffold and the guard towers.
                       little john
         ya gone bleedin' cracked, girl?
                                           (continued)

                                                      109.
continued:
                       fanny
         you go an' birth eight babies and
         then you can come an' tell me
         'bout hurtin', ya big ox. i ain't
         gonna sit aroun' an' let one o'
         'em die, neither.
                       little john
         ya should be bloody well mindin'
         the other seven. tell 'er, rob.
robin starts to draw a diagram on the ground with a
stick.
                       robin
         fanny, show me the exact location
         of the scaffold.
little john double-takes.
