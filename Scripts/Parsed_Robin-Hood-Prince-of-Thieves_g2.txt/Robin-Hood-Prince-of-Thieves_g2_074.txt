int. castle chamber - day

... mortianna's apothecary. dark, smoke-filled. foul
things in jars. animals in cages, waiting to meet
unspeakable ends. marian is strapped in a chair, flanked
by two armed guards.
                       nottingham
         how is my bride?
marian smiles as he leans toward her... and spits in his
face.
                       nottingham
         ah... you are overwhelmed with
         happiness.
he slowly wipes off the spittle... and slaps her hard.
                                            (continued)

                                                     110.
continued:
                       marian
                (calm, uncowed)
         i will never marry you.
mortianna emerges from a dark corner, bearing the goblet
she used at the druid ceremony.
                       mortianna
         hold her!
marian struggles against her bonds.
                       marian
         get away from me, you disgusting
         hag. i will not... augh!

the guards viciously restrain her, forcing her mouth
open. mortianna pours the blood-red liquid down her
throat. marian fights, gagging and choking... until the
drug takes its effect. she slumps forward. nottingham
watches with amusement.
                       nottingham
                (to mortianna)
         when we are married, thirty of the
         northern barons will pledge me
         their support as king. as you
         predicted.
mortianna squats on the floor besides a platter of blood.
clasps the dice-like runes.
                       nottingham
         what do you see in the portents?
mortianna rocks on her heels, clutching her taloned hands
to her sides. she chants, fingering the bloody stones.
                       mortianna
         the union. the blood of the lion
         and the house of nottingham. new
         faith. new power. new souls.
she stares at nottingham, her red eyes demented.
                       mortianna
         if there is no union, there will
         be darkness, despair, death.
         ours!
                       nottingham
         di not give me riddles, woman. we
         are to be married within hours.
         how can we be in danger?
                                            (continued)

                                                     111.
continued:
                       mortianna
         the blood does not lie.
                       nottingham
                (shouting)
         tell me how it will result.
                       mortianna
         i have told you what i know.
                       nottingham
         confound you, crone. without my
         protection, the people would hunt
         you down, rip out your black heart
         and burn it.

mortianna runs at him.   points her bony finger at his
heart.
                       mortianna
         without me, you are nothing. you
         are straw, a fleabite, a speck.
                (as nottingham
                 laughs)
         laugh, fool. i birthed you from
         this body. i stole a babe in this
         very castle, and killed it so that
         you might rise in its place. you
         are my son.
                (nottingham is
                 too shocked to
                 react)
         together we are strong. now is
         not the time to doubt. now is the
         time to believe, to be bold. the
         bold will prevail.
