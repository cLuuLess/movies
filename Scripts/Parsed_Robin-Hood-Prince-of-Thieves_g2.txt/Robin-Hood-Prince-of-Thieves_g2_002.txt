int. dungeons - sunset
pervasive blackness. moans of men in pain. dripping
water. rats. filth. the nadir of human degradation.
bedraggled white men, pows from the crusades, caged
together with arab cutthroats. jailers wrench two
crusaders from their cell. robin of locksley and peter
dubois. their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but
remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their
faces. peter is so frail he can barely walk.
