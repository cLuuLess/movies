ext. castle forecourt - day
hal and the others battle against huge odds. more
peasants join them, daring to take on the sheriff's hated
men. aslan's a whirlwind,  striking out in all
directions. each blow for  a cause.
                       aslan
         for allah!... for jehovah!
         for brotherhood!... for
         justice!
