ext. woodsmen's camp
a blazing fire. deer carcasses roast. tuck's barrels
supply the refreshment. robin and aslan pass out coins
to each family.
                       robin
         buy yourself a new son, stephen.
                       farmer
         thankee, robin.
little john and bull approach. john indicates the two
prisoners roped to a nearby tree.
                       little john
         cain't get a bleedin' squeak outa
         'em, rob.
                       bull
         they'd be spittin' it out good
         if they'd knowed anythin'.
                       little john
         reckon the cap'n knows summat, rob,
         but stubborn ol' cocker 'e is.
                       aslan
         perhaps it is time for some
         heathen persuasion.
                                            cut to:
captain of soldiers
stares up at robin defiantly.
                       captain
         spare your breath. i know nothing.
                       robin
                (reasonable)
         i believe you. but this arab here,
         he's got it into his barbarian
         brain that you know a whole lot
         more than nothing.
                       (more)
                                         (continued)

                                                      71.
continued:
                       robin (cont'd)
         and when he gets like this,
         he's very hard to reason with.
with a hair-raising war cry, aslan   leaps into view.
stripped to the waist, brandishing   his scimitar. the
captain tries to back away. robin    tries to restrain
aslan, is hurled aside. snarling,    drooling at the mouth,
aslan explores the captain's body   with his hands. a
butcher checking meat.
                       robin
         i strongly advise you to talk.
         he hasn't eaten in weeks.

                       captain
                (rising terror)
         what does he want?
                       robin
         you.
                       captain
         for godsakes, get him off me!
                       robin
                (very deliberately)
         no, aslan... not this one, aslan.
         ... how about this other one?...
         fatter, yes... more meat.
the other soldier, who definitely  has more flesh on the
bone, is struck dumb with horror,  as aslan turns his
attention to him. with one swing   of his sword, aslan
slices through the man's ropes.   drags him to his feet.
little john runs over.

                       little john
                (urgent)
         no, robin, no! they be god-fearin'
         men.
                       robin
         i cannot stop him, john. besides,
         if they will not tell what they
         know, then they must pay the price.
                       little john
         kill 'em aye, but not like this.
         'tain't christian.
blood-curdling screams from behind the wagon where aslan
has dragged his victim. the captain's face pales. then
silence.
                                           (continued)

                                                     72.
continued:
the demented arab slowly reappears. blood drips from his
lips. he munches the flesh from a long bone, on the end
of which is the soldier's glove... the man's arm.
turning to robin, aslan shouts in arabic and gesticulates
wildly at the captain.
                       captain
         what does he say?
                       robin
         well, roughly, he says that he
         doesn't care for the way your
         friend tastes, and he wants you.
                       captain
         no, god, no! i'll talk. just
         keep him away. keep him away!

behind wagon
bull holds the other prisoner, muffling the man's mouth
and trying to suppress his own laughter. beside them
lies a large chunk of venison. the man is unharmed,
except that he's missing a glove.
