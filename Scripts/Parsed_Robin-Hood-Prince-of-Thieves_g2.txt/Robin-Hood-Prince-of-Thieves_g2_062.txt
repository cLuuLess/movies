ext. hillside - day
celts, arrayed behind their chieftain. an awesome sight.
clad in hides and skins, painted arms and faces, head-
pieces the faces of wild animals. standing in eerie
silence. a loud clap of thunder. nottingham rides up
to the chieftain.
                       nottingham
         i want prisoners.
the chieftain does not turn his head.
                       chieftain
         we came to fight.
                       nottingham
         nevertheless, i need prisoners.
with only a short flick of his head, the chieftain spits.
nottingham waves his arm, signalling his own foot sol-
diers to advance. the chieftain raises his sword.
instantly a tumultuous chilling roar from his warriors.
they charge forward.
