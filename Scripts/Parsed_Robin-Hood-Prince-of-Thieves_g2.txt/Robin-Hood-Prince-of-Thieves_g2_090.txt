int. castle chapel - day
once, christian, now blasphemously transformed   to the
practice of black magic. the crucifix on the    altar is
upside down. marian stands before it, between    the
sheriff and mortianna. the bishop is dragged    in.
frightened. the battle sounds echo.
                       bishop
         they are rebelling. we must
         escape.
                       nottingham
         marry us. when i am declared king,
         that rabble will not dare go against
         us.
                       bishop
         is is madness to delay.
mortianna screams and slashes her talons across the
bishop's outstretched hands. blood flows.
                       mortianna
         face them, or face me.
