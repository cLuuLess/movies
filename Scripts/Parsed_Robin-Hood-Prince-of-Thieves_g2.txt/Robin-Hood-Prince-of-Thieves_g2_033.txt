ext. hamlet - day
a squealing hog is loaded onto a wagon. soldiers round
up the livestock. an old farmer protests.
                       farmer
         go' bless ya, sir. leave us the
         sow. she's with young 'uns. the
         next litter'll feed us through
         the winter.
                       soldier
         you've heard of robin hood?
                       farmer
         yes, sir.
the soldier brutally kicks the old man to the ground.
                       soldier
         then pray he is brought to us
         before winter.
