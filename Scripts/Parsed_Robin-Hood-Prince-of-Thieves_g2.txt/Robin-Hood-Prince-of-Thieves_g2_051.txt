int. castle chamber - night
the sheriff and six barons are gathered around the model.
these are the men who revealed their faces to lord
locksley in the druid ceremony. nottingham toys with
a white rat on his arm.
                       redhead baron
         forget about locksley. he is no
         threat.
                       nottingham
         how can we control all england if
         we cannot control our own county?
         the people are turning him into
         a hero.

                       greybeard baron
         it is impossible to attack him
         in the forest. we have tried
         everything. he is cunning.
                         nottingham
         then we   will be more cunning. i
         must be   rid of him. we may not
         be able   to intercept his next
         warning   to the king.
sounds of commotion outside. the door swings open.
framed in the doorway is a colossus in black armor.
his helmet is the head of a dragon. he slowly raises the
visor. deep tribal scars on his cheeks. implacable
ferocity in his eyes.
                       celtic chieftain
         i want the heads of the men who
         stole my gold.

                       nottingham
         welcome, sir. we were discussing
         how to rid ourselves of those very
         men. the outlaws who band with
         robin hood.
                       redhead baron
         my lord nottingham, i must protest.
         it is a mistake to ally ourselves
         with foreigners.
                       greybeard baron
         what can these celts do that we
         cannot?
                                             (continued)

                                                     87.
continued:
the chieftain strides across to the fire. grabs a
burning log. the baron backs away in fear. the log
spits sparks as the chieftain raises it above his head...
and drives it into his own palm. he stares unblinking
at the baron, holding the log to his hand for a full
three seconds.
an awed silence. nottingham grins, delighted with the
demonstration. he deposits his white rat onto the model.
                       nottingham
         this rat hood has hidden out in
         the forest.  he resists all our
         assaults with traps and devices,
         while he robs us blind. we must
         bring him out and destroy him.
the rat has scurried into the shelter of the model trees.
the chieftain watches impassively, then calmly touches
the log to the model. the trees ignite... the rat
squeals in terror and runs. the chieftain cuts off its
escape, setting fire to more trees... again... and
again. the sheriff watches the flames, fascinated.
                                            dissolve to:
