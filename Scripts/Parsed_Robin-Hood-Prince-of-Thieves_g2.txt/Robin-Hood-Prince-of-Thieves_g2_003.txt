int. torture chamber - sunset

a furnace. torture instruments glow red hot. chained
victims. a massive interrogator scrutinizes the two
white men. indicates a rat-faced lowlife, who points at
peter, jabbering in arabic.
                         interrogator
           he says you stole his bread.
                         peter
           it is a lie. i caught him
           stealing ours.
the lowlife jabbers some more.    the interrogator debates.
                         interrogator
           cut off the infidel's hand.
the jailers haul peter to the chopping block.
                                            (continued)

                                                      2.
continued:
                       robin
         no!... i took the bread.
                       peter
         that's not true.
                       robin
         they're not interested in truth.
         you are too weak, peter. you
         would not live through it.
the interrogator stares into robin's eyes.
                       interrogator
         sacrifice for the weaker? how
         noble... as you wish... cut off
         this one's hand as well!... but
         first...
he indicates an arab prisoner, who is dragged forward.
his struggling hand is laid on the executioner's block.
                       interrogator
         show them the courage of allah.
the prisoner's face braces for the pain. a red-hot
scimitar flashes down. the hand flips into a basket.
twitching.
robin is next. his composure fails. he flops to his
knees, crying. the interrogator laughs. the jailers
unlash the thongs on robin's hand. they stretch it out,
forcing it down. robin goes limp, sobbing. peter
catches his eye... robin winks.
the scimitar. drawn from the coals. spitting flame.
arcs down. robin is suddenly galvanized.
                       robin
         and this is english courage.
he hurls his holders aside. swings upward, driving his
fast into the executioner's throat. grabs the sword.
slash. his thongs melt like butter. a jailer leaps at
him. steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest.
despite his bindings, peter wrestles the interrogator.
knife pressed to his throat, peter is forced against the
furnace. at the last second, he flips the man into the
fire. screaming.
                       peter
         that's for five years of hell.
                                             (continued)

                                                        3.
continued:
a jailer aims a scalding blade at robin's back.
                         voice (o.s.)
         behind you!
warned, robin ducks away.    slams the jailer's head into
the wall.
peter frees himself, but they are still outnumbered.
while fighting, robin acknowledges the man who shouted
the warning. an imposing, shaven-headed saracen.
heavily-muscled arms and chest, covered in tattoos. even
his bald head is ornamented.
                       robin
         you speak english?
                       saracen
         the king's own. set me free.
                         peter
         no, robin.
                       saracen
         for pity's sake. mine is a
         sentence of death.
robin sidesteps, propelling a guard into a pit.
                       peter
         don't trust him.
two more guards attack, yelling fury.    robin eyes the
curved scimitar.
                       robin
         what i would give for an english
         sword. this is a pruning hook.
a guard swings at him with a giant axe.    robin slashes...
shears the axe handle in two.
                        robin
         hmm!   not bad.
he runs the man through. peter loses his sword. his
opponent moves in for the kill... peter grabs tongs from
the fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand.
commotion outside.    raised voices and running feet.
                       saracen
         free me and i will show you a way
         out.
                                            (continued)

                                                       4.
continued:
                       robin
         why should we trust you?
                       saracen
         if you don't, you are dead men.
                       robin
         he makes a point.
the door bursts open.    more guards rush in.
                         robin
         a good point.
he slashes the man free.

                         peter
         robin!
                       robin
         whatever blood is in his veins, he
         does not deserve to die here.
                         saracen
         this way!
he beckons them to the back.     a hidden door leads into a
tunnel.
