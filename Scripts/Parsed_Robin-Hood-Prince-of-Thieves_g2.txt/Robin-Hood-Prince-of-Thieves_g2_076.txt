ext. dungeon gate - day
wulf blinks at the sunlight as the prisoners are led out.
holds his head high. soldiers hurl abuse, the people are
too cowed to show support. fanny glances at her son,
crosses herself and scurries into the castle, unnoticed.
on horseback, encircled by guards, the sheriff and his
baron cronies watch the outlaws progress with cruel
amusement. a  yell attracts nottingham. will is being
shoved back by guards.
                      will scarlet
         sheriff! my lord sheriff! i have
         word for you! of robin hood!
nottingham shouts to one of his mounted guards, who rides
over, grabs will by the collar, and drags him to his
side.
                       nottingham
         ah, the turncoat. did you succeed?
                       will scarlet
         i found his lair, but alas he still
         lives.
the sheriff strikes down with his armored hand.    will
crumples.
                       nottingham
         stretch his neck with the others.
hands yank will to his feet. dazed, he tries to speak.
disinterested, nottingham turns away, until he catches...
                       will scarlet
         ...he... he... is here!
                       nottingham
         locksley, here? where ?
will struggles to get free of his holders.
                       will scarlet
         call off your dogs.
                       nottingham
         release him!... now, where is he?

                                                       113.
continued:
                       will scarlet
         i want your word, in front of
         these witnesses. if i tell you,
         i will go free.
                       nottingham
                (scoffs)
         we will find him.
                       will scarlet
         he is concealed. he is going to
         free the prisoners and stop the
         wedding.
nottingham's jaw tightens.   eyes the prisoners, the
scaffold.
                       nottingham
         put hood in my hands, you go free.
                       will scarlet
         with the reward. ten thousand
         crowns.
                       nottingham
         damn your worthless hide!    just
         tell me where he is.
                       will scarlet
         the reward!
the parade of prisoners reaches them. seeing will, wulf
charges at him, screaming in blind rage. soldiers grab
wulf. throw him down, kicking and beating. voices in
the crowd plead to let him be. someone tries to
intervene, gets hurled down.

                       nottingham
                (to will)
         you'll get your reward. where
         is he?
