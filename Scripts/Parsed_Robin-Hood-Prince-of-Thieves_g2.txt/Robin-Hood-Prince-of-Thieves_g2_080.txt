ext. city parapet - day
fanny lowers a knotted rope over the battlement. far
below, john clings to the outer wall. above him it's
sheer, without footholds. the rope doesn't reach his
fingertips. he stretches, loses balance. falls...
desperately grabbing at the rope. he swings, clinging
by one arm, his body smashing into the wall.
