         step down, friar.
                       friar
         as you wish, sire. is there
         something amiss?
                       nottingham
         this man claims you have outlaws
         concealed in these barrels. among
         them the cursed robin hood.
tuck glares at will with unconcealed hatred.
                       friar
         this man will rot in hell as a
         knave and a liar. these are
         libations for the celebration
         of your lordship's nuptials.

                (nervous)
         why waste fine vintage, my lord?
a cask is shattered... wine torrents out.
                       will scarlet
         try another. there are many
         barrels, only a few outlaws.
a drum roll. the sheriff's attention turns to the
scaffold, where the first victim is escorted up the
steps -- wulf.
tense, tuck pulls a tinder box from his robes, strikes
a flame.
