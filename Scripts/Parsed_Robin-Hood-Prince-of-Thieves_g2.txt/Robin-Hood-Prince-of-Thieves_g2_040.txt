int. castle armory - night
sparks. smoke. sweat. the sheriff inspects his weapon
factory. his eyes glint with the reflections of the
smithy's fires.
a door crashes open behind him. footsteps. paying no
heed, he draws a sword from a furnace. it's blade white-
hot.
                       gisborne
         we were ambushed. in sherwood
         forest.
nottingham tests the sword against an anvil.

                       nottingham
         spanish steel, cousin. so much
         stronger than our native blades.
         any losses?
                       gisborne
         all the men are gone.
                       nottingham
         yet again you are the sole
         survivor, cousin? interesting.
         and the gold?
                       gisborne
         well, it er... disappeared.
                                            (continued)

                                                       74.
continued:
the sheriff looks at gisborne for the first time.
                       nottingham
         robin hood?
                       gisborne
         they were woodsmen, dressed in
         green.
                       nottingham
         robin hood.
he places a hand reassuringly on his cousin's shoulder.
                       nottingham
         cousin, we must be strong. we
         cannot allow this outlaw to make
         fools of us.
without warning, he drives the blade into gisborne's
belly.
                       nottingham
         and i cannot allow a lieutenant
         to fail me.
                (turning to the
                 horrified smithy)
         it is indeed fine steel.
