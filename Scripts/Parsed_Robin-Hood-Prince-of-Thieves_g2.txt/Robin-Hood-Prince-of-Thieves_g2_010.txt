ext. english shore - day
a twelfth century french sailboat at anchor.    a cross on
its sail.
a longboat rows to shore. robin stands in the prow, in
a pilgrim's hooded robe. he gazes at the approaching
land. unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades
to the beach. he kneels, pressing his hands and face
into the soil.
                         robin
         home.    thank you, lord.
aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. the french
sailors keep their distance from him. robin takes his
hand.

                       robin
         my friend, you have escorted me
         home. i beg you to free yourself
         of your vow. return with the
         boat. i know how heavy your
         heart must be, this far from your
         family and native land...
                       aslan (saracen)
         because i love them so dearly,
         i cannot dishonor them.
a sailor creeps up behind aslan, club in hand.
                       robin
         i thought you'd say that.
he nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. the
saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him
into the surf. he turns a cold stare on robin.

                       aslan
         no man controls my destiny.
         especially not one who attacks
         downwind and stinks of garlic.
robin laughs.    the saracen remains intense.
                       aslan
         if our positions were reversed,
         i would have done the same.
         only i would have succeeded.
he smiles broadly.    robin claps him on the shoulder.
                       robin
         come, aslan. by nightfall we will
         celebrate your honor when we dine
         with my father.

                                                    14.
