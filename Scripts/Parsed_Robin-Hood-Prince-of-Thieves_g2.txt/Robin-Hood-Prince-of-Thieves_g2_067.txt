int. castle dungeons - night
a heavy key turns in a lock. bolts drawn back. fol-
lowed by guards, nottingham enters the torture chamber
where the captured woodsmen are chained, among them
wulf and will scarlet. putrid ankle-deep water on the
floor, walls encrusted with dried blood and grime.
nottingham walks up to the first man. wry smile.
                       nottingham
                (wry smile)
         would you prefer pain or death?
                        first woodsman
         death.

dignity masking his terror.    nottingham appears to
consider.
                        nottingham
         torture him.
the man is dragged away by guards.    the next prisoner --
                        nottingham
         and you?   pain or death?
                       second woodsman (prisoner)
                (pure terror)
         ... er... pain.
                       nottingham
         torture him... you see, it makes
         no difference.
                       (more)
                                            (continued)

                                                     100.
continued:
                       nottingham (cont'd)
         you will all be tortured. you will
         all tell me all you know about
         robin hood, and then you will all
         be hanged. then we will catch your
         beloved robin hood and do the same
         to him.
                       will scarlet
         i will kill him for you.
                          wulf
         will, no!
nottingham strides up to will, drawing his sword.

                       nottingham
         why would i need you?
                       will scarlet
         all your attempts to kill him
         have failed. your army failed.
         your celtic mercenaries failed.
nottingham places his sword point against will's throat.
                       nottingham
         and you can succeed?
                       will scarlet
         i am one of his men. he would
         never suspect me.
                       wulf
         he knows you always hated him,
         traitor.

                       will scarlet
         he is a trusting fool. he will
         believe me. if he doesn't, he
         will kill me and you have lost
         nothing.
nottingham slides his blade between will's teeth.
                       nottingham
         if you fail, i will personally
         cut out your lying tongue.
he withdraws the blade.    will tries to smile.
                       will scarlet
         and if i succeed?
                                            (continued)

                                                      101.
continued:
                       nottingham
         his friends will..
                (to a guard)
         ... torture him!
he turns back to will.   a smile of mock apology.
                       nottingham
         it will look better.
