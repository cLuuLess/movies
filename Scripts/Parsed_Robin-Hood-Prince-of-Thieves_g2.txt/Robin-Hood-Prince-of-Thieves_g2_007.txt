int. locksley castle - night
fire crackles in an open hearth. hams and a half sheep
hang, smoking. an old dog snores at the fireside. a
bone clunks on the floor, waking him.
                       voice (o.s.)
         enough of that din, remus.    i
         can't think.
licking the bone gratefully, the dog looks in the direc-
tion of the voice... grey. proud. distinguished. lord
locksley.
seated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores   over a
wonderful illustrated bible. reading to himself    for
solace and strength. empty chairs surround the    vast
table. a deep sense of loneliness. he glances     at a
portrait over the fireplace... robin.
the dog jumps. hackles rise. o.s. shouts. locksley
unsheathes a dagger. obscures it in the folds of the
bible. the door bursts open. a peasant, ragged,
desperate, kenneth.
                        kenneth
         my lord!   help me.
he's bleeding from a face wound. another man grabs him
from behind. locksley's craggy-faced retainer, duncan.
older than his master, but still strong, he holds kenneth
back.
                       duncan
         you must wait... i am sorry you
         were disturbed, master.
                       kenneth
                (high anxiety)
         my lord, please!
                       locksley
         it is alright, duncan.
                (to kenneth)
         you are kenneth of cowfall?
the peasant falls to his knees.
                                           (continued)

                                                           9.
continued:
                       kenneth
         they've taken my gwen.    my
         daughter.
                       locksley
         who has taken her?
                       kenneth
         men on horses. in masks.
                (touches his wound)
         we tried to stop them. my son is
         dead.
