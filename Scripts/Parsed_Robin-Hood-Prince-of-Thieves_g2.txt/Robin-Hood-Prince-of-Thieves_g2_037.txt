ext. forest clearing - day
robin climbs onto the tax wagon's roof.     angry shouts
from inside.
                       robin
         surrender your weapons. i give
         you my word you shall go free.
in answer, a swordblade jabs up through the roof, near
his feet.

                       robin
         ah, i feared as much.
he signals to aslan, who steers the tax wagon into the
river. water floods in through the slits. inside,
panic. drowning rats.
the bowmen scramble out. what they see stops them dead.
both banks are men in green, longbows aimed directly at
them.
                                               cut to:
countryside
sparks. an axe pounds into the lock of a strongbox. the
lock snaps. little john pries open the lid. reacts in
astonishment. the trunk is filled to the brim with
glittering gold coins. the woodsmen press around.
cheers of celebration.

                       little john
                (awestruck)
         i'll be buggered.
                       robin
         this treasure had a purpose.     we
         must find out what.
he turns at the sound of a brawl from the friar's cart.
the friar is at the bottom of a struggling heap of bodies.
                        robin
         get off him.   he's a man of the
         cloth.
robin drags the men off. the friar clambers to his feet.
around him are strewn battered and winded woodsmen.
                                               (continued)

                                                      67.
continued:
                       friar
         the lord's blessing on you, kind
         sir. these sinners were attempting
         to steal these libations destined
         for the monks of st. catherine's.
he indicates his cargo of barrels.
                       robin
         it appears to me, reverend friar,
         that many of the libations have
         found their way into your own
         esteemed person.
ignoring him, the friar mounts the cart.

                       friar
         a thousand pardons, sir, but duty
         beckons. i must hasten on.
                       robin
                (grabbing the bridle)
         a moment, my reverend friend. you
         travel with poor company when you
         travel with nottingham's soldiers.
                         bull
         aye, tax him.
this sparks a chorus of comments.
                       robin
         my men are thirsty and have much
         to celebrate.
                       friar
         lord bless me, sir, are these your
         men? i had mistook them for
         common thieves. kindly step
         aside.
                       robin
         surely the lord has the charity to
         spare a few barrels to good
         christian men.
the friar relents, loosening his grip on the reins.
                       friar
         well, sir, if you wish them to
         share in the good lord's brew...
casually reaching under the seat, he pulls out a club.
smites robin with it.
                                            (continued)

                                                     68.
continued:
                       friar
         ... you must best me for it.
robin staggers. the friar whips up the horse. dazed,
robin grabs for the fat man's leg. gets a holy sandal
full in the face.
                         friar
         giddyup, nag!
the friar's horse, as obese as his driver, slowly raises
his head from the grass and ambles forward. robin runs
after them and dives at the friar, toppling him from the
cart.

                       robin
         you leave when i say.
scrambling to his feet, the friar glances skyward.
                       friar
         protect me, lord.
he sweeps his foot, knocking robin's legs out from under
him. hurls his full body weight on top of him. whooomf!
                         friar
         yield!
he bounces on robin's stomach. robin can barely breathe.
the woodsmen are enjoying the spectacle.
                       friar
         confess that friar tuck is a
         better, holier, and braver man
         than thou art, knave.

                        robin
         never!   whoomf!
                         friar
         yield, i say!    yield to friar
         tuck.
desperate, robin bites the friar's leg. tuck howls.
robin extricates himself, grabs for a weapon. smashes
the friar's head with his drinking jug.
                       robin
         yield yourself!
he dives onto the friar and hammers his head into the
ground.
                                           (continued)

                                                         69.
continued:
                       robin
         yield to robin hood.
tuck holds up a hand in surrender.    robin eases off.
                       friar
                (feeling his head)
         thank you, lord, for teaching me
         humility.
                       robin
         well, friar tuck. we have need
         of an honest man of god, to
         minister to these men and their
         families. what do you say?

the friar struggles to his feet. he reviews the motley
faces of his potential flock. his eyes light on the
grinning saracen.
                       friar
         i'd rather roast in hell.
he punches robin in the gut.
                                              cut to:

friar tuck
strapped into the traces, pulls the beer cart. sweating
profusely, grunting with strain. his horse contentedly
follows.
                       robin
         giddyup, friar.

he flicks the reins, steering the cart into camp. women
and children rush to greet their men. jeer the roped
soldier-prisoners. the friar checks out his flock. a
woman curtsies, another crosses herself, children touch
his robe in wonder.
                       robin
         what do you say now, tuck?    here
         are the meek of the earth.
tuck surveys the hopeful, hungry faces. the little
hamlet of half-built huts. he folds his hands in a
moment of prayer.
                       friar
         the lord moves in mysterious
         ways. i accept.
                                              (continued)

                                                      70.
continued:
                       robin
         you will not regret it.
                       friar
         aye, but you may.
