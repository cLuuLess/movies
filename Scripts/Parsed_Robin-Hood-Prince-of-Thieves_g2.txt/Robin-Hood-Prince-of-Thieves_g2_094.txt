int. castle hallways - day
a door slams back. robin bursts through. alone, against
three attackers. he swings a soldier around. holds him
as a shield, using the man's own sword against his
companions. in seconds, all three are down and robin is
off and running.
down corridors, searching. soldiers and armed servants
converge to block his way. robin strikes, vaults, flings
statues. up the stairs... topples a suit of armor down
on his pursuers.
                       robin
                (grabbing a servant)
         where is she? where is lady
         marian?
                                          (continued)

                                                    123.
continued:
the man refuses to speak. robin looks up the corridor,
sees six men guarding the private chapel's arched door-
way.
                        robin
         ah!   there is my answer.
he hurls the man aside... the armed guards charge him.
