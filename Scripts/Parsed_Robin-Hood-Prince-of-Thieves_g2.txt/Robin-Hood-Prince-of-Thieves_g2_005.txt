ext. arab street - night
robin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of
mounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears.
all clear. they're outside the prison wall. robin helps
peter up.
                       robin
         god willing, we may now be safe.
                                            (continued)

                                                     6.
continued:
swoosh. an arrow pierces through peter's chest -- fired
from the prison wall. he reels... robin leads him under
the wall for protection. shouts of alarm. soldiers
approaching.
                         robin
         come, peter.    we must hurry.
raising his sword, peter faces the oncoming soldiers.
                         peter
         it is mortal.    leave me.
                       robin
         hold on to my shoulder.

peter shakes him off.
                       peter
         my mother... my little sister.
         tell them i love them. tell them
         i died a free englishman.
robin looks despairingly to the saracen.
                       saracen
         his wound is by the heart.    we
         cannot save him.
robin knows it's true. peter pulls an insignia ring from
a hidden pouch in his clothes. thrusts it into robin's
hand.
                       peter
         take this to my sister. swear you
         will protect her for me... swear
         it, robin!
                       robin
                (reluctantly)
         i swear it.
summoning hidden resources of strength, peter charges at
the oncoming soldiers, brandishing his sword.
                         peter
         for england.
he fells the first arab.   the saracen pulls robin away.
                       saracen
         come now! do not fail your friend.
         make his sacrifice an act of honor.
they vanish into the night. fighting like a man pos-
sessed, peter is swallowed in a sea of enemy soldiers.

                                                         7.
deserted alley - later
robin and the saracen catch their breath.
                          robin
            farewell, friend. god speed you
            on your way.
                          saracen
            our way is together. with the
            speed of allah.
he grins.    this strange man has a sense of humor.
                          robin
            i go to england.

                          saracen
            then i go to england.
                           robin
            england?   why?
                          saracen
            you saved my life. i must stay
            with you until i save yours.
                          robin
            go your own way. i relieve you of
            your obligation.
                          saracen
            only allah can do that.
                          robin
            and if i don't want you?
                          saracen
            you have no choice... unless you
            think you can kill me.
he grins broadly.      offers his hand.
                          saracen
            my name is aslan.
resigned, robin takes the proferred hand.
                          robin
            robin of locksley. you know a
            short route to england, aslan?
                                               cut to:

                                                      8.
