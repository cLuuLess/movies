int. castle chamber - day
surrounded by flickering candles, marian sits before a
mirror. in a white wedding gown. her eyes faraway,
lifeless, in deep trance. mortianna sensuously combs
the bride's hair with her taloned fingers. the
sheriff's face appears in the reflection.
                        nottingham
         come!   it is time for the union.
the guards roughly haul marian to her feet.    she is
oblivious.
