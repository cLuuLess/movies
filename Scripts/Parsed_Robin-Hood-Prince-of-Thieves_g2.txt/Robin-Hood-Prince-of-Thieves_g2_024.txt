ext. forest clearing - day
a large tree trunk spans a swift-flowing river. the
ragged band of woodsmen approach the makeshift bridge.
stop in their tracks. robin stands on the bridge,
brandishing a long wooden staff.
                       robin
         this is my bridge. no one crosses
         without paying tax.
                       john little
         just bugger off, mate, huh?
                       robin
         if you wish to cross, it will
         cost you a gold medallion.
                       john little
         ain't i hurt you a bloody nuff
         for one day?
                       will scarlet
         if he's in a hurry to end his
         mortal misery, help him.
                                           (continued)

                                                      47.
continued:
                       robin
         you don't have the courage to
         face me again, john little? or
         should i call you 'little john'?
john grabs a hefty, gnarled staff.   strides to the
bridge.
                       john little
         alright, m'old cock. you wanna
         nuther good wallopin'?
his confidence melting, robin glances back at duncan
and aslan, who grins like a fan at a boxing match. john
storms at robin. staffs thrash. driven back, robin
connects a blow on john's foot.
the giant is off-balance. robin follows up. lands a
couple to the ribs. john responds with heavy swings,
which robin blocks deftly. back and forth, blow for
blow, all blocked. john chuckles with every swing.
enjoying the time of his life.
their staffs lock. it's strength against strength.
robin is no match. with one mighty thrust, john
hurtles him into the stream. the woodsmen cheer loudly.
aslan watches impassively.
robin scrambles back onto the bridge.   john waits,
grinning.
                       john little
         lil' wet behind the ears, mate?
                       will scarlet
         don't fool with him. get him!

john charges. robin fends him off, gets in some shots
of his own. john swings in a giant arc. robin ducks.
john loses balance and falls to his knees. robin allows
him time to right himself.
john comes at him again, pummeling. wood splinters from
the impact. brute force versus agility. agility is
beginning to prevail, when robin's staff splits in two.
                       john little
         swimmin' time again, ol' chum.
the coup de grace. lands heavily. robin teeters.
falls. disappears under the foaming water... does not
re-emerge. john waits. the spectators rush to the bank.
no sign.
                                            (continued)

                                                      48.
continued:
                       john little
         bloomin' shame. 'e were a brave
         'un.
suddenly robin arcs up out of the water. his hands clamp
onto john's ankles. robin heaves with all his might.
john topples headfirst into the water. surfaces in panic.
                        john little
         help!   cain't bloody swim.
he submerges again.   robin pulls his head above water.
                         robin
         do you yield?

the terrified giant sputters. goes under again, flailing
with arms and legs. robin holds his head just above the
surface.
                         robin
         do you yield?
                         john little
         yes!
                        robin
         good.   now put your feet down.
john struggles, then his feet hit bottom... the water
only reaches his chest.
                       john little
         i'll be buggered.
                       robin
         pay me the tax.
a tense pause while all wait for little's reaction.
                       john little
         robin hood, ya got balls o' solid
         rock.
he hands robin back the medallion. chuckling loudly, he
swoops robin up in his arms and carries him to the bank.
