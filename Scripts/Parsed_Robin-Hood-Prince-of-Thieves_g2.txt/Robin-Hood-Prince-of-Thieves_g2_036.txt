ext. forest road - day
autumn. the forest is a mosaic of green, gold, orange,
and red. a giant eye in a circle of glass. aslan, his
telescope raised.
                          aslan
            here they come.
                          robin
            how many?
                           aslan
            two wagons.   twenty escort.
                           robin
            twenty?   they usually have five.
he grabs the telescope.

scope pov
a phalanx of   mounted soldiers, a cart loaded with
barrels, and   a tax wagon. the wagon is an armored box on
wheels, with   crossbow slits in the side. guy of gisborne
commands the   escort.
back to scene
                          robin
            this is no ordinary convoy.
bull calls up from below, where a ragged group of woods-
men lies nervously in ambush.
                          bull
            'ow many?
                                                (continued)

                                                    65.
continued:
                       robin
         er, about ten.
                (then, to aslan)
         why scare them? they can't count
         anyway.
                       aslan
         and they call me the barbarian.
                         robin
         let's go.
together they run down the hill, keeping low.
gisborne eyes the forest. the beer cart is steered by a
fat red-faced friar, raucously singing hymns and quaffing
from a jug, which he repeatedly dips into one of the
barrels.
arrows whistle in. the friar yells and drops his jug. a
soldier is hit. at the forest edge, four woodsmen reload
their longbows. dressed in green, their faces
camouflaged.
the mounted soldiers charge them. the  woodsmen run into
the trees. as the horsemen close in,  the runners leap
into a trench. lift up matted screens  of brush and
grass. it's as if they disappeared.   the soldiers slash
wildly at the thick screens.
more arrows fly. more soldiers fall. the others spin
in confusion, trying to discern the enemy. more woods-
men break from cover. run down a narrow path. gisborne
urges his men to pursue. they ride in single file,
beating their way through the tangled branches.

the runners dive into the trees, as other men haul on
ropes, raising a giant screen in the soldiers' path. the
horses swerve, on the edge of a twenty-foot drop to the
river gorge. momentum  carries many of them over the
cliff.
back on roadway
robin and aslan swing down from the trees onto the tax
wagon. kick down the two drivers and take the reins,
steering the wagon off the road. the archers inside are
unable to fire at them.
little john leaps onto the beer cart, sending the friar
hurtling back among the barrels. the friar slams his
head and drops unconscious. john whips the horse,
driving the cart after robin. another camouflage screen
is lifted into place, covering their route.
                                           (continued)

                                                         66.
continued:
gisborne races back to the road... the wagons are gone.
he rides frantically back and forth. searching and
cursing.
