ext. dubois mansion - day
robin pounds on the door.    a hatch opens.     an old woman's
face.
                         old woman
           no beggars!
the hatch slams shut.    robin pounds again.
                         robin
           open up!

a pause.   the hatch slides back.
                         robin
           tell the mistress of the house
           that robin of locksley is at her
           door.
                         old woman
           her ladyship is not at home.
she slams the hatch again.    robin jams in his hand.
                         robin
           aagh!
he shouts through the hatch, over his bruised fingers.
                                                (continued)

                                                           32.
continued:
                          robin
            is the child marian at home?
                          old woman
            maybe she is. maybe she isn't.
            remove that hand.
robin refuses. she waits imperiously behind the locked
door. robin reluctantly withdraws his hand. instantly
the hatch slams.
                          aslan
            the hospitality here is as warm as
            the weather.

they wait, shivering... the door opens a crack.
                          old woman
            leave your weapons.
the three start forward.       her bony finger points at
robin.
                            old woman
            just you.
