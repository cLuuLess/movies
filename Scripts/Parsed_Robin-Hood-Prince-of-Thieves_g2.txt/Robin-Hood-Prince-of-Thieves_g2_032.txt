ext. nottingham cathedral
the sheriff maniacally spits out orders to gisborne.

                       nottingham
         starve them out. slaughter their
         livestock. i want to see locksley's
         own people fighting each other to
         bring him to us.
                       gisborne
         i swear he will not live to see
         the next full moon.
