ext. nottingham cathedral - day

robin runs to the courtyard and leaps on the sheriff's
horse, which is held by a stunned groom. he rides
through the busy marketplace. a crossbowman tracks
him. a sure shot.
marian spots the danger. she fakes being tripped and
stumbles into the bowman. his bolt flies harmlessly
into the air.
                       marian
                (innocently)
         please excuse my clumsiness.
robin charges for the city gate. as he passes, he kicks
the guard who hasseled him into the wall.
