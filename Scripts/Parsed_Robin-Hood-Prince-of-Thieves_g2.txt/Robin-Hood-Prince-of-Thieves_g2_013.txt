ext. locksley castle - night
ruins. the moon hovers ominously over the once-proud
castle. burned to the ground. gutted and deserted.
towers demolished. moat drained. robin stares, struck
dumb with horror.
the dark courtyard.   heartsick, robin stumbles over
debris.
                         robin
         father!    hello!
his voice echoes around the fallen battlements. aslan
places a hand on his shoulder and points... suspended
high on a tower wall is a decaying human corpse.


close - medallion
round the corpse's neck.   the locksley crest.
                        robin
         noooooo!
a paroxysm of rage and grief. he smashes furniture.
slams his fists relentlessly into the wall. pained,
aslan looks on.
                       robin
         i should have been here.
spent, he leans against the wall. in the silence, they
hear an eerie tapping. robin draws his sword... a
hunched, old man emerges, walking with the aid of a staff
... duncan.
                                           (continued)

                                                        23.
continued:
                       robin
                (shaking him)
         damn you, duncan. why didn't you
         cut him down?
                       duncan
         master robin, is it you? a
         miracle. i thought god had
         abandoned us.
                       robin
         you left my father to hang like
         a common thief, carrion for the
         crows.

                       aslan
         easy... look at him.
duncan steps into the moonlight.    his face crudely-
scarred.
                       robin
         what has happened?
                       duncan
         they say they captured him
         worshipping with the druids. he
         signed a confession before the
         bishop of hereford.
                       robin
         did they have witnesses?
                       duncan
         just one. kenneth of cowfall.
         the bishop decreed all the locksley
         lands forfeit.
                       robin
         did you believe the charges?
                       duncan
         not even when they took my eyes.
                       robin
         who did this to you, duncan?
                       duncan
         guy of gisborne. with the sheriff
         looking on.
robin holds the old retainer to his chest.    stares into
the night in silent rage.

                                                         24.
