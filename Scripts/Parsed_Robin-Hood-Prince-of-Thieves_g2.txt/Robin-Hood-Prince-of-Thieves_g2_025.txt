ext. sherwood forest - night
a bonfire crackles. the woodsmen drink, eat, argue, and
fight. a rabble. john passes robin a jug.
                        little john
         mead.   made it m'self.
                                           (continued)

                                                         49.
continued:
                          robin
                   (drinks)
            a fine brew, little john.
he spits black objects from his mouth.      dead bees.   john
grins.
                          little john
            real honey.
he takes the jug back. sneezes royally, spewing all over
the brew. oblivious, he hands the contaminated jug to
aslan.
                          aslan
            with regrets, i decline.
                          little john
            an englishman's mead not bleedin'
            good enough for ya?
                          aslan
            on the contrary. i thank you,
            but my faith prevents me from
            partaking in such enjoyments.
                          little john
            your bloody loss, mate.
he swigs.    passes the jug on to duncan, who drinks
heartily.    wulf cautiously approaches robin.
                          little john
            what is it, boy? speak up!
                          wulf
            i wanna thankee, lord locksley.
            i owes ya m'life.
                          robin
            you owe me nothing, wulf. i am
            glad i chanced by in time to help.
                          little john
            c'mon, lad, drink! 'twill put
            hair on your bloomin' chest.
wulf tries the brew. the impact is instant.       he turns
green and runs. his father cracks up.
                          robin
            tell me about your men, john.
john points to a short fellow with the build of a tree
trunk.
                                           (continued)

                                                      50.
continued:
                       little john
         this stumpy one 'ere's david o'
         doncaster. we calls 'im bull.
                       robin
         how do you come by the name, bull?
                       bull
         'cuz o' my size, sire.
                       robin
         because you are short?
                        bull
         nay.   'cuz i be so long.

proudly, he starts to pull down his pants.
                         robin
         no, bull.    save it for the ladies.
drunken laughter.    robin turns to the next man at the
fireside.
                       robin
         your name, friend?
the man's bald pate blushes scarlet as he tries to
respond, but he stutters too badly to get out a
comprehensible word.
                       little john
         that be hal brownwell, but the
         lads call i'm hal hiccup.
the others make hiccup and belching sounds, and crack up
at hal's embarrassment. hal strikes out angrily at his
tormentors.
                       robin
         hold! hal, you have the face and
         hands of a farmer. i wager you
         are a strong and honest man, and
         i'd be glad to have you at my side
         in a fight. the next man who makes
         light of you will have to answer
         to me.
there is murmuring around the group, but no one elects
to try it.
                       robin
         how is it there are so many of
         you in hiding?
                                             (continued)

                                                      51.
continued:
                       little john
         we're outlaws. got prices on our
         'eads, every man jack. blasted
         sheriff says we owes 'im taxes.
                       robin
         how do you fare?
                       little john
         we get by, i reckon.
                       robin
         while the sheriff steals your
         land and your families starve?

                       little john
         what in bloody blazes'd ya have
         us do?
                       robin
         your ghosts will only keep his
         men at bay so long, my friend.
         soon the sheriff will hunt you
         down and hang you. you must
         fight back.
                       little john
         we show as much as a toe outside
         the forest, they'll slaughter us
         like bleedin' sheep.
                       robin
         we must organize. win by guile.
                      little john
         'we'? ya lookin' to join us,
         matie?
                        robin
         no.   to lead you.
                       will scarlet
         ha! i would never be led by the
         son of a druid.
                       robin
         there are many here who knew my
         father to be a kind and generous
         man. i doubt that in their hearts
         they believe him capable of such a
         horror.
murmurs of agreement from around the fire.    robin turns
to will.
                                             (continued)
                                                       52.

continued:
                       robin
         what is your name, friend?
                       will scarlet
         count me not a friend, locksley.
                       little john
         stuff a flippin' cork in it, will.
         the man's our guest.
will gets up.   angrily pushes his way out of the group.
                       little john
         that there's will scarlet. pay 'im
         no 'eed. 'e's full o' piss and wind.

                       robin
         he is right to distrust me. i am
         a rich man's son. i have done no
         honest labor. but today i am as
         poor as any of you. nottingham
         has stolen all that i own. and
         when i killed gisborne's men, i,
         too, became an outlaw.
                       little john
         ya're full o'bloody wind an' all,
         mate. this 'ere load o' rubbish
         agin the sheriff's bloomin' army?
         ya must be bloody jokin'.
                        robin
         we can win.   and i believe we will.
                       little john
         ya're a daft bugger, robin hood,
         but ya're a brave 'un, i'll give
         ya that. drink up, laddie, cuz
         tomorrow ya mayn't be so lucky!
         tomorrow i shall best ya an' crack
         that blasted noble head in two.
laughing loudly, he throws back his head for a long
draught of mead.
