int. dungeons - day
carrying a flaming torch, tuck runs down the dark passage-
ways. before him, an awesome sight... dozens of pitiful
men in cages. suddenly he is confronted by the jailer.
a cruel behemoth of a man, carrying a spiked club.
                       friar
                (pious)
         my son, there is a holy war being
         waged outside. release all these
         wretches and god shall surely find
         you a place in heaven.
                       jailer
         i'd rather go to hell!
wham! tuck takes the lethal cudgel full in the chest.
flies back.
