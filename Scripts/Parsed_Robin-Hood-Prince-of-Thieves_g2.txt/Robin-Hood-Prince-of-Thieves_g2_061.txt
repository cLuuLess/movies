ext. woodsmen's camp - day
chaos. acrid black smoke pours across the clearing.
disarray. coughing, screaming, confusion. little john
vainly attempts to instill calm.
                        little john
          ya'll be jus' fine. lil' smoke
          ain't gonna kill ya.
scared and injured woodsmen careen out of the trees.
full retreat.
                        will scarlet
                 (running up)
          it's burning for miles, john.
          it's hotter than hades, and them
          damn screens ain't worth nothing.
two woodsmen, blinded and choking, stumble into one of
their own camouflaged pits. hideous screams as they're
impaled on hidden stakes. john tries to gather the able-
bodied men to his side.
                        little john
          'ere, lads... over 'ere! we must
          make a stand.
most of them keep on running.
                        little john
          damn y'all! ya're no more use
          than a load o' wet farts.
                        will scarlet
          where's that damn locksley?   i'll
          swear he betrayed us.
                        little john
          bollocks, will. quit yer bloody
          bellyachin'.
hal runs to join them, stuttering.
