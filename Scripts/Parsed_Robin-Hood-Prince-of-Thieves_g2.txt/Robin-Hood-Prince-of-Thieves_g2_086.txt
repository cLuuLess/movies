ext. castle parapet - day
crossbow bolts fly. little john ducks and weaves, while
spinning and firing at the men advancing at him from both
sides.
                       little john
         come on, ya ckicken-'earted buggers.
         ya milksops, ya bleedin' pansies.
he can't shoot fast enough. as they descend on him, he
leaps from the battlements onto a soldier's back. grabs
his sword.
                       little john
         excuse me, m 'old cock. ya mind
         if i borrow this?
he's backed up against a battlement, outnumbered five to
one.
