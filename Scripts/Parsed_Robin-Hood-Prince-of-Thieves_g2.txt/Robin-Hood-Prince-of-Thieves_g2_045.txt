int. bishop's castle - day
the letter is held in the pudgy, jeweled fingers of the
bishop of hereford. a lavish office.
                       marian
         it is a personal matter, my lord,
         but one of vital importance.
                       bishop
         i understand, my dear lady.
         this is my most trusted emissary.
he hands the letter to a solemn courier.
                                             (continued)

                                                      79.
continued:
                       marian
         you will travel to france
         immediately. you must give this
         directly into the hands of the
         king, and him alone.
the courier bows in acknowledgement.    marian indicates
sarah.
                       marian
         my lady-in-waiting will accompany
         you.
surprised, the courier glances at the bishop.

                       bishop
         my dear, i could not vouch for
         her safety. the journey is fraught
         with danger.
                       marian
         i appreciate your concern, my
         lord, but sarah is an accomplished
         rider. i must insist that she
         goes along.
                       bishop
                (a beat)
         as you wish.
