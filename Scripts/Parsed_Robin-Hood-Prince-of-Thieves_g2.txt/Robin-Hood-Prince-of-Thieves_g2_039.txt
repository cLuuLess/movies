int. woodsman's hut - night
the walls shake with little john's laughter.
                       little john
         sure changed the color of 'is
         britches, didn't 'e?
                       robin
         thanks to our cannibal friend.
aslan repeats his wildman act, munching on a chunk of
venison.
                       little john
         gonna laugh my bloody balls off.
                       bull
         why'd the sheriff be sendin' gold
         north o' the border?
                       robin
         to hire mercenaries. the celts
         are savage tribesmen, trained
         to kill from birth.

                       little john
         aye, the romans built a bleedin'
         great wall to keep 'em out.
                       bull
         what does 'e want wi 'em?
                       robin
         since he also has every smith
         in the country working in his
         castle, we can assume he is
         planning a little war.
                       little john
         agin' who?

                       aslan
         england.
