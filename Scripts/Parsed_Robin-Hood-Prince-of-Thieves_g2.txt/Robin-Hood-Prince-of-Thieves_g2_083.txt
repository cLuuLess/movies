ext. city square - day
wulf crosses himself as the executioner steers him to the
noose. a hush falls... except for a rotund old woman who
is barging to the front. and a wounded soldier, his head
bandaged, who eases her path, striking out with his tree-
branch crutch.
                       wounded soldier
         give room for a fightin' man and
         his ma. step aside, or i'll make
         ya. i wanna see the bastards walk
         on air.
