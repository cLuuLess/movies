             ext. rocky beach - outside nightmute - morning

             ...the dark figure.  disappearing back into the fog.  closing
             in around him like milky water...

             we whip out our smith 39/13...plunge in after him...taking
             chase...breathing hard...leaping from rock to rock...the fog,
             blanket thick...tightening around us...

             our feet.  hit water.  up to our ankles.  icy cold.  we
             run...sloshing through...when...

             suddenly

             a dark figure.  appears ahead.  big and hulking...crashing
             towards us...

             we raise our weapon...quick as a flash...as the figure
             emerges...

             and in a split second...

             we lock eyes with figure's - his eyes, brown and gentle...

             crack!  we fire!  the figure grips his gut, falls into the
             water.

             heart pounding.  adrenaline pumping.  we slosh towards the
             body.  something...catching our eye...

             a 357 ruger

             lying in the rocks.  off to the side.  we grab it.  turn back
             to the body...

             and stop cold.

             that's when it hits us.  that's when we realize...
