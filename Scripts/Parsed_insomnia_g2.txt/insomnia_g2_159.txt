             ext. back yard - summer house

             the sky, heavy with clouds.  the air, foreboding.  will
             steals out the screen door.  gun cocked.  eyes scanning.
             wind, bending the weeds, the trees.

             bam! a shot.  out of nowhere.  rips into his thigh.  will
             cries out.  bam! a second shot.  whizzes past him...
