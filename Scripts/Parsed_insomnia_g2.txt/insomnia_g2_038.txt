             int. will's room - late night

             bang!  will bolts upright in bed.  a film of sweat over his
             body.  breathing hard.  the sound that woke him: the window
             shade flapping open.  light floods the room.

             will gets up.  goes over to the shade and pulls it down.  it
             lurches up halfway.  he tugs it down again.  it slaps all the
             way open.  will yanks it down so hard it rips off the window.

                                 will
                       goddammit!

             he gets tangled in it.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       goddamned...thing!

             pulls it off and flings it in the corner.
