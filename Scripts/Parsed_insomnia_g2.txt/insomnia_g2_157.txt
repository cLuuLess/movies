             int. front hall - continuous

             ellie.  gun swinging.  doorway one.  doorway two.  doorway 
             three...suddenly

             a figure

             runs past number one.  big.  shadowy.  the flash of a gun.
             she wheels toward it.  finger on the trigger...

             slo-mo...the figure, passing.  her heart, pounding.  her
             finger...squeezing...

             will dormer or walter byrd?

             at the last second, she jerks the gun away.  the figure 
             disappears.  she swallows.  gripping the gun.  follows.
