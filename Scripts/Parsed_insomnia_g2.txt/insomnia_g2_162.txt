             int. boathouse

             the boathouse.  old, rotted wood.  crumbling beams.

             walter stands at a window.  re-loading his shotgun.  he
             fumbles, drops a shell.  it rolls towards a crack in the
             floor.  falls into the lake water below.

             click!  walter levels the shotgun out the window.

             walter's pov - the long, undulating weeds outside.
