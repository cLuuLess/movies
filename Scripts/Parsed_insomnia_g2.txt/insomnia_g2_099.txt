             int. ferry - minutes later

             ferry's getting pitched around in the roiling water.  most
             everyone is inside.  tourists with throw-away cameras,
             backpacks, anoraks, children.  some looking sea-sick in the
             corner.

             will weaves through the crowd.  eyes darting, searching.  the
             ferry lurches to one side, the crowd sways, will spots

             walter byrd standing by a window.
