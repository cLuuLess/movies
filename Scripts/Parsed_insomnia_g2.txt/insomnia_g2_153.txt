             walter jerks open another drawer.  a stack of books teeter on
             the top of the cabinet.  he finds what he needs.  shells.
             grabs a handful...

             the books tumble down on top of him.  he cries out, covering
             his head...touches his ear, panics - hearing aid's gone!
             looks up.  will, coming down the hall...
