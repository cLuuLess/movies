             ext. cemetery - nightmute - day

             will, walking up to the wrought-iron gate surrounding the
             cemetery.  stops.  puts his hands up to the bars.

             kay connell's grave

             on the other side.  newly dug.  a mound of dirt.  flowers,
             scattered by the wind.  daughter and friend...1982-1999.

             will.  grips the bars.  as if he's seeing it for the first
             time.  really seeing it.

             closes his eyes.
 
             what have i done?
