             close on a finger.  running along a row of book spines.
             brundt...buckley...buss...buckham...byrie...

             pull back to reveal will in nightmute's small bookstore.
             still in his funeral clothes.

             in the "mystery!" section.  not finding what he wants.  then,
             something catches his eye:  a bargain bin at the end of the 
             aisle.  will limps down to it.  avoides eye-contact with a
             young woman shelving "new arrivals!"

             reaches into the bin.  rummages through some paperbacks.
             then he finds it:  otherwise engaged by walter byrd.
             underneath the title, he finds what he's looking for:
             another j. brody mystery.  flips to the inside of the cover.

             a blurry picture of walter byrd.  head turned to the side.
             walter byrd was born in watson lake, canada.  he graduated...

             will's eyes skip down to the bottom:

             mr. byrd currently lives in umkumiut, alaska, with his two
             labrador retrievers, lucy and desi.

             will looks up.  slaps the book closed.
