             int. will's room - night

             close on a nail.  one thwack of a hammer and it bites into
             the wall.  pull back to reveal will nailing the corner of a
             blanket to one side of the window.  an ad hoc curtain.

             he finishes that side.  starts to stretch the blanket across
             the window.  hesitates.  looks outside.  to the left.  to the
             right.  to see if anybody's out there.  if anybody's
             watching.  sees instead...

             a lone tugboat chugging across the harbor.  pulling a huge
             freighter.  will squeezes his eyes shut.  opens them again.
             pulls the blanket fully across the window.
