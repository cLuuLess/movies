             int. summer house - continuous

             will heads down a hallway.  dark, narrow, floorboards worn.
             more shit stacked up.

             each step, careful, quiet.  tracking.  listening.  a breeze
             sweeps through.  the burned-out lightbulb hanging from the 
             ceiling, starts swinging.

                                 walter (o.s.)
                       here to visit me?

             will whips around.

             walter standing there.  at the other end of the hallway.
             shoulders slumped.

             will shakes his head.

                                 will
                       no.

             flies, bouncing against the screen door.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       i'm here to end this.

             walter looks around.

                                 walter
                       where's your back-up?

                                 will
                       no back-up.

                                 walter
                       you're not following procedure.

                                 will
                       procedure went out the window a long time
                       ago.

             walter looks at him.

                                 walter
                       we're on the same side, will.  you know
                       that.  after what we've been through
                       together.  we're partners.  bound by a
                       secret.

             will takes a step forward...

                                 will
                       that's where you're wrong, walter.

             slowly reaches into his jacket...

                                 will (cont'd)
                       there is no secret.  because the biggest
                       difference between you and me is what we
                       will or will not live with...

             pulls out his smith and wesson.  walter.  looks at the gun.
             inches back.

                                 walter 
                       will...

             suddenly, darts out of sight.  swings back into the doorway
             with a shotgun...

             bam!  will's shoulder explodes with blood.
