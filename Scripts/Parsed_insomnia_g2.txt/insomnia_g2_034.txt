             int. alley - continuous

             a couple industrial trash bins.  will leans his hand against
             the wall and vomits.  hovers for a moment, saliva dripping
             from his mouth.  braces himself.  heaves again.  hears a 
             buzzing behind him.  turns.

             a dead dog lying next to a dumpster.  flies buzzing around
             its head.  teeth bared.  eyes wide open.

             like it's watching him.
