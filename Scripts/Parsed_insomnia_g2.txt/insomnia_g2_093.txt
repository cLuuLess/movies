             int. stairway - diamond tooth road - umkumiut - late night

             a dark stairway.  late at night.  will, bathed in shadows.
             climbs to the top.  quietly, carefully.  he heads down a
             hallway.  we recognise it.  back where walter byrd lives.
 
             will approaches apartment "b."  slowly pulls out his weapon.
             cocks it.  waits a beat then swings out in front of the door.
             ready to fight.  ready to confront.  looks down...

             tile corner's still there.
