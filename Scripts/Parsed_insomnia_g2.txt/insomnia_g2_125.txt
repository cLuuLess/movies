             int. shanty bar - nightmute - night

             close on a tray of dark beer.  five glasses, foam sloshing.

                                 farrell (o.s.)
                       i can't believe it.  randy stetz.

             pull back to reveal farrell, rich, francis, and will sitting
             at a small, round table.  fred's passing out the beers.  dive
             bar.  music blaring.  3 a.m. happy hour! banner on the wall.
             place packed with rough-looking fishermen.

             rich takes a glass from fred.

                                 rich
                       what do you mean, you can't believe it?

                                 francis
                       he was an asshole.

                                 farrell
                       that doesn't mean anything.

             fred sits.  takes a sip of his beer.  to farrell.

                                 fred
                       didn't you grow up with him?

             farrell shifts in his seat.

                                 farrell
                       our dads were on the same boat.
                           (to will)
                       we used to wait for them together.

             will nods.  jostled by the crowd.  reaches for his beer.

                                 francis
                       he used to pick fights at the gas
                       station.

                                 rich
                       and remember when he did all those donut
                       holes that one summer?

             he and francis guffaw.

                                 fred
                       just a bad seed.

             farrell looks over at will.

                                 farrell
                       how do you like our beer?

             will slams down his empty glass.  squeezes his eyes open and
             shut.  loud music.  cigarette smoke.

                                 will
                       i like it fine.

             fred pats will's shoulder.

                                 fred
                       what detective dormer needs is a little
                       shut-eye.

                                 rich
                       the white nights been hard on you?

                                 will
                       they haven't been easy.

             francis grabs a handful of peanuts.

                                 francis
                       they don't have titanium shades over at
                       the pioneer.

                                 rich
                       well no wonder.

                                 francis
                       you lose all sense of time.

                                 farrell
                       better than fred's home town.

             will turns to fred.  wiping the foam from his moustache.

                                 fred
                       my people are from barrow.  way up north.

                                 rich
                       in the winter there's no sunlight for
                       five straight months.

                                 fred
                       like being swallowed up in a black hole.

             just then.

                                 ellie (o.s.)
                       hi, guys.

             they look up.  ellie standing by their table.  jeans, down
             vest.  hair tousled.

                                 fred
                       nancy drew!  pull up a seat!

                                 francis
                       you hear what happened, ellie?

                                 ellie
                       yeah.

                                 rich
                       pretty cool.

                                 farrell
                       rich found the gun.

                                 ellie
                       i know.  i heard.

             fred leans back in his seat.  eyeballs ellie.

                                 fred
                       something's on nancy's mind.

             ellie reaches into her vest pocket.  pulls out a ziploc with
             the shell casing inside.

                                 ellie
                       i found this out on the beach.

                                 farrell
                       what is it?

                                 ellie
                       shell casing.  9mm.

             will, blanches.

                                 francis
                       let it go, ell.  we got the bad guy.

                                 ellie
                       none of us carries a 9mm duty weapon.
                       and the murder weapon was a 357.

             rich throws peanut shells at her.

                                 rich
                       get a hobby, will ya?

             ellie brushes off the shells.  looks right at will.

                                 ellie
                       it's a legitimate point, isn't it,
                       detective dormer?

             everyone turns to will.  their faces, spinning.  he nods.

                                 will
                       it's legitimate.

                                 ellie
                       worth pursuing?

             he looks up.  holds her gaze.  then turns away.  grabs the
             side of the table.

                                 will
                       the case is closed, ellie.
                           (gets up)
                       i got the next round.

             the guys don't protest.  will starts heading for the bar.
             weaving through broad shoulders, massive backs.  smoke.
             music.  laughter.  arguing.  a mass of bodies and sound.
             like being swallowed up in a black hole...

             looks back at the table.
 
             ellie, watching him.
