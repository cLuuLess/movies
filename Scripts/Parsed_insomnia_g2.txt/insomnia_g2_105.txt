             int. will's room - late night

             will bolts up.  white as a sheet.

                                 will
                       i didn't know!

             his body, drenched in sweat.  his breathing, quick and
             ragged.  caught up in the twisted sheets of his bed.  looks
             across the room and sees

             hap

             sitting in the corner.  eating an apple with a penknife.

                                 hap
                       you sure about that, buddy?

             he smiles.  sympathetic.  looks over at the window just as...

             the blanket.  drops to the floor.  

             light floods the room.
