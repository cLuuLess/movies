             int. bullpen - nightmute pd - continuous

             rain hammering against the windows.  chief nyback addresses
             the bullpen.  everyone's there except farrell.

                                 chief nyback
                       ...nightmute hasn't lost an officer in
                       thirty-seven years, and even though
                       detective eckhart wasn't from here, he
                       was as good as one of us on this case.  i
                       had the honor of working with him down in
                       seattle for a number of years.  he was a
                       fine detective and an even better man.

             will stands nearby, watching the rain hit the windows.  his
             suit pants are slightly wrinkled.  nyback nods towards fred.

                                 chief nyback (cont'd)
                       fred, you'll be working with detective
                       dormer directly from now on.

             fred, stroking his moustache, nods.  nyback turns to will.

                                 chief nyback (cont'd)
                       will?  anything you'd like to add?

             will looks up.  everyone's eyes turn to him.  he shakes his
             head.

                                 chief nyback
                       okay.  then let's get to it.

             feet shuffling.  chairs scraping the floor as people get up.
             a sense of determination in the air.  will grabs his coat.

                                 ellie (o.s.)
                       detective dormer?

             he turns.  ellie is beside him, holding a map.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       i'm sorry to bother you, but i was asked
                       to write the report on...
                           (lowers eyes)
                       ...you know what i was asked to write the
                       report on...
                           (looks back up)
                       ...could you, just to be accurate, for
                       the report, could you just point out
                       where you were when you saw detective
                       eckhart yesterday?

             she holds out the map.  it's of the small stretch of
             coastline.  red circles marking various points.

             will looks down at her.  takes the map.  turns it around.

                                 will
                       it's good to be accurate, ellie.  you're
                       doing your job.

             he looks down at the map.  ellie watching his face.

                                 ellie
                       i'm so sorry about what happened.  i know
                       you did everything you could...

             will points to a spot.  cutting her off.

                                 will
                       i was here.

             hands her back the map.  smiles.  just then fred walks up.

                                 fred
                       dormer.  still no sign of the bullet that
                       went through farrell.

                                 will
                       i'm going to the hospital to talk to him
                       now.
                           (looks at his watch)
                       you get the search party together.  no
                       fewer than thirty people.  i'll meet you
                       in exactly twenty-five minutes.  don't
                       waste any time.

             he pulls on his coat and heads for the door.  fred watches
             him leave.  sticks a toothpick in his mouth.

                                 fred
                       partner or no partner.  that guy's a
                       prick.

                                 ellie
                       he has to be a prick, fred.  he's a great
                       detective.
