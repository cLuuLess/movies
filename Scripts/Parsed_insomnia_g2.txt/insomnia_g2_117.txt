             int. randy stetz's room - nightmute - day

             a dark, narrow boarding room.  a hand reaches through an open
             window.  feels for the lock on the door.  click.

             will enters randy stetz's place.  cigarette butts, electric
             guitar, hustler centerfolds tacked on the walls.

             he looks around.  every inch of him revolting against what
             he's about to do.
