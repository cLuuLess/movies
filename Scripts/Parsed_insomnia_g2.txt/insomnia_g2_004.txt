             ext. landing strip - outside nightmute - day

             a sign swinging in the wind: nightmute, alaska.  halibut
             fishing capital of the world!

             pull back to reveal it hanging from the eave of a small,
             corrugated building.  the "airport."  nothing else for miles
             around.

             a mud-splattered jeep cherokee pulls up next to it.  brakes
             screeching.  a young woman hops out.  about 23.  petite with
             short, brown hair.

             peers up at the sky.  brightens at the sight of the bush
             plane coming in for landing.  smooths down her down vest.
             making sure the gold shield on her belt's visible.  nervous.
             excited.

                                 old man (o.s.)
                       eleanor?

             ellie burr turns.  shields her eyes from the sun.  an old man
             hosing down the side of the building.

                                 ellie
                       hey, mr. angstrom!

                                 mr. angstrom
                       what're you doing here?

             ellie puffs up.

                                 ellie
                       police business.

                                 mr. angstrom
                       police business?

             the old man screws up his face, confused.  

                                 mr. angstrom (cont'd)
                       didn't you used to baby-sit for us? 

                                 ellie
                       i don't babysit any more, mr. angstrom.
                       just made detective three weeks ago.

             a cat jumps down off the roof.  angstrom sprays it.

                                 mr. angstrom
                       boy, charlie must be short-handed down at
                       the station.

             ellie, used to not being taken seriously.  turns back to the
             roar of the bush plane as it taxis down the strip.  coming to
             a stop.  she hurries over as the door swings open and...

             will dormer steps down.  slipping on his sunglasses.
             scanning the nothingness around him.  spots the swinging
             sign.

                                 will
                       "halibut fishing capital of the world."

             hap, right behind him.  rubs his neck.

                                 hap
                       this ought to be interesting.

                                 ellie
                           (over the engine)
                       detective dormer!

             they look down.  ellie reaches up and takes will's bag.  then
             his hand.  shakes it vigorously.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       it's a huge honor to meet you!  ellie
                       burr.  i'm here to take you to the
                       station!

             will motions to hap.

                                 will
                       my partner...

                                 ellie
                       detective eckhart!  i know!  welcome to
                       nightmute!

             she leads them away from the plane.  takes will's briefcase.

                                 ellie
                       i just want to say how incredible it is 
                       to have you working with us, detective
                       dormer.  i've followed all your cases.
                       theodore dineli, frank and casey
                       prud'homme, the port angeles shootings...

             opens the back of the jeep.  puts the bags inside.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       ...and especially the leland street
                       murders.  that was my case study at the
                       academy.

             the pilot walks by.  taps her on the shoulder.

                                 pilot
                       tell your dad the game's gonna start late
                       this week, ellie.

                                 ellie
                       sure thing, spence.

             she looks back at will.  can't help but focus in on his scar.
             touches her own smooth neck.  in awe.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       that's where ronald langley cut you in
                       the basement of his father's house on 325
                       leland, isn't it?

             will smiles, taken aback by this girl's exuberance.

                                 will
                       you did your homework, officer.

                                 ellie
                       actually...

             she throws a quick glance at angstrom.  out of ear-shot.

                                 ellie
                       i just made detective three weeks ago.
