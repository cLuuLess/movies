             int. restaurant - pioneer lodge - night

             the pioneer lodge restaurant.  small, dark wood, a radio
             playing something between bluegrass and folk.  some rough-
             looking guys at the bar.  throwing looks over at...

             will and hap, sitting at a table.  studying faded menus.

                                 will
                           (reading)
                       halibut calabrese.  halibut olympia.
                       halibut cajun style.  halibut fish and
                       chips...

             he puts down his menu.  reaches for his drink.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       can't wait to see what's for dessert.

                                 hap
                       at least there's variety.

             will drains his drink.  locks eyes with a big guy over at the
             bar.  beer froth on his moustache.

                                 will
                       looks like the natives are restless.

                                 hap
                       will?

             will looks back at his partner.  hap's fidgeting with the end
             of his tie.

                                 hap (cont'd)
                       i think, i think i'm gonna talk to buck
                       when we get back to seattle.

             a cold flash down will's spine.

                                 hap
                       i wish i could stick it out like you.  i
                       just, with trish and the kids...

                                 will
                       don't do this, hap...

             hap avoids his eyes.

                                 hap
                       i'm thinking i could get off with
                       probation.  keep half my pension.  that's
                       all i want.

                                 will
                           (hisses)
                       goddammit, hap.  think about what you're
                       doing...

                                 hap
                       you don't have to be involved, will.

                                 will
                       you tell buck and i'm involved whether i
                       like it or not...

                                 rachel (o.s.)
                       ready to order?

             the men look up, interrupted.  rachel is standing by the
             table with a pad.  hap tries to recover with a big smile.

                                 hap
                       hey - you do everything around here?

                                 rachel
                       just about.

             will stands abruptly.  eyes on hap.  trying not to explode.

                                 will
                       i'll just have another scotch in my room.
                           (turns to rachel)
                       if you don't mind.

             just then, his cell phone rings.
