             ext. boathouse

             will staggers out on to the dock.  drops his gun.  crashes to
             his knees.  falls back.  his face, pale.  lying against the
             wood of the dock.

             rain drops.  start to fall.  washing the blood from his skin.
             puckering the lake water.  will's eyes...flutter...

             footsteps...running along the dock.  heavy boots...

                                 ellie (o.s.)
                       detective dormer!

             will squints against the rain.  makes out the face of

             ellie hovering over him.  he gives a half-smile.

                                 will
                       god, you're a pain in the ass.

             ellie kneels down next to him.  pulls over her vest.  covers
             him.

                                 ellie
                       you're shot.

             will looks at her bloody shoulder.

                                 will
                       you, too.

             ellie, tearing off her boot.  yanks off her sock.

                                 ellie
                       i'm going to make a tourniquet.

             will, fading fast.

                                 will
                       walter byrd killed kay connell.  her
                       things are in the house.

                                 ellie
                       i know.

                                 will
                       byrd's dead.

             ellie, wraps the sock around his leg.  starts twisting.  will
             grimaces.  ellie swallows.  doesn't want to ask this.

                                 ellie
                       you shot detective eckhart, didn't you?

             will nods.

                                 will
                       yes.

             a pained looks crosses ellie's face.

                                 ellie
                       did you mean to?

             will shakes his head.

                                 will
                       no.  but i covered it up.  i lied.

                                 ellie
                       why?

             rain, drumming down around them.  will, takes a deep breath.

                                 will
                       because i just couldn't be wrong.
                           (looks at her)
                       don't ever get that way, ellie.  don't 
                       ever lose your way.  it blurs the line.

             his blood, pumping out in rivulets.  ellie looks down at him. 
             her hero.  moves up to the wound in his arm.

                                 ellie
                       this one looks worse.

             will reaches up a feeble hand.  stops her.

                                 will
                           (whispers)
                       just let me sleep, ellie...

             his eyelids, growing heavy.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       let me sleep.

             ellie blinks away the tears.  knows what he means.  what he
             wants.  watches as the calm spreads over him.

             will closes his eyes.

                                 ellie
                       no!

             will opens his eyes.  she ties the second sock around his
             arm.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       i will not let you sleep.  if you've lost
                       your way then you have to make it right.
                       that's the only way.  that's what you'd
                       tell me.  i've been a detective for four
                       weeks and i say you're coming with me.

             she gets up.  slips her arms under his shoulders.  starts
             hoisting him up.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       c'mon...

             will.  struggling to his knees.  every inch of him, screaming
             in pain.  gets to his feet.  arm slung around this tiny,
             young woman.

                                 will
                       what about your shoulder?

                                 ellie
                       don't worry.  i'll have a cool scar.

             and they head, slowly but surely, back down the dock.
