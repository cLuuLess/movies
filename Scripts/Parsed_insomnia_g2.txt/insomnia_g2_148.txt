             int. hallway - continuous

             walter walking down the hall.  will, writhing on the floor,
             reaches for his back holster...gun's not there!

             walter stands over him.  swings his leg back and...crack!
             kicks will in the ribs.  the pain, blinding.  will gasps.

             crack! again, crack! again, crack! again.  walter's face.
             calm, flushed.  a vein along his temple.  

             will's eyes flutter.  blood, spewing from his lips.  a thud!
             to his kidneys.  walter stops, out of breath.  hand on hip.

                                 walter
                       you give the police a bad name, will.

             will's hand suddenly shoots out.  grabs the shotgun barrel.

             walter stumbles back.  the shotgun goes off.  bam!  chunks of
             ceiling rain down.  walter falls to the ground.
