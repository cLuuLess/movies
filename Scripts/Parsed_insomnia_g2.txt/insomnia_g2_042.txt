             int. hospital room - st. francis hospital - day

             close on the cover of one of the paperbacks, otherwise
             engaged by walter byrd.

             pull back to reveal farrell lying in a hospital bed in
             striped pajamas, reading it.  a tear runs down his cheek as
             he turns the page.

             a snickers bar is tossed onto his lap.  he looks up.  face
             brightens.

                                 farrell
                       detective dormer!

            will stands by his bed.  farrell puts down the book.  picks
            up the snickers.

                                 farrell (cont'd)
                       you don't seem like the bring-an-
                       underling-who's-in-the-hospital-a-
                       snickers-bar kind of guy.

                                 will
                       i'm not.

             he pulls up a chair.  nods to the paperback.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       how's the book?

             farrell bites into the candy bar.

                                 farrell
                       oh, a real tear-jerker.  brody, the good
                       guy, just got shot.

             he stops chewing.  realises the association.  swallows
             uncomfortably.

                                 farrell (cont'd)
                       oh.  i'm sorry.  about hap.  detective
                       eckhart.

                                 will
                       thanks.

                                 farrell
                       i wish i'd had the chance to get to know
                       him better.  take him fishing or
                       something.

                                 will
                       he would have liked that.

                                 farrell
                       we just gotta catch the bastard, right?

                                 will
                       that's why i'm here.  i need to know
                       exactly what you saw yesterday, farrell.

                                 farrell
                       what i saw?

                                 will
                       anything.  it's important.

             farrell takes another bite of the snickers.  like a little
             boy.  furrows his brow, trying to remember.

                                 farrell
                       pretty much nothing.  that fog was so
                       thick.  the bullet seemed to come out of
                       nowhere.  i don't even remember seeing 
                       any shapes.  then i saw you.  but only
                       when you came up close.  then you
                       disappeared again.
                           (shrugs)
                       i guess i heard more than i saw.

             will sighs, rubs his eyes.

                                 farrell (cont'd)
                       sorry.

                                 will
                       no.  no.  don't be sorry.  it's not your
                       fault.

             just then a nurse comes in with a dixie cup.  pretty,
             freckled face.  not much older than kay connell.

                                 nurse
                       time for your meds.

             farrell smiles at her, winks at will.

                                 farrell
                       lonnie and i went to high school
                       together.

             lonnie gives him the cup.

                                 lonnie
                       just take the pills, farrell.

                                 will
                       how's the leg?

                                 farrell
                       oh, you know.  don't feel that much.
                       bullet went right through.

                                 will
                       right.  got lost in the rocks.

                                 farrell
                       we'll get the other one, though.

             will looks up.  farrell pops the rest of the snickers in his
             mouth.

                                 farrell (cont'd)
                       after the autopsy.
