             int. will's room - continuous

             ...his room.  rachel follows.  looks around at the mess.

                                 rachel
                       are you alright?

             will grabs up a sweater.

                                 will
                       i'm fine.

             he heads back over to the window.  rachel now notices all the
             stuff piled up.  softens her voice.

                                 rachel
                       did something happen?

             will.  cramming the sweater into a crack.

                                 will
                       no.

             rachel walks up behind him.  his cramming, more desperate.
             more urgent.

                                 rachel
                       will...

             he grabs a magazine.

                                 will
                       the light.  it keeps coming in...

             rachel reaches out.  catches his arm.

                                 rachel
                       will.

             he stops.  looks down at her hand.

                                 rachel (cont'd)
                       what happened?

             will suddenly realises what he's doing.  absurd.  pathetic. 
             pitiful.  slowly turns to face rachel.

             her eyes, looking up at him.  his shoulders droop.
             exhausted.  rachel reaches up.  catches him in her arms.
             strong arms.  caring.  will buries his face in her neck.
             wants to be swallowed up.

             rachel holds him.  arms encircling.  will breathes her in.
             sweet, soft, safe.

             looks up.  his mouth suddenly finding hers.  a kiss, hungry,
             urgent.  his arms move to surround her.
