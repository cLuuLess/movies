             ext. mainstreet - nightmute - late night

             will walking down main street.  in the middle of the road.
             the dead of night.  no cars.  the sky a blinding white.

             hears some rowdy noise coming from a corner bar, beer lights
             flickering.  a woman rides by on a bicycle.  birds singing.
 
             not day.  not night.  stuck somewhere in between.  like a
             dream.

             turns down a side street.  passing more stores.  guns and
             ammo.  patty's hair and nails.  general store.  comes upon
     
             the alley

             where he vomited the day before.  stops.  sees the dead dog,
             still down at the end.  half obscured by the dumpster.

             will wavers, pale.  suddenly...

             a homeless man emerges from the shadows.  big.  wild-eyed.
             awakened from his sleep.  will, quickly backtracks to the
             sidewalk.  spooked.

             just then the crack! of bat hitting ball.  he turns.  in the 
             distance.  nightmute elementary school.
