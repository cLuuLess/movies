             int. window - ferry

             walter holds on to the railing.  looking at the view, the sea
             spray.  will comes up.  stands next to him.  cognizant of the
             people around them.

                                 will
                       walter byrd.

             walter continues looking out the window.  that same stuffed-
             nose voice.

                                 walter
                       when i was seven my mother and
                       grandmother took me to vancouver.  we
                       were walking along the street one day
                       when these two men ran past and snatched
                       my grandmother's purse right from under
                       her arm.  right from under her arm.  that
                       night a police officer came to our hotel 
                       room to ask us questions.  stood the
                       whole time.

             the ferry pitches again.  will grabs on to the railing.
             looking down at this little man.  hate in his eyes.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       his uniform looked brand new.  his shoes
                       and badge were polished, his billy club,
                       his belt buckle.  all perfect.  he was
                       like a soldier, but better.

             walter reaches up to blow his nose.  will's eyes look on in
             disgust - his knuckles are still red and swollen.  from
             beating kay connell to death.

                                 walter (cont'd) 
                       made a huge impression on me.  his
                       goodness.  gave me an instant respect for
                       the police.  i tried to become a cop when
                       i left high school, but...

             he points to his hearing-aid.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       congenital problem.

             the ferry's engine hums to a stop.  walter smiles.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       oh.  we're here.
