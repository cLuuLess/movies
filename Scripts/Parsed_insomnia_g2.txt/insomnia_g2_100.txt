             ext. gendreau glacier - day

             gendreau glacier.  spilling down between two huge mountains.
             enormous in its whiteness, its coldness, its silent power.

             will and walter walk up its face, away from the other
             tourists.  walter leads the way.  hands in his pockets.

                                 walter
                       you know this glacier moves a quarter of
                       an inch every day?

             he points off to the horizon.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       and on a clear day you can see all the
                       way over to newtok.  there's a beautiful
                       aviary over there.  we can go sometime.

             will's lip curls.  watching him.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       it's actually cool for this time of year.
                       normally the temperature runs about...

             suddenly will lunges at him.  walter's eyes widen in surprise
             as he grabs him up by the collar.  nose to nose.  will barely
             keeping control.

                                 will
                       you think this is a nice meeting we're 
                       having here?  friendly?  two people
                       getting acquainted?
                           (jerks him harder)
                       you sick, coward, fuck.  i get up every
                       morning of my life just to bring someone
                       like you down.  beating a seventeen year-
                       old girl to death.  washing her
                       afterwards, cleaning her.  make you feel
                       like a real man?
                           (tightens his grip)
                       huh?

             walter flounders.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       i outta end this right now.  take a rock
                       and smash your fucking skull in...

             his jaws tense, nostrils flare.  walter, red-faced,
             sputtering...

                                 walter 
                       i stood right behind you...i saw you look
                       right into his eyes and shoot him...

             will clenches his teeth.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       ...seattle's great hero.  shooting his
                       own partner.  i saw it all...

                                 will
                       that was an accident!  you hear me?  i
                       didn't know it was him!
                           (shakes him hard)
                       i didn't know it was him!

             just then a shriek.  will looks over

             a couple kids.  further down the glacier.  having a snowball
             fight.

             will looks back at walter.  has to take it easy.  shoves him
             away in disgust.  walter falls down onto the snow.  dislodges  
             his hearing aid.

             watches will pace.  head throbbing.  ribs, screaming in pain.

                                 walter
                       then why lie about it?

             walter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid.  puts
             it back around his ear.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       i mean, i'm all for bending the truth.
                       that's what i do in my novels.  it's my 
                       trade you might say.  but why cover it
                       up?

             gets up.  brushes the snow from his butt.  checks something
             in his pocket.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       you don't have to tell me if you don't
                       want to.  i'm sure you have some reason.
                       something noble.  i have faith in that.
 
             looks down at the kids.  shakes his head.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       they should be bundled up better.

                                 will
                       what's your game, byrd?

             walter turns back to him.

                                 walter
                       no game.

                                 will
                       the phone call.  the knapsack.

             walter shrugs.

                                 walter
                       i figured we're partners on this one.  i
                       mean, after what i saw...

             will stops short.  eyes burning.  it's all he can do not to
             throttle this weed.

                                 will
                       let's get one thing straight, byrd.  we are
                       partners on nothing.

             walter looks at him.  scratches his head.

                                 walter
                       i research my novels.  i know the 
                       procedures.  you'd have cuffed me back at
                       the ferry.  you'd have called for back-
                       up, read me my rights, and gotten a
                       search warrant for my apartment.  you're
                       a well-respected detective.  there's
                       no reason for you to be talking to me
                       right now...

             he takes out a handkerchief.  blows his nose.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       ...except that we could help each other.

             will stares at him.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       so.  we're at an impasse.

             will runs his hands through his hair.  half-crazed.  heart
             pounding.  turns to watch...

             the kids down the glacier.  making angels in the snow.  their
             giggles carried along by the wind.

             will, squeezes his eyes shut.  trapped.  about to defy every
             instinct in his body.

                                 will
                           (sotto)
                       you're going to get a phone call.

             walter steps up, tapping his hearing aid.

                                 walter
                       i'm sorry?

                                 will
                       i said you're going to get a phone call.

                                 walter 
                           (perks up)
                       oh?

                                 will
                       kay connell had a signed copy of one of
                       your books.

                                 walter
                       thought you might find that.

                                 will
                       you're going to be brought in for
                       questioning.

             walter smiles.  pleased.

                                 walter
                       down at the station?

                                 will
                           (hisses)
                       yes down at the station.

             walter rubs his hands together.  thinking.

                                 walter
                       okay.  okay.  brought in for questioning.
                       good.  i can write this.

             just then the ferry blows its horn.  low and loud.  walter
             looks down at it.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       ferry's leaving.

             he starts down.  will watches him pass, has no choice but to
             follow.  walter, going over the details in his head.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       something to divert...

             snaps his fingers.  an idea.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       my gun.  you still have my gun, right?

             will nods.  walter smiles.  spreads out his hands.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       then that's the wild card.  every
                       detective story has a wild card.

                                 will
                       what do you mean, "wild card?"

             tourists.  boarding the ferry.

                                 walter
                       next ferry's in forty-five minutes.

             walter heads over to the ramp.  will stops, grabbing his
             side.  a pang through his ribs.  excruciating.  calls out to
             walter.

                                 will
                       what do you mean "wild card?"

             walter looks back.  waves.

                                 walter
                       you'll know.  at the questioning.

             gives his ticket to the ticket taker.  gets on.  walks back
             to the stern.  looks out at will.  the horn sounds again.

             walter, at the rail.  smiles.  the ferry's engine, churning
             up water.  starting forward just as...

             walter takes a mini cassette recorder from his pocket.  holds
             it up for will to see.

             will, on shore, sees it.  a cold flash ripping through his 
             body.  that motherfucker.  bolts through some tourists
             towards the ramp but...

             a couple of guys are just pulling it in.  the ticket taker,
             grabs his arm.

                                 ticket taker
                           (to will)
                       full up.

             will, jerks his arm away.  stares off at the ferry.  walter
             byrd and his tape recorder.  receding into the distance.
