             will's reflection in the mirror.  he's showered.  hair's
             combed.  put on a clean suit.  steps back.  smooths down his
             lapels.  just right.

             turns to face the room.  bed's made, mess cleaned up.  he
             heads over to the bureau, pulls out his smith 39/13.  lays it
             on the bed.

             unclips his badge from his belt.  lays it on the bed.  takes
             something from the bedside table.  the bullet found in hap
             eckhart.  lays it on the bed.

             all neat.  all ordered.

             reaches under the mattress.  pulls out the photograph of a
             blurry walter byrd standing in front of a house.  a radio
             tower in the background.  the call numbers: wkoz.

             will studies it.  tears it in half.
