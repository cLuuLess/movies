             ext. nightmute police department - day

             will, heading for the cherokee.  clutching the box.  face
             pale, pace quick.  everything's different now.

                                 ellie (o.s.)
                       detective dormer!

             he closes his eyes.  now is not the time.  reaches the
             cherokee.  yanks open the driver's side door.  ellie catches
             up with him.  out of breath.

                                 ellie
                       you look like you're in a hurry.  i just
                       wanted to ask you about these pictures.

             she smiles, holds up some photographs.  they're of the beach.
             the ones kepp took.  almost all fog.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       i know they're not great quality, but
                       this is where you said you were when you
                       first saw detective eckhart, right?

             will.  barely glancing at them.  tosses the box into the car.

                                 will
                       right.

             gets in and closes the door.  puts his hand over the box.
             ellie comes up to the window.

                                 ellie
                       but here's the thing.  i retraced your
                       exact steps according to your statement.
                       you couldn't have seen detective eckhart
                       from there.  i mean, not in that fog.

                                 will
                       then change it.

                                 ellie
                       how much closer would you say you were?

                                 will
                       i don't remember.

                                 ellie
                       five feet?  seven feet?

             will, about to seriously lose his shit.  looks at ellie.
             eyes dark, distant.

                                 will
                       listen, ellie.  i don't have time for
                       this shit.  five feet, seven feet, twenty
                       feet.  put down whatever you want in your
                       report, alright?

             he turns the ignition.  pulls out with a squeal.  ellie
             steps back, watching him drive away.  more curious than
             stung.
