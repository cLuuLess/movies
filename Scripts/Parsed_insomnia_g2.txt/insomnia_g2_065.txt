             int. alley - day

             will, standing at the mouth of the alley.  just like the
             night before.  steps inside.  cautious.  eyes darting.
             peering into the shadows for the homeless man...

             not there.  coast's clear.  heads for the dumpster at the end 
             of the alley.  shoves it aside.  looks down at...

             the dead dog.  rancid.  rotting.  will gags.  holds a
             handkerchief to his face.  waving away the flies.

             then.  pulls the 357 ruger from his pocket.  shrugs his coat
             off and wraps it around his hand and the gun.  looks away.
             fires a muffled shot into the dog's side.  the body kicks.

             crouches down.  feels along the dog's ribs for the bullet's
             point of entry.  finds it.  pulls out a penknife and extends
             one of the blades.  cuts into the gash, fingers probing deep
             for the lodged bullet.  he finds it.  pulls it out.

             looks back at the dog.  takes a deep breath.  wipes his brow.
             a little smear of the dog's blood left on his forehead.
             turns and pulls a bottle of rubbing alcohol from his pocket. 
             douses the bullet.  cleaning it.  glancing at his watch.
             running out of time...
