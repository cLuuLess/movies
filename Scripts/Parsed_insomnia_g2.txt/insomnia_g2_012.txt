             int. will's room - night

             will's asleep.  kay connell's folder open on his chest.  it's
             dark in his room, quiet.  suddenly the shade on his window
             quivers and snaps up, flooding the room with light.

             will's eyes pop open.  he rolls over to look at the clock:
             3:15.  squinting, he gets up and walks over to the window.
             we can see the rest of his scar.  runs down deep across his
             sternum.

             he yanks the shade back down.  it bucks, then settles.
             satisfied, will returns to bed.  plumps the pillow, pulls the
             blanket up around him.  closes his eyes.

             the shade lurches halfway.  then snaps back up.  light pours
             in.  will's eyes open.

                                 will
                       you got to be kidding me.
