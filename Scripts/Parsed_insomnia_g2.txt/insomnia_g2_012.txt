             int. will's room - night

             will's taken off his jacket and is unpacking.  the room is
             sparse and creaky.  bed dips in the middle.  he hangs a
             jacket in the armoire then returns to his suitcase.  pulls
             out his smith and wesson 45.

             lays it on the bedside table.  takes out a shoulder holster.
             a back holster.  a handful of shells.  lays them on the 
             table.  then a small smith and wesson 39/13 9mm.  checks the
             magazine.

             there's a knock on the adjoining door.

                                 hap (o.s.)
                       me.

             will slaps the magazine back.

                                 will
                       come on in.

             hap opens the door.  a glimpse into his room: family pictures
             on his bedside table - a woman and three teenage girls.

                                 hap
                       see you have the same decor as my room.

             he walks over to the big window.  it overlooks the harbor.
             big, snow-capped mountains in the distance.  one lone tugboat
             in the harbor towing a freighter.

                                 hap (cont'd)
                       same view, too.
                           (looks out)
                       i've been watching that tugboat for the
                       last half hour.  so small, pulling all
                       that weight.
                           (beat)
                       we have to talk, will.

             will reaches into his suitcase.  pulls out a shirt.

                                 will 
                       what do you want to talk about?

                                 hap
                       you know what about.

             will throws him a look.

                                 will
                       we'll talk when we get back to seattle.

                                 hap
                       when's that, a week?  two weeks?...
                           (heads over to him)
                       we have to figure out a plan of action
                       now.

                                 will
                       you know my plan of action.

                                 hap
                       to do nothing.

                                 will
                       that's right.

                                 hap
                       dammit, will.  warfield had me locked up
                       in his office again for five hours
                       yesterday.  five hours.  asking all kinds
                       of questions...

                                 will
                       he's asking everybody questions.

                                 hap
                       but he's zeroing in on me.  on us.
                       everyone's talking about it.

                                 will
                       he's just rattling your cage.

                                 hap
                       well, i gotta tell you.  with a wife,
                       three kids, and a pension plan in the
                       balance, it's rattling hard.

                                 will
                       we say nothing.  it goes away.  simple as
                       that.

             will goes back to his suitcase.  hap follows.  a thin film of
             sweat on his upper lip.

                                 hap
                           (lowers voice)
                       look.  we've tampered with evidence.
                       we've pushed witnesses.  we've planted
                       shit.  and they're sniffing around like
                       dogs.  especially on the dobbs case...

             will flares up.  struck a nerve.  turns to his partner.

                                 will
                       weston dobbs killed an eight year-old boy
                       and left him hanging in the basement like
                       a piece of meat.  you remember that?

                                 hap
                       you know i remember that.

                                 will
                       one word to i.a. and he walks.

                                 hap
                       maybe not.  we could talk to buck...

                                 will
                       no way.

                                 hap
                       cut some kind of a deal.  i heard that's 
                       what flynn's doing...

                                 will
                       mike flynn's a dirty cop, hap!  we are
                       nothing like mike flynn.  we did what we
                       needed to do to make sure that son-of-
                       bitch dobbs paid for what he did.  and
                       every bastard like him.  we say one word
                       about it and every case we ever brought
                       in is going to blow wide open and they'll
                       all walk.  every last one.  and i am not
                       going to let that happen.  no deals.  no
                       compromises.  no discussions.

             he grabs a hanger.

                                 hap
                       goddammit, will.  you grab on to
                       something and you don't let it go.

             he takes out a handkerchief.  wipes his brow.

                                 hap
                       i don't know if it's because you think
                       it's the right thing to do or because
                       your pride won't let you do anything
                       else.  i can't tell any more.
                           (steps back)
                       but i can tell you one thing.  i'm
                       getting too old for this cowboy cop
                       stuff.  breaking the rules.  cleaning up
                       messes.  we're a dying breed, will.
                       you're a dying breed.  i.a., the d.a.,
                       all those reporters - they don't care
                       what you did at leland street seven years
                       ago.  they don't care that you've made
                       this your life.  they don't care about
                       getting the bad guy...

             will turns on his partner, eyes burning.

                                 will
                       i care.

             the partners, lock eyes.  years of working together.  a
             thousand things unsaid.  hap reaches for the door.

                                 hap (cont'd)
                        they're watching us, will.  like it or
                        not.  they're watching us.
