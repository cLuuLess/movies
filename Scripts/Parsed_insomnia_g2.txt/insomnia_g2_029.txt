             ext. down by the water - minutes later

             fred and ellie, skittering down the rocks.  getting closer to
             the water.  hear a voice ring out...

                                 voice (o.s.)
                       hap!

             the fog starts to dissipate.  they reach the water to see...

             will dormer

             kneeling beside the body of his partner.  lying in the water.
             shot in the stomach.  blood dribbling from his mouth.  will
             grabs him up by the collar.

                                 will
                       hap!

             starts shaking the limp body.  teeth clenched.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       hap!

             hap's head, rolls back.  mouth agape.  face white...

             will, rips off his tie.  presses it to the gaping wound...
             trying to stop the bleeding...warm blood, pumping into the
             water...

             ellie watches.  horrified.  fred races over to the body.
             feels for hap's pulse.

                                 fred
                       dormer...

             will, shaking hap again.  jaw set.  eyes intense.  veins
             popping up along his temples.  fred catches his shoulder.

                                 fred (cont'd)
                       dormer!  he's gone.

             will looks up at fred.  his face contorts.

             suddenly leaps to his feet.  grabs a rock and hurls it
             savagely into the thick fog.
