             the shoulder jerks away.  pull back to reveal randy stetz
             sitting at a wooden table in an interrogation room.  longish
             blond hair, wearing a metallica t-shirt, trying like hell to
             grow a moustache.

             he takes out a cigarette.  it's bent.  he lights it.  hap
             sits opposite.

                                 hap
                       you know smoking stunts your growth.

                       night.

                                 will
                       but she was seeing someone else on the
                       side.

             randy glares.

                                 randy
                       i don't know what you're fucking talking
                       about.

                       friday night, at the party - what'd you
                       fight about?

                                 randy
                       stuff.

                                 will
                       the other guy?

                                 randy
                       i told you i don't remember.

                                 will
                       after that she left the party to go to
                       him.

                                 randy
                       how should i know?...

                                 will
                       ran like hell to go to him...

                                 randy
                       fuck you, man! - i'm sick of all your
                       fucking cop questions...

             will suddenly hurls his coffee cup and grabs randy up by the
             collar.  nose to nose.

                                 will
                       now you listen to me, you little shit.
                       this fuck-the-world-metallica-t-shirt 
                       crap may work with your mamma, but it
                       doesn't work with me.  you got mad at
                       your girlfriend because she was seeing
                       someone else.  you want to be the last
                       person who saw her alive or are you going
                       to tell me who that is?

             randy's lip curls.  red-faced.

                                 randy
                       i don't know.

                                 will
                       you don't know.

                                 randy
                       she didn't tell me.

             disgusted, will shoves randy back into his seat.
