             a small bedroom.  pink shag carpeting and clouds painted on
             the ceiling.  pictures cut from magazines pasted on the
             walls.  a stack of tapes and a boom box in the corner.

             will stands in the middle of the room.  taking it in.

             herself.  will opens the top drawer of the bureau.  roots

                                 fred
                       she left the party early.  friends said
                       she had a fight with her boyfriend and
                       stormed out.

                       around twelve-thirty.

             hap picks up a bear on kay's bed.  a bell jingles when he
             shakes it.  will crosses to a closet in the corner.

                                 will
                       who was the last one to see her alive?

                       randy stetz.  her boyfriend.  we've
                       questioned him, searched his place.

                           (looks up)
                       could randy stetz afford these?

             fred and ellie exchange a look.

                       well her mother didn't buy them for her.

                                 hap
                       what are we thinking?
