             int. basement

             pitch black, then, click! as a bare lightbulb's switched on.
             ellie stands beneath it.  piles of crap everywhere.

             she steps through the quagmire of old bikes, fans, auto
             parts.  over to a stack of cardboard boxes in the corner.

             she nudges through them, reading the writing on the tops.  in
             thick black pen.  shoves a couple aside.

             then.  finds what she's looking for.  pulls down a box
             marked:  ellie acad.  tears it open.

             inside - piles of papers, polaroids of her and her friends,
             schedules, syllabi, handbooks.  stuff from her academy year.
             at the bottom, a report.  the title:  "securing the crime
             scene," the leland street murders.  by eleanor p. burr.

             ellie pulls it out.  sits down on an old stool.  opens to the
             middle of the report.  her finger, tracing down the 
             typewritten page.  flips to the next page.  then the next.
             the next.  then.  she spots it.

             three-quarters down the page, her finger finds the
             sentence:...detective dormer's unregistered smith and wesson
             model 39/13 9mm, to immobilize langley...

             ellie looks up.  chews her bottom lip.
