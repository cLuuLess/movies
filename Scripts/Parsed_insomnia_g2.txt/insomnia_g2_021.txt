             int. bullpen - nightmute pd - night

             will bursts into the bullpen.  hap behind.

                                 will
                       where is it?

             ellie, fred, and a couple other guys huddled around a desk.

                                 ellie
                       over here.

             will and hap head over to them.  one of the younger guys,
             farrell, intimidated by will's presence.  tucks his shirt
             into his dirty jeans.

             they part to reveal a blue knapsack laying on the desk.  mud
             spots all over it.  an embroidered daisy.  will examines it.

                                 will
                       we're sure it's hers?

                                 fred
                       has her books in it.

                                 hap
                       what about prints?

             ellie shakes her head, unfortunately not.  will reaches into
             the bag.  pulls out two text books.

                                 will
                       biology and algebra.

             he shoves the books towards one of the guys.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       find out who she studied with.

             he continues through the bag.  pulls out a little plastic bag
             with "hello kittys" all over it.  dumps out the contents.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       make-up.

             looks up at fred.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       find out where she bought it.

             fred looks at him.  not happy with make-up duty.  will pulls
             out a hair brush.  hands it to ellie.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       lab.

             next, a couple worn paperbacks.

                                 will (cont'd)
                           (reading titles)
                       otherwise engaged, murder at sunset.

             he looks up at the group.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       who here reads this kind of crap?

             farrell straightens.

                                 farrell
                       i read that kind of crap.

             will tosses them to him.

                                 will
                       read them.  tell me anything that strikes
                       you.

             down to the bottom of the bag.  a ziploc with a half-eaten
             sandwich and an apple core.  will hands them to ellie.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       lab.

             upends the knapsack.  scraps, paper clips, gum wrappers.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       that's it.

             fred reaches for the knapsack.

                                 fred
                       i'll stick it in the evidence locker...

                                 will
                       no.

             will takes it, walks slowly over to the window.  thinking.
             twists the knapsack in his hands and looks out at the
     
             totem pole standing tall outside.  a black raven alights on
             top of it.  pecks at the air.  turns.  seems to look right at 
             will.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       we put it back where we found it.

             will turns to them.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       you said it was a fishing cabin.

                                 farrell
                       uh, right.  about two miles outside of
                       town.

                                 ellie
                       on the beach.

             fred tightens his jaw.

                                 fred
                       why are we taking it back?

             will ignores the question.  walks back towards them.

                                 will
                       this murder was in the papers, right?

                                 ellie
                       yeah.  all over.

                                 will
                       call all of them from here to anchorage.
                       tell them we now know that kay connell
                       left the party with a dark blue knapsack,
                       but we haven't recovered it yet.
                           (checks watch)
                       we can get it in by the morning editions.

             he hands the bag to farrell.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       fill this with random books.  make it
                       look heavy.

             will pulls out a handkerchief.  wipes the mud off his hands.
             taking his time.  finally turns to fred.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       it'll eat this guy alive if he thinks he
                       overlooked a detail.
