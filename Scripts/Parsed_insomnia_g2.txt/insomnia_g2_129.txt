             int. mariner's memorial - continuous

             walter byrd waits under the mariner's memorial.  wind
             whipping his jacket, the green sea churning behind him.  next
             to a fifteen-foot statue of a seaman, tall, rugged, tough.
             holding on to a thick coil of rope.

             hunches against the wind.  watches as...
 
             will approaches the monument.  sonics sweatshirt, wrinkled
             coat.  face drawn and haggard.  angry.

                                 walter
                           (smiles)
                       hi, will...

             will enters the monument.

                                 will
                       what the hell are you doing calling me at 
                       the station?

             a gust of wind whorls through the monument.

                                 walter
                       i figured we should touch base.  compare
                       notes.  i think it went well.  what did
                       you think?

             will's eyes pierce into him.

                                 will
                       randy stetz is in jail.

                                 walter
                       told you i could write an ending.

                                 will
                       congratulations.

             will holds out his hand.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       the tape.

             walter looks at the open hand.  hugs his jacket to him.

                                 walter
                       i thought maybe we could talk some more.

                                 will
                       there's nothing more to talk about.

                                 walter
                       but we work so well together...

             will breaks.  rushes walter.  slams him against one of the
             concrete pilasters.

                                 will
                       we do nothing well together.
                           (slams him again)
                       nothing!  you understand me?

             another wave crashes.  sprays them.  walter looks up into
             will's bloodshot eyes.

                                 walter
                       you run on two settings, will.  i've 
                       noticed that...

             will tightens his grip.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       you jump from calm to rage in the blink
                       of an eye.  that's okay.  i do that too.

             he holds up the tape.  will grabs it, shoves walter to the
             side.  yanks the tape out of the cassette.  steps back and
             hurls it into the sea.  waves engulf it hungrily.

             walter watches him.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       you're not sleeping, are you?

                                 will
                       what the hell do you know?

                                 walter
                       kay told me.  she comes to me, you know.   
                       tells me things.  about you.  about me.

             pause.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       does detective eckhart come to you?

             will curls his fists.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       does he ask you why you shot him?

             whips around...

                                 will 
                       i told you that was an accident!

                                 walter
                       then so was mine...

                                 will
                       don't you pull that shit with me.

                                 walter
                       i didn't want to kill her, will.

             steps closer to him.  beseeching.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       when she called me that night from the
                       party, she'd had a fight with randy.
                       wanted to talk.  i told her to meet me at
                       our special place.  the cabin at the
                       beach...

             a couple ravens alight nearby.  flapping their wings.
             screeching into the wind.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       ...when she came she was barefoot.  and
                       there was liquor on her breath.  i only
                       wanted to comfort her.  to touch her.
                       she could have at least let me do that.
                       her skin...it was like everything i'd
                       ever written about.

             a dark shadow crosses his face.  holds on to the coiled rope
             of the statue.  will hisses.

                                 will
                       couldn't get it up, walter?

                                 walter
                       it was when i went to kiss her.  she
                       started laughing.  i got angry.  after
                       all i'd given her.  all i'd shared with
                       her.  i just wanted to make her stop.
                       that's all.

             walter.  squeezing the bronze rope.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       from calm to rage in the blink of an eye.

             locks eyes with will.  conspiratorial.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       remember?

             will's hand shoots out.  clamps around walter's neck.

                                 will
                       like this?

             walter's face, starts turning red.

                                 walter
                       yes.  like that.

                                 will
                       this an accident, walter?

                                 walter
                       if you want it to be...

             will looks deep into walter's eyes.  squeezing harder.  pure
             hatred.

                                 will
                       it took ten minutes to beat kay connell
                       to death.  ten minutes.

             their eyes, locked.  veins, popping along walter's temples.
             lip quivering...

             just then a bell sounds in the distance.  will looks up.

             a line of fishing boats coming back in.

             will, looks back at walter.  throws him to the ground.
             sickened.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       get the fuck out of town, byrd.  leave
                       and never come back.

             walter coughs.  holding his neck.  enjoying this.

                                 walter
                       i have a summer house up by kgun lake.
                       i'm going to write my next novel there.
                       it's about a famous detective who goes
                       bad.

             will shoots him a look.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       just kidding.

             he pulls himself to his feet.  a little unsteady.  takes out
             a handkerchief.  dabs his forehead.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       the never coming back part, though.  i'm
                       not sure.  to tell you the truth this has
                       been kind of fun.  going to the station,
                       meeting all those nice people.  talking
                       with you.

             he shrugs.  walks past will.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       i might miss it.

             will turns.  watches him walk away.  walter hesitates.  turns
             back.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       i especially like that new detective.

             will looks at him.  back straightening.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       detective burr.
                           (smiles)
                       i liked her very much.  has a real
                       vitality.

             will's stomach jumps.  walter turns back.  continues on.

             the little man in a beige windbreaker.
