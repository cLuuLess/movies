             int. storage room - nightmute pd - day

             close on a key slipping into a padlock.  opens with a click!

             pull back to reveal fred and will in a small storage room.
             standing in front of an army-green locker.  the evidence
             locker.  room's stuffed with old files and boxes.  moose
             antlers hanging over a small window.  will glances up.

                                 will
                       what's with all the moose antlers around
                       here?

             fred throws a look over his shoulder.  opens the locker.

                                 fred
                       lots of moose.

             inside the locker - another manila envelope.  the name on
             this one: farrell brooks.

             fred reaches back for the other envelope.  will, hesitant to
             give it to him.  feeling the bump of the bullet in the bottom
             corner.  hands it over.  wipes his brow.

                                 will
                       when's rich coming?

             fred slides it in beside farrell's.  closes the locker door.

                                 fred
                       i'll call him now.

                                 will
                       first i need a copy of the key.

             fred turns, a twinkle in his eye.

                                 fred
                       this isn't seattle, detective.  we don't
                       have copies.
                           (holds up key)
                       this is the only one.

             will looks at him.  at the key.  plucks it from his hand.
             just then nyback's secretary appears in the doorway.

                                 secretary
                       detective dormer?  telephone.
