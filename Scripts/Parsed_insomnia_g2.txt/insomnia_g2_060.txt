             int. bullpen - nightmute pd - day

             the secretary hands will the phone.  pulls something from
             under the desk.  a beat-up box.  will's name on it.

                                 secretary
                       this came for you earlier.

             will glances at it.  takes the phone.  rubs his eyes.

                                 will
                           (into phone)
                       dormer.

             nothing.  someone's there but they're not saying anything.
             will, too tired for this shit...

                                 will (cont'd)
                       goddammit, warfield, if you're gonna
                       check up on me every...

             then...the voice.  a man's voice.  not john warfield's.
             this voice is medium-ranged.  higher.  nose sounds stuffed.

                                 man's voice
                       i bet you haven't been getting much
                       sleep.

             will straightens.  something weird.

                                 will
                           (into phone)
                       what?

             a little titter on the other end.

                                 man's voice
                       you lower-48s.  you think the white
                       nights are kind of neat.  then you can't
                       sleep for days.  i've seen it happen
                       about a million times.  but you can't
                       sleep for a different reason.

                                 will
                           (into phone)
                       who is this?

             a pause.  will loosens his tie.

                                 will 
                           (into phone)
                       i said, who is this?

             the voice.  dropping to a whisper.

                                 man's voice
                       i saw what really happened, will...

             will, furrows his brow.

                                 man's voice
                       i saw you kill your partner.  with your
                       back-up weapon.  out there on the beach.
                       i saw you shoot him dead...

             close on

             will dormer's face.

             as all the blood drains from it.

             as all sound

             fades around him.

             as his heart
 
             begins to pound against his chest.

             he falters, reaching out for the desk.  to steady himself.
             as if the floor's just dropped out beneath him.  eyes,
             darting around the bullpen...

                                 will
                           (sotto, into phone)
                       now you listen to me...

                                 man's voice
                       don't worry.  i won't tell anyone.  oh,
                       and i saw you take my gun.  my uncle's
                       old 357.  i dropped it in the rocks.
                       but you can go ahead and keep that.

             chief nyback, exits his office.  looks at will and smiles.

                                 man's voice (cont'd)
                       ...i mean...
                           (beat)
                       ...now that we're partners.

             click.  the line goes dead.

             will, throat constricted.  listening to the dial tone.
             smiles back at nyback.  turns.  slowly hangs up the phone.
             white as a sheet.  trying to act normal.  trying to act calm.
             sound returning to the bullpen, like nothing's different.
             looks over at

             the box

             sitting on the edge of the secretary's desk.  he reaches for
             it.  carefully, rips the packing tape.  bends back a flap.
             inside, some dark blue material.  an embroidered daisy.
  
             kay connell's knapsack.
