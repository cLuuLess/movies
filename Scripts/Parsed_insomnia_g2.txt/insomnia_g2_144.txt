             int. study - house

             the clang of electric typewriter keys bang out a title:
             blink of an eye, by walter by

             walter byrd hunched at his typewriter.  in an old study.
             books stacked everywhere.  light patches on the walls where
             pictures used to hang.

             barking outside.  walter cocks his head.  gets up.  walks
             over to the window.  

             outside.  will walking up to the house.  lucy and desi
             jumping around him.
