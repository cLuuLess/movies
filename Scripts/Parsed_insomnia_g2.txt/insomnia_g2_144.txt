             will opens the screen door with a creak.  steps into the
             living room.

             recoils from the smell.  flies buzzing.  yellow plastic
             covering the sofas.  boxes, books, papers, pictures piled
             high everywhere.  wallpaper faded, peeling.

             everything, decaying.
