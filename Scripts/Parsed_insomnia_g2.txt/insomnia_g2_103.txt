             int. will's room - pioneer lodge - late night

             clock flicks to 3:00 a.m.  will, pacing in his room.  shirt
             off.  rib cage wrapped in a bandage.  looking through...

             a stack of messages.  all from john warfield.  he discards
             them one by one.  can barely focus...

             suddenly the phone rings.  he lunges for it.

                                 will
                           (grabbing it)
                       listen to me, you son-of-a-bitch...

             interrupted by a click...

                                 recorded voice
                       ...i saw you look right into his eyes
                       and shoot him...

             walter byrd's voice.  recorded from that afternoon.

                                 recorded voice (cont'd)
                       ...seattle's great hero.  shooting his
                       own partner.  i saw it all...

             will, hears his own voice...

                                 recorded voice (cont'd)
                       that was an accident!...

                                 will
                       goddammit, byrd!

             then, another clumsy click.  walter byrd gets on.

                                 walter
                       you'd have done the same thing, will.  i
                       know you would...

             he hangs up.

             will slams down the receiver.  then again.  and again.  yanks
             the cord out of the wall and hurls the phone across the room.
