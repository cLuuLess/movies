             ext. garage apartment - day

             will stands outside the garage apartment.  wind whipping his
             coat.  watches as a nightmute pd squad car pulls off with
             randy stetz in the back.

             fred sees him, heads over.

                                 fred
                       you look like shit, cowboy.

             will shifts his eyes to him.

                                 will
                       that's an understatement.

             fred half-smiles.  watches the receding squad car.

                                 fred
                       looks like we can wrap this one up.

             will barely nods.  fred pulls his baseball cap on.

                                 fred (cont'd)
                       we're getting together for a couple of
                       beers later on.  might not be the seattle
                       thing to do.  but you're welcome to come.

             fred puts out his hand to shake.  truce.  will looks at him.
             takes it.
