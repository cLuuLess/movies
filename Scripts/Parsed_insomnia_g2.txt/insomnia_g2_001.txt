             an arm

             stretched out.  long, alabaster white.  beautiful.  a wash
             cloth enters frame.  starts washing the arm with long, tender
             strokes. 

             a tumble of hair
 
             thick and auburn.  being gently washed.  

             fingernails

             being clipped with a shiny nail clipper.  short.  uniform.
             tidy.

             eyebrows

             brown with a touch of gold.  a brush comes into view.
             brushes against the eyebrow hair, then back again.  against.
             then back again.

             panty-hose

             pulled gingerly off a long leg.  folded neatly.  the wash
             cloth begins between the toes.  warm, soapy water.

             hair

             now dry.  the hand appears with a comb.  pulls down through
             the thick tresses.

             it is only now that we see the hand is wearing a surgical
             glove.

             the gloved hand holds up the comb and pulls stray hairs from
             it.  places them in a big, clear, plastic bag.  in the bag we
             see the panty-hose, a folded flower dress, the nail
             clippings.

             goes back to combing.  comes across a knot and yanks the comb
             through.  the head rolls over to us.  her face is bruised,
             her eyes blank.  she is lying on the floor.

             dead.
