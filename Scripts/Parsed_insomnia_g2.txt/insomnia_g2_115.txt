             int. interrogation room - continuous

             will in the interrogation room.  standing by the window.
             tensed jaw.

                                 walter (o.s.)
                       yes i was.

             walter byrd

             sits at the table.  hair combed, wet.  shirt newly starched.
             a styrofoam cup of coffee in front of him.  playing the part.

             fred sits opposite him.  report file open.  ellie, next to
             fred.  taking notes.  she's combed her hair, too.

                                 fred
                       in what manner?

             walter smiles modestly.  looks over at ellie.

                                 walter
                       she was, not quite a "fan."  more an avid
                       reader of my detective novels.

                                 ellie
                       when did you first meet her?

             fred shoots ellie a look.  she closes her mouth.

                                 walter
                       a year ago.  at one of my signings.

             ellie hands fred the hardback of otherwise engaged.  he holds
             it up.  opened to the signature.

                                 fred
                       where you signed this?

                                 walter
                       that's right.

                                 fred
                       what happened at that signing?

                                 walter
                       she flattered me about my writing.  asked
                       if she could visit me.  to talk about my
                       books.

                                 fred
                       did she?

                                 walter
                       yes.  not that much at first.  but then
                       she became more comfortable.  started 
                       visiting me every week...

             will, from over by the window.  interrupts.

                                 will
                       what was the nature of your relationship?

             walter looks over.  wide-eyed.

                                 walter
                       what do you mean, detective dormer?

             will turns.  accusatory.

                                 will
                       she was an attractive girl.  did you have
                       sex with her?

             walter blinks.

                                 walter
                       she was only seventeen.

                                 will
                       but she was an attractive girl.
 
                                 walter
                       i suppose.

                                 will
                       did you have sex with her?

             fred shoots will a look.  ellie, watching him.

                                 walter
                       no.

                                 will
                       but you wanted to.

                                 walter
                       i was a mentor to her.

             will heads over to walter's chair.  fists clenched in his
             pockets.

                                 will
                       you gave her gifts.

                                 walter
                       yes.

                                 will
                       expensive dresses.  a heart necklace.

                                 walter
                       yes.

                                 will
                       doesn't sound like a mentor to me.

                                 walter
                       i gave her things she didn't have.
                       couldn't have.

             he turns to fred and ellie.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       her family lives on mr. connell's
                       disability.  it isn't much.

             fred stops will with a look.  had enough.

                                 fred
                       we understand, mr. byrd.
                           (to will)
                       you want to sit down, detective?

             tense beat.  will stares at walter.  revulsion.  heads back
             over to the window.

                                 walter
                       she wasn't happy.  i was someone to talk
                       to.

                                 fred
                       how do you mean?

                                 walter
                       that boyfriend.  randy.

             fred, sits up.

                                 fred
                       randy stetz?

                                 walter
                       that's right.

                                 will
                       what about him?

                                 walter
                       he.  well, he...

             walter hesitates.  takes a sip of coffee.

                                 walter (cont'd)
                       i don't want to talk out of school.  kay
                       told me things in the strictest of
                       confidence.  as a friend.

                                 fred
                       mr. byrd.  anything you can tell us could
                       help out with this case.

             walter furrows his brow.  taps his hearing aid.

                                 walter
                       well.  he hit her.

             ellie's eyes widen.  fred glances at will.  but will's too
             busy watching this little man weave his web.

                                 fred
                       are you sure about that?

                                 walter
                       she'd come to me, sometimes in the middle
                       of the night.  bruises all over her back,
                       her upper arms.  i pled with her to let
                       me call the police, but she wouldn't hear
                       it.  wanted to keep it a secret.

                                 ellie
                       randy stetz beat kay connell?

                                 fred
                           (angry)
                       ellie.

             walter looks right at her.

                                 walter
                       he has a terrible rage.  kay even said he
                       carried a handgun around with him.

             fred stands.  this is big.  calls out the door.

                                 fred
                       margaret!  get judge biggs on the phone!
                           (to will)
                       i'll get another warrant for stetz's
                       place.

             walter takes a sip of his coffee.  cup's empty.  holds it out
             to ellie.  smiles.

                                 walter
                       could i have some more coffee, detective
                       burr?

             ellie nods, takes the cup.  heads over to the coffee machine.
             fred turns back to the door...

             and at that moment walter levels a look right at will.

             mouths the words wild card.

             a shiver down will's spine.  wild card.  the gun.  randy.

             ellie

             over at the coffee machine.  pouring coffee.  glances up at
             the window.  catches the reflection of the two men.

             an intense look between them.
