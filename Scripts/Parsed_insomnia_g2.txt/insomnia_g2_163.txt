             int. boathouse

             walter, looking out the window.

             over his shoulder - we see will climbing in through the
             window.  smearing blood along the sill, favoring his leg.
             stands straight.  levels his gun at walter's back.

                                 will
                           (softly)
                       walter?

             nothing.  walter continues staring out the window.  will
             raises his voice.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       walter!

             walter jumps, whips around.  comes face to face with the 
             barrel of will dormer's gun.  surprised.  absently touches
             his deaf ear.

                                 walter
                       wild card.

                                 will
                       drop the gun, walter.

             walter looks at will's 45.

                                 walter
                       that jammed the last time, remember?

             the men lock eyes.  wind howling through the boathouse.
             killer and detective.  only a bullet separating them.

             walter suddenly jerks up his shotgun...

             bang!  he stumbles back.  hit in the gut.

             will's smith and wesson, smoking.  no longer jammed.

             walter, touches the blood.  looks back at will.  staggering.
             crack!  the rotting floor gives way beneath him.  he cries
             out, falls.  drops into the icy water below.

             silence.  will steps over to the hole.  looks down at
     
             walter, floating on his back.  looking up at him.  water
             washing over his body.  eyes, pleading.  fading.  a wave,
             gently pulls him away.

                                 will
                       another j. brody mystery.
