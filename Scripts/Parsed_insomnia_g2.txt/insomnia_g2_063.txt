             ext. breakfront - day

             will dormer, walking along a breakfront.  aimless.  one foot
             in front of the other.  staring out at nothing.  the endless
             sea.  waves crashing.  wind howling.  seagulls screeching.

             everything.  closing in on him...

             he stumbles over a rock.  grabs his head in his hands.

             stunned.  guilty.  ashamed.  fucked.

             he saw it.  he saw it!

             a wave, explodes nearby.  drenching him in sea spray.

             will turns, raking his hand across his face.  blinking.  eyes
             stinging.  trying to focus.  trying to think this through...

             hears a dog barking in the distance.

             shakes his head.  looks at his watch.

             got to deal with the problem at hand.
