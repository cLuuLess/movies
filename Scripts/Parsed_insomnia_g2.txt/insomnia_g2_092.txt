             int. bullpen - nightmute pd - day

             will strides into the bullpen.  wounded hand in pocket.
             ellie hunts and pecks at a typewriter.  glances up.

             fred, over in the corner.  slams a drawer in the filing
             cabinet.  turns.

                                 fred
                       forget your pager?

                                 will
                       what?

                                 fred
                       i beeped you over two hours ago.

             holds out a one-page report.

                                 fred (cont'd)
                       got a fax from the lab.  murder weapon
                       was a 357 ruger.

             will takes the report.  heads over to the coffee machine.

                                 will
                       good.

                                 fred
                       and something else that might interest 
                       you.

             he reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a book.  holds
             it up.  otherwise engaged.  in hardback.

                                 fred (cont'd)
                       remember this?

             will blinks.

                                 will
                       no.

                                 fred
                       one of the paperbacks we found in kay
                       connell's knapsack.

             will pours himself a cup of coffee.  trying to keep the
             stream steady.  ellie continues typing...clack...clack...

                                 will
                       that's right.

                                 fred
                       mrs. connell found this copy in the 
                       house.
                           (opens it up)
                       it's signed.  personally.

                                 will
                       so?

                                 fred
                       this is a local writer.  kay had all his
                       books.  i think we should check it out.

             clack...clack...clack...will rubs his chin.  looks back at
             the report.  judicious.

                                 will
                       i don't think it'll lead anywhere.

             the clacking stops.  silence.  will turns around.  ellie's
             staring right at him - that isn't like him.

             he turns back to fred.  beat.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       well.  if he's local.  give him a call.

             the clacking resumes.
