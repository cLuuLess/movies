             ext. down by the water - minutes later

             ellie sloshes through the water.  ankles getting cold.
             cheeks pink.  but it doesn't matter.  she's investigating.

                                 ellie
                           (into tape recorder)
                       ...shortly after hearing the second shot,
                       detective dormer continued through the
                       water until he spotted the body, lying
                       approximately fifteen feet away.

             she stops.  looks at the map.  at the spot will pointed out.
     	     looks back up.  fog.  clicks off the recorder.  calls out.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       you there, rich?

             a voice calls back.  someone pretending to be hap.

                                 voice (o.s.)
                       yeah.  and i'm freezing my nads off!

             ellie furrows her brow.  just then...

             francis appears.  slips on a rock but catches his fall.

                                 francis
                       ellie!  think i found something!
