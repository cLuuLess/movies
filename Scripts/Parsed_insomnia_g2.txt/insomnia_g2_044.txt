             int. hallway - hospital - later

             will walks down the hallway.  light pouring in from a set of
             high windows.  he looks tired.  set-upon.

             pov of someone

             watching him.  from a doorway.  not close, not far.  a hand
             comes into view.  small.  bruised knuckles.  holds on to the
             door jamb.  watches as...

             will suddenly stops.  skin prickling at the back of his neck.
             turns and looks around.

             a man in a wheelchair.
 
             a little girl tugging at her hospital gown.

             a couple of nurses laughing at check-in.

             an empty doorway.

             nothing.
