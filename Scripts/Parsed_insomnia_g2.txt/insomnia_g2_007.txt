             int. bullpen - nightmute pd - continuous

             ...the bullpen of nightmute pd.  wooden desks, a couple
             computers, a jumbled corkboard, an impressive gun cabinet.  a
             radio's playing.

             three men look over.  a young uniformed cop and two guys with
             heavy facial hair, timberland boots, and flannel shirts.  one
             of them's part inuit.  ellie sits in the back.  reaches over
             to turn off the radio.

             will and hap stand in the doorway.  sticking out like sore
             thumbs in their suits.  nyback jerks his thumb towards them.

                                 chief nyback
                       this is detective dormer and his partner
                       detective eckhart.  on loan from buck
                       lundgard, seattle robbery and homicide
                       special branch.  they'll be helping with
                       the connell case.

             the inuit, fred duggar, snorts.  takes his feet of the desk.

                                 fred
                       helping?  

                                 chief nyback
                           (ignoring him)
                       anything they need to see, you show them;
                       anywhere they want to go, you take them.
                           (nods to fred)
                       this is detective fred duggar.  he's been
                       leading the investigation up to now.

             will puts out his hand.

                                 will
                       detective...

             fred tugs at his dark handlebar moustache.  stands.

                                 fred
                       suppose you want to see the body.
