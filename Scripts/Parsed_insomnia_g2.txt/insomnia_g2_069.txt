             int. storage room - nightmute pd - day

             the storage room.  hot.  stifling.  the moose antlers looming
             over his shoulder.  will pulls the evidence locker key from 
             his pocket.  unlocks the padlock.  swings the door open.

             pulls the hap eckhart envelope out.  throwing a look over his
             shoulder.  opens it.  shakes out the bullet that was lodged
             in hap's spine.  then fishes a plastic bag from his pocket.
             the bullet he shot into the dead dog.  drops that into the
             envelope and reseals it.  hands shaking.

             something.  catches the corner of his eye.  he turns.

             his reflection in the locker mirror.  the blood smear still
             on his forehead.

                                 fred (o.s.)
                       dormer...

             will jumps.  quickly wipes the smear off and turns.  fred 
             duggar standing behind him.  rich by his side.  will clears
             his throat, shoves hap's envelope into fred's hand.  then
             farrell's.  angry.

                                 will
                       these should have gone out two hours ago.

             slams the locker door and brushes past him.  fred and rich
             exchange a glance.
