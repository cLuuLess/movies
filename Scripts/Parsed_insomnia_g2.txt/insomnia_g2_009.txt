             close on a faucet.  a bead of water, quivering at the mouth.
             falls with a blip!

                                 coroner (o.s.)

             pull back to reveal will, hap, and the county coroner
             standing by a stainless steel table.  the naked body of kay
             connell is laid out before them.  fred hangs back.

             the coroner tugs at her surgical gloves.  she's in her late
             seventies.

                                 coroner (cont'd)
                       clear cause of death was herniation of
                       the brain stem due to intracerebral
                       hemorrhage.

                                 hap
                       beaten to death.

                                 coroner
                       beaten to death.

             will points to the bruises on the body's shoulders and
             breasts.

                                 will
                       what about these contusions?

                                 coroner
                       superficial.

                                 will
                       any signs of rape?

                                 coroner
                       none.

             the coroner starts to cover the body with a sheet.

                                 coroner (cont'd)
                       she was a nice girl.  played flute with
                       my granddaughter.

             will stays her hand.

                                 will
                       wait.

             he pulls the sheet back down.  studying the body of kay
             connell.  starts walking slowly around the table.  in his
             element.  the faucet drips.  drips.  drips.

             he bends down to smell her hair.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       he washed her hair.

             takes a handful and lets it fall from his fingers.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       combed it.

             continues around the table.  picks up one of her hands.
             examines her fingers, her nails.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       cleaned under her fingernails.  clipped
                       them.

             continues down around her feet.  checks between her first and
             second toes.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       toes, too.
                           (to fred)
                       you found nothing on the body?

                                 fred
                       no.
 
                                 will
                       no fibers, skin flakes, hairs...

                                 fred
                       like i said, no.  we know about those
                       things up here.

             will stands there.  looking down at the body.  slim.  young.
             beautiful.  skin like marble.

                                 will
                       he knew exactly what we'd be looking for.
                       made sure to cover up all his tracks.

                                 hap
                       even the best make mistakes.

             will looks up and locks eyes with his partner.
