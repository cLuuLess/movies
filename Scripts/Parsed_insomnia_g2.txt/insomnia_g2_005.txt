             int. chief charles nyback's office - continuous

             nightmute police chief charles nyback gets up from behind his
             desk with a big smile.  ruddy, red hair sprinkled with grey,
             nyback wears a faded army sweater over his uniform.

                                 chief nyback
                       i'll be damned!

             limps from behind his desk and gives will a shake and a slap
             on the back.

                                 will
                           (warmly)
                       how you doing, charlie?

             nyback shakes hap's hand.  a reunion.

                                 hap
                       hey, charlie.

                                 chief nyback
                       christ.  i haven't seen you boys since...

                                 will
                       just after leland street.

                                 chief nyback
                       what's that, then?

                                 hap
                       eight years.

                                 will
                       seven years.

                                 chief nyback
                       seven years?  where does it all go?  that
                       was some amazing time, though, wasn't it?

             looks at will.  down at his boots.

                                 chief nyback (cont'd)
                       you haven't changed a bit, will.

             will.  looks at nyback's gut.

                                 will
                       you have, chief.

             they laugh.  eyes twinkling.

                                 chief nyback
                       i knew that was coming.  i deserve it.

             he starts back over to his desk.  notices ellie still
             standing by the door.  points to will.

                                 chief nyback (cont'd)
                       pay attention to this man, ellie.  he'll
                       teach you how to be a great cop.

             ellie straightens.  smiles.  looks over at will.

                                 ellie
                       yes, sir.

                                 chief nyback
                       that's all, for now.

             ellie, realises they want to be alone.

                                 ellie
                       oh.  right.  okay.

             backs out.  quietly closing the door behind her.  will
             unbuttons his jacket.  takes a seat.

                                 will
                       nice kid.

                                 chief nyback
                           (sits with a sigh)
                       got a love affair with police work.
                       drives me crazy with it.

             will surveys the fishing poles leaning against the gun rack.

                                 will
                       keeping you busy up here, charlie?

             hap picks up a cheap trophy.  reads the base.

                                 hap
                       "2nd prize great kodiak salmon catch."

                                 chief nyback
                       i told you seven years ago this was a 
                       stepping stone to retirement.

             nyback nods to hap's seattle times.  the headline:  "deeper
             investigation into special branch"...

                                 chief nyback (cont'd)
                       looks like it's a good time for you to
                       get up here, too.  with all the bad
                       business going on down at special branch.

             will and hap share a look.  no more joking.  hap folds over
             the paper.

                                 chief nyback (cont'd)
                       just five bad apples so far?

                                 will
                       so far.

                                 chief nyback
                       what's the d.a. got them on?

                                 will
                       four unwarranted shootings, witness
                       intimidation, and cocaine theft.

             nyback winces.

                                 chief nyback
                       how about you?  how you faring?

                                 hap
                       they're all over us, charlie.

                                 will
                       they're all over everybody.

                                 hap
                       i.a.'s calling themselves the "corruption
                       task force."  can you believe that?
                       trying to root out any mistakes or
                       "oversights" any other detectives may
                       have made over the years.  they're
                       turning it into a witch hunt.  something
                       on the news about it practically every
                       night.

             nyback pulls a stack of messages from his desk.

                                 chief nyback
                       got a bunch of messages here from some
                       guy named warfield.

             hap tosses a glance over at will.

                                 will
                       that's i.a.'s pit bull.

                                 chief nyback
                       wants me to keep him posted on all your
                       movements up here.

             nyback turns and ceremoniously drops the messages into the
             trash.

                                 chief nyback (cont'd)
                       i'm just glad buck could spare you a
                       couple of weeks.  take you out of the
                       frenzy.  i gotta tell you, though, i sure
                       don't miss big city police work.  not
                       that i was ever a great detective.  but
                       up here there's no bureaucracy.  no
                       public relations.  no blurred lines.
                       just good guys and bad guys.  simple.

             a cloud passes over his face.

                                 chief nyback (cont'd)
                       except for this.

             holds up a file.  the name written on the lip:  kay connell.
