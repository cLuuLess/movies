             int. will's room - pioneer lodge - day

             will, bursts into his room at the lodge.  the shoulders of
             his coat still wet with sea spray.  crosses to the area of
             the floor where kay connell's files are still spread out.

             starts pressing the floorboards with the toe of his boot.
             testing.  testing.  until...he finds the one that squeaks.

             gets down on his knees.  hesitates.  then jams his fingers in
             around the loose board.  starts pulling it up.  face
             reddening.  knuckles whitening.  slips his hand into the gap.

             pulls out a muddy 357 ruger.

             the killer's gun.

             will, stares down at it.
