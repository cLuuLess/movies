             int. back room - pioneer lodge - evening

             rachel in the back room behind reception.  a pullman's
             kitchen, a desk, an old recliner.  pouring some milk into a
             bowl for a cat.  a stray.

             will walks in.  rachel turns, smiles.

                                 rachel
                       i found a new friend.

             will walks up to her.  puts his arms around her.  holds her,
             smells her, kisses her neck.  pulls away.  looks into her
             eyes.

                                 rachel (cont'd)
                       will.  what is it?

             he doesn't answer.  the cat, rubs against his leg.  purring.
