             ext. nightmute elementary - late night

             a little league game in full swing.  the uniforms, a little
             faded.  the diamond, a little unkempt.  a smattering of
             spectators.  mostly dads with six-packs.

             will wanders over to the fence.  spots ellie sitting alone on
             the bottom bleacher.

                                                                   cut to:

             pov of someone

             watching him.  from afar.  the sounds of the game, delayed a
             few seconds.  watches as will crosses to the bleachers...

                                                              cut back to:

             ...and sits down next to ellie.  she turns, surprised.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       detective dormer!  what are you doing
                       here?
                           (looks at watch)
                       it's two-thirty in the morning.
                       shouldn't you be asleep?

             will glances out at the game.

                                 will
                       i could say the same thing about you.

                                 ellie
                       oh.  we always have play-offs in the
                       middle of the night.  it's the best time.

                                 will
                       who's playing?

                                 ellie
                       the puffins and the hawks.  we're in
                       extra innings.  the hawks have a really
                       good line-up this year.

             she sips on a take-out coke.  looks back at the game.  a
             plump, redheaded girl comes up to bat.  blows a bubble.

                                 ellie
                       that's my sister.

             will looks over just in time to see the girl swing and miss
             by a mile.  ellie cups her hands around her mouth.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                           (calling out)
                       that's okay, lib!
                           (to will)
                       usually she's better.

                                 will
                       she your only sibling?

                                 ellie
                           (nods)
                       twelve years younger.

             libby takes another swing.  connects with the ball.  drops
             the bat and runs to first.  ellie gives a sharp whistle.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       what about you?  you have any siblings?

                                 will
                       no.
                           (rubs his eyes)
                       well.  i had a brother.  he died when i
                       was eleven.

             ellie, sits up...

                                 ellie
                       oh, i shouldn't have...

                                 will
                       it's okay.  happened a long time ago.  he
                       was killed in a fire.  in new mexico.

                                 ellie
                       that must have been awful for you.

             will leans back.  stretching his legs.  remembering.

                                 will
                       not really. 
                           (slight smile)
                       i remember i was more embarrassed that he
                       had died.  embarrassed that it made me
                       different.  so i didn't tell the other kids
                       at school what had happened.  they'd ask 
                       me where he was, where he'd gone.  and i'd
                       make up stories.  he was visiting an aunt up
                       north, he'd broken his leg, he was in a 
                       swiss boarding school.  stuff like that.
                           (shakes his head)
                       nice kid, huh?  just kept making up more
                       and more lies...

             suddenly, he stops talking.  slowly sits up.  sensing 
             something.  ellie, noticing the shift.

                                 ellie
                       you okay?

             the row of dads behind them.  jump up and start cheering.

                                                                   cut to:

             pov of the person

             watching will.  sees him sit up.  look around.  that same
             prickle at the back of his neck.  a kid slides home just as...

                                                              cut back to:

             ...will stands.  trying to shake the feeling.

                                 will
                       i'm going back to the lodge, ellie.
                       still need to go through some of kay
                       connell's school records.

                                 ellie
                           (unsure)
                       okay.

             he turns to go, scanning the area.  ellie calls after him.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       try to get some sleep!
