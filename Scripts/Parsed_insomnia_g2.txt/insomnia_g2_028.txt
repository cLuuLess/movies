             ext. down the beach - continuous

             will heads towards the sound.  reaching out for approaching
             rocks.  scrambles over a small bank and finds...

             farrell rolled up into a fetal position on the ground. 
             clutching his thigh.  blood seeping through his fingers.  he
             looks up.

                                 farrell
                       sorry about...

                                 will
                       where is he?

             farrell can't answer that.

                                 will (cont'd)
                           (impatient)
                       where'd the shot come from?

             farrell lifts his bloody hand.  points off towards the water.

                                 farrell
                       over there.

             will disappears back into the fog, leaving farrell behind.

             clambers back down towards the water, pausing every few 
             seconds to listen, to adjust.  heart pounding.  blood 
             pumping.  like an animal tracking its prey.  leaps up onto a
             plateau of rocks when...

             suddenly

             a dark figure

             flashes past him.  the killer!  inches away.  will wheels
             around...

                                 will
                       freeze!

             crack!  squeezes off a shot.  misses!  can't believe it.
             goes for another... nothing!  jammed!  the figure,
             disappearing.  will tosses his smith and wesson, reaches
             behind his back and whips out his smith 39/13...
