             ext. up on the beach - continuous
 
             ellie, weapon drawn, making her way down the rocks.  a hand
             suddenly grabs her arm.

                                 voice (o.s.)
                       dammit, ellie!...

             fred emerges from the fog.

                                 fred (cont'd)
                       put that thing away!  farrell's down!...

             crack! as another shot rips through the air.  fred and ellie
             freeze.
