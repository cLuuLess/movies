             int. chief charles nyback's office - nightmute pd - day

             close on a hand.  signing the bottom of a form.

                                 chief nyback (o.s.)
                       i was hoping not to send you back with so
                       much paperwork, will.

             pull back to reveal chief nyback sitting at his desk.  will
             stands before him.  signing papers.  a bottle of bourbon on
             the desk.  some paper cups half filled.

                                 chief nyback (cont'd)
                       when are you taking off?

             will checks his watch.

                                 will
                       six-thirty.

             fred, standing over by the filing cabinet.  toothpick in his
             mouth.

                                 fred
                       if spencer's not too drunk to fly.

             nyback chuckles.

                                 chief nyback
                       can't talk you into staying for a couple of
                       days?  do some fishing?  show you what
                       normally goes on around here.

             will shakes his head.

                                 will
                       i have to get back.

                                 chief nyback
                       too bad...

             looks over at fred picking his teeth.

                                 chief nyback (cont'd)
                       ...brought some real class to the place.
                       but, seattle needs its hero back.
                           (stands)
                       couldn't have done it without you, will.

             will caps the pen.  uncomfortable.  nods towards fred.

                                 will
                       had a lot of help from nightmute's 
                       finest.

             just then the door swings open.  they look over as

             ellie hurries in.  she smiles.  looks tired.

                                 ellie
                       didn't want to miss anything.

                                 chief nyback
                       detective dormer's not leaving for a few
                       hours.

                                 ellie
                       good.

                                 chief nyback
                       maybe you could drive him to spencer's.

                                 ellie
                       sure.

             an awkward beat.  ellie walks over to will.  looks up.
             suddenly throws her arms around him.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       i thought what you did on this case was
                       amazing.

             will holds his hands out.  not sure what to do.  looks down
             at the top of ellie's head.

             ellie's hand

             slips down his back.  feeling for a holster.  for that 39/13.
             nothing.  she breaks away.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       we're really going to miss you around
                       here.

             she and will lock eyes.  hold for a beat.

             he knows exactly what she was trying to do.
