             int./ext. jeep cherokee - day

             ellie driving.  a hula-girl, swinging from the rear-view
             mirror.  will in the passenger seat.  wearing a crisp suit.
             ellie hands him a take-out bag.

                                 ellie
                       brought you a bear claw.  just in case
                       you were hungry.

             will takes the bag.  looks inside.  yikes.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       local delicacy.

                                 will
                       think i'll pass.

             he puts the bag on the dash.  looks out the window.
             nightmute's main street.  a line of shops.  undistinguished
             town hall.  elementary school up on a hill.  sign out front:
             sign-ups for midnight little league!

                                 will (cont'd)
                       what kind of calls you get around here?

                                 ellie
                       oh.  you know.  small-time stuff.
                       nothing like what you must get.  mostly
                       drinking-related problems.  domestic
                       abuse.  barroom fights.  stuff like that.

             she shifts down.  takes a steep turn.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       in the summer months it's pretty quiet.
                       that's when there's work out on the
                       boats.  the rest of the year, though...

             they pass a man walking along the road.  gnarled walking
             stick.  ellie calls out the window.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       hey, there, joe!

             joe waves.  they pass.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       that's joe willy.  took his family 
                       hostage in november.  that was the most
                       exciting thing that happened last year.
                       i wasn't there, though.
                           (grinds gear)
                       chief barely lets me handle anything
                       above a misdemeanor.

             will looks over at her.  smiles.

                                 will
                       don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.

                                 ellie
                       but they're so boring.  all small stuff.

                                 will
                       it's all about the small stuff.  small
                       lies.  small mistakes.  small oversights.
                       people give themselves away in a traffic
                       violation just as much as they do in a
                       murder case.  it's human nature.

             he looks over.  ellie's listening intently.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       aren't you going to write that down?

             ellie, searching her pockets for something to write with...

                                 ellie
                       let me just...

             stops.  looks over.  realises will's teasing her.
