             int./ext. cherokee - umkumiut - next day

             close on walter byrd's appointment book laying open.
             scrawled in pencil:  8:30.  dr. agee.

             pull back to reveal will sitting in the parked cherokee.  the
             appointment book on the passenger seat.  been there all night.

             insomnia.  taking its toll.  his hair, no longer neatly
             combed.  his face, pale and unshaven.  his eyes, dragged open
             from fatigue.  looks like the whole world's pulling him down.
             staring down the street at a
   
             brick building on the corner.  a placard by the front door:
             dr. florence agee, d.d.s.

             will checks his watch.  rubs his eyes with the heels of his
             hands.  suddenly.  something tells him to look up.

             a man

             in the distance, walking along the road.  towards dr. agee's.
             he's in his forties.  short, shoulders sloped.  wears a 
             beige, zip-up windbreaker, khakis, brown desert boots.

             walter byrd

             has a bulky hearing aid in one ear.  is looking down at the
             road.  glances up.

             locks eyes with will

             byrd, slows his pace.

             will, reaches for the door handle.

             suddenly

             byrd turns in the other direction, starts walking fast.

             will leaps out of the cherokee and heads after him.

             walter byrd

             his short legs pumping, spots a tour bus across the road.
             veers over to it.

             will

             a runner's stride.  weaves through people.  closing in on
             byrd.  sees his plan.  cuts across the road just as...

             a pick-up

             rounds the corner.  thump!  broadsides him.  will's pitched
             up and over the hood.  falls hard on the tarmac.  dazed for a
             second.  blood, gushing from his forehead.  hears the pick-up
             door open...feet running over to him.

                                 woman's voice (o.s.)
                       are you alright?  you popped out from
                       nowhere!

             more feet running over.

                                 man's voice (o.s.)
                       he okay?

             will opens his eyes.  trying to focus.  looks up and sees, in
             the distance...walter byrd getting on the tour bus.

             will struggles to his feet.  the old lady who hit him,
             wearing overalls.  reaches out.

                                 old lady
                       i don't think you should move.

             will stands, wavering.  flashes her his badge.
