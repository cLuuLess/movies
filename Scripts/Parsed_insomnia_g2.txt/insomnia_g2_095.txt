             int./ext. pick-up

             the old lady rips along in the truck.  will sits in the
             passenger seat, a handkerchief to his forehead.  it's soaked
             with blood.  the lady looks over.

                                 old lady
                       you sure you're okay?

                                 will
                       i'm fine.

                                 old lady
                       careful not to bleed on my interior.

             will looks over at her.  shifts in his seat.  ouch.  feels
             like a couple cracked ribs.  peers out the windshield at the
             tour bus a few cars ahead of them.
