             ext. road near beach - day

             close on a row of feet.  mostly boots.  some more beat-up
             than others.  inching forward along a road.

                                 will (o.s.)
                       ...anything catches your eye, you put it
                       in a bag.  anything looks strange, you
                       put it in a bag...

             pull back to reveal a long line of people stretched out
             across the road about a mile up the beach.  some old, some
             young.  linking arms and moving forward.  looking down.  the
             search party.

             will, walking up and down behind the line.  talking through a
             megaphone.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       ...anything he may have dropped, moved,
                       kicked, or stepped on, you put in a bag.
                       cigarette butts, gum wrappers, paper
                       clips, coins, buttons - nine times out of
                       ten a suspect leaves something behind...

                                 voice (o.s.)
                       detective?

             will turns.  a couple burly guys with some bloodhounds.

                                 burly guy #1
                       where do you want us?

             will points over to the woods on the other side of the road.

                                 will
                       the woods.  one group heading south, the
                       other heading north.

             nods to fred who's standing nearby.  he hands the guys two
             radios.
 
                                 fred
                       make sure they're set to channel 6...

             just then two young officers pull up in a squad car.  young
             and apple-cheeked.  the first one holding a piece of paper.

                                 officer #1
                       we did the interviews with all the nearby
                       houses like you asked.

                                 will 
                       anything?

                                 officer #1
                           (shakes his head)
                       here's a list of who we talked to.

             hands the list to will.  he glances it.

                                 will
                       alright.  go back and set up some follow-
                       ups for this afternoon.

             the officers nod, put the car in reverse.  fred saunters
             over.  nods towards the searchers.

                                 fred
                       you don't think they should start further
                       back?

             will shakes his head.

                                 will
                       he had to have exited here.  over those
                       boulders.  i saw him move, he's nimble.
                       would have taken the hardest way out.

             fred shrugs, skeptical.  just then, his cell phone bleats.
             he reaches for it.

                                 fred
                           (into phone)
                       duggar...

             will looks back at the search team.  slow.  meticulous.

                                 fred (cont'd)
                           (into phone)
                       where was it?

             a local woman.  at the end of the line.  glances over her
             shoulder.  looks at will.  smiles.  you'll help us catch him.

                                 fred (cont'd)
                           (into phone)
                       okay. 
                           (slaps phone closed)
                       that was ellie.

             will turns back to him.

                                 fred (cont'd)
                       they found farrell's bullet.  says it
                       looks like a 357.  after the autopsy rich
                       can drive 'em both to the lab in
                       anchorage.  have a murder weapon by
                       morning.

             fred crosses his arms.  sarcastic.

                                 fred (cont'd)
                       that is, if it's alright with you.
