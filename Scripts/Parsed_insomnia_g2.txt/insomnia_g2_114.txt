             int. will's room - later

             will and rachel in bed.  spooning.  rachel behind will, her
             finger tracing his scar.  rain drums against the window.

             will.  watching the raindrops streaming down the glass.
             casting strange shadows against the wall.

                                 will
                       there was this guy named weston dobbs.
                       twenty-four.  worked as a part-time stock
                       boy in a copy store.  every morning he'd
                       sit at the only window in his apartment
                       and watch an eight year-old boy get
                       picked up by his carpool across the
                       street.  and every afternoon he'd watch
                       the boy get dropped off again.  he did
                       this for about six months.  until one day
                       he got up the nerve to cross the street
                       and grab the boy before his carpool came.
                       kept him in his apartment for three days.
                       tortured him.  raped him.  made him do
                       things...

             will tenses his jaw.  rachel, listens in horror.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       when he was done, he got a rope and a
                       kitchen stool and hanged the boy in the
                       basement of the apartment building.  but
                       he didn't do a good enough job.  the
                       little boy's neck didn't break and he
                       died from shock.  the landlord found him
                       five days later.

             rachel reaches for will's hand.  squeezes it.

                                 rachel
                       one of your cases?

                                 will
                       me and hap.  a year and a half ago.  i
                       knew the second i met dobbs that he was
                       guilty.  smug, cold.  dead eyes.  we had
                       circumstantial evidence, but nothing to
                       tie him to it.  nothing concrete.  went
                       over every inch of that apartment.

             he pauses.

                                 rachel
                       what happened?

             will turns slowly over to face her.  her hair, splayed out on
             the pillow.  her cheeks, flushed.  her eyes, listening.

                                 will
                       we took some blood samples from the boy's
                       body and planted them in his apartment.
                           (beat)
                       arrested him the next day.

             rachel looks at him.  goose pimples on her arms.  realising
             the weight of the confession.

                                 rachel
                       will.

                                 will
                       there've been other cases.  where we've
                       changed results.  pushed witnesses.
                       manipulated evidence.
                           (rubs his face)
                       but dobbs.  i wanted dobbs more than
                       anything.

             he sits up.  abrupt.  wincing from the pain in his ribs.
             rests his arms on his knees.

                                 rachel
                       what if someone finds out?

                                 will
                       we're under investigation now.  back in
                       seattle.
                           (beat)
                       hap wanted to talk.  as soon as we got
                       back.  thought he could work out some
                       kind of deal.

             rachel rubs his shoulder.

                                 rachel
                       well, that's not going to happen now.

             will closes his eyes.  the rain, pattering.  rhythmic.

                                 will
                       do you think it was wrong?  what we did?

             there's a pause.  rachel, studying will's back.  the cuts.
             the bruises.  not sure how to answer.

                                 rachel
                       there are two kinds of people in alaska. 
                       those who were born here and those who've
                       come here to escape something in their
                       lives.
                           (beat)
                       i wasn't born here, will.  i'm in no
                       position to judge anyone.  i'm not about
                       that any more.

             looks out the window.

                                 rachel (cont'd)
                       it's all about what you're willing to
                       live with.
