             int. cherokee - forest - day

             sunlight dappling through tall fir trees.  will drives.
             tanya sitting next to him.  her black skirt riding up.
             picking at the flaking polish on her nails.
 
                                 tanya
                       i never met anyone from seattle before.

                                 will
                       you're not missing much.

                                 tanya
                       what are you doing in this shit-hole
                       town?

             will, shifts.  looks over.

                                 will
                       you were good friends with kay connell,
                       weren't you?

             tanya hesitates.  pulls a cigarette from her purse.

                                 tanya
                       i was her best friend.

                                 will
                       best friend?

                                 tanya
                       since grade school.

                                 will
                       that's a long time.

                                 tanya
                       we were like sisters.  knew everything
                       about each other.

                                 will
                       must be tough for you.  what happened.

             tanya shrugs.  lights the cigarette.  takes a drag.

                                 tanya
                       everybody says i'm holding up great,
                       considering.  don't even care if i go to
                       school.  they're all worried i haven't
                       cried yet.

             she stretches.  her midriff showing.  shifts her body towards
             will.

                                 tanya (cont'd)
                       but there's no law against not crying,
                       right?

                                 will
                       what about kay's other friends?

             tanya makes a face.  reaches out and taps the hula-girl.

                                 tanya
                       do we have to talk about kay?  i don't
                       want to talk about her right now.  let's
                       just drive.  go somewhere.

             will looks over at her.  she blows out a plume of smoke.
             smiles.  seductive.

                                 will
                       you want me to take you somewhere?

                                 tanya
                       long as it's fun.

             she reaches out a sinewy arm.  starts massaging the back of
             will's neck.

                                 tanya (cont'd)
                       young, impressionable girl left alone
                       with older, seattle detective.  who knows
                       what we could get up to.

             will, impervious to the touch.  head, throbbing.  reaches for
             the gear.  his foot, pressing harder on the gas.
