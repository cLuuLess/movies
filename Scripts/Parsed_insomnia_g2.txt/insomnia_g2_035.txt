             int. pioneer lodge - later

             will walks up to reception.  no one there.  just wants his
             key.  rings the bell.  in the back room, he hears a radio.

                                 radio
                       ...earlier this evening after an aborted
                       attempt to apprehend a suspect.  he was
                       forty-five...

             it clicks off abruptly.  rachel appears in the doorway.
             takes in the blood on will's shirt.

                                 rachel
                       i'm sorry about your partner.

             will looks at her.  she walks over to the desk.

                                 rachel (cont'd)
                       it's been on the radio for the last two
                       hours.  nothing but that.  like when they
                       found kay connell's body.
                           (sympathetic smile)
                       we're not used to this sort of thing up
                       here.

             she reaches for his key.

                                 rachel (cont'd)
                       he was standing right there just a couple
                       of days ago.  your partner.  exactly
                       where you are now.
                           (beat)
                       i hope i was nice to him.

             will takes his key.

                                 will
                       you were nice to him.  he liked you.

             he smiles faintly, turns to go.  just then the phone rings.

                                 rachel
                           (answering)
                       pioneer lodge?...
                           (listens)
                       hold on a second.  he's right here.

             will stops.  turns.  rachel holds up the phone.  covering the
             mouthpiece.

                                 rachel (cont'd)
                       john warfield.  he's called a couple of
                       times.

             will's stomach drops.  that's the last phone call in the 
             world he wants to take.  rachel reads his face.

                                 rachel (cont'd)
                       want me to lie?

             will shakes his head.  steps back and takes the phone.
             clears his throat.

                                 will
                           (into phone)
                       dormer.

             pause.  a bemused voice on the other end.

                                 warfield's voice
                       detective dormer.  i've been trying to
                       reach you.  i was very sorry to hear
                       about your partner, detective eckhart.
                       it must have been a terrible shock, what
                       happened this morning.

             will.  not giving this asshole an inch.  rachel, trying not
             to listen.

                                 will
                           (into phone)
                       that's not exactly how i'd put it.

                                 warfield's voice (cont'd)
                       no, no.  i suppose not.  but i look
                       forward to reading the report.  very
                       sad.  very sad.  funny...

                                 will
                           (into phone)
                       what do you mean, "funny?"

                                 warfield's voice
                       oh, nothing.  just that i felt detective
                       eckhart and i, hap and i, were starting
                       to make a real connection before you
                       left.  i sensed that he was ready to get
                       some things off his chest.  did you
                       sense anything like that, detective?  i
                       mean, as his partner?...

             will, squeezing the phone cord with his bloody fist.

                                 warfield's voice (cont'd)
                       ...you were his partner for, what, about
                       ten years?...

             will turns from rachel.  eyes burning.  voice steady.

                                 will
                           (into phone)
                       you know why everyone hates you,
                       warfield?  it's not your questions, it's
                       not your press conferences, it's not even
                       your cheap suits; everyone hates you
                       'cause day after day you suck the marrow
                       out of real cops when you never had the
                       balls to become one yourself.  well i got
                       to tell you, it's a shame you're not up
                       here with me because i'd love to show you
                       right now just what a real cop is capable
                       of.  you just remember that when you're
                       sitting at your bullshit desk reading
                       your bullshit report on my dead partner!

             slam!  he hangs up the phone.  runs his hand through his
             hair.  turns back to rachel.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       next time.  go ahead and lie.
