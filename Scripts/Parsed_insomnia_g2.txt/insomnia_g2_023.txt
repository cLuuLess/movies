             ext. rocky beach - outside nightmute - morning

             pov through binoculars

             a wooden cabin comes into focus.  right by the water.  hasn't
             been used in years.  weathered, slate roof.  algae growing up
             the sides.

                                 hap (o.s.)
                       nice.  lighter than i remembered.

             will lowers his binoculars.  he's standing on the black rocky
             beach.  it's damp, slick, and cold.  a fog's rolling in.

             hap and farrell are sitting behind a cluster of rocks.  a
             couple paper bags and a megaphone.  they're comparing guns.

                                 farrell
                       glock 40.  all plastic save the barrel
                       and firing pin.  never rusts.  what do
                       you carry down in seattle?

             hap reaches into his holster.  pulls out a...

                                 hap
                       smith and wesson 45.

                                 farrell
                       excellent!

             fred duggar's standing on the other side of them.  he's got a
             pair of binoculars, too.  they're staking out the cabin.
             been there a while.

                                 ellie (o.s.)
                       brought some coffee...

             ellie appears with a thermos.  crouching down.  fred turns,
             annoyed.

                                 fred
                       what are you doing here?

                                 will
                           (answering for her)
                       i told her to come.

             fred shoots will a look.  down at his cowboy boots.  will
             gives him a smile.

                                 ellie
                       anything yet?

                                 will                    fred
                       nothing.                nothing.

             fred goes back to scanning, pissed.

                                 farrell
                       maybe this guy doesn't read the papers.

                                 hap
                       or goes straight to the sports section.

             hap and farrell chuckle.  hap unscrews the thermos.  a cloud
             of steam.

                                 hap (cont'd)
                       who gets first dibs?
                           (looks up at will)
                       will?

             will looks down at his partner.  holding out the thermos like
             a weird kind of truce.  will turns away, rejecting it.  a
             swath of thick fog unfolds over the black rocks as...

             fred tenses.

                                 fred
                           (looking through binoculars)
                       i see someone!

             hap and farrell scramble to their feet.  will whips up his
             binoculars.

             pov through will's binoculars - a figure making its way to 
             the cabin.  furtive.

                                 will (o.s.)
                       that's him.

             will lowers the binoculars.  snaps his fingers at the men.
 
                                 will (cont'd)
                       fan out.

             fred, farrell and hap.  start spreading out.  ellie steps
             up.  will looks back at her.  too dangerous.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       stay here, ellie.

                                 ellie
                       but...

             will puts up his hand.  she stops short.  he plunges ahead.

             hap.  will.  farrell.  fred.  fanning out.  silent.  keeping
             eye-contact.  will points to farrell.  wants the megaphone.
             farrell, balancing on a rock, holds it out.  accidentally
             keys it.  the feedback squawks.  fuck.

                                 fred
                       he's bolting!

             pov through will's binoculars - the figure, looking around,
             running towards the cabin.  leaping from rock to rock.

             will reaches for his smith and wesson.

                                 will
                       go!  go!  go!

             the men jump into action.  race down towards the cabin.

             fred and farrell, nimble over the wet rocks.  will and hap,
             harder going.  grab onto jagged edges, slip down small
             crevices.  rocks sticking out every which way.  the fog,
             thick and white...

             the figure disappears into the cabin.

             fred and farrell leap up onto a tall boulder and jump down.
             run over to the door of the cabin, guns at the ready...

             will rounds the boulder, hap panting behind him.  joins fred
             and farrell at the door.

             will levels his smith and wesson at the door, and with a nod
             to fred as he kicks it in...
