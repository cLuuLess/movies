             int. front hallway - house - night

             slam!  ellie heads through the front door like a gust of
             wind.  thunders up the stairs.  calls out.

                                 ellie
                       me, pop!

             we hear the tv in the other room.  an older man, ellie's
             father, appears in the doorway.  thick glasses, grey stubble,
             big paunch.  wearing a flannel robe.

                                 ellie's dad
                       ellie?  you okay?

             ellie appears at the top of the stairs.

                                 ellie
                       where's all my academy stuff?
