             ext. tunnel - continuous

             ...he exits the tunnel onto the rocky beach.  stops short.

             fog

             has enveloped everything - obscuring all vision, dulling all
             sound.  like a strange dream.  eerie.

             will blinks against the thick whiteness.  strains to hear any
             sound, anything.  there's only the distant lapping of the
             water.

             he tightens his grip on his gun and plunges into the fog.
             quick, careful steps.  stumbles over a rock.  waves his gun
             in defense.  eyes wide open like a blind man...

             suddenly

             a gunshot.  off to the right.  will whips his head around.
