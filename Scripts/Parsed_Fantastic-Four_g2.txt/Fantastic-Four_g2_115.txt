               int. baxter building - transformation lab - day

               reed enters the room carrying a stack of boxes that no normal
               man could balance.  but he is not normal.  his arms are
               wrapped around the boxes five times over -- like human twine. 
               he stops short, and drops the boxes when he sees...

               victor overseeing a group of technicians.  they are boxing up
               reed's work -- all of his equipment, research.  victor wears
               a bandage, covering his scar.  reed eyes a glint of metal.

                                   reed
                         victor, are you...are you okay? 

               victor turns away.

                                   victor
                         don't worry about me.  worry about
                         yourself.

               reed looks around, seeing his lab turned inside out.

                                   reed
                         what are you doing here?

                                   victor
                         what i should have done a long time
                         ago.  applications and patents, reed. 
                         this all belongs to me.

               reed reaches out, grabbing a folder from a box.

                                   reed
                         but i'm not done with the machine --

                                   victor
                         which is precisely the point.
                         analysis is over.  it's time for
                         action.  my men could have mass-
                         produced this by now.

               reed shakes his head, defending himself.

                                   reed
                         mass-produced?  this isn't a
                         toaster.  you have no idea how it
                         works.

               victor pulls the folder from reed's hand, and whips out the
               intricate diagram of the machine.  he points to parts:

                                   victor
                         re-create the storm, invert the
                         polarity here, reverse the mutation
                         there.  don't talk to me like i'm some
                         schoolboy.  i've got the same phd you
                         do.

               reed is a little surprised that victor is so familiar with
               his machine.  he points to a secure chamber on the blueprint.

                                   reed
                         the storm needs to be handled exactly
                         right, or it could make our mutations
                         worse, much worse, maybe even kill
                         us...

               victor slows.  is reed getting to him?  or giving him ideas?

                                   reed (cont'd)
                         victor, please.  we need time to
                         verify the data... we can't afford any
                         mistakes -- there's only enough ions
                         for two or three attempts.

               victor considers.  he seems to enjoy watching reed dangle.

                                   victor
                         reed.  i'm not asking permission.
                             (a final verdict)
                         we'll build it, while you check the
                         specs.

               victor walks out.  reed looks unsure, as we cut to --
