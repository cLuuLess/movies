               int. baxter building - transformation lab - night

               lights flicker in darkness.  the door rips open.  sue lunges
               inside.  she sees through smoke and sparks...reed sways in
               the chamber.  a beat.  did it work?  then...

               reed slumps to the ground.  his eyes flutter back.  dead...? 
               his body is warped, twisted -- one half remains tense, hard,
               while the other half is loose, soft, almost melted.

                                   sue
                         what did you do, reed?  what did you
                         do?
