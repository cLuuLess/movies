               reed and sue, tables turned: reed observes her through a
               prismatic device measuring light refraction.  he "sees" her
               through the device: lit up like some heavenly creature.  he's
               having a hard time concentrating.  he focuses on his work.

                                   reed
                         it's not "invisibility" per se. 
                         you're bending the light around you
                         with some kind of malleable force
                         field.  that's what you projected on
                         the bridge.

                                   sue
                         what about you?  you haven't eaten in
                         days.  how come you're never on this
                         side of the microscope?

               he tightens, uncomfortable with being center of attention. 
               she reaches for his arm, like a specimen.  he pulls away, but
               she sees a glimpse of bruises on his arms.  she slows down.

                                   sue (cont'd)
                         bruises...from the bridge?

               he nods, rolls down his sleeves.

                                   reed
                         have you had any side-effects, from
                         your powers?

               she considers.  a little vulnerable.

                                   sue
                         i've had some headaches.  migraines.

               a beat.  reed drops his eyes, makes a note, back to work.

                                   reed
                         you should be able to bend light
                         around other objects, even people, if
                         you could control your emotional state
                         better --

                                   sue
                         excuse me?

               she is annoyed.  reed is oblivious.

                                   reed
                         i'm saying, if you had a little more
                         self control, you could locate the
                         trigger.  can you remember the exact
                         emotions when --

                                   sue
                         anger.  rage.  frustration.

                                   reed
                         okay.  is there any way to duplicate
                         that feeling?  some memory or...

                                   sue
                             (staring right at him)
                         i'm sure i can come up with something.

               she looks at reed, eyes narrow.  she becomes invisible.  as
               she focuses on reed -- and gets angry -- a small, clear force
               field forms around her body.  the force-field bends light
               around a microscope, which goes invisible.  reed steps out to
               ask...

                                   reed
                         how's that coming -- whoa --

               the force-field shoots in all directions, knocking everything
               over in a fifteen foot radius.  reed is thrown from his
               chair.

                                   sue
                         i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i didn't mean to
                         do that... you must think that was
                         some kind of latent hostility or --

                                   reed
                         what in the world would give me that
                         idea?

               an awkward beat.

                                   reed (cont'd)
                         i mean, you broke up with me, right?

                                   sue
                         are you kidding?

                                   reed
                         no, i distinctly remember: you walked
                         out my door.  ergo...

               she didn't want to get into this.  she looks down,
               vulnerable.

                                   sue
                         reed.  i was ready for the next step,
                         you weren't, ergo, i walked.

                                   reed
                         i think it was a little more
                         complicated than --

                                   sue
                         i just wanted to share an apartment. 
                         what was so complicated about that?

               the question stumps him.  a beat.  he struggles.

                                   reed
                         there were a lot of variables to
                         consider --

                                   sue
                         no.  there weren't.  there was you. 
                         and me.  no variables, no math.  it
                         was actually the simplest thing in the
                         world.  but your head got in the way...
                         like it always does.

               her words penetrate.  he knows she's right.  he looks away.

                                   reed
                         sue...i just...i thought...

               he struggles for the words.

                                   sue
                         same old reed.  too much thinking...

               he opens his mouth, but...wham!  doors open.  johnny enters,
               wearing a charred shirt.  he points to the burned scraps of
               his shirt.

                                   johnny
                         okay guys, we have a serious problem.
