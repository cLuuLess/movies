               ext. brooklyn bridge - day

               ben stands in the middle of the chaos, staring at the
               destruction.  he sees the tow-truck driver bleeding, trapped
               in his cab.  ben moves to this burning hunk of steel.

               he swipes through the shattered window, and punches the
               airbag, popping it like a kid's balloon.  he tries to grab
               the seat-belt, but his fingers are too big.  he struggles.

                                   ben
                         a little help here?!  you wanna hit
                         that button, sir?

               the driver is too woozy.  ben can't get to the button. 
               frustrated, he simply tears off the door, and rips the
               driver's seat right out of the cab!  cops round the corner. 
               they see ben holding onto the driver.  they raise their guns.

                                   cop
                         freeze!  put the man and the seat
                         down!

               ben looks at the cops.  pedestrians stare, point.  he
               realizes how this must look -- a monster holding a bloody man
               in hand.
