               int. space station - observation deck - same time

               sue descends the stairs at victor's behest.  joins him.

                                   victor
                         surprised i agreed to reed's proposal?

                                   sue
                         i understand the business reasons.

                                   victor
                         well, when you're looking at your
                         future, it never hurts to find closure
                         about the past.

               sue's eyes narrow.  what is this about...?

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         susan, every man dreams that he'll
                         meet some woman he can give the world
                         to.

               he presses a button and the observation deck's outer windows
               open up, revealing a spectacular, romantic view of the earth.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         in my case, it's not just a metaphor.

               while she stares out the window, victor reaches into a
               pocket, revealing a ring box.  sue looks unsettled.
