               int. baxter building - elevator - day

               the doors close, and victor really lets loose.  he slams his
               fist into a steel wall.  the wall buckles, steel denting.

               victor shakes out his hand, and sees...a rippling metallic
               shell under the skin.  he stares at it in horror.  the dark
               surface pulsates with electric energy.  what is he
               becoming...?
