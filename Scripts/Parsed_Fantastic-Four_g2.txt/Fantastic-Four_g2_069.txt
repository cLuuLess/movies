               int. victor's office - day

               victor sits with remote in hand, staring at his plasma tv. 
               on the tv: he sees a crowd of firemen applauding the new
               fantastic four.  for the first time they strike a heroic
               pose.  leonard enters, with a phone in his hand.

                                   leonard
                         uh, sir...larry king called, to
                         cancel.
                             (seeing the tv, a beat)
                         apparently, there's a bigger story.

               victor sees reed put his arms around sue as he covers her
               with the jacket. and the penny drops: he's furious.  as it
               hits him, he feels something odd.  he looks down at his
               hand...at glints of gleaming metal poking through flesh.
