               int. o'donnel's pub - night

               a big photo of ben grimm in his astronaut heyday occupies a
               place over the bar.  ben enters, and the bar goes silent.  he
               moves through the crowd.  people clear out of the way.

               ben reaches the bar.  he sits on a stool, and crunch!  smash! 
               the stool snaps like a toothpick.  he hits the ground hard. 
               glasses shake.  a few patrons smile, laugh softly.

                                   ben
                         that's not funny!

               they go silent.  they drop bills onto tables, filing out,
               scared of this monster.  ernie works the bar.

                                   ernie
                         hey, that's ben grimm there, the first
                         mook from brooklyn to go to outer
                         space, so pay him some respect!

               but the patrons keep filing out.  ben looks down, weary.

                                   ben
                         ernie.  sorry for killing your
                         business.  i'll take the usual, then
                         i'm out... better make it a double.

               ernie heads for the booze.  ben gives a sad shake of his
               head.  then he notices...one lone patron at the end of the
               bar.  a beautiful young woman nursing a drink.  meet alicia
               masters.

                                   alicia
                         who killed the party?

               she turns to him, unafraid.  he notices her blank stare, lack
               of focus, and white cane.  alicia is blind.

                                   ernie (o.s.)
                         make it a triple.  on the house,
                         benny.

               ben takes his drink, but smash!  his grip shatters the glass,
               spilling all over himself.  he smiles ruefully.

                                   ben
                         if there's a god, she hates me.

               he grabs a bar-rag to dry off.

                                   alicia
                         i don't think she's real big on hate.

                                   ben
                         you wouldn't say that, if you could
                         see me.

               she knocks back her drink, grabs her cane, steps toward ben.

                                   alicia
                         can i...?  see you...?

               ben doesn't say anything.  a little unnerved by this woman.

                                   alicia (cont'd)
                         it's okay, i won't bite...
                             (feeling his arm)
                         ...not that i could.

               she puts a hand on his face -- something in her tone and
               gentle touch allows ben to let her.  she smiles softly.

                                   alicia (cont'd)
                         such a sad face... you know, sometimes
                         being different isn't a bad thing.

                                   ben
                         trust me, this ain't one of those
                         times.

               she smiles softly, takes her cane, and starts to head out.

                                   alicia
                         see you round, benny...

               right as she hits the door, over her shoulder --

                                   alicia (cont'd)
                         i'm alicia, by the way.

               ben watches her disappear.  he sees a few people staring.  he
               lowers his head, turns back to the bar, and finds a new
               drink, in a steel martini shaker.  he knocks it back.
