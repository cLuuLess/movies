               int. space station - nearby corridor - same time

               reed checks data on a work station, set on a wall.  the
               results of his calculations are not what he expected... he
               sees wind velocity digits rise.  he does a double-take when
               he sees the readout: event threshold, t-minus 10:00.

                         no...no...impossible.  it's...too
                         fast.
