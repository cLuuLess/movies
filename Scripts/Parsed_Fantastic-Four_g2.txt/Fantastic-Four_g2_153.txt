               int. baxter building - later - night

               smoke billows, windows are shattered.  sue races inside,
               seeing doom's devastation.  silence, deadly silence. 
               then...she sees a pile of wreckage shift.  ben crawls out.

                                   sue
                         ben?!

               she helps him out of the rubble.  he is beaten, battered.

                                   johnny (o.s.)
                         sue!

               johnny comes running in.  he sees the wreckage.

                                   johnny (cont'd)
                         i'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --

                                   sue
                         no, i'm sorry, for pushing you out.

               he nods.  a beat between them.  he looks around, sees ben.

                                   johnny
                         jesus, ben!
                             (eyeing him)
                         i go away, look what happens.  you got
                         a lot of explaining to do.

               he motions to the wreckage.

                                   ben
                             (struggling, weak)
                         the machine works.  and vic's gone
                         mister hyde on us --

                                   johnny
                         really?  with a name like von doom? 
                         never saw that one coming.

               sue looks around.  only one question.  dead serious:

                                   sue
                         where is reed?

                                   ben
                         victor must've taken him.
