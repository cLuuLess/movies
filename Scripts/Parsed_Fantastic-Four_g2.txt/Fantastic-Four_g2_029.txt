               ext. space station air lock - day

               the exterior air lock door slides open.  in agonizing,
               weightless slow motion ben reaches to haul himself inside. 

               the leading edge of the cloud hits: ben is pelted by a
               hissing mass of space dust, splattering his suit with orange
               stains.  larger particles, small pellets, pepper him.  ben
               hauls himself in the last few feet by pulling on his tether.
