               ext. lake launch facility - day

               a helicopter shot through trees.  we soar over timberland,
               and find something massive looming on the horizon:

               a spacecraft.  a sleek take on a space shuttle.  modern tech
               combined with industrial design that nasa could never afford. 
               the craft's nose is pointed straight up, ready for launch. 
               workers in jumpsuits are scattered around the two-hundred
               foot tall scaffolding, performing routine checks.
