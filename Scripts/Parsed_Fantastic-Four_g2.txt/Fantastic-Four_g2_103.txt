               ext./int. upscale restaurant - night

               lights twinkle.  a maitre d' leads us through fancy digs. 
               heads turn, whispers flutter.  sue steps out, joining...
               victor at a prime table.  he pulls out her chair, wearing
               gloves.

                                   victor
                         thank you for coming out to see me.

               she nods, a little self-conscious.

                                   sue
                         you said it was urgent.

                                   victor
                         it is.  there's something we need to
                         talk about.  something i need to ask
                         you...

               sue senses where this is going, and she cuts it short.

                                   sue
                             (slow, careful)
                         victor, wait, slow down a second.  i
                         want you to know i appreciate
                         everything you've done for me, but i
                         just don't --

                                   victor
                         susan.  what are you doing?

               he is cold as ice.  if he's hurt, he'll never show it.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         you think i brought you here to talk
                         about us?  please.  this is business.
                             (leaning forward, intense)
                         i need to know: how close is reed
                         to finding to a cure?

               she pauses.  then:

                                   sue
                         he's working round the clock.  but the
                         data needs to be tested, analyzed
                         before --

                                   victor
                         same old reed.  all analysis, no
                         action.  wasn't that the problem with
                         you two?

               she holds tight, keeping cool.

                                   sue
                         if these molecules aren't stable, they
                         could make us worse, maybe even kill
                         us.

                                   victor
                         then why is reed dragging his feet? 
                         maybe he likes having his prize
                         specimen under glass...
                             (closer, cruel)
                         it's ironic, isn't it?  you're finally
                         the perfect woman for him...because
                         you're his science project.

               the words sting.  she can't help but hear some truth in them.

                                   sue
                         please don't make this personal --

                                   victor
                         oh, i think you already have.

                                   sue
                         victor, we can't do anything until the
                         research is ready.

               victor's fist clenches -- metal sfx.

                                   victor
                         "we," huh?

               victor screeches his chair back, pushing the table so hard
               that he spills water.  heads turn, all eyes on sue.  victor
               gets close to her, too close, a hand on her shoulder.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         don't forget who you work for, susan. 
                         so get to work.  and do your job.

               he walks out.  as he goes, he slips the engagement ring out
               of his pocket.  he crushes the diamond to dust, leaves the
               dust in an ashtray, and disappears into the night.

               sue sits embarrassed.  she slowly...disappears.  people gasp. 
               she walks out, invisible, save for her clothes, which drift
               through the air.  at a table full of businessmen --

                                   businessman
                         i wish my wife would disappear.

               the other men laugh, but whhm!  the man's wine spills into
               his lap!  sue walks out.  the restaurant is left buzzing. 
               lights twinkle.  and we fade out.  a beat.  then we crash
               into --
