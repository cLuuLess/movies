               int. investment bank - conference room - day

               the news plays on the tv.  head banker ned cecil freezes the
               screen on an image of...the thing.  he turns to victor, who
               sits with the rest of the bankers.  cold, sterile
               environment.

                                   ned cecil
                         this is how you "turn things around"? 
                         these freaks are on the front page and
                         your company's in the obituaries.

               victor has a larger bandage on his face now.

                                   victor
                         i have a plan to use their publicity
                         for --

                                   ned cecil
                         victor, stop.  the bank's lost enough
                         already.  this isn't a negotiation. 
                         it's a notification.  we're pulling
                         out.

               a cold, silent beat.  victor leans forward.

                                   victor
                         you need to look long-term here. 
                         without risk, there's no --

                                   ned cecil
                         reward.  we all know the sales
                         pitch, vic.  and frankly, we're
                         done buying... gentlemen.

               he motions to his men.  they all stand.  victor is the lone
               man sitting.  push in on victor's face, his inner rage
               palpable.  a few quick surges of electricity emanate from his
               body.  this man is getting stronger, more electric.
