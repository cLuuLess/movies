               the storm is a computer-image on screen now.  behind the
               screen are six chalkboards full of reed's calculations and
               the scribbled beginnings of a machine.

               we pull back to see his arm stretched across the room writing
               on the end of another chalkboard.

               he's moving fast, excited, almost a little manic.  he
               hears...a creak.  he slows down, but doesn't look up to see
               sue enter.

                                   sue

                         the plants, from space.  their
                         particles are still charged.  with the
                         right amount of energy, those ions
                         could create the elemental profile of
                         the cosmic storm.

               he rifles through a desk drawer, then heads out.  sue stands
