               int. von doom industries tower - office - day

               a large, dark office.  ben in the corner.  he yawns,
               watches...

               bright holograms: stars.  planets.  they hover in the air,
               making the room feel like a majestic portal into outer space.

                                   reed (o.s.)
                         my research suggests that exposure to
                         a high-energy cosmic storm born on
                         solar winds might have triggered the
                         evolution of early planetary life.

               reed stands among the holograms, speaking to a mysterious
               figure in shadow behind a desk.  an ominous, pulsating red
               cloud covers the stars.  it washes over a hologram of earth.

                                   reed (cont'd)
                         in six weeks another cloud with the
                         same elemental profile will pass
                         earth's orbit.  a study in space could
                         advance our knowledge about the
                         structure of the human genome, and
                         help cure countless diseases, extend
                         human life --

               the shadow clears his throat.  reed speeds up, emotional.

                                   reed (cont'd)
                         give kids the chance to be stronger,
                         healthier, less prone to --

                                   shadowed figure
                         turn it off.  please.

               the figure's deep voice pierces the darkness.

                                   reed
                         but i haven't fully explained my --

                                   shadowed figure
                         yes you have... imagination.
                         creativity.  passion.  those were
                         always your trademarks.

               lights brighten, revealing the face behind the voice: victor
               von doom.  35, handsome, commanding.  he looks almost...
               airbrushed.  he drops a wired magazine to the desk.  reed is
               on the cover over the words: richards bankrupt, grant
               cutbacks.              

                                   victor
                         but dreams don't pay the bills, do
                         they?
                             (a condescending smile)
                         same old reed, the hopeless optimist. 
                         still reaching for the stars, with the
                         world on your back.

                                   reed
                         you remember in school we talked about
                         working together.  that's what i was
                         about to explain...

               reed presses the remote.  another hologram appears: a shuttle
               slowly approaching an orbiting space station.  both bear the
               von doom industries logo.  victor smiles, more intrigued.

                                   victor
                         so it's not my money you want.  it's
                         my toys... tell me: if nasa doesn't
                         trust you, why should i?

               victor is a step ahead.  reed pauses, thrown for a beat.  ben
               wakes up, suspicious.  victor notices.  he notices
               everything.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         that's my job.  to stay a step ahead. 
                         to know what other men don't.

               ben gets close to reed, turning toward the door.

                                   ben
                         i can't take this.

                                   reed
                             (low, quiet)
                         ben.  this is business.  just work.
                         
               a beat.  victor cracks a smile, enjoying the tension.  and...

                                   sue (o.s.)
                         he's right, ben.

               they turn to see...sue storm (demure, stunning) standing in a
               corner...possibly for the whole presentation.  a little cold:

                                   sue (cont'd)
                         it's just business.

                                   victor
                         i think you both know my director of
                         genetic research, susan storm.

                                   ben
                         heya susie.
                             (under breath, to reed)
                         one more thing he's got.

               sue gracefully walks into the office, only taking her eyes
               off of reed to give ben a warm hug.

                                   sue
                         ben, it's been too long.

               she gives reed a polite handshake.  victor watches carefully. 
               reed looks uncomfortable in her gaze.  a little tongue-tied.

                                   reed
                         you're, you've, i mean, how have you
                         bee--

                                   sue
                         never better.

               victor sizes them up.  he puts a hand on sue's shoulder.

                                   victor
                         this isn't going to be a problem, is
                         it?

                                   reed
                         not at all.

                                   sue
                         ancient history.

               victor smiles, eyeing sue.

                                   victor
                         good.  then you're just in time to
                         hear the great reed richards ask me
                         for help.
                             (to reed)
                         you know, you made a lot of folks at
                         mit feel like a junior high science
                         fair.  so you'll excuse me if i savor
                         the moment.

               ben tightens.  a hard beat.  reed sucks it up.

                                   reed
                         you back this mission, and i'll sign
                         over a fair percentage of any
                         applications or --

                                   victor
                         the number's seventy-five.  and it's
                         applications and patents.

                                   ben
                         what about his first born?

                                   reed
                             (quiet)
                         ben, the money's not important.  we
                         could save lives.

               sue gives a thin smile -- a flicker of old feelings.

                                   victor
                         twenty-five percent of a billion is
                         enough to keep the lights on, isn't
                         it?  maybe even pay off your fourth
                         mortgage on the baxter building.

               they look at victor.  how does he know all this...?

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         deal...?

               reed looks at ben, who shakes his head softly no.  but
               reed...drops a nod.  done.  victor smiles, offers a
               handshake.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         well then, to our future.  together.

               victor squeezes.  hard.  his other hand on sue's shoulder.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         funny how things turn out, isn't it?

                                   reed
                         hilarious.

               as reed and sue lock eyes, ben watches victor.  wary.
