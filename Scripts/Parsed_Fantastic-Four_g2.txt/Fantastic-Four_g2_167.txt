               ext. new york city street - continuous

               crash!  water floods the street.  doom and ben land in a
               large garbage truck.  the truck rocks back and forth, denting
               from the inside.  grunts, growls.

               crash!  the truck suddenly stops.  cop cars speed closer,
               sirens screaming.  and --

               boom, a huge shape explodes from the truck.  smash!  ben
               lands on a car filled with two old ladies -- his head cracks
               the windshield.  doom steps out of the garbage truck, water
               flooding the street around him.  cop cars converge on doom. 

               doom turns his attention to the cops.  his limbs spark with
               electricity, ready to fire at the cars.
