               int. baxter building - transformation lab - night

               reed and sue return, laughing quietly, bodies close.  reed
               turns on the lights, and they flinch when they see...ben.  he
               sits waiting, scowling.  they stop laughing immediately.

                                   ben
                         yeah, i have that effect on people.

               the construction of the transformation chamber is complete. 
               the technicians are gone now.

                                   reed
                         ben --

                                   ben
                         oh, you remember my name do you?  you
                         happen to remember what you swore to
                         do with every breath in your body?

                                   reed
                         we're working as hard as we can --

                                   ben
                         yeah.  i can tell.  victor was right.

               he motions to reed and sue together.

                                   reed
                         come on, this is nothing.

               sue looks a little hurt.

                                   ben
                         glad "nothing" could take you away
                         from your work.

                                   reed
                         ben, i don't know if this thing'll
                         change us back or make us worse. 
                         i need you to be patient for a little
                         while longe--

               he pokes his finger into reed's chest, which indents around
               it like the pillsbury doughboy.  ben pushes reed back.  hard.

                                   ben
                         look at me, reed.  look at me!

               he grabs reed's face, his fingers indenting the skin.  he
               throws reed back.  reed slams down to the ground.

                                   reed
                         i am looking.  that's why i can't make
                         a mistake!  i've got to get it right,
                         and it's not right yet!  we need to
                         test this.

               ben shakes his head, looking down at reed.

                                   ben
                         i spent my whole life protecting you,
                         from the schoolyard to the stars.  for
                         what?  so you could play twister with
                         your girlfriend while i'm the freak of
                         the week?

               reed tries to stand, but ben knocks him back.  reed slams
               into the wall, and stays down this time.

                                   sue
                         ben!  stop it!  or i'll stop it.

               she starts to raise her hands to throw force-fields.

                                   ben
                         stay out of this susie.

               as ben turns to her, reed takes this opportunity to wrap ben
               up like a python.  they struggle.  ben runs back into a wall
               to shake reed.  their faces are close, heated.

                                   ben (cont'd)
                         good thing you're flexible enough to
                         watch your own back.  'cause you're on
                         your own now.

               ben seems to relax and reed lets go.  ben walks out.  sue
               comes to reed's side.  he's bleeding.

                                   reed
                         i'm ok.  just go, go after him.  stop
                         him.

               she heads out.  reed slowly stands.  he looks at the
               transformation machine.  it's not ready.  but...reed steps
               toward it.  as he walks, his image goes grainy in --
