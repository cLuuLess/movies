               int. von doom compound - ben's room - early evening

               they open the door.  the room is trashed.  every stick of
               furniture smashed to splinters.

                                   reed
                         ...ben?

               their eyes adjust; there's a huge hole where the window used
               to be.  they rush to it.  looking out they see something
               large in the distance, running away.

                                   johnny
                         what is that thing?

                                   sue
                         i think that thing is ben.

               reed looks out, emotions roiling.  is that his best
               friend...?  suddenly, victor comes around the corner (bandage
               bigger).

                                   victor
                         what's going on?

                                   sue
                         victor, are you feeling alright?

               he considers, but never shows weakness.  he nods.

                                   victor
                         just a little banged up.  a couple
                         scrapes.  why?

                                   reed
                         ben did this.

                                   victor
                         ben did this?

                                   reed
                         he's had some kind of...reaction to
                         exposure from the cloud.  and he's not
                         the only one.

                                   sue
                         we need to find him.

               victor redirects his attention to sue.

                                   sue (cont'd)
                         victor, i'm sorry i --

                                   victor
                             (cold)
                         just find him.

               victor strides off, leaving the others.

                                   johnny
                         anybody know where the big guy's
                         going?

               we push in on a picture of debbie lying on the floor, reed
               knows exactly where ben is going.

                                   reed
                         he's going home.
