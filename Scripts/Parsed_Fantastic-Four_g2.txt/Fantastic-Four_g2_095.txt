               reed and sue enter.  reed is looking for something.  sue
               slows down, staring at this sprawling space, jam-packed with
               gear, gadgets, blueprints, inventions.  awe-inspiring,
               overflowing.

                                   sue
                         you really need to get a janitor.

               she stares at shelves upon shelves of overcrowded clutter.

                                   sue (cont'd)
                         this must be what it looks like inside
                         your head.

               reed finds his electron microscope.  he turns to sue,
               defensive:

                                   reed
                         there's a system to it.

               she starts to pull out a model of the fantasticar.

                                   reed (cont'd)
                         wait!  sue, don't touch tha--

               the little car sets the whole shelf off balance.  a wave of
               inventions come clattering down!  reed moves fast:

               he lunges toward sue, streetching his arms around the shelf,
               pushing sue away, just as the inventions smash to the ground! 

               reed and sue hit the floor.  a close call.  now more
               closeness: sue and reed lay face-to-face, with reed's wrapped
               around her.  a heated beat.  their first real intimate
               moment.

                                   sue
                         sorry.  my fault.  i won't...touch
                         anything.

               as if suddenly made aware of their vulnerability, sue and
               reed stand, backing off.  as they part, we see:

               ben watching from the doorway.  melancholy.  he disappears. 
               we slowly move to...a surveillance camera in a vent grate.
