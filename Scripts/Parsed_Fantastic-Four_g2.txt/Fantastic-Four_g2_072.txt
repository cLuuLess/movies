               ext. emergency holding area - press field - day

               clickclickclick!  fifty cameras flash.  the field is full of
               press.  our heroes freeze, shocked by the crowd.

               johnny eats up the attention.  ben turns, self-conscious. 
               reed notices.  the chief fireman turns to them.

                                   chief fireman
                         so which one of you's the leader?

               johnny does not hesitate.

                                   johnny
                         that'd be me.

                                   chief fireman
                         no seriously.

               a beat.  sue and ben turn to reed.  the chief hands him a
               mic.

                                   chief fireman (cont'd)
                         you're on, son.  they all want a
                         statement.

               all eyes go on reed.  he looks out, gulps hard.  a long beat.

                                   reed
                         uh, during our recent mission to the
                         von doom space station, we were
                         exposed to as yet-unidentified
                         radioactive energy, most likely some
                         kind of nucleotide compoun--

               nobody came for a science class.  a crush of questions
               overwhelms reed:

                                   various reporters
                         what happened on the bridge?  does it
                         hurt to stretch?  were you really on
                         fire?  is it true that one of you can
                         fly?

                                   johnny
                         working on it.  and it's a lot harder --

                                   sue
                         we don't know much more than you do,
                         at this point.  which is why we will
                         be going directly to the lab, where we
                         can diagnose our symptoms and --

                                   reporter #2
                         symptoms?  so it's like a disease?

               reed looks at ben's face, feeling the guilt.  ben is lost in
               thought, looking at deb's engagement ring.  johnny leaps in.

                                   johnny
                         symptoms?  please.  if having powers
                         is a disease, then yeah we got it. 
                         and we are gonna blow your minds. 
                         there's a new day dawning.  the day of
                         the fantastic four.

                                   reporter #3
                         that thing doesn't look too fantastic.

               the reporter nods toward ben.  ben's fists tighten, the sound
               of rocks crushing together.  reed feels the pain.

                                   reed
                         ben grimm is a genuine american hero
                         who's been through a terrible orde--

                                   johnny
                         what he's trying to say is: every team
                         needs a mascot...

               reporters laugh.  ben turns his head away.  reed burns.

                                   reed
                         look, we went up to space to find a
                         way to understand dna, to cure
                         disease, save lives.  well, now it's
                         our dna, our disease, our lives on the
                         line...
                             (a beat)
                         thank you.  no more questions.

               reed, sue, and ben get up to go.  the press waits a beat,
               then surges.  ben spins, holding up one finger.  a giant.

                                   ben
                         be nice.

               the press step back, intimidated.  flashbulbs pop, and ben's
               face freezes.  it goes black-and-white on a new york post in --
