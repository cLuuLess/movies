               ext./int. limo - night

               johnny climbs in, sees...three impossibly gorgeous models.

                                   victor
                         a few fans.  hope you don't mind.

                                   johnny
                         gotta take care of the fans, right? 

               he smiles, sitting down in the middle of them.

                                   victor
                         look, i built my business knowing what
                         people want.  and right now, the
                         people want you.

               johnny eyes the models, all lusting.

                                   johnny
                         and we don't want to let the people
                         down now, do we?

                                   victor

                         no we don't.  which is why we need
                         to strike while the iron's hot. 
                         i'm talking action figures,
                         videogames, sponsors --

                                   johnny
                         videogames?  you serious?

               victor nods, knowing he has johnny on the hook.

                                   johnny (cont'd)
                         you talk to reed and sue about this?

                                   victor
                         johnny.  let's be honest here.  ben,
                         reed, sue.  good people, all.  but
                         stars?
                             (shaking his head, a beat)
                         i don't want to break up the band, but
                         you're the one they want.  don't you
                         think it's time to go solo...?

               victor subtly nods to the models.  they envelop johnny.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         take the car for a spin.  think about
                         it.  is this the life you want?  or
                         would you rather live in reed's
                         lab...?

               the car stops.  victor gets out.  he stands on the pavement. 
               as he shuts the door, we see the women climbing onto johnny. 
               the door shuts, and...

               whhhmmmpf!  the windows all suddenly steam up!
