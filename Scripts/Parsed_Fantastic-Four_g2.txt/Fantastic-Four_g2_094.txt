                         if we can build a machine to re-create
                         the storm, we can reverse the polarity --

                             (realizing)
                         and reverse the mutations --

                             (talking more to himself)

                                   reed

                         and you sure you can control this
                         thing?  last time didn't work out so

                              spinning)
                         with the right energy, we can
                         stabilize the storm.  maybe tie into
