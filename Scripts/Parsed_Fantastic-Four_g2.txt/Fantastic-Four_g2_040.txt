               ext. von doom compound hospital patio - day

               ben finds reed on a patio with a panoramic view.  reed works
               at a laptop computer.

                                   ben
                         how long was i out?

                                   reed
                         three days.  i was worried about you. 
                         how are you feeling?

                                   ben
                         solid.

               ben can see reed doesn't look too solid.

                                   ben (cont'd)
                         how you doing?

               reed shakes his head, looking back at his screen.

                                   reed
                         i don't know.  i just keep going over
                         and over the numbers.

                                   ben
                         reed.  even you can't compute every
                         little thing.

                                   reed
                         i should have done more, run more
                         tests --

               ben gets closer, pushing down reed's computer screen.

                                   ben
                         it was a freak of nature.  last i
                         checked, you don't have a crystal
                         ball.  let it go.

               reed considers.  but he can't let it go.  he opens his
               computer back up, returning to work.  ben shakes his head,
               looks out at the view.  his eyes catch on something, wheels
               turning.

                                   ben (cont'd)
                         you go through something like this,
                         makes you appreciate having the right
                         woman in your life.

                                   reed
                         yeah, you and debbie and perfect --

                                   ben
                         reed, i'm not talking about debbie.

               reed follows ben's eyes to a lower level patio: sue.

                                   reed
                         what?  come on.  she's got a good
                         thing with victor --

                                   ben
                         i'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen
                         your screws?

                                   reed
                         he's smart, powerful, successful --

                                   ben
                         well maybe you should date him.

               reed looks at ben, resigned.

                                   reed
                         ben.  he'll give her the life she
                         deserves.  she ended up with the right
                         guy.  things worked out for the best.

               reed steps away.  ben stands alone, an idea sparking.

                                   ben
                         do i have to do everything myself?
