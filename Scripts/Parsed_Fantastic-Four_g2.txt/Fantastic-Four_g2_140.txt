               ext. under the brooklyn bridge - night

               ben sits alone, looking at city lights.  a man without a
               home.  without a family.  a hard beat.  headlights slash
               across ben.  he slowly turns, blinded in the lights of...a
               limo.

                         ben!  they need you back at the baxter
                         building.  it's...reed.

               ben considers.  despite it all, he's a good friend.  and a
               good man.  as he gets into the car, we hear throbbing music
               in --
