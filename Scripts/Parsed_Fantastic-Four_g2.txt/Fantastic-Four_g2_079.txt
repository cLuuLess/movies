               int. baxter building - elevator - day

               the elevator rises.  reed roils with guilt.

                                   sue
                         how come ben can't turn it on and off
                         like us?

                                   reed
                         that's what we're here to find out.

                                   sue
                         if it happened to him, then it
                         could...

               happen to all of them.  reed nods softly.

                                   johnny
                         wait.  you mean there's chance we
                         could be full-on-24-7-fantastic? 

                                   sue
                         grow up, johnny.  you want to run
                         around on fire for the rest of your
                         life?

                                   johnny
                         is that a trick question?  c'mon, i
                         can't be the only one who thinks
                         this is cool.

               reed considers.  but sue cuts him short with a look.

               ding!  the elevator stops.
