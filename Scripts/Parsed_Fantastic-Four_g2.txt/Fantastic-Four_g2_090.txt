               int. baxter building labs - day

               angles of reed in the lab, grabbing their space uniforms from
               various closets/containers:

                                   reed (v.o.)
                         our uniforms were exposed to the storm
                         like us.  so they can transform like
                         us, becoming invisible, changing size
                         on demand or remaining impervious to
                         flame.

               reveal: reed, sue, and johnny step out to look at themselves
               in a mirror wearing the uniforms.  no boots, no gloves.  not
               yet.  (the uniforms will develop, like our heroes).

                                   ben
                         you look like an eighties rock band.

                                   sue
                             (to ben)
                         the suit will stretch.  you should try
                         it --

                                   ben
                         i wouldn't be caught dead in that.

                                   johnny
                         he's right.  these costumes are...
                         missing something.  i can't put my
                         finger on it --

                                   reed
                         they're not costumes.

                                   sue
                         we're not taking them out.  johnny, we
                         need to stay here till we've stabilized.
                        
               johnny shakes his head, frustrated.

                                   johnny
                         i'm getting sick of being trapped
                         here.  nasa wasn't even this strict!

               he marches out.  sue turns to reed, who says nothing.  sue
               heads out, leaving ben and reed.  a beat.  ben looks at reed.

                                   ben
                             (looking at uniform)
                         maybe it's missing a utility belt. 

               off reed's dark look, we hear:

                                   victor (v.o.)
                         so what's the prognosis?
