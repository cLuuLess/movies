               int. lake launch facility locker room - night

               reed and ben unpack gear into lockers.  suddenly --

                                   johnny (o.s.)
                         captain on the bridge!

               ben goes to attention on reflex: johnny snaps a picture with
               a digital camera.  then advances, as ben realizes who it
               is...

                                   johnny (cont'd)
                         digital camera: $254.  memory stick:
                         $59.  the look on your hard-ass former
                         co's grill when he finds out he's your
                         junior officer: priceless.

               ben eyeballs johnny, suddenly reaches up as if to grab him. 
               johnny flinches.  but ben just reaches for johnny's zipper,
               adjusts his uniform.

                                   ben
                         i can handle the ship.  i can even
                         handle mr. blonde ambition.  but i
                         don't know if i should be flying or
                         playing vegas in these suits.  who the
                         hell came up with them?

                                   sue
                         victor did.

               sue enters, wearing her blue, wetsuit-like uniform, carrying
               a stack of flightsuits.  she hands them out to the guys.

                                   sue (cont'd)
                         the synthetics act as a second skin,
                         adapting to your individual needs to --

                                   johnny
                         keep the hot side hot, and the cool
                         side cool!

                                   reed
                         wow.  fantastic.

               reed stares at sue in the skintight outfit.  she wonders,
               maybe hopes -- is he actually checking her out?

                                   reed (cont'd)
                         material made from self-regulating
                         unstable molecules.  i've been working
                         on a formula for this.

                                   sue
                         great minds think alike.

                                   victor (o.s.)
                         guess some think faster than others.

               victor enters, wearing his custom-tailored flightsuit.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         i hired armani to design the pattern. 
                         these colors will look great on
                         camera.

               a door opens.  leonard enters, in a sharp suit.

                                   leonard
                         they're ready for you, sir.

                                   victor
                         showtime.
