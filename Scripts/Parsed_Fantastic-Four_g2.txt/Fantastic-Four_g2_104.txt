               ext. nyc arena - espn moto x games - day

               the x games in full effect: a maze of mountainous dirt hills
               and ramps...where moto-bikes launch into the air to the
               delight of 20,000 fans.  the riders spin and flip, performing
               aerial acrobatics on their 250cc motor bikes.

                         and now, ladies and gentlemen, we have
                         a special guest for you... johnny
                         storm of the fantastic four!

               johnny emerges, wearing his blue uniform, waving to the
               crowd.  he steps up to the pit where riders prep.  he
               beelines to ronnie renner.

                                   johnny
                         hey, ronnie renner!  i'm a big fan.

               ronnie gives a tight nod.  he doesn't like being upstaged by
               this circus freak.

               the other bikers approach.

                         her for a spin?

               he motions to his bike.  johnny eyes this mean machine.

                                   ronnie renner
                         come on, bro.  i'll teach you some
                         tricks...if you can keep up.
