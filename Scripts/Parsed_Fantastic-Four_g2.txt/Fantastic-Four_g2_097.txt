               int. baxter building - media room - night

               ben grimm stands front and center.  not the thing.  but ben
               grimm.  a normal man.  he smiles wide, shaking his head.

                                   woman's voice (v.o.)
                         you surprised?

               now we pull back to reveal debbie and ben on a screen.  the
               thing watches the old videotape.  he smiles sadly at his old
               life.  he mouths the words -- he knows this tape by heart.

                                   ben (on screen)
                         yeah i'm surprised.  surprised the
                         fire department didn't shut this down.

               on screen: the handheld camera whips around, revealing...a
               surprise party.  full of people.  ben grimm is a popular guy. 
               on screen: reed hugs ben.  they pose for pictures together.

                                   the thing
                         god.  i was good looking.

               we hear the party sing "happy birthday."  debbie kisses ben. 
               thing's eyes start to mist.  on screen: ben blows out
               candles.

                                   debbie (on screen)
                         what did you wish for, honey?

                                   ben (on screen)
                         i already got it.  everything i want.

               as they kiss, a tear runs down thing's cheek.  the tape ends,
               and he sits in darkness for a beat.  a long, lonely beat.
