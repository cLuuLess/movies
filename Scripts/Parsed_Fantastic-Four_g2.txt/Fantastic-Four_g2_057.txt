               ext. pay phone - night

               a huge figure is huddled in shadow.  it's ben.

               close on: the dial pad.  big fingers try to push keys but
               they're too large.  ben tries for a few seconds, getting more
               and more frustrated.  he manages to press "0" with his pinky.

                                   ben
                         hello, operator?

               ben looks up the street, into the 2nd story window of a
               modest, working-class home.  his eyes go soft when he sees
               debbie grab the phone.

                                   ben (cont'd)
                         deb... it's me.  i need you to step
                         out front.

                                   debbie
                         out front?  you home, baby?  i got
                         a surprise for you.

               he blinks hard.  sad, dark.

                                   ben
                         i got a surprise for you too.
