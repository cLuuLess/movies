               sue rounds a corner, sees reed and johnny.

                                   sue
                         johnny!  reed!

                                   automated voice
                         five...foooouuur...

               slow motion: everyone frozen in position as:

               -- johnny is hit with sparks of flame from a control panel.
               -- reed reaches out for ben and the airlock door.
               -- vapor stream pours down on sue from a blown gasket.
               -- the space dust burns into ben's skin.

               slow motion: just before the exterior air-lock door closes, a
               single particle zips through the narrowing gap and hits ben
               in the back, ripping through his suit.  the exterior door
               shuts and seals.  the station loses all power.  darkness.
