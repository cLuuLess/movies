               victor and leonard stride out.  victor is writhing.

                                   victor
                         goddamn book-keeper doesn't know
                         preferred stock from livestock.

               leonard is thinking all business.

                                   leonard
                         sir.  reed's comments at that press
                         conference killed us.  how are we
                         going to turn this around?

               victor considers.  his mind races, eyes narrow.

                                   victor
                         very simple.  i cure them.  if i can
                         cure these freaks, then i can cure
                         anyone.  what better way to restore my
                         reputation?

               leonard nods, impressed.  victor is a man in motion.  as they
               step into sunlight, we cut to...clickclickclick in --
