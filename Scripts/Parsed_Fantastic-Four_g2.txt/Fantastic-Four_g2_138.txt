               sue struggles to lift reed -- half of his body is stretched
               out, devoid of any semblance of bone structure.  one side of
               his face looks like it's melting off.

                                   reed
                         i can...make it work.

                                   sue
                         reed, stop, you need to rest your --

                                   reed
                         the power...i need...more power...to
                         control...the storm --

                                   sue
                         you need a doctor.

               reed loses consciousness.  sue carries him out.
