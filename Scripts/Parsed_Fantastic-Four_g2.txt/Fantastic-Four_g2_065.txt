               ext. brooklyn bridge - gridlock - day

               reed, sue, and johnny race toward the flames.  all other
               people head in the opposite direction.  bridge police herd
               the crowd away from the accident.

                                   bridge cop
                         back!  we're evac-ing the bridge. 

               reed, sue, and johnny slow down, swap glances.

                                   sue
                         what now?  reed...?  what do we do?

               move in on reed.  a first test of leadership.  but he is not
               a leader.  not yet.  sue gets closer to him.

                                   sue (cont'd)
                         ben's out there.  let's go get him.

                                   bridge cop
                         maybe you didn't hear me.  those cars
                         are gonna blow sky high, any second.

                                   reed
                         look, we've got a friend out there in
                         trouble.  we need to get to him before --

                                   bridge cop #2
                         nobody gets past this point.

               a hard beat.  reed signals sue with a look, a nod.

                                   sue
                         what?

                                   reed
                             (mutters)
                         we need to get past them.

               he motions to her body.  she understands.  she concentrates,
               and starts to turn invisible.

                                   bridge cop #1
                         what the hell is this?  a magic show?

               but her clothes don't go invisible.  beat.  reed mutters:

                                   reed
                         sue.  your clothes.  lose them.

                                   sue
                         what...?
                             (realizes)
                         oh.

               she unbuttons her blouse.  not thrilled with the idea.  she
               wriggles out of her pants.  down to her skivvies.  she
               reaches back to undo her bra...momentarily loses
               concentration and becomes visible.  the sight of sue in her
               undies grabs the cops' attention.  everyone watches, stunned. 

               the realization that she's visible hits her like a ton of
               bricks.  cops are transfixed.  so is reed.

                                   johnny
                         this is wrong in so many ways.

                                   reed
                         you've been working out.

                                   sue
                         shut up.

               sue takes a deep breath.  closes her eyes.  focuses.  nothing
               happens.  she's embarrassed and furious.

                                   sue (cont'd)
                         any more ideas, reed?  maybe you
                         should strip down next, see how it
                         feels to have fifty people staring --

               ...and she disappears.  entirely.  undies float.  jaws drop.

                                   reed
                         uh, sue?

               she stops ranting.  realizes she's gone invisible.

                                   sue (invisible)
                         oh.  well then...

               the undies drop.  the cops stare open-mouthed.  they turn to
               look at reed, astonished.  he sheepishly shrugs his
               shoulders.

                                   johnny
                         i'm gonna need serious therapy.

               a beat.  she walks away.  the cops watch her, gaping.  by the
               time they turn back around, reed and johnny are gone,
               disappearing into the clouds of smoke.
