               int. space station - command center - same

               victor and sue lead the others into the command center.

                                   johnny
                             (a "dad voice": to ben)
                         if you behave, maybe next time
                         daddy'll let you drive.

                                   ben
                         keep talking, there won't be a next
                         time.

               reed is focused on the earth.

                                   sue
                         long way from the projection booth at
                         the hayden planetarium, isn't it?

               reed turns towards her -- a little stunned that she would
               bring that up.  it's the first time she's been nice to him so
               far.  he smiles, gently, hesitantly, always hesitant with
               sue.

                                   reed
                         yes.  yes it is.

               johnny and ben exchange a look.  reed keeps looking at the
               stars, eyes wide, like a little kid.
