               ext. brooklyn bridge - approach - day

               at the back of the traffic jam, cars screech to stops.  the
               whole bridge is full of bumper-to-bumper traffic.  we push
               toward one car: three doors pop open, and out come...

               reed, johnny, sue.  they look through smoke and mayhem to
               see...their first full look at ben.  reed stands gutpunched.

                                   johnny
                         not even ben deserves that.
