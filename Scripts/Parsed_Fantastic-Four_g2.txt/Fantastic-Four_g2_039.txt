               int. von doom compound hospital room - day

               a sexy nurse wheels a testing station into johnny's room. 
               he's stripped down to calvins, changing into a ski outfit.

                                   sexy nurse
                         and where do we think we're going?

                                   johnny
                         i don't know if "we've" noticed, but
                         the sickest runs this side of the alps
                         are right outside that window --

                                   nurse
                         i've noticed... but doctor's orders,
                         you're not allowed to leave until we --

                                   johnny
                         finish the tests, i know -- could you
                         give me a hand with this zipper?

                                   nurse
                         you know this is not a ski resort.

                                   johnny
                         not yet.

               johnny opens the cardboard box, revealing a colorful
               fiberglass object the size of a briefcase.  in the blink of
               an eye, he unfolds it into a long snowboard.

                                   johnny (cont'd)
                         luckily grandma still sends care
                         packages.

               the nurse pops a thermometer in his mouth to shut him up.

                                   nurse
                         you are trouble.

                                   johnny
                             (thermometer in his mouth)
                         brubbles my triddle name.

               they both pay more attention to his zipper than the digital
               read-out: it runs right up past 98.6, then accelerates fast.

                                   sexy nurse
                         you're hot!

                                   johnny
                         so are you!

                                   sexy nurse
                         i mean, you feel a little feverish.

                                   johnny
                         i've never felt better in my life. 
                         when do you get off work?

                                   sexy nurse
                         my shift ends at four, but i couldn't --

                                   johnny
                         meet me at 4:01, top of the run. 
                         that'll give you a minute to freshen
                         up.

               he hands her the thermometer, a quick kiss and he's out the
               door.  the machine beeps: johnny's temperature is 209
               degrees.
