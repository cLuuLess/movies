                         you sure about this, reed?

               he nods, head down.  he doesn't want eye contact.

                                   reed
                         those solar winds are flaring, but i
                         factored them into my coordinates and --

                                   sue
                         i was talking about us.  working
                         together.

               sue holds her eyes on reed.  he is clearly uncomfortable in
               her gaze.  did the elevator just get smaller?

                                   reed
                             (thinking, talking fast)
                         well, uh, based on our history...you
                         can handle the biogenetics, and i'll
                         focus on the molecular physics.  or,
                         uhm, maybe i should take the biotech,
                         you work the microscopes, since you
                         have some background in electropho--

                                   sue
                             (droll, a little annoyed)
                         right.  that's exactly what i meant.

               she shakes her head -- same old reed.  he looks at her --
               what did he say wrong?  ben smiles, patting reed on the
               shoulder.

                                   ben
                         way to not overthink it.
                             (to sue)
                         so when do we leave?

                                   sue
                         i'll schedule the launch.  call me in
                         the morning to talk about resources
                         and crew.

               she offers a business card.  reed doesn't take it.

                                   reed
                         i, uh, think i remember the number.


                                   sue
                         it's been changed.

               beat.  ben grimaces.  reed takes the card, his eyes down.

                                   reed
                         as far as crew, i was hoping ben could
                         pilot the mission --

                                   sue
                         well, he's welcome to ride shotgun,
                         but we already have a pilot on our
                         payroll.  you remember my brother
                         johnny...

               off ben's curdling smile, we dissolve to --
