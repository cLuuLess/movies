               int. baxter building - kitchen - night

               johnny opens a cupboard, pulls out some jiffy pop.  it starts
               to pop in his hand, the bag swelling.  he casually turns on a
               tv, flipping to...the x- games.  the jiffy pop swells, ready
               to blow.  he rips it open, eats popcorn, and watches the
               games:

               cool stunts, hot girls.  johnny's brow furrows, a thought
               forming, a mischievous smile on his lips.
