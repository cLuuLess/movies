               int. von doom conference room - night

               eerily silent.  reed tries to move, but he is frozen.  he
               hears a footstep.  but the room is empty.  no sign of doom
               even.  a beat.  he hears a creak.  another creak, closer. 
               and...

               a freezing tube starts to shift.  it goes taut, clearly being
               manipulated by a hand -- an invisible hand.  sue appears next
               to reed, tube in hand.  she tries to stay calm.

                                   sue
                         what has he done to you?

               reed's eyes shift to see...doom emerge from the darkness.

                                   doom (o.s.)
                         how romantic.

                                   sue
                         victor, please --

                                   doom
                         it's doctor doom to you.

               he steps closer.  electrodes course over his metal skin.

                                   sue
                         we know the machine works.  it worked
                         on ben, it'll work on you.  we can
                         turn you back --

                                   doom
                         do you really think fate turned us
                         into gods so we could refuse these
                         gifts?

               she hardens, a little force field starts to emanate from her.

                                   sue
                         victor.  you always thought you were
                         god.

               doom has a hand behind his back, generating an energy blast.

                                   doom
                         sue please, let's not fight.

                                   sue
                         no, victor... let's.

               she hurls a force-field at him.  it connects, knocking him
               back a half-step.  but he simply shakes it off, and steps up. 
               too powerful.  he smiles.  his arms crackle with electricity.

                                   doom
                         susan...... you're fired.

               boom!  he fires an electric shockwave that launches her back. 
               she spirals through the air, crashing into the wall, thudding
               to the floor.  as doom stalks closer, sue gathers her
               strength to...go invisible.

                                   doom (cont'd)
                         marco...

               a hanging beat.  we see: a faint outline of sue behind him.

                                   doom (cont'd)
                         polo.

               he spins, grabs her!  doom grips her neck, slamming her to
               the ground beside reed.  she lays there, beaten, visible.

               in the distance behind doom, city lights blink, fading in and
               out.  lights flutter softly here (like when ben went through
               the machine).  reed looks up.  could it be...?
