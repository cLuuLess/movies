               ext. new york city street - night

               boom!  doom smashes into the out of service bus!  crash! 
               windows shatter.  the bus slams into an electricity pole,
               snapping the pole.  doom steps out, unharmed.

               ben charges toward him.  doom grabs the broken electricity
               pole, flips it into his hand, and wields the pole like a
               giant stun-gun!  electric sparks fly through the air into -- 

               ben!  the blast of volts launches him off his feet!  he goes
               flying backward, electrocuted in mid-flight, and --

               whoompf!  ben lands hard, face down, cratering the street! 
               water rushes into the crater.  ben lays there, incapacitated.
