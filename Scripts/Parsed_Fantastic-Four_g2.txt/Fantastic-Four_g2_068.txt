               ext. brooklyn bridge - day

               ben sees a familiar face in the masses: debbie.  ben steps
               toward her, but she stops him with a look.  she places
               something on the ground and runs off into the crowd.

               ben sees something glistening on the ground.  he stoops over
               to pick up...her engagement ring.  his big fingers can't grip
               it.  he tries in vain.  hopeless, pathetic.  a beat.  and... 

               a hand grabs the ring.  it's reed.  quiet, close.

                                   reed
                         i swear to you, i will do everything
                         in my power until there is not a
                         breath left in me: you are going to be
                         ben again.

               off the wounded look in ben's eyes, wanting to believe him...
