               int. baxter building transformation lab - day

               the shields slowly rise.  five technicians go to work.  they
               wear the vdi jackets.  reed watches, worried.

               sue enters.  she sees the shields, the technicians, the vdi
               logo.  and she is deeply worried.  she steps over to reed. 
               sparks fly behind them.  drills scream.

                                   sue
                         can i talk to you?
