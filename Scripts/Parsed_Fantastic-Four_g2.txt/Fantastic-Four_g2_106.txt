               sue stands alone, sifting through piles of mail.  she focuses
               on one piece of mail that she's holding.  her hand begins to
               disappear and then the envelope slowly begins to disappear as
               well.  sue smiles at the success.  intrigued.  quiet:

                                   sue
                         that's new...

               reed enters -- overworked, unshaved.  he keeps his head down,
               preoccupied.  sue shifts focus.

                                   sue (cont'd)
                         have you read these...?  from all
                         over.  people want us to fight crimes... 
                         save their kids...solve their problems...
                             (no response from reed)
                         ...when we can't even solve our
                         own.

               she puts the letters down, steps closer to reed.

                                   sue (cont'd)
                         reed.  how close are we to a cure?

                                   reed
                         no way to know.  without more
                         tests, experiments.

               she considers.  victor's words echo in her head.

                                   sue
                         we're not specimens, we're patients. 
                         this isn't just another science
                         project to you, is it...?

               reed looks up, a little surprised.  he opens his mouth, but --

                                   ben (o.s.)
                         no...no...no freakin' way!!
