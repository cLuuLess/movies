               int. space station - air lock - later

               ben preps for a space walk, putting on a helmet and boots. 
               johnny unloads a set of clear sample boxes off of a cart,
               each containing a variety of plants.

                                   johnny
                         please tell me your dawg's not trying
                         to rekindle things with my sister.

                                   ben
                         'course not.  strictly business.

                                   johnny
                         yeah, well, his eyes say different.

                                   ben
                         hey, two hearts got busted last time. 
                         maybe she's not over it either.

                                   johnny
                         let's see: you got victor, stud of the
                         year, more coin than god?  or reed,
                         the world's dumbest smart guy worth
                         less than a postage stamp.  hmmm, it's
                         a toss-up.

                                   ben
                         put your tiny little mind at ease.

                                   johnny
                         don't you wander off, boy.

               johnny steps out of the air-lock and shuts the door.  he
               looks through a small window to see ben give the thumbs up. 
               the airlock door opens, and ben gracefully steps into space.
