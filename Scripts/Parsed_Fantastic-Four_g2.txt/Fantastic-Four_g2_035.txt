               int. space station air lock - day

               reed and johnny scramble to open the interior air lock door. 
               sue joins them, as they pull ben in.  they try to remove his
               helmet.  we don't see his face, but he's clearly unconscious.

                                   reed
                         he's not responsive --

                                   johnny
                         ben!  ben!
