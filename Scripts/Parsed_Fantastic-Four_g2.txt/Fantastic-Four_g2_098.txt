               int. baxter building - halls - night

               ben stalks the halls, slipping into his ragged trenchcoat. 
               as he passes a crossroads, he sees a strange sight:

               reed's hand is tied to a latch in the wall.  his arm is
               streeetched thin, spanning around the corner.  ben just
               shakes his head, keeps moving.  and we follow reed's arm... 

               up the hall...round a corner...down another hall.  the
               muscles and tissue stretch, going taut.  finally, we reach... 

               reed.  he steps slowly.  he holds a digital tape-measure in
               his other hand, measuring distance.  his skin streeetches. 
               his face tightens, pained.  we hear the faint squeak of his
               skin.

                                   voice (o.s.)
                         damn, stretch!

               reed turns his head around, seeing johnny come down the hall.

                                   johnny
                         how far's that rubber bend?

               reed keeps moving, slowly.  his muscles and tendons laboring.

                                   reed
                         that's what i'm trying to calculate. 
                         and it's not rubber.  it's muscle,
                         tendon.  i seem to have the ability to
                         manipulate the malleability of my
                         molecular structure and redistribute
                         my density to --

                                   johnny
                         right, whatever, have fun.

               and johnny is gone, ducking under reed's arm into --
