               int. victor's office - night

               victor watches a bank of videoscreens.  he has the baxter
               building under surveillance.  he sees reed and sue on
               monitors.  he toys with sue's diamond ring in his gloved
               hand.

               a door opens.  leonard enters.  he sees the screens.

                                   leonard
                         is reed any closer to a cure?

               victor looks at that image of reed and sue on the screen.

                                   victor
                         the only thing he's closer to is
                         sue...

               but victor sees something between reed and sue on the wall. 
               he leans closer, and the camera zooms in, as if responding to
               his will.  he zooms all the way to a close up of:

               reed's blueprints for the transformation chamber.  victor's
               eyes narrow, mind ticking, a plan forming.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         make me a reservation for two at
                         cipriani tonight.

               victor opens a drawer, pulls out an old videotape.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         and get this over to ben grimm.

               victor leans forward, fixated on that machine.  as he gets
               closer, his screens go staticky.  he absentmindedly picks at
               his scar.  in shadows, we see skin peeling off.

                                   woman's voice (v.o.)
                         close your eyes, baby.  keep 'em
                         closed.
