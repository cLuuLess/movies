               int. von doom compound dining hall - evening

               the sun is long gone, and so are most of the diners.  the
               room is darker, more romantic.  ben finishes the last shrimp
               on his plate, pushes it away, belches prodigiously.

                                   ben
                         pardon me...

               sue and reed stare at him.  ben's stomach growls again.

                                   reed
                         are you alright?

                                   ben
                         i think i need to lie down.  bad
                         shrimp.

               this was ben's plan, but he really isn't feeling well,
               unsteady when he walks away.  he looks down at his stomach.

                                   ben (cont'd)
                         really bad shrimp.

               angle: fireplace.  sue looks gorgeous in the light.  a beat. 
               a long beat.  reed doesn't know where to start with this
               woman.

                                   reed
                         feeling better?

                                   sue
                         yes, thanks.

                                   reed
                         that's good.  that's uh...good.

                                   sue
                         you always had a way with words.
                             (an awkward beat)
                         i should be getting back.

               sue gets up to leave.  exasperated, reed tries to think of
               something, anything, to say.

                                   reed
                         i'm really happy for you and victor.

               she slows down, looking at him.  she was hoping for more.

                                   sue
                         you're happy for me and victor.

                                   reed
                         i can tell you guys are enjoying what
                         was the best part of our relationship --

                                   sue
                         which was?

                                   reed
                         passion.

               we see surprise on sue's face, and...

                                   reed (cont'd)
                         for science.

                                   sue
                             (frustrated)
                         you are such a dork, reed... you never
                         got it and never will unless it's
                         explained to you in quantum physics.

               as if triggered by her emotion, the fireplace light around
               her bends.  the flames flicker in a ghostly breeze.

                                   reed
                         what?  what did i say?

               she looks more disappointed than angry.

                                   sue
                         it's never what you say.  it's what
                         you don't say. what you don't do...

               she lets that hang.  a lot of history here.  quiet, hurt --
               she wants reed to fight for her, to show some emotion.

                                   reed
                         i...i...i just wanted to --

               as sue's emotions swirl, she slowly...disappears.

                                   sue
                         it's been two years, and all you can
                         say is you're happy for me and some
                         other guy...
                             (standing up, hurt)
                         you know, victor may be a lot of
                         things, but at least he's not afraid
                         to fight for what he wants...
                             (reed looks down)
                         and it's nice to be wanted sometimes. 
                         to be heard...seen... reed, look at
                         me.

               he looks up...but all that's left of her is the blush on her
               cheek and her bewitching eyes.  he drops his fork, shocked.

                                   reed
                         uh, sue...?  i can't.

                                   sue
                         what?  what do you mean you --

                                   reed
                         sue...look at your hands.

               she raises her hands, but we don't see them.  we only see a
               medical waistband...floating.  her watch...floating.  her
               clothes appear to be suspended in mid-air.

               sue is invisible.  she shrieks and gets up -- knocking a
               glass off the table...

               slow motion: the glass flies off the table, tumbling... reed
               instinctively reaches for the bottle: his arm stretches two
               feet out of his sleeve -- grabs it just before it hits -- 

               then snaps back into place.  reed stares at his arm in
               disbelief.  sue's eyes widen as well.  the rest of sue
               reappears.  they look at each other: mutual alarm.

                                   johnny (o.s.)
                         you guys will not believe what just
                         happened!

               they look up to see johnny in the doorway, naked except for
               the nurse's pink parka wrapped around his midsection.
