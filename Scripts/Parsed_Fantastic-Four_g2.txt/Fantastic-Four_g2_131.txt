               int. baxter building - ground floor - night

               ding.  sue speeds out of the elevator.  no sign of ben.  she
               runs into...johnny who shakes off the encounter.

                                   sue
                         johnny?  did you see ben?

                                   johnny
                         yeah, for the last time, i hope.  i'm
                         done with this freak show.  i'm moving
                         back to the real world.

                                   sue
                         is that what you call it?  "real"?

                                   johnny
                         at least it beats living in a lab like
                         somebody's science project.

               this hits home.  sue is quiet.  johnny turns to go.

                                   sue
                         johnny, slow down.  think.  you know
                         mom didn't raise us to --

                                   johnny
                         look around, sis!  she's not here.  so
                         you can stop talking to me like i'm
                         your little boy --

                                   sue
                         as soon as you stop acting like one. 
                         come on, you're smarter than this. 
                         you think those people out there care
                         about you?  you're just a fad to them.

               he pulls away from her, taking a step out the door.

                                   johnny
                         let's try something new: you live
                         your life.  and i'll live mine.
                             (beat)
                         and just for the record: they love
                         me.

               he strides into the night, leaving sue alone.  a dark night. 
               the fantastic four is no more.  the family is split apart.
