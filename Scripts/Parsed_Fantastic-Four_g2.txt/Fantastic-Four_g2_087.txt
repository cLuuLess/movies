               reed and ben sit in chairs, facing each other.  a beat
               passes.  ben taps his fingers on the chair, making small
               dents.  reed looks down at his clipboard.  a little awkward.

                                   reed
                         okay.  i've uh, got some questions,
                         from sue.  that she thought might be
                         better coming from me... can you, you
                         know, go to the bathroom...like
