               int. baxter building - reed's office - night

               a series of time-lapse shots: reed works around the baxter
               building, spending hours searching for the cure.  he checks
               charts, writes equations, paces, frustrated.

               finally, he sits at his long desk, looking at a wall where
               ben's charts are projected (both ben and thing's anatomies). 
               reed wears the uniform under his labcoat.  he checks his
               equations over and over, making notes upon notes.

                                   reed
                         nothing...nothing...nothing...

               he hits the end of the slides.  the wall fills with white
               light.  frustrated, reed slams his head into his desk, crash! 
               something falls off the end of the desk.

               reed raises his head, revealing his flattened face.  he steps
               over to see...a plant sample from space, glass box shattered. 
               red sparks swirl around the plant, like the cosmic storm --

                                   reed (cont'd)
                         of course...of course...the cloud...

               the cosmic storm swirls, terrifying.  we slowly pull back to --
