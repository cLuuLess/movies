               ext. von doom compound - victor's office - day

               on an expansive parapet with a billion-dollar view, victor
               prepares a romantic dinner-setting as his staff scurry about. 
               he checks every fork and knife, with a slightly manic energy.

                                   victor
                         how's the ipo?

                                   leonard
                         stable.  we're looking at low
                         twenties.  it's a good number,
                         considering the fallout from --

                                   victor
                         reed's disaster.  you know, i half-
                         think he did this to me on purpose.

                                   leonard
                         sir, i'm sure he wouldn't put himself --

               but victor is on to the next thought, always strategizing.

                                   victor
                         get me on the am shows, larry king,
                         cover of the journal...
                             (staring into silver tray)
                         i've got to do something about this
                         scar.  make sure they only shoot my
                         right side.

                                   leonard
                         actually, uh, people seem to think the
                         scar "humanizes" you.

                                   victor
                         and that's a good thing?

               victor looks at the scar, enraged by this defect.  it
               glistens in the silver tray.  his eyes are bloodshot,
               sleepless.

                                   leonard
                         you know, maybe you should get some
                         rest --

                                   victor
                         later.  first, i've got some
                         unfinished business.  a deal that
                         needs closing...

               leonard looks at the table, the lavish spread.  a beat.

                                   leonard
                         sir, i've always wondered... why sue? 
                         you could have any woman in the world
                         but --

                                   victor
                         that's why.  because i could have
                         any other woman... you know, when
                         they asked caesar "why england," he
                         said, "because it's not mine."
