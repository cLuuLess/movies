               int. baxter building - hall - day

               victor moves fast, holds tight to his anger.  reed catches
               up.

                                   reed
                         victor wait... i just wanted to say,
                         i'm sorry the mission didn't go as
                         planned --

               victor suddenly wheels on reed.  lights flicker.

                                   victor
                         didn't go as planned?  it was a
                         catastrophe.  you ruined the lives of
                         four people --

                                   reed
                         i ruined?  with all due respect, i
                         told you to abort --

                                   victor
                         abort?  reed, i put my company, my
                         name, billions of dollars on the line,
                         and i will not let you make me look
                         like a fool --

                                   reed
                         victor, if we could understand what
                         happened to us --

                                   victor
                         i don't want to understand it.  this
                         isn't one of your science projects.  i
                         just want to fix it.  fast!

               reed sees victor's scar maybe growing.  lights dim.

                                   voice (o.s.)
                         there a problem, vic?

               they turn to see...ben down the hall, leaning in a doorway. 
               victor tightens, looking at ben's massive rock-hewn body.

                                   victor
                         no problem, ben.

               he turns back to reed.  close, quiet.  lights flicker.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         just pay your goddamn electric bill,
                         and get to work on a cure.

               victor steps away, toward the elevator.  he passes ben, who
               just smiles and waves "goodbye."  before victor's finger taps
               the down-button, the button lights up (as if the circuit
               responded to him).  reed exhales, shaken.  victor steps into --
