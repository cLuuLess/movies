               int. victor's compound office - day

               victor packs a monogrammed armani briefcase: "vdm" emblazoned
               on a gold plate.  leonard waits not-so-patiently.

                                   victor
                         make sure you find ben, bring him back
                         here.  and keep it quiet.  i don't
                         need this to hit the press.

                                   leonard
                         yes sir.  you've got the mayor at
                         eight, then a nine-thirty interview
                         with the journal --

                                   victor
                         front page?

                                   leonard
                         top left, like you asked.
                             (a smile)
                         today wall street.  tomorrow, who
                         knows...maybe washington.

               victor turns to leonard, disappointed with him.

                                   victor
                         leonard.  think bigger.
