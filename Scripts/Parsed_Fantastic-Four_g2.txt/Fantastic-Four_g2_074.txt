               int. bank - conference room - continuous

               bankers sit around a table.  laptops hum.  the lead banker is
               power-broker ned cecil.  the men keep their eyes on victor.

                                   ned cecil
                         well, victor, the bank would like to
                         congratulate you.  on the fastest
                         freefall since the depression.  we
                         can't even give your stock away.

                                   victor
                         ned, you know i can turn this around.

               ned motions to the paper, the picture of ben.

                                   ned cecil
                         you promised a cure-all, and came back
                         with this.  who the hell's going to
                         invest in a biotech company that turns
                         its workers into circus freaks?

               victor's grip tightens around the table, and...the laptops
               flicker, losing feeds.

               victor looks down at his hands -- a private beat (did i do
               that?)  he lets go of the table; screens go back to normal.

                                   victor
                             (pointed)
                         i really appreciate all your support.

                                   ned cecil
                         you've got a week, victor.  one week
                         to turn this around.  or we pull
                         out...
                             (a beat)
                         this meeting is over.

               victor looks at him, blood boiling, and we cut hard to --
