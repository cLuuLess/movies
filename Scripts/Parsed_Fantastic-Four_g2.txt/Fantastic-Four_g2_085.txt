               sue works the controls.  reed approaches ben with an
               electrode needle.  he tries to stick the needle into ben, but
               it snaps.

                                   ben
                         you got a chisel round here?

                                   reed
                         if we're going to identify the source
                         of the mutation, we need to isolate
                         your recombinant dna so we can
                         activate positional genomes.

               ben looks to sue for translation.

                                   sue
                         we need to give you a physical, so we
                         know what got zapped.

                                   ben
                         well why didn't you say so?  you want
                         me to lift some weights or something?

               reed shakes his head.  he approaches with an x-ray machine.

                                   reed
                         no, just sit back.  we have a good
                         sense of your strength from the
                         firetruck.  we need to find the source
                         of your strength.

               he turns on the x-ray machine.  the graph shows solid rock. 
               the rays don't penetrate.  sue and reed look confused.

                                   ben
                         how bad is it?  you know i used to
                         smoke.

               reed grabs a blood pressure machine, but the strap is way too
               short to wrap around ben's arm.  reed stands stumped.  he
               looks at his tray full of instruments.  he picks up the
               little rubber reflex-hammer.  but it looks miniscule compared
               to ben.

               reed has an idea.  he opens a drawer full of hardware tools. 
               he pulls of a real hammer.  he approaches ben.

                                   reed
                         okay, this might smart a little.

               he taps ben's knee lightly, and ben's leg kicks!  slamming
               up!  right between reed's legs!  the ultimate kick in the
               crotch.  reed stretches up a few feet, then snaps back,
               wincing.

                                   reed (cont'd)
                             (high-pitched voice)
                         we'll...continue this later.
