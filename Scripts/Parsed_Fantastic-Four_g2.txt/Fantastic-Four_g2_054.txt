               ext. train yard - night

               a view from brooklyn: manhattan glistens in the distance. 
               camera moves down to a train yard, where we find empty cargo
               trains.  we push in on the main track, where...

               a cargo train has just stopped.  we hear a cargo door slide
               open, then whump!  big feet hit the ground.  someone, or
               something barrels into the night.
