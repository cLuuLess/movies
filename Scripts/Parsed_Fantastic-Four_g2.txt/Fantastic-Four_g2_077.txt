               the fantastic four enter.  they are greeted by jimmy
               o'hoolihan, an old-time doorman with a kind smile.

                                   o'hoolihan
                         welcome back to the baxter, dr.
                         richards.  all that for you?

               he motions to the flashing cameras outside.

                                   reed
                         i'm afraid so...

               he searches for the name.  sue steps up.

                                   sue
                         jimmy.  good to see you again.

               he smiles at sue, then at reed.

                                   o'hoolihan
                         good to see you too... don't worry,
                         sir.  i know how crowded that head of
                         yours is.

                                   reed
                         any visitors while i was away?

                                   o'hoolihan
                         just the usual.  told 'em you were
                         circling round outer space.

               he opens a drawer full of letters from the bank.  reed looks
               sheepish.  he shuts the drawer, looks to johnny and sue.

                                   reed
                         we had a tough year.

                                   ben
                         yeah, nine years straight.

               reed looks at ben.  thanks a lot.  ding.  elevator doors
               open.
