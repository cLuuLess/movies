               two dozen employees sit and eat.  others serve themselves at
               the buffet.  ben and sue walking into the dining hall --

                                   sue
                         i can only stay for one drink, ben. 
                         i've got to meet with victor.

                                   ben
                         wouldn't want to keep vic waiting.

               they turn a corner and find reed, entering by another door.

                                   ben (cont'd)
                         hey reed, what are you doing here?
                             (before he can answer)
                         great, why don't you join us?

               he quickly shepherds the two of them toward a quiet table. 
               ben's stomach growls; so loud that they all can hear it.

                                   ben (cont'd)
                         god, i'm starving.  gonna hit the
                         buffet.

               ben's stomach growls again, even louder this time.
