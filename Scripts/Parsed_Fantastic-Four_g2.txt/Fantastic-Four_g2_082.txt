               int. sue's room - day

               sue walks out of the bathroom in a robe, drying her hair. 
               she notices a familiar book on a shelf: a scrapbook.

               she flips through it.  it's filled with pictures of reed and
               his inventions -- a lot less fancy than victor's multimedia
               globe.  she stops at a picture of her and reed in college.

               a noise, and she turns, flinching slightly, surprised to
               see...victor.  he smiles, standing at the door, watching her.

                                   victor
                         god, i've been so worried about you.

               she notices the scar on his head.

                                   sue
                         victor, your scar --

                                   victor
                         i told you, i'm fine.  it's you i'm
                         worried about.

                                   sue
                         i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to --

                                   victor
                         please, no apologies.  i've arranged
                         for your things to be moved to one of
                         my condos.  you'll have round-the
                         clock care.

               he goes for her bag.  but she stops him.  a half beat.

                                   sue
                         thank you, that's generous, but i
                         think i should stay here.  with my
                         brother.  until we get a handle on
                         this.

               victor is not used to being rebuffed.  he gives a thin smile.

                                   victor
                         sue.  i think you should let my
                         doctors have a look at you.

               a tense beat.  standoff.  made more tense by --

                                   reed (o.s.)
                         victor!  what are you doing here?

               they turn to see reed approaching, with files in hand.

                                   victor
                         i'm starting to wonder the same
                         thing... how much do you know about
                         what happened to you?

                                   reed
                         not much.  we need to run tests to see
                         the extent of the damage.

               victor pauses.  he looks at sue, knowing she's here to stay.

                                   victor
                         well, let me know if there is anything
                         i can do.  we're all in this together
                         now.

               victor shakes reed's hand.  his grip is so tight that reed's
               fingers stretch.  victor lets go, and turns to sue, who puts
               her hand out.  he smiles, and shakes.  he heads off.

               reed looks at his hand.  shakes his wrist.  he looks at
               victor.
