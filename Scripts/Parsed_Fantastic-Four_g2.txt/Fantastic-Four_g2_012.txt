               ext. lake launch facility - night

               retrofitted into a makeshift press area.  victor sits on a
               platform, with reporters stretched out below him.

                                   victor
                         today we stand on the edge of a new
                         frontier.  in the furthest depths of
                         outer space...we will find the secrets
                         to inner space.  the final key to
                         unlocking our genetic code lies in a
                         cosmic storm...

               behind the action: reed, sue, johnny and ben walk past.  news
               crews barely notice, passing without even taking a picture. 
               our "fantastic four" are not exactly big news.  not yet.

                                   ben
                         isn't that your speech?

                                   reed
                         he's made a few changes.

                                   ben
                         this is your dream, reed.  you should
                         be the one up there.

                                   reed
                         victor's better at these things.

               just past the press area, they see...one woman standing,
               waiting.  this is debbie, ben's fianc√©e.  and for the first
               time in the entire film...ben smiles.  they hug, kissing. 

               johnny and reed watch.  reed glances at sue, who walks ahead. 
               debbie slips a photo into ben's flightsuit.  a tender beat.

                                   ben
                         i'll be watching over you.

                                   debbie
                         just get back soon, or i start looking
                         for a new groom.

               ben looks at the little engagement ring on her finger.

                                   ben
                         soon as i'm back, i'm gonna trade that
                         in for a bigger rock.

                                   debbie
                         i don't care about rocks, i care about
                         you.
                             (to reed)
                         you bring him back in one piece, or
                         you can forget being best man.

               reed nods, smiles.  debbie gives ben a last kiss.  ben turns
               to johnny, who gives a cocky smile.

                                   ben
                         what the hell you smiling at?  just
                         keep your mouth shut, and your mind on
                         those smbs --

                                   johnny
                         actually, the engines are smes.
                         hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. 
                         couple generations past your last
                         ride.
                             (at the threshold)
                         i'm not as dumb as you look.

               ben just glares at reed.  this is going to be a long trip. 
               as they follow after sue, we cut back to --

               victor on stage

               mid-speech.  playing behind him is reed's hologram: stars
               give way to a pulsating red cloud...

                                   victor
                         think of a world without genetic flaws
                         -- no asthma, allergies, baldness,
                         breast cancer...

               ben and reed hear the speech.  ben bristles.

                                   ben
                         what's wrong with being bald...?

               victor smiles at the crowd, commanding.  a true leader.

                                   victor
                         darwin discovered evolution.  now we --
                         i -- will define it.  only in america
                         could...

               the red cloud of cosmic rays wash over the earth.

                                   victor (v.o.) (cont'd)
                         ...a little country boy from latveria
                         build one of the biggest companies in
                         the world, and truly reach the stars. 
                         now if you'll excuse me, history
                         awaits...

               on those words, the hologram transforms to...von doom's
               shuttle on the launch pad.  boom!  thrusters fire white hot. 
               smoke billows across the pad.  ready for take off.

               victor walks past the hologram and exits.  his departure
               perfectly timed with the shuttle lifting off.

               we push in on the shuttle, and follow the ship as it leaves
               earth's atmosphere.  boom -- booster rockets fall away and
               the shuttle fires its thrusters.  the hologram transitions
               to...

               a shot of the space station high above the earth.  the
               shuttle enters from the top, lighting up the hologram with
               engines afire.  as the shuttle approaches the station we cut
               to --
