               ext./int. diner - night

               a pitstop in queens.  heavy rain swims down windows.  ben
               sits at the counter, with his hat pulled low, coat tight. 
               nobody sits within four chairs of him.  he sips coffee in a
               metal bowl.  a long beat.  then...

                                   victor (o.s.)
                         this seat taken?

               ben turns to see...victor.

                                   ben
                         what are you doing here?

                                   victor
                         i'm worried about you.

                                   ben
                         about me?  how sweet.

                                   victor
                         come on.  let me buy you something to
                         eat.  looks like you could use the
                         company.

               ben considers.  a man deeply alone.  a beat.
