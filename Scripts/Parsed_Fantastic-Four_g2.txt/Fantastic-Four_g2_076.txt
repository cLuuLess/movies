               ext. baxter building - day

               reporters snap pictures.  a police convoy drives up, stopping
               in front of a towering high-rise.  sue, reed, and johnny and
               get out of a police-car. ben steps out of a big paddy-wagon,
               which immediately bounces back up to the normal axle
               position.

               cops hold back the surging press.  ben keeps his head down,

                                   johnny
                         smile, ben.  they want to like you. 
                         give 'em your good side.  or your less

               ben turns to a group of little kids.  stiff, tentative:

                                   ben
                         uh...don't do drugs.

               the kids flinch.  ben trudges on.  johnny smiles bright,
               doing hand-signs for f4.  sue pulls him toward --
