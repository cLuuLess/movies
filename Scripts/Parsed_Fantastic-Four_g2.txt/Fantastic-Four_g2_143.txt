               int. transformation chamber - night

               the chamber doors open.  thing enters.  he looks around this
               sterile box.  an animal in a cage.  victor pushes a control;
               the doors of the chamber slowly close and seal.  thing shuts
               his eyes.  he just wants to be ben again.

               from the controls: victor initiates the transformation
               sequence.  as lights go on inside the chamber, they dim in
               the lab.  energy pumps into the chamber.  the storm swirls
               faster.  lights flicker...there's not enough power, until --

               -- victor walks over...grabs hold of the machine with both
               hands...and whhhm!  a countdown begins in the control panels. 

               slow move in on the chamber, the thing's face in the window. 
               the chamber activates.  the storm strikes hard.

               the thing opens his mouth, a beat, then he screams in agony. 
               struggling violently inside.  to escape?  extend the moment:
               condensation obscures the chamber window: the thing vanishes.
