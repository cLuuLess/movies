               ext. baxter building - night

               reed melts down the sides of an awning, like a salvador dali
               watch.  he tries to grab hold of window ledges, but he can't
               get a grip.  his arm streeetches, and snap!  he falls like a
               slinky, out of control.  half his body loose, half hard.

               he drips to the sidewalk, where...doom steps out.  he catches
               reed's face, holds it close.

                                   doom
                         why the long face?

               doom whips reed into the night.  as doom turns, people cower,
               horrified by his face.  they clear out, and...

               doom sees his reflection in a window: scarred skin, metallic
               veins.  a monster.  infuriated, he shatters the window with
               an iron fist, and bounds into the night.
