               reed richards and ben grimm head toward the soaring glass-box
               atrium of vdi headquarters.  designed to inspire awe, it
               does.

                                   reed
                         high open space, exposed structural
                         elements.  obviously aimed at first
                         time visitors to create feelings of...
                         smallness, inadequacy.

               ben glances at reed, who looks a little nervous.

                                   ben
                         good thing it ain't workin... reed,
                         what are we doing here?  this guy's
                         fast-food, strip-mall science --

                                   reed
                         this wasn't our first stop, in case
                         you forgot nasa.  and victor's not
                         that bad.  he's just a little...
                             (seeing the statue)
                         larger than life.
