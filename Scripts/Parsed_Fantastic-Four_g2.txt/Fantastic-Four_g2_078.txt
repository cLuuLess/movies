               int. baxter building - elevator - day

               they enter.  reed hits the top button, for the 20th floor.

                                   johnny
                         twenty?  from outside the place looks
                         a lot taller.

                                   reed
                         oh, it is.

               the doors close, but...the elevator does not move.  a beat.

                                   johnny
                         either we're moving really fast...or
                         not at all.

               a digital readout on the panel: exceed maximum weight.  a
               sign reads: maximum capacity: 2000 pounds.  they turn to ben.

                                   ben
                         i'll take the stairs.

               doors open.  he lumbers out.  as the doors close behind him,
               he looks back over his shoulder, locking eyes with reed.
