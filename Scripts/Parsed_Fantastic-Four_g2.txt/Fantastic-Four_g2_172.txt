               ext. circle line boat - deck - dusk

               a romantic view of the city-scape.  reed stands with sue.

                                   reed
                         i found a broken gasket, from space --

                                   sue
                         a gasket?  reed, we're at a party.

               he opens his hand, revealing a circular piece of metal, just
               about the size of......a ring.  sue slows down.

                                   reed
                         if one of us were to wear it...

               she sees johnny and ben inside, watching -- in on a secret. 

               reed looks her square in the eye.  unflinching.

                                   sue
                         reed.  what are you doing?

               reed drops to his knees.  his head stays eye-level, while his
               body drops.  sue gapes, so emotional she starts to disappear.

                                   reed
                         no more thinking, no more variables...
                         sue storm...will you...
                             (she's gone)
                         sue?  sue?  you there?

               dead silence.  and then...

               the ring disappears.  sue is wearing it.

                                   sue (v.o.)
                         yes.

               reed goes to kiss her.

                                   sue (v.o.) (cont'd)
                         that's my nose, genius... these are my
                         lips.

               reed's face is squeezed on both sides by sue's invisible
               hands.  she pulls him into a kiss and reappears.

               inside: the party applauds.  ben, johnny, and alicia move
               through the crowd to join reed and sue.  as they go --

                                   ben
                         no more cracks about how i look.

                                   johnny
                         hey, i'm mr. sensitivity now.
                             (weaving around bodies)
                         clear the way, wide load coming
                         through.

               ben glares, fists clenched.  johnny smiles, mischievous, as
               they hit the balcony.  and he flames on, taking off into the
               air, blazing the number "four" enclosed in a circle of flame
               (their future callsign), over the city skyline.  the crowd
               oohs and aahs.  ben watches, unimpressed.

                                   ben
                         showoff.

               people drink, laugh, dance.  we slowly pull back from the
               party, the boat, the city, and...cut to --
