               int. baxter building - reed's office - day

               sue steps into the office, followed by reed.  quiet, urgent:

                                   sue
                         don't let victor push you into making
                         a mistake --

                                   reed
                         he was going to take away all my data,
                         equipment --

                                   sue
                         better than your life.  victor's not
                         the one who has to get into that
                         thing.  we are.

               reed starts to snap, losing his studied cool.

                                   reed
                         which is why i'm working twenty hours
                         a day, checking every variable --

                                   sue
                         every variable but yourself.  you
                         don't eat, sleep.  you can't live in
                         your head like --

                                   reed
                             (finally losing it)
                         i'm not the only one in there.  i got
                         you, vic, ben, johnny, all rattling
                         around in there.

               sue stands there, shocked by his outburst.  a beat.

                                   sue
                         so clear it out.  get out of your
                         head.  get out of here...

               he looks at her, knowing what she means.  where she means.
