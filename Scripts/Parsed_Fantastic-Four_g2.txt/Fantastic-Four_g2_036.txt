               int. von doom compound hospital room - day

               a black screen:

                                   johnny's voice
                         ben, wake up!  wake up!

               subjective camera, ben's pov: the blurry image of johnny
               comes slowly into focus, standing beside a hospital bed.

                                   ben (o.s.)
                         where...where am i?

                                   johnny
                         back on earth.  victor's medical
                         facility... we're in quarantine.

                                   ben (o.s.)
                         reed? ... sue?

                                   johnny
                         they're fine.  everybody else...is
                         fine.

               johnny looks away, as if he can't bear to lay eyes on him.

                                   ben (o.s.)
                         what's wrong with me?

                                   johnny
                         i swear to you they've done everything
                         humanly possible.  the best plastic
                         surgeons in the world, ben.  you had
                         the best --

                                   ben (o.s.)
                         give me a mirror...

               johnny picks up a hand mirror on the bed table before ben can
               reach it, reluctant to give it to him.

                                   johnny
                         they said that's not such a good idea,
                         the shock alone could --

                                   ben (o.s.)
                         give me the god damn mirror!

               ben grabs it from him.  then slowly raises it to look and see
               that...except for some serious stubble, ben's totally normal.

                                   johnny
                         unfortunately, the doctors just
                         couldn't do anything to fix your face!

               he cackles as he heads for the door.  ben heaves the mirror
               at him, breaking it into hundreds of pieces.  he turns to the
               side-table, and grabs that picture of debbie.  it calms him.
