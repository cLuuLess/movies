	ext. street - day

	beefy is taking a dump on the sidewalk.  pan over to:

	nicky, his pants around his ankles.  he's trying to do the
	same.

				nicky
		this is intense!  and it happens every
		day?  sometimes twice?  i gotta tip my
		hat to you people!

				beefy
		look, it's okay for me to shit the
		street.  but you gotta use a toilet.

				nicky
			(pulling up pants)
		okay, just point me in the right
		direction next time.

				beefy
		come on, there's like ten million people
		in this city and the clock is ticking.

				nicky
		well, let's rock and roll.

	nicky looks at the next person walking by.  it's a chinese
	delivery guy on a bicycle.  nicky clotheslines him, taking
	him off the bike in a sleeperhold/headlock.

				nicky (cont'd)
		get in the bottle.  dad's falling apart.
		you froze the gate and you're killing
		him.  drink!

	nicky puts the flask to the chinese guy's lips.

				chinese delivery guy
		i'm not thirsty!  i'm not thirsty!

				nicky
		just get in the flask!

	the chinese guy breaks loose, gives nicky a roundhouse kick
	to the head and runs away.  nicky gets up.

				nicky (cont'd)
		adrian and cassius!  you think a kick to
		the head is gonna make me throw in the
		towel?  well, in the immortal words of
		judas priest, "you got another thing
		comin'."

	beefy shakes his dog head and sighs as we see nicky hold the
	bottle up to a few more pedestrians.
