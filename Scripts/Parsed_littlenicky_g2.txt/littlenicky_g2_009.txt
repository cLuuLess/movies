	ext. gates of hell - shortly after

	we see the coals are cooling down on the road and the damned
	souls in hell are sneaking off.

	the demons are baffled and don't quite know what to do.

	dad, jimmy and nicky walk to the frozen fire.

				damned souls (o.s.)
		what's going on?  where are we?

	we keep hearing people hit behind the frozen fire with loud
	thuds.

				jimmy the demon
		nothing's getting through that.  the
		fire is solid as a rock.

				nicky
		we gotta get this bad boy burning again.
		ideas?

				dad
		to do that cassius and adrian have to
		come back through the other way.

				nicky
		so go get 'em, dad!

				dad
		i'm too weak.  the process has already
		begun.

	dad holds up his hand.  his pink is hanging by a thread.  we
	see the bigfoot monster grunt disgusted by the sight.

				nicky
		so go get 'em, jimmy!

				jimmy the demon
		i'm just a demon, nicky.  i don't got
		devil blood in me.  i'd last two minutes
		up there with your brothers.

				nicky
		you're not saying it's up to me?

	the monster puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as
	if to say, "oh no."

				nicky (cont'd)
		i've never been to earth.  i've never
		even slept over at some other dude's
		house!

				jimmy the demon
		you're the spawn of satan.  you got it
		in you.

				dad
		nicky, the worst thing that could happen
		on earth is you get killed, in which
		case, boom, you end up back here.

				nicky
		are you telling me i have to go to earth
		and kill my brothers?

				jimmy the demon
		not go.  they left together at the exact
		same time.  they gotta come back
		together at the exact same time.

	dad takes an ornate flask from his robe.

				dad
		here.  get them drunk from this.  one
		sip and they'll be trapped inside.  once
		you've got both of them, you bring the
		flask back through the gate.

	dad's pinky is hanging.  jimmy pulls it off and examines it.
	the monster gags.

				jimmy the demon
		your ol' man's got less than a week.

	nicky looks petrified.

				nicky
		no.  this can't be happening.

				dad
		son, just do your best.

	nicky looks teary eyed.  the moment is broken by the monster,
	who runs in and pushes nicky through the fire.

	nicky goes through the solid fire wall.  pause.  the monster
	taps his own wrist and looks at dad as if to say, "gotta get
	a move on."
