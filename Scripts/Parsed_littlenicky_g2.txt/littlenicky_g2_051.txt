	int. basketball court - midcourt - continuous

	nicky pushes the ball up the court while the ref plays
	extremely tight defense.  nicky fakes one way, then heads
	toward the basket.  the ref stays tight.  nicky's eyes are
	redder than ever.  he fakes left, he fakes right.  he
	dribbles behind the back, dribbles between the legs, then
	takes his momentum up toward the basket.  he jumps from the
	foul line and flies through the air.  he emits a crazy, blood
	curdling, devil yell.

	cut away during devil yell to:

	shot clock

	it reads: 666.

	popcorn and sodas explode.

	cornrow's cornrows pop open into a giant afro.

	back on nicky

	nicky's head starts turning and does a 360 (like the
	exorcist).  he ends his flight by slamming down a thunderous
	dunk, cracking the backboard's glass into pieces.  he hits
	the ref on the way down.  the crowd cheers, finally happy
	again.
