	ext. valerie's street - night

	we see nicky hurtling toward the street.  holding his eyes.

				valerie
		oh my g-d, i'm so sorry!

	suddenly he stops.  suspended above ground.  valerie doesn't
	hear the expected thud.

				valerie (cont'd)
		nicky?

	he floats up, but he can't see.

				nicky
		valerie?

				valerie
		are you dead?

				nicky
		no.

				valerie
		what are you doing?

				nicky
		i think i'm floating.

				valerie
		why would you be floating?

				nicky
		i don't know.  maybe it's because of
		your sweet voice.

				valerie
		am i supposed to not be freaked out
		right now?  because i am.

	he's floating up.  he slows down.

				nicky
		i can't see you but i can smell you.
		and you make me feel alive in a way i've
		never felt before.

	cut to reveal he's floating outside the student's window.
	the student's dripping candle wax on his belly.

				student
		you got the wrong window again, man.

				nicky
		oh.  sorry, andrew.  valerie?

	nicky resumes floating up.

				valerie
		i'm over here, nicky!  to the left.

	nicky is parallel with her.  he hovers in front of her, eyes
	still watering.  she punches nicky in the face, and he flies
	back ten feet.

				valerie (cont'd)
		look, just because you're floating
		doesn't mean i'm gonna forget about you
		giving me the finger.

				nicky
		that wasn't me.  i was being possessed
		by my brother, adrian.  he's the one who
		call you a gross pig.

				valerie
		what do you mean, "possessed?"

				nicky
		remember when i told you my dad was in
		hell?

				valerie
		yes...

				nicky
		well, that's because he's the devil.
		and he wants to keep his throne for
		another ten-thousand years.  which is
		fine with me, but not with my brothers,
		so they broke out of hell, causing my
		dad...

				valerie
		... "the devil?"...

				nicky
		...to decompose.  and i love my  dad
		very much.  so i came to earth to save
		him but then crazy eyes stole my flask
		and i met you and...well, my dog tells
		me i just might be in love with you.

	his vision is clearing and he can start to see her.  she is
	totally in shock but still here.

				valerie
		okay, now i get that "deep south" joke.

	nicky laughs.  valerie joins in.

				valerie (cont'd)
		i don't know if i should believe you.

	nicky starts to drop.

				nicky
		you gotta believe me.  you gotta believe
		in the butterflies.

				valerie
		okay, i do.  get back up here.

	he floats up to her holding out his hand.  nervously, she
	takes his hand and suddenly she is lifting off and they are
	flying.
