	int. todd's apartment - night

	a homemade cake is laid out.  it reads: congratulations,
	nicky.  john, todd, peter and beefy are there.

				todd
		so your father's the devil, you're a
		talking dog sent from hell, and you guys
		are who?

				peeper
		just a couple of big fans of nicky and
		the work his dad does.

				john
		by the way, nicky.  check this out.

	he spins his black sabbath backwards.

				john (cont'd)
		what's ozzy trying to say there?

				nicky
		absolutely nothing.  the blizzard always
		came straight with his messages.  but
		wrap your minds around this one.

	nicky gets up and we see his is sitting on a hibachi.  he pus
	on a james taylor album and plays it backwards.

				voice
		i command you in the name of the lucifer
		to spread the blood of the innocent.

	john and peter look at each other, shocked.

				john
		no wonder your uncle's so weird...

				todd

		funny.

				peter
