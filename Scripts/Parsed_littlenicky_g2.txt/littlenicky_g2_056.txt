	int. dorm room window - continuous

	a student is standing in the window draped in silks, feeling
	his nipples with his legs crossed like the guy in "silence of
	the lambs."  the student is startled.

				student
		hello.

				nicky
		you smell like coconuts.

				student
		it's "comptoir sud pacific."  makes me
		feel like a hula girl.  which is kinda
		what i'm going for.  wanna come in?

				nicky
		no thanks.  i'm looking for a girl named
		valerie who also smells like coconuts.

				student
		valerie doran?  two floors up, one
		window over.

				nicky
		thanks, much.  good luck with the
		genital tucking.

				student
		i don't need luck.  i'm good.

	nicky floats away.  a few seconds later, he floats back,
	holding up the flask.

				nicky
		adrian?

				student
		andrew.

	nicky nods and floats off.
