	ext. fire gates of hell

	we see the gate/wall of flames.  we hear screaming.  wham!
	we see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in
	a heap in a shallow pit of coals.

	dazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the
	fire wall at different levels.  (note: all the arrivals
	clothes are now burned & shredded).

				gatekeeper (o.s.)
		welcome!

	the peeper looks left to see the gatekeeper standing at his
	station greeting the new souls with mock cheer.

				peeper
		am i in hell?

				gatekeeper
		what do you think?

	a giant bird appears and bites the peeper's crotch area.  we
	leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to...

	matte painting hell

	music up: "running with the devil" by van halen

	the vast and insane kingdom of hell.  a road leads toward it
	like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals.  we see
	the black castle in the distance.  the camera zooms into the
	castle, to one particular window.
