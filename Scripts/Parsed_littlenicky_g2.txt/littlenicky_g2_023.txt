	int. cathedral

	close on an elderly, kind looking cardinal.  he ascends the
	steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation.
	we see that tv cameras are covering the sunday service.  he
	gins his homily.

				cardinal
		in today's gospel, the lord tells us who
		we are to live if we wish to attain the
		splendor of heaven... or something like
		that.  jesus sure says a lot of stuff in
		the bible.  moses this.  moses that.
		abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.

	the crowd stares dumbfounded.  we see that the cardinal is
	standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box
	with the top open.

				cardinal (cont'd)
		yep, the lord sure did say a bunch of
		hibbity-jibbity.  but has he ever really
		done anything for us?  has he ever put a
		jaguar xjr in my driveway?  has he ever
		given any of my enemies the herpes?  no.
		he hasn't done a damn thing for any of
		us.

	a middle-aged woman stands up.

				middle-aged woman
		the lord gave my son the strength to get
		off drugs.

				cardinal
		ma'am, i know your son, and believe me,
		he was better off on drugs.  he's a
		bore.  at least when he was smoking
		hashish, he made me laugh occasionally.

	a young man and his pregnant wife stand up.

				young man
		after we tried for many years, the lord
		finally helped my wife conceive a baby.

				cardinal
		no, your best friend fitzie helped your
		wife conceive a baby.  he helped her
		conceive it all night long.

	fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the wife, starts
	to "raise the roof."  then thinks better of it.  the cardinal
	points to a well-dressed man in the front pew.

				cardinal (cont'd)
		how about you, mr. mayor?  the lord ever
		do anything for you?

	the mayor has tinfoil on his feet.

				mayor
			(standing)
		well, i wish i could think of something,
		cardinal, but to be honest with you, i
		can't.  kind of makes you wonder if
		there even is a lord.  if there is any
		ultimate punishment for our so-called
		"sins."  maybe we should all just have
		fun and do whatever the hell we want.

	a hubbub is raised by the crowd.  fitzie raises the roof
	again, this time energetically.

				cardinal
		amen to that.  let the sin begin!

	the hubbub grows to a roar.  several people start fighting
	over the money in the collection plate.

	the cardinal smiles knowingly at the mayor.  we hear the
	cardinal's thoughts - in adrian's voice.

				adrian (o.s.)
		oh, this is delicious.

	on mayor

	he's smirking.  we hear his telepathic response.

				cassius (o.s.)
			(laughing)
		"let the sin begins" - that was a good
		one.

				adrian (o.s.)
		well, we must get people sinning if we
		want to fill up our new hell.  how are
		things going down at city hall?

				cassius (o.s.)
		i lowered the drinking age to ten.

				adrian (o.s.)
		brilliant.  this is so much fun.  i
		never want it to end.

				cassius (o.s.)
		why should it end?  who's gonna stop us?

	the mayor/cassius laughs.  as he does, his eyes slowly cross.
