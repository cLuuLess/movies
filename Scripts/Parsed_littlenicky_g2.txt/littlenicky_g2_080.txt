	int. chief's office - day

	surrounded by prostitutes and criminals in a very hot room,
	the chief of police puts down his bottle of peppermint
	schnapps, stands up and looks at the two idiots.

				chief of police
		you have what i want?

				john
		sure do.  you got what we want?

				peter
		fifty million bones, bro.

	he nods to a deputy who gives them a briefcase of money.

				chief of police
		that's half of it.  you get the rest
		when i get nicky.

				peter
		excellent.  but i gotta warn you, man.
		he's not human.

				chief of police
		really?

				john
		we think he's the son of satan.

	pause.  the chief laughs, then everyone else does.  he walks
	over and picks them up by their throats.

				chief of police
		well, then i guess i'll have to be extra
		careful.  now where is he?
