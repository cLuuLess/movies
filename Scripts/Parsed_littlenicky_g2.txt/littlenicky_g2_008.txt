	int. throne room - later

	close on dad.

				dad
		i'm sorry.  after careful consideration,
		i regretfully have to decline.

	on person he's talking to: dan marino.

				dan
		c'mon, man, i'm just asking for one
		superbowl ring.

				dad
		in exchange for eternal damnation of
		your soul?  you're too nice of a guy for
		me to want to do that to you, mr.
		marino.

				dan
		you did it for namath.

				dad
		yeah, but joe was coming here anyways.
		just go back to earth and enjoy your
		records and the hall of fame and the
		beautiful family and all that.

				dan
		this is bullshit, man.
			(gets up to leave)
		i'm gonna win the superbowl this year,
		with or without you!

				dad
		now you're talking.

	dan exits.

				nicky
		you're a good devil, dad.

				dad
		and i also happen to be a jets fan.

	nicky and dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint
	sirens.  the gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his
	knees.

				gatekeeper
		your highness, cassius and adrian have
		escaped from hell.  they went through
		the fire, and they broke it.  i think
		they took the new york tunnel.  i tried
		to stop them, but they overpowered me,
		sir.

				dad
		oh, boy.  oh boy.  calm down.  get off
		your knees.

	the gatekeeper stands up.

				gatekeeper
		thanks for being so understanding, your
		worship.  you're the man.  you've always
		been the man.

	dad's eyes glow red as the gatekeeper stands up.  two huge
	boobs grow out of either side of the gatekeeper's head.  we
	only see them from the front for a second.
	from behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the
	nipples as he talks to nicky.

				gatekeeper (cont'd)
			(to nicky)
		i'm lucky to get away with just the head
		boobs, right?

				nicky
		coulda been much worse.

				gatekeeper
		that's what i'm thinkin'...

	dad is staring off.  he looks shaken.

				dad
		this is bad, nicky.

				nicky
		how bad?

				dad
		i'm gonna die, nicky.  if the gates are
		broken, no new souls can get in, which
		means i'll start to deteriorate into
		nothing.

	grandpa lucifer enters.

				lucifer
		what's with all the whoo-whoo noises?

				dad
		everything's fine, pop.

				lucifer
		last time you said that the renaissance
		happened.

				dad
		please, pop, just go back to your room.

				lucifer
			(regarding gateskeeper)
		can i take him with me and have sex with
		his head?

				dad
		sure, pop.  whatever you want.

	the gatekeeper walks towards lucifer.

				gatekeeper
		oh, this is gonna be a whole new
		lifestyle for me, isn't it.
