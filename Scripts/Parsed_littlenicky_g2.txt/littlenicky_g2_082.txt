	int. grand central station platform - day

	we see beefy and todd waiting by the place where nicky
	usually comes up.  it is hot down there.  steam and smoke
	comes out of the tunnels.  todd is nervous.

				todd
		where is he?  he's late.

				beefy
		he'll be here.  just keep your cool,
		kid.

	they hear footsteps.  they turn and see the chief of police
	backed up by the huge police force.

				beefy (cont'd)
		we've been ratted out.

	beefy and todd turn to see john and peter looking sheepish.

				todd
		you guys.  that was so uncool.

				peter
		we thought the son of satan would
		understand a move like this.

	peter and john high-five.

				chief of police
		okay, take these two outside.  i can
		handle this.

	the police grab todd and put a leash on beefy.  the cops lead
	their prisoners away down the tunnel, leaving john and peter
	alone with the chief.

				chief of police (cont'd)
		wanna see something cool?

	the chief inserts a finger into his nostril.  then he fits
	his hand up there.  soon his whole arm is up his nostril as
	he searches for something.  john and peter are impressed.
	the chief grabs something and starts to pull.  then out of
	his nose comes adrian, who fully forms as the shell of the
	chief's body slumps to the ground.

				adrian
		ta-da.  so what time is my brother
		expected back?

				john
		noon...

	they look at the clock.  it's noon.

				john (cont'd)
		...ish.

	peter is sweating, kinda nervous.

				peter
		so even though you're not really the
		chief, we still get the rest of the
		cash, right bro?

				adrian
		you know what you'll get?  an
		indescribably horrific torture
		administered by demons for the rest of
		eternity.

				john
		but what about the cash?  can we keep it
		or what?

				adrian
		sure, why not?

	they high five.  adrian smiles and waits.  it is real hot
	down there.  we hear a train coming in the distance.  a fan
	circles slowly.  they all wait for him.

				lady
			(mumbling to herself)
		food stamps?
		they should call 'em "dude stamps."
		cause ever time i get one, some dude
		takes it away...

	we see the homeless lady down the platform stumbling her way
	towards them, drunk.  adrian scowls at her.

				lady (cont'd)
		hey, studs.  i'll let you make out with
		me for a dollar!

				john
		no thanks...but we'll take that bottle
		of booze.
			(grabs the bottle, laughs)

				lady
		hey...that's mine.

	peter pushes her away.

				peter
		beat it, ya freak.

	john and peter high five and john swigs from the bag.

				john
		schnapps...

				peter
			(takes the bag, swigs)
		peppermint...alright.

	adrian raises his eyebrows.  we see that the homeless lady is
	actually valerie in disguise.  she looks back, tense.  john
	offers adrian the flask.

				john
		wanna hit?

	hands it to him.  he takes it.

				peter
		drink up.  here's to fifty million
		clams.

				adrian
		to the defilement of earth and the
		corruption of its people.

				peter
		whatever.  knock it back, grab nicky and
		let's get outta this hell-hole.

	adrian smiles at john, then raises the bag.  he stops just
	before it hits his lips.  he looks at john curiously.

				adrian
		it is awfully hot down here.  how do you
		manage to stay so cool?

				john
		weed lowers the body temperature.
			(stuttering)
		i read that...in, uh...er, science
		magazine.

	adrian stares at john.  he raises the bag again.

				adrian
		this liquid will probably quench my
		thirst.  cool me off.

				peter
		definitely.

				john
		and give you a good buzz.

				adrian
		or maybe it will trap me inside for all
		eternity.

				john
		uh.  no it won't?

	john starts to tremble a bit.

				adrian
		oh, nicky, i've missed you.  come on out
		and say hello...

				john
		urr...uggg...errr...

				adrian
			(eyes getting red)
		i'm calling you out, brother...

	adrian is mentally pulling nicky out of john.  nicky/john
	wages an epic battle with himself as adrian smiles.

				john/nicky
		urrr...uggh...
			(as nicky)
		oww.  adrian, this is very painful.

	nicky comes flying out.  john's body slumps to the floor next
	to the chief's.  adrian looks in the "schnapps bottle" to see
	the flask wrapped in paper.  he peeks inside.

				adrian
		hello, cassius.

				cassius (o.s.)
		all right.  let me out.

				adrian
		you know, new hell really only needs one
		new satan.

				cassius (o.s.)
		you mother...

	adrian hands nicky the flask.

				adrian
		but cassius could use some company for
		the rest of eternity.  so get in the
		flask.

	he puts the flask in nicky's hands.
