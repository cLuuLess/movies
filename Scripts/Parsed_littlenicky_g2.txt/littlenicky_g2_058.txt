	int. valerie's room - continuous

	cool music.  she is up late.  working by candlelight on a
	fantastic design.  something's not working.  she drapes a
	beautiful fabric over another.  she smiles at the
	combination.  she is happy being creative.  nicky feels his
	heart swell as he watches her.

	on nicky

	he's so enraptured he leans forward trying to kiss her.  his
	head bumps the window.  she turns, startled.  she sees the
	beaming nicky.

				nicky
		hey.

				valerie
		nicky?  oh my g-d.  stay right there.

	pause.  valerie opens the window and sprays a can of mace
	right in nicky's face.

				nicky
		oh that stings!  my eyes are on fire!

	nicky stands up and stumbles around.

				valerie
		what were you thinking coming here?

				nicky
		i'm not sure, but it didn't involve
		getting blinded with poison.

	he bounces off the front rail, stumbles backward and goes
	flying over the back rail.
