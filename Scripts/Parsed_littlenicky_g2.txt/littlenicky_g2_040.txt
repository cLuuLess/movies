	int. todd's apartment - day

	beefy turns to nicky.

				beefy
		your brothers are upsetting the balance
		of good and evil.

				nicky
		what can i do about it?

				beefy
		you can't do jack shit... unless you
		learn your evil powers.

				nicky
		nobody's as evil as my brothers.  those
		dudes put the wick in wicked.

				beefy
		go get a soda out of the fridge.

				nicky
		but those are my roommate's sodas...

				beefy
			(high-pitched mocking)
		"but those are my roommate's sodas..."
		does that sound like a statement the son
		of the devil would make?

	nicky, ashamed, gets a coke out of the fridge and places it
	on the coffee table.  he and beefy sit on the couch and stare
	at the coke.

				beefy (cont'd)
		you have the power to change the cola in
		that can into any other liquid - engine
		oil, bat's blood, moose piss.  you just
		have to release the evil within you.

				nicky
		release the evil?

				beefy
		i'm just saying, there's wickedness in
		you... i can tell from your snores.

	nicky stares at the can.

				beefy (cont'd)
		release your evil...

	nicky frowns and bites his lip.  the can rattles a little.

				todd
		what are you doing?

	todd is standing in the doorway.  beefy runs to the fire
	escape.

	*******************

				todd (cont'd)
		i know it's your living room night.  but
		can i finish watching the globetrotters'
		game out here?  to me it's classic
		comedia dellarte.
