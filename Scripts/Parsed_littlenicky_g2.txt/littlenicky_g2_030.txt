	ext. central park - day

	nicky sits on the rocks, beaten and exhausted, eating a
	popeye's drumstick.

				nicky
		all that running and chasing is making
		the sleep thing want to come early.

				beefy
		i think we have to work on narrowing
		down our list of suspects.  now i'm
		going to go check in with some of my
		contacts uptown.

	beefy hears nicky's strange terrible snores.  he's asleep.
	beefy sighs.

				beefy (cont'd)
		kid's got a lot of evil in him, just
		begging to come out...

	beefy walks away.
