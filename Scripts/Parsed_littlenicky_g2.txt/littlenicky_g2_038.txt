	ext. bar - down the street - day

	several eleven year-olds stumble out, drunk.

				kid
		i just stole twenty-five bucks off the
		bar.

				kid #2
		how many beers did you have?

				kid # 3
		eight sips.

				kid
		i had five!  i'm so wasted.

	they both high five, throw up and fall.  pan over to adrian
	sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle
	of peppermint schnapps.

				adrian
		when an adult goes to hell, that's
		terrific.  but when a child goes...
		that's why i'm in this business.

	adrian looks across the street and sees nicky walking with
	valerie.  he's shocked.

	valerie is holding up a pair of drawstring pants from her
	collection.

				nicky
		so you're saying, make all pants with a
		drawstring, then heavier set gals don't
		have to feel humiliated by telling their
		waist size in front of the whole store?

				valerie
		basically, yeah.

				nicky
		wow.  maybe you should make drawstring
		socks for gals with fat ankles.

	valerie laughs.

				valerie
		you know what's nice about you?  you
		just seem happy being yourself.  you
		don't try to act cool.

				nicky
		thanks much.  you know what's nice about
		you, valerie?

				valerie
		what?

	up the street, adrian's eyes redden.  nicky looks like he's
	been stunned by something.

				nicky
		your juicy, heart-shaped ass.

				valerie
		what was that?

				nicky
			(shocked and confused)
		i...i don't know why i just said that.
		i meant to say that...

					 quick cut to:

	adrian's eyes flashing.

				nicky (cont'd)
		...i've always wanted to have sex with a
		gross pig.  what do you say we go behind
		that dumpster, pull our pants down and
		see what happens?

	valerie's very hurt.

				valerie
		you're a jerk.

	she turns and walks away.  nicky looks over and sees adrian.
	his inner voice speaks to him.

				nicky (o.s.)
		adrian!

				adrian (o.s.)
		you shouldn't have come here.

				nicky (o.s.)
		please, get out of my mind!

	adrian's eyes flash.

				nicky (cont'd)
		hey, valerie!

	she stops and turns.  nicky raises his fist to resist
	adrian's force.  it's too much.  his middle finger comes up,
	giving her the "finger."

				valerie
		what the hell's your problem?

	she runs away crying.  nicky turns to adrian who's still
	across the street.

				nicky (o.s.)
		adrian, you gotta come back to hell.
		dad's sick.

				adrian (o.s.)
		he's sick?

				nicky (o.s.)
		yeah, he needs souls to live.  when you
		guys left, you broke the gates.  we
		gotta get the gates burning again before
		he dies.

	adrian processes this.

				adrian (o.s.)
		he should have thought of that before he
		denied me my birthright.

				nicky (o.s.)
		well maybe you should go back and talk
		it over with him.

				adrian (o.s.)
		how about this?  i stay here enjoying my
		schnapps and you go back.

	nicky's body jerks around.

				nicky (o.s.)
		adrian, please...

	nicky, fighting control over his body, walks slowly and
	crazily into the middle of the street where he sees a large
	truck bearing down on him.

	john and peter get blood splattered on them.  peter looks
	down to see the "666" forms in blood on their clothes.

				peter
		check this out.  the number of the
		beast.

	they laugh and hi-five.

	on the tv - day
