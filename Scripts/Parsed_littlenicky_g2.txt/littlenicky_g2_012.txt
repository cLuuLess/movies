	nicky makes it back through the hole.  looks both ways and
	hops out of the hole.  he carefully crosses the tracks and is
	stopped by the sight of a bulldog, beefy, on the other side.
	in his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to
	identify their passengers at the airport.  on the sign is
	scrawled "nicky."

	nicky and beefy stare at each other a beat.

	beefy drops the sign from his mouth.
