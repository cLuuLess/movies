	ext. highway to hell - day

	cassius and adrian are standing by the road still flowing
	with souls.  both are pissed.  there's a big, ugly, bigfoot
	looking monster hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.

				cassius
		you work your ass off for ten thousand
		years, hurting people, helping others
		hurt people, then you get a decision
		like that.

				adrian
		and he's dead serious.

				cassius
		it's just such a slap in the face.

	adrian turns to the monster.

				adrian
		um, excuse me, we're having a private
		conversation here.

				cassius
		yeah, get out of here!  beat it!

	cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the monster's face.
	the monster shrugs and walks off.

				adrian
		twenty-thousand years ago, grandpa
		lucifer said, "it is better to rule in
		hell than serve in heaven."  well, i'm
		getting tired of serving in hell.  we
		need a place where we can rule.

	cassius throws a rock at the monster.  he yelps, then turns
	around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back.
	cassius sees this and gets enraged.

				cassius
		oh you wanna be a big man?  bring it
		on!! let's see what you got!

	the monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in
	an "aw phooey" gesture and continues walking away.

				cassius (cont'd)
		that's what i thought!

				adrian
			(to cassius)
		could you concentrate for five seconds?

				cassius
		i am concentrating.  where can we rule?

				adrian
		what do you think about...earth?

	cassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea.

				adrian (cont'd)
		we could create our own hell there.

				cassius
		you saying we go up there and kill
		everyone?

				adrian
		eventually, cassius.  but first we
		corrupt as many as we can so that when
		we do destroy them...

				cassius
		...their damned souls will be ours.

				adrian
		it's our time, brother.

	the two look at each other.  they start running toward the
	fire wall.  knocking souls out of their way.

				gatekeeper
		hey, what are you doing?!?

	they get closer to the fire.

				gatekeeper (cont'd)
		you can't go through there.  the fire
		flows in, not out.

	they dive through the fire wall.  it freezes.

				gatekeeper (cont'd)
		you know something?  you guys suck!  you
		really suck!

	sirens go off.  dogs start barking.  lights flash.  and we
	hear the sound of damned souls hitting the back of the
	firewall hard.
