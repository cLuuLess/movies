	ext. flagpoles - continuous

	adrian is underneath valerie.

				adrian
		you know, from this angle, you're kind
		of cute.

				valerie
		you think so?  why don't you come a
		little closer and i'll show you a better
		angle.

	he moves a little closer, and she spits on him.  he smiles.
	opens his mouth and catches her spit.  he swallows.

				adrian
		yummy.

	everyone is grossed out.

				todd
		oh my g-d, he just opened his mouth and
		swallowed that spit.

				beefy
		that turn you on there, rupaul?

				adrian
		keep it up and i just might make you my
		queen for a night or two.

				john
		you want a queen?  got one right here.

	john points at todd.  they laugh.  adrian gets closer to
	valerie.  just then a big butterfly appears on his shoulder.
	he looks down to see:

	nicky standing there with his army.

				adrian (o.s.)
		little nicky.

				nicky
		adrian, i'm asking you nicely, in the
		name of all that is good: release my
		friends and get in the flask.

				adrian
		is this a joke?

				nicky
		no.  it's the inner light.  and with it
		we can defeat anything you've got.

				reformed demon
			(eating popeye's chicken)
		it's true!

	adrian glares down at the reformed demon.  his eyes shoot out
	an evil ray.

	the reformed demon explodes into a million pieces.  his
	golden insides splatter on the crowd.

	the army of good is shaken.  another demon lowers his
	chicken.

				another reformed demon
		it's not true?

	the bucket of chicken sprouts legs and runs away.  nicky
	steps forward bravely.

				nicky
		okay, adrian, you've left me with no
		choice.

	nicky leaves frame and he flies up towards adrian.
