				beefy
		he superimposed your head onto
		"scarface."

				todd
		...which is by far depalma's best
		work...

	a loud knocking at the door

	the pounding increases.

				nicky
		i'm not nicky.  i'm not home!  i don't
		live here!

				peter
		dude, it's us.  let us in.

	nicky opens the door.  peter and john stumble in.

				john
		there's like a total mob scene coming
		this way.

	we hear voices of an approaching crowd coming outside.

				nicky
		i thought for sure i gave 'em the slip.

	todd i s looking out the window.

				todd
		looks like they're following a giant
		trail of bug shit.

				peter
		what'll we do now, beefy?

				beefy
		i don't know, this is a little out of my
		league.

	voices grow louder.

				voices (o.s.)
		come on.  let's get 'em.

				john
		what would your dad do, nicky?

				nicky
		good idea...kill me.

				peter

				nicky
		yes.  i'll meet you at grand central at
		noon.  okay.  do me.  i command you.

				john and peter
			(psyched)
		alright!

	john takes nicky's head and slams it hard into the kitchen
	counter.  nicky is dazed.

				nicky
		that just hurt a lot.

				todd
		i've always wanted to kill someone.  can
		i do it?

				john
		look at queen latifah steppin' up.
