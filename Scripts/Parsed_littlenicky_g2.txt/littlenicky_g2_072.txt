	but when he heads downhill, the guys in wheelchairs start to
	catch up.  they get closer and closer until... nicky makes a
	last second right turn into an alley.  the wheelchairs can't
	slow down and crash into a double decker tourist bus at the
	bottom of the street.  the tourist on the top level look over
	the edge to see the crash.
