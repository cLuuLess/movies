	int. birthday cake - continuous

	nicky enters the cake to find angel and two friends: jenna
	and christa.  they are doing arts and crafts sort of things
	on a glass table in front of them.  they stare at him.  angel
	rises.

				angel
		oh. my. g-d.  i can't believe you're
		here.  welcome.  can i just tell you, i
		am so excited right now.

				christa
		so excited.

				jenna
		she really is.

				nicky
		that's terrific.  now could you ladies
		point me to the black palace?  i should
		check in with my dad...

	nicky trails off as he sees the angels laughing at him.

				angel
		i'm sorry, you're just so cute.

				jenna
		do you have any idea where you are right
		now?

				nicky
		the home of eternal damnation, house of
		hades, h.e. double toothpicks...

				angel
		maybe try the opposite of that.

	the angel and two friends laugh and high-five.  nicky's
	confused.

				angel (cont'd)
		okay, can i just ask you something?
		what do you know about your mom?

				nicky
		my brothers told me my mother was a
		mountain goat.  which would explain my
		chronic halitosis.

				angel
			(annoyed)
		a mountain goat?  that's really sweet.

				nicky
		my mom wasn't a goat?

				angel
		try an angel.

				nicky
		an angel?

				angel
		unh-huh.  which would make you half
		angel.

	nicky is floored.

				nicky
		wow.  what...what did she look like?

				angel
		well, she was about six-three, only
		spoke portuguese and had really long
		grey hair.

	the girls start laughing.

				angel (cont'd)
		i'm sorry, i'm totally busting on you.
		i'm your mom.

	nicky is even more floored.  flash.  jenna has taken a
	picture of nicky.

				jenna
		i'm sorry, but you just had the sweetest
		look on your face.

				christa
		you're gonna be so happy she did that.

				nicky
			(stunned)
		how come you're not older?

				angel
		angels don't get any older, son.

				jenna
		i can't believe you just called him
		"son."

				angel
		oh my g-d.  this is so wild.

	they laugh.  nicky is quite baffled.
