	int. basketball arena - day

	as the ref taunts the crowd, a fan wearing a globetrotter's
	shirt yells out.

				globetrotter fan
		get your head out your ass, ref!  the
		kids came to see the globetrotters win.

				ref
		oh, so you wanna lip off to me?
		unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth
		in the globetrotter's shirt.  take ten
		points off for the globetrotters.

	the globetrotter's score on the board goes from 46 to 36.

	on stands

	the kids are crying.

	on court

	the halftime buzzer sounds.  the globetrotters walk off the
	court.  the crowd boos.

		in all my years of basketball, i was
		never so happy to hear a halftime
		buzzer.  folk, i'm afraid if the second
		half doesn't get any better, i expect a
		full scale riot.

	a spotlight points to an announcer at mid-court.

				court announcer
		it's time for the globetrotter's
		halftime half-court heave throw, where
		one lucky fan will have a shot at ten
		thousand dollars!

	a brick lands at the announcer's feet.

				court announcer (cont'd)
		and if he makes it, everyone in
		attendance today will receive a free
		pizza.
