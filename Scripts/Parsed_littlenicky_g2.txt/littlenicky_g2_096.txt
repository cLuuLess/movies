	ext. new hell rally - night

	the bad people realize they've been tricked into being bad
	and they get scared.
	the preacher, who is now more battered from his fall through
	the plate glass window (ask steve), yells out.

				preacher
		we really are gonna die!

	this kicks off a frenzy of the scared bad people trying to
	run away.  but they are stopped and herded back by demons.
