	ext. new hell rally - night

	nicky looks up to see adrian flying down towards him.  nicky
	rolls away at the last second.  adrian hits the bed hard and
	bounces up.  nicky grabs him mid-bounce and slams him back
	down into the golden/brass headboard of the bed.  nicky holds
	out the flask.

				nicky
		now i'm asking you nicely, get in the
		flas...

	adrian grabs a pillow and hits nicky hard in the face,
	sending him flying off the bed.

				nicky (cont'd)
		oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?!

	nicky is an expert pillow fighter.  he lands a series of
	awesome, almost matrix-like pillow moves.  adrian is dazed.

	nicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air
	to him.  adrian looks up to catch it and just before it
	lands, nicky steps up and pops him in the face.  adrian goes
	down hard.  nicky towers over him.

				nicky (cont'd)
		now will you get in the flask?

				adrian
		absolutely not.

	adrian turns to his demons.

				adrian (cont'd)
		a little help over here.

	a bunch of demons advance.

	on flagpole

	we see henry winkler, swollen with bee stings, valiantly run
	over and lowers the five from the flagpoles.

	on adrian

	he looks up and glares at henry.

				adrian (cont'd)
		henry!

	on flagpole

	henry's eyes widen.

				henry winkler
		oh no.

	he is covered in bees again.

	back on adrian

	he turns his attention back to nicky who is grabbed by
	demons.  adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't
	open his mouth.

	adrian pinches nicky's nose closed so he has to open his
	mouth.

				adrian
		goodbye, nicky.

	we hear cassius banging against the walls.

				cassius (o.s.)
		come on in, bro.

	nicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth.  adrian jams
	the flask in his mouth and nicky starts to get sucked in.
	adrian smiles.  but just before nicky is gone, he manages to
	grab adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him.

	as the flask hits the ground, we hear:

				cassius (o.s.) (cont'd)
		thank you, nicky.  cause now i'm gonna
		bust adrian's head wide open.

				adrian (o.s.)
		i was going to let you out, eventually,
		cassius.  i swear.

				nicky (o.s.)
		sole ruler of hell and earth is what i
		heard him keep saying.

	we hear the sounds of a struggle.

	all the demons and all the people of new york form a large
	circle around the flask.  valerie and the gang make it down
	off the stage.

	we hear crazy sounds as the flask starts to jump.  the crowd
	reacts.  a big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a
	horrible thud.

				valerie
		nicky!

				nicky (o.s.)
		that was cassius!

	the flask starts rolling over and over on the road.  people
	get out of the way as if it were real people fighting in the
	street.  they root for their side.

				demon
		kill him, adrian.

	john and peter start beating up the demon.
