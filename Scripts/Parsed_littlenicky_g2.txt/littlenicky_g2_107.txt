	ext. central park pond shore - night

	nicky dissolves into walking.  he checks his pocket to see
	the ball.  he looks up to see fifteen demons marching towards
	him, ready to attack.  nicky closes his eyes and
	concentrates.

				nicky
		release...the good.

	when he opens them, beautiful butterflies are floating around
	the head of five of the demons.  they stop approaching.
	their eyes turn from white back to normal.  and their facial
	expression changes to happiness.  they wave at the
	butterflies.

	angle on

	more demons keep closing.

				nicky (cont'd)
		release the good...

	five more are stopped by something.  they look down and see
	fluffy white bunny rabbits at their feet.  they start petting
	them.

	the remaining demons advance on nicky.

				nicky (cont'd)
		release the awesome.

	...then stop, their path blocked by a very large bucket of
	popeye's fried chicken.  the demons consider the bucket of
	chicken.  one demon takes out a piece.

				nicky (cont'd)
		put it in your mouth and let it slide
		down your throat-hole.

	the demon bites into it.  he can't help but grin a little.

				demon
		popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

	the other souls dig into the bucket.
