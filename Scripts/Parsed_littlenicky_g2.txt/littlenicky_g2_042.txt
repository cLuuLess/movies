		what an odd game, folks.  the powerhouse
		85-0 harlem globetrotters, who normal
		run circles around the 0-85 nationals,
		seem to be struggling to find their
		groove in front of their hometown fans.

	a globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player, who
	makes a fancy pass to cornrows who starts doing some vintage
	globetrotters fancy dribbling.  the ref blows the whistle and
	makes the travelling signal.

				ref
		he's walking, get him a bus!

				bill walton
		oh, another awful call.  there is no way
		that was travelling.

	ref takes ball from cornrows, who gets in the ref's face.

				cornrows
		what's with all these crazy calls?  you
		gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a
		game in 53 years.

				ref
		technical foul!

	ref snaps just like cassius in the players' face.

				nicky
		that guy in the striped shirt snaps his
		fingers like someone i know...

	on tv

	the ref mind wrestles four globetrotters to simultaneously
	slam their heads on the scorers table again and again.

	on todd and nicky

				nicky (cont'd)
		it looks like the work of a brother...

				todd
		a black guy?

				nicky
		if it's cassius, yes.

	nicky races for the door.
