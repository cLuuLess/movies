	int. nicky's room - day

	looks like an american teenager's room - models, a dresser,
	heavy metal posters (tons of ozzy stuff) everywhere (but no
	bed - devils don't sleep).  nicky is air guitaring to the
	song.  over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled
	"nicky's monster metal mix."

	the head demon, jimmy the demon, opens the door, scaring
	nicky who falls backward into the table, breaking it.

		rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
