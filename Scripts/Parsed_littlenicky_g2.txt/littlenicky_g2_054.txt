	int. apartment - later

	pan up from popeye's laying everywhere.  everyone's laughing
	hard.

				john
		come on.  one more time.

				nicky
		not again, fellas.  it kind of hurts.

				peter
		please.  you got to.

				nicky
			(resigned)
		all right...

	nicky loosens up his neck and makes his head go around 360
	degrees.  everyone cracks up, high fives.  even todd laughs.
	pan over to beefy, who has bloodshot eyes.

				beefy
		i used to get baked like this with my
		first girlfriend, heather.  we'd get so
		stoned she would forget i was a dog.

				john
		she was human?

				beefy
		actually, she was a sewer rat.  man,
		that pissed my parents off.

				john
		i dated a japanese girl once.  my
		parents disapproved.  not cause she's
		japanese, but cause she was only
		fifteen.

				nicky
		i'm only fifteen...thousand years old.

	everyone cracks up.

				todd
		i was in love one time but she said i
		wasn't financially reliable enough.  and
		she needed that.

				john
		by she, do you mean he?

				todd
		no.

				beefy
		busted.
			(laughs)

				peter
		how you feelin' over there, satan abdul
		jabar?

				nicky
		a little strange.  i can't stop thinking
		about this girl, valerie.

				todd
		why?  did she hurt you?  do you miss
		her?  need a shoulder to cry on?

				john
		easy, liberace.

				todd
		oh, would you grow up.

				nicky
		we had the greatest afternoon of my life
		until adrian made me tell her she had a
		heart-shaped ass.

				beefy
		maybe you love her.  but what do i know?
		i'm baked out of my mind.

				peter
		me, too.  we're gonna get going.

				todd
		you guys want to stay?  i have a futon
		in my bedroom.

				john
		that's a big pass, elton john.

				peter
		we're going to see ozzy play at the
		meadowlands, right now.  wanna come,
		nicky?

				nicky
		no thanks.  i'm afraid i wouldn't be
		able to give ozzy the focus he deserves.

				john
		whoa, that chick must be the real deal,
		then.  later on.

				nicky
		see ya, fellas.

	they leave.

				beefy (o.s.)
		you better snap out of it soon, kid.
		cause we're going after adrian tomorrow.
		seven am.  nighty, night.

	he falls asleep and starts snoring.  we hear the sound of
	three little girls singing "ring around the rosie" as he
	exhales.

				todd
		that is the most frightening thing i
		have ever seen.

	nicky stands and moves to the window.  he looks out longingly
	over the sleeping city... achingly.  rack focus behind him,
	we see todd nodding encouragingly in the reflection.

				nicky
		todd.  which way to the parson's school
		of design?
