      frank shrugs. suddenly one of the monitors aligns itself,
      and livingston presses play.

      overhead security-cam view of the vault corridor: the
      three uzi guards stand idly, on duty. and of the vault
      itself: yen trying to get out of the cash cart.


      on monitor b

      overhead security-cam view of the vault corridor: the
      three uzi guards stand idly, on duty... and in totally
