262   ext. mccarren airport - night                               262

      as the white van arrives at a charter airline's entrance,
      the five sedans converge upon it, tires screeching, goons
      emerging, weapons drawn.

                              head goon
                get out of the van, now!   now!

      no response within the van. the head goon signals and
      the others shoot the van's tires.

                                                               136.
