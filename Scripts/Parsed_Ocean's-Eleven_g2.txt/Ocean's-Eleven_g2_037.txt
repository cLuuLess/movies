     along one wall, a buffet table has been set up, and while
     virgil and turk pile shrimp onto plates, saul pockets an
     orange for later.

                                turk
                  you make it out to utah much,
                  saul?

                                saul
                         (last man you'd see
                          in the tabernacle)
                  not as much as i'd like.

                                 turk
                  you should.   you'd like it.   you'd
                  like provo.

                                virgil
                         (scarfing a jumbo
                          shrimp)
                  anybody see the salsa goes with
                  this?

     at the wet bar, basher mixes a drink for livingston; on a
     couch, yen balances coffee-table ornaments into a
     skyscraper, to frank's astonishment. in a corner, off on
     his own, linus watches the company, his eyes narrowing,
     wary. until...

                                  danny (o.s.)
                  gentlemen:    welcome to las vegas.

     danny stands at the top of the stairs leading into the
     room, flanked by rusty and tishkoff. he starts down...

                                 danny
                  everybody eaten? good. everybody
                  sober? close enough. most of you
                  know each other already. you
                  probably haven't met linus
                  caldwell before, he's bobby's kid
                  outta chicago.

     linus trades nods around the room.

                                danny
                  okay. before we start, nobody's
                  on the line here yet. what i'm
                  about to propose to you happens to
                  be both highly lucrative and
                  highly dangerous. if that doesn't
                  sound like your particular brand
                  of vodka, help yourself to as
                  much food as you like and safe
                  journey. no hard feelings.
                         (pauses, soberly)
                  otherwise, come with me.

     he turns and walks out of the living room, into another.
     rusty is close behind; he turns briefly, casts an eye
     over the assembled and keeps going. the guys look each
     other over, sizing things up.

                                   basher
                  what the hell.

     and he follows, along with frank and livingston. then
     virgil, turk and yen. then saul. that leaves linus,
     watching the line of men disappear. he turns to find
     tishkoff by his side, staring at him.

                                   linus
                  hi.

                                tishkoff
                  you're bobby caldwell's kid, huh?

                                   linus
                  yeah.

                                   tishkoff
                  from chicago?

                                   linus
                  yeah.

                                tishkoff
                  it's nice there. you like it?

                                   linus
                  yeah.

                                tishkoff
                  that's wonderful. get in the
                  goddamn room.
