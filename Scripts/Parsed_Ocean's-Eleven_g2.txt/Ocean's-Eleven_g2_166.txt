       danny and linus pry open the elevator doors and squeeze
       out. just beyond the next doorway stand...

       ... three uzi-carrying guards, hovering outside the vault
       door and wondering what the hell just happened to the
       lights.

       yen continues to push up on the cash cart lid, and the
       more he pushes, the more saul's briefcase slides off.
       yen stretches his hand out to grab it, but it's slid
       beyond his reach, to the edge of falling.

       the uzi-carrying guards turn their backs to the elevator
       shaft...

       ... and linus and danny appear in the doorway; they both
       snap gas pellets and slide them into the corridor.

       linus and danny wait, danny silently mouthing a three-
       count before... thud, thud, thud. they peer around the
       corridor to find...

       all three uzi-carrying guards lie unconscious on the
       ground. linus starts in, danny holds him back...

                                   danny
                    not yet.

                    okay.
