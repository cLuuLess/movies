264   int. vault corridor                                             264

      the vault elevator doors open and terry benedict makes
      his way into his smoke-filled vault corridor. he passes
      the uzi guards, awake now and stumbling to the elevator
      with swat members' assistance, then arrives before his
      decimated vault: anything within -- people, money, lyman
      zerga's emeralds -- could only have been destroyed.


      over swat leader's shoulder

      as he approaches benedict.

                              swat leader
                mr. benedict...

                              benedict
                yes.

                              swat leader
                we couldn't find any survivors.
                or, i'm afraid, any of your money.
                i'm sorry, sir.

                              benedict
                       (doesn't want to hear
                        anymore; the swat
                        team failed him)
                take your men out now.

      hold on benedict, seething, as the swat leader steps
      away...

                              swat leader
                okay, guys, grab your gear and
                clear out.

                              benedict
                       (into walkie-talkie he
                        has with him)
                walsh: how are we with the van?
