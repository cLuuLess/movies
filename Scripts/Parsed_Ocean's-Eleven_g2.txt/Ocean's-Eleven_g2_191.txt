      tess and rusty hold a stare as rusty holds the phone.

                                 tess
                where's danny?

                              rusty
                he's fine. he wants you to go
                upstairs, and watch tv.

                              tess
                       (a little pissed)
                he does?

                              benedict (v.o.)
                you have a deal.

                              rusty
                it's alright, tess. i promise.
                       (back on phone)
                good. here's what you do. five
                minutes from now, the men in the
                vault are going to deposit six
                bags in the vault elevator.

      tess isn't sure what to do. as rusty continues on the
      phone, she backs off, debating: can she blow the whistle
      on her ex?
