      linus half-nods in response, and benedict notices.
      suspicious of the young man, he decides to test him.

                                 benedict
                   you new at the commission?

                                 linus
                   been there about two years.

                                 benedict

                                  linus
                          (a pause; will he
                           pass?)
                   not since he died last year.

      he passes.    the pit boss returns with frank in tow.

                                 benedict
                   mr. escalante. would you come
                   with us, please?

                   i think it's better if we talked
                   off the floor.

      linus and benedict lead frank away.       as they pass an
      elevator...

      ... its doors open, revealing turk and virgil, dressed
      now as security guards, pushing out the false-lid cash
      cart. they leave behind a pile of dishes, waiter
      uniforms, a tablecloth.
