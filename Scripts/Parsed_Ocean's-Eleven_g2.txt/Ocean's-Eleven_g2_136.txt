178   int. interrogation room - 06:36                                   178

      danny sits opposite two plainclothes goons in absolute
      silence, waiting.

                              danny
                how much longer do you think mr.
                benedict will be?

                              goon #1
                just a few minutes more.

      he scans the room.

                              danny
                no cameras in this room, huh?
                don't want anyone seeing what
                happens here?

      the goons say nothing.   danny checks his watch.

                              danny
                he's not coming, is he?

      the goons look at each other; danny has called their
      bluff.

                               danny
                who is?

      there's a knock at the door, and the goons smile:
      danny's about to find out who. one goon rises to usher
      in...

      ... the bruiser, come to beat the shit out of danny
      ocean. the guy's at least six-six, three hundred pounds,
      but it's not his size that draws attention, it's his
      teeth...

                                                      (continued)

      ocean's 11 - rev. 10/24/00                            111.

      ... or the lack thereof; the bruiser doesn't hold a
      single incisor, molar or bicuspid in his mouth. gum
      city. and there's something really terrifying about the
      sight.

                                 danny
                   i guess mr. benedict didn't like
                   me talking to his girl.

      the goons shake their heads. danny smiles at the
      bruiser, and the bruiser snarls back, showing off those
      gums. he rolls up his shirtsleeves, itching to tear a
      hole in this man. the goons head for the door.

                                 goon #1
                   we're gonna step outside now.
                   leave you two alone to talk things
                   over.

      the goons exit. danny and the bruiser face off. and as
      danny opens his mouth to speak, bruiser's fist flashes
      out and knocks him down. danny rises, wiping a little
      blood from his lip.

                                 danny
                   jesus, bruiser, not 'til later.

                                   bruiser
                   sorry, danny.    i -- i forgot.

                                   danny
                   s'okay.
                          (shaking it off)
                   how's the wife?

                                 bruiser
                   pregnant again.

                                 danny
                   then we better get to work.


179   outside interrogation room                                   179

      standing guard outside, the goons hear punches and groans
      from inside as...
