       as danny checks his batteries (the types with built-in
       power meters: both at zero percent), linus ransacks the
       uzi-carrying guards' gear for replacements. he finds
       aa's in their flashlights.

                                  linus
                    you know, you lose focus for one
                    second in this game --

                                  danny
                    -- and someone gets hurt, yeah
                    yeah. i don't hear yen complaining.

       he takes the batteries, inserts them in his detonator,
       then slaps the door twice more.

       yen catches his breath on the far end of the room. he
       hears the slap, rolls his eyes, and ducks out of the
       line of fire.

       several muted but powerful blasts.

       linus inches forward, almost dreading this moment,
       pauses...

       linus pulls... and the door opens.
