     a waiter serves coffee to rusty and saul.

                                rusty
                  i thought you drank bloody mary's
                  at the track, saul.

                                saul
                  a man shouldn't drink on the job.

                                rusty
                         (re: race)
                  who we rooting for here?

                                 saul
                  number four.

     there's the bell; the electronic rabbit is released and
     the dogs break out of the gate. from this point on
     saul's eyes never leave the race.

                                saul
                  you gonna ask me? or should i
                  just say no and get it over with?

                                rusty
                  saul, you're the best there is.
                  you're in cooperstown. what do
                  you want?

                                saul
                  nothin'. i got a duplex now, i
                  got wall-to-wall and a goldfish,
                  i'm seeing a nice lady, she works
                  the unmentionables counter at
                  macy's. i've changed.

                                rusty
                  guys like us don't change, saul.
                  we stay sharp or we get sloppy,
                  but we don't change.

                                saul

                                                      (continued)

                                                             31.

     they watch the race.

                                rusty
                  that your hound way in the back
                  there?

                                saul
                  he breaks late. everyone knows
                  this.

     on the track: the dogs are now coming around the back
     stretch, and the crowd on the bleachers rises, cheering.

                                saul
                  you gonna treat me like a grownup
                  at least? tell me what the scam
                  is?

     under the noise: rusty leans in and whispers in saul's
     ear. saul's eyes widen, then glaze over as all around
     him people are standing and shouting.

     rusty places an envelope in saul's lap, then gets up and
     walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish
     line... last by several lengths.

     saul considers his options. in one hand: a fan of
     losing tickets. in the other (courtesy of rusty): a
     ticket to las vegas.

                                danny (v.o.)
                  and saul makes ten.
