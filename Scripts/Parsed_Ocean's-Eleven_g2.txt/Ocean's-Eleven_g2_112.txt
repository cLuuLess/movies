      a white, unmarked van pulls in from the street and races
      up to the curb where saul and benedict wait.

      turk malloy gets out the passenger's side, a briefcase
      handcuffed to his wrist, as virgil comes around from the
      driver's side, both of them dressed in their bodyguard
      suits.

                               turk
                mr. zerga.   a gift from mr. hesse.

      turk extends the briefcase to saul, so that they both
      clasp the handle, as virgil produces a key, unlocks the
      cuff on turk's wrist, transfers it to saul's, clamps it
      shut, and hands saul the key.

                              saul
                thank you, friedrich, gunther.

      he turns, nods to benedict, and they retreat into the
      hotel, the security guards and malloys flanking them.
