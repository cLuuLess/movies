30   ext. reuben tishkoff's back yard - day (present)                30

                                tishkoff
                  but what am i saying? you guys
                  are pros, the best. i'm sure you
                  can make it out of the casino. of
                  course, lest we forget, once
                  you're out the front door, you're
                  still in the middle of the fucking
                  desert!

     both danny and rusty look chastened.

                                rusty
                  you're right.
                         (to danny)
                  he's right.

                                danny
                  reuben, you're right. our eyes
                  are bigger than our stomachs.

                                rusty
                  that's exactly it. pure ego.

                                tishkoff
                  yeah yeah blah blah.

                                danny
                  thank you so much for setting us
                  straight. sorry we bothered you.

     they both rise to go.

                                tishkoff
                  look, we all go way back. i owe
                  you from that thing with the guy
                  in the place, and i'll never
                  forget it.

                                danny
                  it was our pleasure.

                                rusty
                  i'd never been to belize.

                                                       (continued)

                                                               20.

30   continued:                                                      30

                                tishkoff
                  give dominic your addresses, i got
                  some remaindered furniture i wanna
                  send you.

     danny and rusty begin to circle the pool to leave.
     tishkoff, of course, won't let them go that easily.

                                tishkoff
                  just out of curiosity, which
                  casinos did you geniuses pick to
                  rob?

     danny stops, almost as if he's been waiting for this
     question, which of course he has.

                                danny
                  the bellagio, mirage, and the
                  m.g.m. grand.

                                 tishkoff
                         (nostrils flared,
                           smelling a rat)
                  those are terry benedict's
                  casinos.

                                rusty
                  say, you know, he's right.

     tishkoff waves them back, sipping on his umbrellaed
     cocktail.

                                tishkoff
                  you guys... whadda you got against
                  terry benedict?

                                danny
                  what do you have against him?
                  that's the real question.

                                tishkoff
                  he torpedoed my casino, muscled me
                  out, now he's gonna blow it up
                  next month to make way for another
                  fuckin' eyesore. don't think i
                  don't see what you're doin'.

                                rusty
                  what are we doing, reuben?

                                                       (continued)

                                tishkoff
                  you gonna steal from terry
                  benedict, you better goddamn know.
                  this sorta thing used to be
                  civilized. you'd hit a guy, he'd
                  whack you. done. but benedict...
                         (bristles)
                  at the end of this he better not
                  know you're involved, not know
                  your names, or think you're dead.
                  because he'll kill you, and then
                  he'll go to work on you.

                                danny
                  that's why we've got to be very
                  careful. we have to be precise.
                  we have to be well-funded.

                                tishkoff
                  yeah, you gotta be nuts, too. and
                  you're gonna need a crew as nuts
                  as you are.
                         (pregnant silence)
                  who do you have in mind?

     danny and rusty both smile; they've hooked their fish.
     and so it begins...

                                 rusty (v.o.)
                  alright.   who's in?

                                danny (v.o.)
                  frank c. is in.
