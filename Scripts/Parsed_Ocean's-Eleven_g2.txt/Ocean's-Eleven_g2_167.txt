       danny and linus enter, waving the faint remnants of the
       gas from their noses, tiptoeing past the guards' bodies.

                                  linus
                    you think yen made it out okay?

                                  danny
                    i'm sure he's fine.

       saul's briefcase inches closer to falling off the cash cart,
       which of course would trigger the floor sensor and terminate
       this heist here and now. yen's hand stretches farther out to
       grab it, pushing up just a little more on the false lid
       until...

       ... the briefcase tumbles toward the floor...

       ... but not before yen snags the handcuff chain attached to
       it and swings it round. he's got it. that threat over, he
       throws open the cash cart lid and takes the biggest breath
       of his life.

       linus punches in the code for the door to the vault
       anteroom (the one he stole from benedict). he steps back
       as it slides open, revealing --

       -- the vault door:     it is sleek and immense and
       impregnable.

                                  linus
                           (jaw dropping)
                    jesus...

                    there's a chinese man with a
                    hundred sixty million dollars
                    behind that door. let's get him
                    out.

       danny takes a flat hand and slaps the door hard.
