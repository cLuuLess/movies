      the monitors here go black as well.   benedict listens
      closely to the swat frequency.

                              swat frequency (v.o.)
                       (leader's voice)
                first wave, in! second wave, now!
                       (there is running,
                        panting, then linus's
                        voice, distant and
                        panicked)
                guys, someone's here!
                       (leader's voice)
                take him down! now!

      a brief spurt of gunfire, then... barrroooooom!

      dead silence in the eye in the sky. slim stares deep
      into a monitor's dark pitch. then...

                              swat frequency (v.o.)
                       (leader's voice)
                lights! we need power now!

      fat flips the power back on, and on the monitors...

      ... visions of destruction down below... smoke fills the
      vault as two swat members push through it... other swat
      members help evacuate the unconscious guards...

                              benedict
                       (into intercom)
                what's the situation down there?

                              swat leader (v.o.)
                they blew it. they blew the...
                oh, jesus... if there was anyone
                in there, they're not in one piece
                anymore.

                going down there.
                       (as an afterthought,
                         to slim)
