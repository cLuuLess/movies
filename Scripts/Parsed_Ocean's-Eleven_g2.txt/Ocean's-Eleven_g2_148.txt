       danny rips off his jacket and shirt to expose a rappelling
       line wrapped around his torso. linus does the same.

                               linus
                 how'd you get here?

                               danny
                 crawlspace. and i had to give
                 away a couple mil.

                               linus
                 but what about -- i mean, that
                 whole thing with rusty...

       danny just smiles at him.

       earlier that night, just after rusty kicked danny off
       the job. as linus watches from inside, deaf to their
       conversation, blind to their expressions, danny and
       rusty confer.

                               danny
                 you think the kid bought it?

                                rusty
                 hell, i think reuben bought it,
                 and he knew we were screwing
                 around.
                         (beat)
                 you sure about this?

                               danny
                        (nods)
                 bobby caldwell threw me into the
                 pool first time. least i could do
                 is give his kid a push.

                               linus
                 why'd you make me go through all
                 this? why not just tell me?

                               danny
                 well, where's the fun in that?
                        (starting toward
                         elevator shaft
                         ladder)
                 c'mon: yen's got about three
                 minutes of air left.

       danny leads linus down and around the elevator and side-
       by-side they crawl onto the bottom of the elevator,
       gripping the undercarriage of the lift to keep from
       falling. meanwhile, we descend quickly down the shaft,
       just to illustrate how very high up they are.
