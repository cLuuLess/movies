                         takes a breath and
                         cups the phone, then
                         barks at walsh)
                 find out how much money we have
                 down there.

       tess, amid all this chaos, is still curious: how did

                 good-bye.

       danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it's alright
       with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then
       gently kisses it...

       ... as he slips the cell phone into her handbag,
       unnoticed.

                 alright. you've proved your
                 point. you've broken into my
                 vault. congratulations: you're a
                 dead man.

       tess leaves.
