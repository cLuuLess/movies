27   int. flamingo casino floor (1971)                               27

     a hippie races toward the electronic sliding doors,
     clutching a tray full of chips, and as the doors begin to
     part for him -- freeze frame: a billy club appears out
     of nowhere...

                                tishkoff (v.o.)
                  second most successful robbery.
                  the flamingo '71. this guy
                  actually smelled fresh oxygen
                  before they got him.

     resume action: the billy club comes down -- whap! --
     across the hippie's skull and it's chicago '68 all over
     again.

                                tishkoff (v.o.)
                  course, he was breathing out of a
                  hose the next three weeks, goddamn
                  hippie.
