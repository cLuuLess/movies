19   int. library tower - 40th floor corridor - night               19

     lights out on the 40th. engraved brass announces:     j.a.
     kuehn & associates, architects.

     two flashlight beams strafe wood-paneled, elegant
     offices: danny and rusty on late-night reconnaissance.
     as danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints, rusty
     passes the time switching papers from a desk's in box to
     its out box.

     at last, danny finds the right set of blueprints and
     drapes it across the desk; we, however, never see it.

                                danny
                  the vault at the bellagio.

     a beat as rusty scans the document, then another
     underneath it.

                                rusty
                  if i'm reading these right -- and
                  i think that i am -- this is
                  probably the least accessible
                  vault ever designed.
                         (beat)
                  oops. actually, you know what,
                  i'm wrong. it's definitely the
                  least accessible vault ever
                  designed.

                                danny
                  yep.

     rusty's brow furrows just a little.

                                rusty
                  you said three casinos...

                                danny
                         (flips to next
                          blueprint)
                  these feed into the cages at both
                  the mirage and the m.g.m. grand.
                         (tapping vault)
                  but every dime ends up here.

                                rusty
                  the bellagio, mirage, and... these
                  are terry benedict's places.

                                   danny
                  yes, they are.     think he'll mind?

                                rusty
                  more than somewhat.


20   at 40th floor elevator bay                                        20

     no ding. the elevator just arrives. its doors part to
     reveal a security guard within, here to make his tour; a
     large fellow, he has to duck to exit.


21   back with danny and rusty                                         21

     as danny rolls up the set of blueprints, rusty considers
     the plan (which, in our absence, danny has pitched him).

                                rusty
                  you'd need at least a dozen guys,
                  doing a combination of cons.

                                danny
                  like what, you think?

                                rusty
                  well, off the top of my head, i'd
                  say you're looking at a boesky, a
                  jim brown, a miss daisy, two
                  jethros, and a leon spinks. oh,
                  and the biggest ella fitzgerald
                  ever.
                         (beat)
                  where do you think you're gonna get
                  the money to back this?

                                danny
                  as long as we're hitting these
                  three casinos, we'll get our
                  bankroll. terry benedict has a
                  list of enemies.

                                rusty
                  but does he have enemies with
                  loose cash and nothing to lose...
                         (smiles, realizing)
                  aha.

                                   danny
                            (smiles, too)
                  aha.

22   moving with security guard                                      22

     as he approaches danny's and rusty's voices...

23   back with danny and rusty                                       23

                                   danny
                  so...

                                rusty
                  so, here's what i think: you
                  should take this plan, kick it
                  around for a week or two. sleep
                  on it. turn it over in your head.
                  then: never bring it up to me
                  again.

                                  danny
                  uh-huh.    so what are you saying?

                                rusty
                  i'm saying: this is like trying
                  to build a house of cards on the
                  deck of a speeding boat.

                                danny
                  really? i thought it was much
                  harder than that --

     suddenly the security guard's flashlight beam hits them
     square in the eyes. danny and rusty put their hands up
     to block the light.

                                danny
                  jesus, oscar, lower it a little,
                  will ya?

                                   security guard
                  sorry.
                         (lowers beam)
                  you two done up here?    find what
                  you wanted?

                                danny
                  yeah, thanks. you mind if we
                  borrow a couple drawings for the
                  night? make some copies.

                                security guard
                  whatever you need.

     danny withdraws his money clip, peels off a couple
     hundreds, and buries them in the security guard's hand.

                                   danny
                  'preciate it.


24   at 40th floor elevator bay                                      24

     danny and rusty wait for an elevator. when its doors
     open, rusty stops danny from boarding.

                                rusty
                  i need a reason. and don't say
                  money.
                         (beat)
                  why do this?

                                   danny
                  why not do it?

     rusty stares at him:    enough bullshitting around.

                                danny
                  because yesterday i walked out of
                  the joint wearing my entire
                  wardrobe and you're colddecking
                  teenbeat coverboys.
                         (beat)
                  because the house always wins.
                  you play long enough, never
                  changing stakes, the house takes
                  you. unless, when that special
                  hand comes around, you bet big.
                  and then you take the house.

     a beat.   rusty smiles.

                  you're been practicing that
                  speech, haven't you?

                                danny
                  a little. did i rush it?   it felt
                  like i rushed it.

                                rusty
                  no, it was good.

     they step aboard the elevator.     as the door closes:

                                rusty
                  i wonder what reuben will say?

     danny and rusty look at each other.

                                tishkoff (v.o.)
                  you're out of your goddamn minds.
