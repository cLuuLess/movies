8   int. lounge at grand                                          8

    danny checks his watch -- 12:58 -- then the lounge around
    him: prison had more nightlife. he nurses a bourbon,
    folds back the new york times and scans.

    his eyes move down the page and stop at a header --
    "vegas' paradiso to be razed; former owner denounces
    plans" -- accompanied by two photographs...

    the first: tan, well-coiffed developer and new owner of
    the paradiso, terry benedict, with a beautiful (if barely
    visible) woman on his arm. the second: scowling former
    owner, reuben tishkoff.

                               frank (o.s.)
                 catching up on current events?

    danny lowers the paper; frank is sitting across from him,
    changed out of his dealer's threads.

                               danny
                 ramon?

                               frank
                 glad to meet you. frank catton
                 wouldn't get by the gaming board.
                        (beat)
                 you just out?

                               danny
                 this afternoon.

                               frank
                        (re: danny's drink
                         and whereabouts)
                 and already turning over a new
                 leaf.

    frank signals a passing waitress; she ignores him.

                               danny
                        (directly, this is
                         why he's here)
                 you seen him?

                               frank
                 last i heard he was in l.a.
                 teaching movie stars how to
                 play cards.
                        (beat)
                 why? you don't have something
                 planned already?

                                danny
                 you kidding? i just became a
                 citizen again.

    frank stares at danny a moment, finally catches his eye,
    and danny can't help but grin: of course he has.
