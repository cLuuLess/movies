42   int. under big top - day                                    42

     the chinese national circus, currently on tour in the
     western united states. trapeze artists, gymnastic teams,
     and trampoline daredevils fly, somersault, spin, and
     swing through the air.

     a full house applauds every feat. danny and rusty sit in
     the bleachers, surrounded by parents and kids munching on
     spindles of cotton candy. tough guys in toyland.

                             announcer (v.o.)
                      (in chinese, then
                       english)
               ladies and gentlemen: the amazing
               yen.

     a funambulist (yen) begins his high-wire act...

                             danny
               so he can walk on a rope.

                             rusty
               more than that.

                             danny
               so he can juggle. we need a
               grease man, not an acrobat. who
               else is on the list?

                             rusty
               he is the list.

                                                   (continued)

                                  danny
                  who else?

                                  rusty
                  watch.

     halfway across the wire, the funambulist sits. and very
     slowly, but without hesitation, he contorts himself into
     a ball, never losing his balance. even danny is
     impressed.

                                rusty
                  there's your grease man.
