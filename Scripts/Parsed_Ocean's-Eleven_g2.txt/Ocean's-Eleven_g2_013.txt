25   ext. tishkoff's opulent back yard (las vegas) - day             25

     reuben tishkoff, the grimace of a man in mid-movement,
     forever cemented on his face, scrutinizes his two lunch
     guests (danny and rusty) at his poolside.

                                 tishkoff
                  are you listening to me? you are,
                  both of you, nuts. i know more
                  about casino security than any man
                  alive. i invented it, and it
                  cannot be beaten. they got
                  cameras, they got watchers, they
                  got locks, they got timers, they
                  got vaults. they got enough armed
                  personnel to occupy paris. okay,
                  bad example...

                  it's never been tried.

                                 tishkoff
                  oh, it's been tried. a few guys
                  even came close. you know the
                  three most successful robberies in
                  vegas history?

     he takes almost three steps before five security men leap
     at him and -- freeze frame on his wide-eyed expression of
     horror...

                  sands. he got two steps closer to

                  before him.
