229   int. mgm grand garden arena                                    229

      moving with benedict and tess, pushing their way out
      through the crowd. a phone is ringing nearby... again
      and again...

                               benedict
                 you gonna answer it?

                               tess
                 i don't have a cell phone.

      they keep moving, but the ring pursues them. finally,
      benedict stops, pulls tess's purse from her shoulder and
      opens it: inside, he finds a cell phone, ringing.

                                  tess
                 it isn't mine.

                               benedict
                 see who's on the other end.

      she takes the phone, activates it.

                                  tess
                 hello?

                               rusty (v.o.)
                 may i have a word with mr.
                 benedict, please?

      tess looks up, confused.

                                  tess
                 it's for you.

      benedict takes the phone.

                               benedict
                 who the hell is this?


      on rusty

      in the distance, at the arena's exit, unseen by benedict
      or tess, on the phone...

                               rusty
                 the man who's robbing you.

                                                            126.
