      and counting. benedict exits the casino manager's office
      with linus and frank. benedict hails two guards...

                              benedict
                please show this man off the
                premises.
                       (to frank)
                don't step foot in my casino
                again.

                               frank
                       (as he's led away,
                         over his shoulder,
                         to linus)
                cracker.

      benedict checks his watch again:    he's really running
      late.

                              benedict
                mr. wills, if you don't mind...
                       (as linus forgets
                        to respond)
                mr. wills?

                               linus
                of course.

      they start toward the exit.   but halfway there...

                               linus
                my beeper.   i'm sorry.   i forgot
                it.

      benedict hesitates: he's in an enormous hurry now, he's
      behind schedule -- he hates being behind schedule -- but
      leaving even a member of the gaming commission alone in
      his cage is a security risk. one glace at the cameras
      all about and he decides to risk it.

                              benedict
                you know how to get back out?

                               linus
                of course.   enjoy the fight.

                              benedict
                       (shaking his hand,
                        then hurrying away)
                thank you.

      linus smiles after him, withdrawing the page of
      combinations he lifted off the man.
