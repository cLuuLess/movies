      walsh mouths to benedict: "swat team is here."   benedict
      nods and throws him a thumbs-up.

                                 benedict
                   sir, i have complied with your
                   every request, would you agree?

                                  rusty (v.o.)
                   i would.

                                  benedict
                   good.   now i have one of my own.

                                  rusty (v.o.)
                   yes?

                                 benedict
                          (at last, his venom
                           released)
                   run and hide. if you get picked
                   up next week buying a $100,000
                   sports car in newport beach, i'll
                   be supremely disappointed.
                   because i want my people to find
                   you. and rest assured: when they
                   do, they won't hand you over to
                   the police.
                          (beat)
                   run and hide. that's all i ask.

      and during the above rant by benedict, we view...

       now empty, livingston's monitors still displaying the
       masked men in the vault.


251    white van                                                       251

       navigating the streets of las vegas.


252    five sedans                                                     252

       tailing the van, security goons piled into each, and
       maybe we notice (or maybe not) the rolls-royce tailing
       them.

       pacing in benedict's suite, biting her nails, debating
       whether to blow the whistle on danny. on tv: a newscast
       of the contentious aftermath of the prize fight.

       bound and unarmed, unconscious to the activity within the
       vault.

       opened and unmanned.

       listens -- the line has gone dead.   he hangs up.

                   our guys say the van is headed
                   toward mccarren airport.

                                 benedict
                   get everyone in position. i want
                   my vault back before that van hits
                   the tarmac.


       longer montage now, cutting between:

       (six in all) hustling through the cage corridors, armed
       to the teeth, with body armor and helmets and vision
       guards: they're as faceless as storm troopers.

       as it approaches mccarren airport.

       the three masked men pace beside the booby-trapped money.

                          (on second
                           inspection)
                   where's zerga?
                          (off walsh's sheepish
                           look)
                   mr. zerga? with the briefcase?

                                 walsh
                   he's -- he died.

       benedict shoots him a slow, sideways glance.

       rappelling down the elevator shaft -- its ultraviolet
       sensors turned off by walsh -- then moving into
       position...
