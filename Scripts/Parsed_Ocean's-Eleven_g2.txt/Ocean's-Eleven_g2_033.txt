51   int. union station - evening                                   51

     the hurly-burly of rush hour in union station.

     commuters zig and zag, this way and that, all on furious
     schedules, and linus slips blithely through them, in no
     hurry, a man who's pulled this job a thousand times
     before.

     he dodges and sidesteps crazed commuters, and except for
     a brief brush with one well-dressed man (the sun-times
     tucked under his arm), he escapes the station without
     incident.
