      blip -- out go the infrared sensors.

                                 danny
                 now!

      and he and linus lean forward and fall...


203   hurtling with danny and linus                                 203

      down the elevator shaft.

      upside down, heads curled, and all we hear is the whoosh
      of their bodies in motion and the whirl of their cords
      uncoiling.

                                                     (continued)

                   ... six, seven.....

      and now, looking straight down, the ground is rising up
      fast to meet them, a flat slab of gray concrete -- fifty
      feet, forty feet, thirty feet, twenty...

                                 basher
                   ... eight, nine...

      and snap -- the cords reach their full extension, and
      danny and linus bounce up, watching the floor recede.

                                 linus
                   aaaaahhhhh!
