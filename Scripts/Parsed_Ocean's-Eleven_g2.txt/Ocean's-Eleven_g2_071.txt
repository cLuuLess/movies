     saul, as lyman zerga, makes as low-profile an entrance
     into the bellagio as he can with bodyguards preceding and
     trailing him. he approaches a v.i.p concierge...

                             v.i.p. concierge
               good afternoon, sir. how can i be
               of service?

                   my name is lyman zerga.   i'd like
                   a suite, please.

                                 v.i.p. concierge
                   do you have a reservation with us?

                                 saul
                          (long glare at him)
                   i don't make reservations.

      a longer glance at lyman's bodyguards tells the concierge
      this is not a man to be denied. as he jumps to it...

      outside a restaurant's entrance, rusty and linus sit
      before two slot machines, idly dropping in quarters as
      they watch saul receive the royal treatment.

                                  rusty
                   okay.   tell me about benedict.

                                 linus
                   the guy is a machine.
