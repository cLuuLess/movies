      the seller exits with the aide-de-camp in tow. benedict
      remains, enthralled by the painting. tess appears beside
      him.

                                  tess
                   you like it?

                                 benedict
                   i like that you like it.
                          (beat)
                   i have some bad news from the
                   world of high fashion. it seems
                   mike tyson will be wearing red on
                   saturday night. red trunks with a
                   white stripe.

                                  tess
                   oh?

                                                       (continued)

                                 benedict
                   and you, as i recall, will be
                   wearing a red donna karan? and
                   when the tv cameras pick us up in
                   the front row, that red dress...

                                   tess
                   i see.

                                 benedict
                   he's a charming man, but no one's
                   going to be watching him when they
                   can make a study of you. i've
                   asked paolo to find three or four
                   things for you to try. i hope
                   you're not too disappointed.

      she is, but she buries it.

                                   benedict
                   are you sure?

      she nods, smiles faintly.

                                 benedict
                   i'll see you tonight.

      instinctively she leans in to kiss him.        he recoils ever
      so slightly.

                                   tess
                   what?    we're alone.

      he lets his eyes wander along the length of the ceiling,
      over all the eye-in-the-sky cameras hidden there. she
      follows his look.

                                 benedict
                   in my hotels, there's always
                   someone watching.

      but he kisses her anyway.

                                 tess
                   i'll see you tonight.

      he glances once more on the picasso as he moves away.

                                 benedict
                   actually, i do like it.

      and tess remains, thinking:         he's rich, he's handsome and
      wooing, but is she happy?
