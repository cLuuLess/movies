112   ext. paradiso hotel (on strip) - day                        112

      just down the block from the terry benedict trinity
      stands (for a few remaining moments) the edifice of the
      paradiso, reuben tishkoff's bankrupted hotel-casino.

      a crowd has gathered to witness its destruction: terry
      benedict, for one, his finger on the button and his face
      in the spotlight; tess another, standing (near)by her
      man; danny, too, hidden within the masses, eyes fixed on
      his ex; and linus, who keeps a steady bead on danny.

                              reporter
                ... and here's reuben tishkoff,
                former owner of the paradiso, come
                to bid farewell to his fabled
                resort and wish terry benedict all
                the best with his future plans for
                the property...

      terry greets reuben before the tv cameras and newspaper
      reporters, and everyone's smiling and shaking hands, but
      behind those smiles and under their breaths...

                              benedict
                good to see you.

                              reuben
                go shit in your mouth.

      tess, her eyes roaming the crowd, finds a pair staring
      back at her: danny's. she holds his glance a moment --
      long enough for both linus and benedict to notice --
      before turning away, to...

      ... benedict, who puts his public smile back on and steps
      up to a podium alongside mike tyson and lennox lewis, and
      together they all put their hands on "the plunger" and
      benedict leans into a microphone...

                              benedict
                i hope there's as much dynamite in
                the paradiso as there will be in
                this saturday's fight.

      ... and -- whoomph -- the plunger comes down and -- write
      your own onomatopoeia here -- the paradiso implodes.
      reuben wipes a tear from his eye.

                              reuben
                g'bye, honey...
