     rusty and linus watch the entrance:    no one enters.

                             linus
               give him another ten seconds.

     around the corner comes benedict, carrying his black
     portfolio.

                              linus
               as i said:   a machine.

                             rusty
               and that portfolio contains the
               codes to all the cage doors?

                                linus
                  two minutes after they've been
                  changed, he's got 'em in hand.
                         (beat)
                  i'll tell you: you guys picked
                  a helluva target. he is as smart
                  and ruthless as they come. the
                  last guy caught cheating here,
                  benedict not only sent him up for
                  ten years, he got the bank to
                  seize the guy's home and
                  bankrupted --

                                rusty
                  -- his brother-in-law's tractor
                  dealership, i heard.

                                linus
                  he doesn't just go after your
                  knees, he goes after your
                  livelihood. and everyone-you-
                  ever-met's livelihood.

                                  rusty
                  you scared?

                                  linus
                  you suicidal?

                                rusty
                  only in the morning.
                         (beat)
                  now what?

                                linus
                  now comes the girl... if she comes
                  in after he does, that means
                  they're in a snit.

                                rusty
                  where's she come from?

                                linus
                  the museum downstairs. she's the
                  curator there. wait... here she
                  is. you'll like this.

     rusty looks up as...

     ... a beautiful woman (the one danny saw on benedict's
     arm in the new york times photo) appears. elegantly
     dressed, a knockout, she moves very much in her own
     private space. and rusty's face just about drops at the
     sight of her.

                  i don't know if we can use her
                  yet. i haven't even caught her
                  name.

                                rusty

                  what?

                                 rusty
                         (looks very certain
                          about this, very
                          certain and very
                          upset)
                  her name is tess.
