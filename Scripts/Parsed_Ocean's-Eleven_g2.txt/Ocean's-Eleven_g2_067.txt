88   ext. billy tim's van and truck dealership - office - day         88

     outside a window: turk and virgil jump up and down on
     opposite bumpers of a van, testing its durability.

     inside, frank negotiates with billy tim, a cal-
     worthingtonesque redneck car dealer, who half-pays
     attention to him, half-frets over the malloys outside.

                                billy tim
                  i'm sorry: eighteen-five each is
                  the best offer i can make you.

                                frank
                         (playing a bit of
                          a dandy)
                  oh, i understand perfectly. they
                  are beautiful vans. well, i thank
                  you for your time, mister...?

                  denham.   billy tim denham.

                                frank
                  yes, denham, like a jean.
                         (they shake)
                  you know: you have lovely hands
                  -- do you moisturize?

                                 billy tim
                  i'm sorry?

                                                        (continued)

     frank's not letting go of the man's hand, the object now
     is to force billy tim into lowering his price just to get
     frank out of his office.

                                frank
                  i swear by it. i try all sorts of
                  lotions. i went through a
                  fragrance-free period last year,
                  but now i'm liking this new brand
                  fortified with rose hip. my
                  sister, you know, she uses the
                  aloe vera with the sun screen
                  built in...

                                billy tim
                         (just can't get
                          his hand back)
                  uh-huh. you said you'd be willing
                  to pay in cash?

                                frank
                  i did. you know: they say
                  cinnamon is wonderful for your
                  pores. read that on the internet.
                  and that ideally you should be
                  wearing gloves to bed, but i find
                  that would interfere with my
                  social agenda. problem is: i get
                  a reaction to camphor so i can't
                  use traditional remedies...

                                billy tim
                  if you could pay cash, i could
                  probably drop the price a little.
                  to, say, seventeen...
                         (as frank squeezes
                          a little)
                  ... sixteen each.

                                frank
                         (big smile)
                  that would be lovely.
