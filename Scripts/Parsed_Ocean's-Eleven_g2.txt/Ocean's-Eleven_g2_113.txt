      frank deals blackjack to a full table. his eyes gaze
      past his players to saul, the guards and benedict passing
      by.

                       (as he busts)
                lookin' like a bad night for the
                house.

      moving with benedict as he spies out of the corner of his
      eye danny, lurking at a slot machine. to one of his
      guards...

                find mr. walsh. tell him mr.

      the guard goes, and benedict continues with saul...

                                 benedict
                   i'm afraid i can't allow my
                   private security personnel
                   inside the casino cages. i hope
                   you don't mind...

                                    saul
                   of course not.

      saul turns to dismiss virgil and turk when...

      ... passing by, on his way to a sports betting window, an
      old racetrack denizen happens past this cabal and, worse
      yet, happens to recognize saul.

                                  racetrack denizen
                   saul?   saul bloom, is that you?

      saul does his best to ignore the man. but even benedict
      notices: this guy seems to know lyman zerga.

                                 racetrack denizen
                   saul, it's me. bucky buchanan,
                   remember? from saratoga.

      at last saul turns to face this man, with shark's eyes.

                                 saul
                   friedrich, gunther.

      an order: dispose of this man. virgil and turk pick up
      the denizen by his elbows and haul him away.

                                 saul
                   mr. benedict...
                          (gesturing to the

       ding! ding! ding! ding! four cherries. danny smiles,
       a big winner, but he's got bigger pots to win tonight.
       he steers a neighboring senior citizen (blind as a bat)
       to his slot machine...

       linus stands dressed in a sharp, conservative suit -- a
       far cry from the threadbare thief in chicago. rusty
       circles him, inspecting.

                                  rusty
                    where you gonna put your hands?

       linus clasps them.

                                     rusty
                    no...

       linus goes for his pockets.

                                  rusty
                    not the pockets, either. and
                    don't touch your tie. look at
                    me...

       linus does.

                                  rusty
                    that how you gonna stand?

       linus shifts his balance.

                                  rusty
                    wrong again. i ask you a
                    question, you have to think of the
                    answer, where you gonna look?

                    death. you look down, they know

       linus is left utterly bewildered, a thousand commandments
       to remember and fifteen minutes to remember them in.
