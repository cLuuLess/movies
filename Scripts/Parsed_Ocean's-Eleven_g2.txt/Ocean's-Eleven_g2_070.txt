91   int. limousine - day                                         91

     saul's dressed completely (and immaculately) now in
     armani, with his hair slicked back, a brief moustache on
     his lip, and impenetrably dark glasses riding the bridge
     of his nose. he continues to practice, his accent even
     deeper now and specifying no geographic origin -- could
     be scottish, could be israeli...

                             saul
               my name is lyman zerga... my name
               is lyman zerga...

     danny passes him an envelope full of $100 bills.

                             danny
               there's a little over twenty grand
               there, saul. try to make it last.

     saul pats down his pockets for something he can't find...

                                saul
               you seen my...

                             danny
                      (handing him rolaids)
               bought you a fresh roll.

     the limo pulls to a stop, and outside there is a flurry
     of footsteps before saul's door swings open, and turk and
     virgil (both costumed as bodyguards) stand waiting for
     him.

                             virgil
               mr. zerga, we're here.

                             danny
               good luck, lyman.

                             saul
                      (hesitates, then gets
                       out)
               luck is for losers.
