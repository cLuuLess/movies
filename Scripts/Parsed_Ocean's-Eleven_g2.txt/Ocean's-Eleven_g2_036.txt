56   int. reuben tishkoff's mansion (las vegas) - night                56

     frank catton is already here, mixing a drink, when --
     ding dong -- the doorbell chimes. tishkoff shuffles
     toward the front (he's given the help the night off) and
     opens his door to find...

                                livingston
                  trick or treat.

     ... livingston, basher, yen, the malloys, saul and linus
     crowding his doormat. a taxi-van pulls away behind them.

                                tishkoff
