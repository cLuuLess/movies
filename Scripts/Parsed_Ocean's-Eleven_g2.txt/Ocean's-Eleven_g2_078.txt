99    int. warehouse - night                                         99

      a facsimile of the bellagio vault sprouts into shape.
      livingston fixes a security camera in a corner, then
      matches its image (of frank staple-gunning floorboard
      into place) to a security tape of the real mccoy.

      on the other side of the garage, turk and virgil go to
      work on their newly-purchased vans, with wrenches and
      blow torches. tishkoff recognizes a gasket virgil
      handles.

                              tishkoff
                this looks familiar. where'd you
                get this?

                              virgil
                off your rolls.

                               tishkoff
                danny!   tell 'em not to touch the
                rolls!

      overlooking the whole enterprise is danny, grinning from
      ear to ear, happy in his work. he checks a stopwatch in
      his hand as...

      ... the false top to the cash cart before him flies open,
      revealing yen within, his arms, legs and torso folded
      into a three-by-four foot space. he whips an air hose
      from his mouth and inhales deeply. danny checks his
      watch.

                               danny
                29:47.   everything okay in there?

      yen responds. of course, danny doesn't understand him.
      but rusty does, appearing behind him.

                              rusty
                but what doesn't beat the shit out
                of being a circus performer?

      danny turns to rusty:    he looks very, very serious.
