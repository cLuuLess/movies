93    ext. bellagio casino - day (super slow motion)                  93

      terry benedict emerges from a town car and, from his
      haircut to his smile to his pant-cuffs, he is effortless
      perfection. he is vegas royalty, yet he denies eye
      contact to no man. he strides into his casino and,
      appearing behind a pillar, linus follows him in.

                                 linus (v.o.)
                   he arrives at the bellagio every
                   day at two p.m. same town car,
                   same driver. remembers every
                   valet's name on the way in. not
                   bad for a guy worth three-quarters
                   of a billion.
