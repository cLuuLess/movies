      carried through the bellagio casino, held by the swat
      leader leading his men out (now eight in all), and at
      last we pull up to see his face for the first time...

      it's rusty, in full regalia, leading livingston, turk,
      saul, frank, basher, yen and linus out of the casino,

      has trouble rappelling with the rest.


277   basher                                                         277

      takes position next to rusty at the elevator shaft's
      bottom. they're on-camera, but just a few feet away and
      (off-camera) danny sits smiling.

                              rusty
                       (hiding his voice)
                prepare to cut power!


278   yen                                                            278

      fires a spurt of blanks.
