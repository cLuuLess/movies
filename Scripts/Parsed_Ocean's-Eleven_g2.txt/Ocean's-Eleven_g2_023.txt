     the explosives expert. a pair of goggles over his eyes
     reflects a match being struck, then touched to a fuse.

                  sweet...

     bang! wood shards and splinters of glass fly all around;
     basher merely ducks his head and whistles. as the dust
     settles, three men move quickly past basher and into

     bank vault. alarms begin to sound: this is bad news.

                                basher
                         (to the rest of his
                          gang, his temper

                  you know, you guys had one job to
                  do.
