                                tishkoff
                  and the closest any man has gotten
                  to robbing a las vegas casino...


29   flashback - ext. caesar's palace entrance (1987)                29

     tourists and valets scatter as a euro-thief (pastel
     t-shirt beneath a white linen suit) bursts from the
     casino and takes five steps before -- freeze frame:
     glass explodes from three different doors behind him and
     he arches his back in agony...

                                                       (continued)

                                                               19.

29   continued:                                                      29

                                tishkoff
                  outside of caesar's in '87.   he
                  came, he grabbed, he got
                  conquered.

     resume action: bullets rip the man to shreds and he
     collapses on caesar's steps a bloody pulp.
