       as danny and linus work, affixing suction-cupped anchors
       to their rappelling lines...

                                  danny
                    who do you like tonight?

                                  linus
                    huh?

                                  danny
                    tyson or lewis.

                           (as danny nods)
                    lewis.
                           (as danny shoots him
                            a look)
                    you like tyson?
                           (as danny nods)
                    how strongly do you feel about it?

                                  danny
                    you looking for action?

                                  linus
                           (shrugs)
                    i'd go in for a buck.

                                    danny
                    a buck it is.

       and they're ready, poised at the top, looking into the
       abyss of an elevator shaft scattered with infrared
       sensors.
