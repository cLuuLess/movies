                  it's tough now, our line of work.
                  everybody so serious. too many
                  guns, too many computers. whadda
                  you gonna do? steal from ordinary
                  people?

                                danny
                  that would be criminal.

                                frank
                  so what's left? banks? hah.
                  banks got no money. it's all
                  electronic. only place that still
                  takes cash is...
