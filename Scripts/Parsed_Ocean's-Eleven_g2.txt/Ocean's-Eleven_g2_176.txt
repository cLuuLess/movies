226    int. vault                                                  226

       danny and linus enter. silence. the cash carts have
       crumpled, and the vault gratings, blackened, have held.

                                  danny
                    amazing?

       linus goes to one of the racks and tentatively opens
       it...

       yen pops up from within, his hair on end, looking like he
       just dropped out of a cyclone.

                                  yen
                           (his only english)
                    where the fuck you been?
