     benedict works the room. he speaks to a japanese high
     roller in japanese, to a swiss in german, etc.

                             linus (v.o.)
               he spends a few minutes
               gladhanding the high rollers.
               he's fluent in spanish, german and
               italian, and he's taking japanese
               lessons, getting pretty good at
               it. he's out by seven-thirty,
               when an assistant hands him a
               black portfolio. contents: the
               day's take and new security codes.
               then he heads to the restaurant.

     indeed, as benedict makes his exit, an assistant hands
     him a black portfolio.
