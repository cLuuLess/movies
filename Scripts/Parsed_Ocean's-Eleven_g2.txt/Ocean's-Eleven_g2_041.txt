     ... an identical keycard is swiped through a keypad, its
     light flashing red to green, admitting a guard into an
     "employees only" doorway.

     the malloys, who've shadowed the guard here, note a
     sentry standing watch by the door as well as a security
     camera embedded in the ceiling above: no one walks
     through that portal unchecked.

                  most of all, i want you guys to
                  know these casinos. they were
                  built as labyrinths, to keep
                  people in. i want you guys to
                  know the quick routes out.

     their job done, the malloys start toward the casino's
     exit... in different directions. they begin to argue:
     the exit's that way -- no, it's that way.

                                                              45.
