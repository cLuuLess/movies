      at the table, saul bets heavily for the bank. benedict
      approaches, stands off to the right, watching.

                                 high roller
                          (to saul, noticing his
                           heavy bet)
                   you don't want to get in the hole
                   too heavy to this benedict. a
                   friend of mine once borrowed a
                   hundred g's from the guy. two
                   months went by, benedict hadn't
                   heard from him, he calls my friend
                   up, asks 'where's my money?' i'll
                   get to it when i get to it,' my
                   friend says. half hour later
                   benedict's in my friend's hotel
                   room, dangling him off his 10th
                   floor balcony by his feet. 'you
                   gonna get to it now?'

      high roller turns over a nine.     saul wins.

                                 frank
                   bank wins -- natural nine.

      benedict steps forward.

                                    high roller
                   hiya, terry.

                                    benedict
                   mr. weintraub.     how's everything?

                                 high roller
                   eh. they put too much grenadine
                   in my shirley temple.

                                 benedict
                   and here i thought you were
                   drinking vodka.
                          (turning attention to
                           saul)
                   mr. zerga.

                                 saul
                   mr. benedict. i recognize you
                   from the tv. you know, nine
                   casinos out of ten, owner comes
                   up in the middle of the hand to
                   ask me what i want. i respect
                   your waiting.

                                 benedict
                   you're the guest, sir.

                                 saul
                   and i have to impose on your
                   hospitality. can you sit in for a
                   hand?

                                 benedict
                   i'd love to, mr. zerga, but the
                   gaming board would feed me to my
                   white tigers.

                                 saul
                   that's a shame. you're the king
                   of vegas and you have to play
                   craps in the alley.

                                 benedict
                   no shame at all. reminds me of my
                   youth.


      corner - moment later

      benedict and saul are huddled in a corner.

                                 saul
                   the fight is saturday, is it not?

                                  benedict
                   yes.   i can get you seats...

                                 saul
                   no, no. hand-to-hand combat
                   doesn't interest me. i have a
                   package arriving here saturday
                   evening. a black briefcase,
                   standard size, the contents of
                   which are very valuable to me.

                                 benedict
                   i'd be happy to put it in the
                   house safe for you.

                                 saul
                   the house safe is for brandy and
                   grandmother's pearls. i'm afraid
                   i need something more secure.

                                 benedict
                   i can assure you, the house safe
                   is utterly...

                                                       (continued)

                                 saul
                          (his looks stops
                           benedict)
                   i can assure you, mr. benedict,
                   your generosity in this matter
                   will not go overlooked. now:
                   what can you offer me besides the
                   safe?

      saul's eyes are pure steel: he is not a man familiar
      with being denied. and benedict recognizes that fact.
