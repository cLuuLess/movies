      the time is 7:27.

      yen tucks himself into the cash cart's hidden compartment
      with a slim oxygen tank for company. meanwhile, rusty
      drills virgil and turk...

                                rusty
                   okay: when do you make the
                   deposit?

                                                    (continued)

                                 turk
                   not until we get your signal.

                                 virgil
                   hey. what do we look like: a
                   couple of peckerwood jackasses or
                   something?

      no one responds.

                                  rusty
                          (turning his attention
                            to yen, squeezed into
                            the cart)
                   amazing: how's it feel? you
                   alright?
                          (as yen nods)
                   want something to read? magazine?

      from the tangle of limbs, a middle finger protrudes to
      show rusty what he can do with a magazine.

                                  rusty
                   okay. i'm counting down.    thirty
                   minutes of breathing time
                   starts... now.

      on "now" a running clock appears on-screen, descending
      from 29:59. it will remain there for the duration of the
      pre-pinch heist, jumping at times between scenes.

      rusty seals yen inside the cash cart, then gives the top
      a tug: it's shut tight. as virgil redresses it with the
      tablecloth, turk snatches back livingston's penne on the
      way to the door.

                                 livingston
                   you get no tip.
