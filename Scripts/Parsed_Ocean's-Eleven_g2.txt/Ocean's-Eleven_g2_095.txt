122    int. white van - night                                               122

       turk and virgil man the front seats as danny, basher, yen
       and linus huddle in the back. basher and yen both
       prepare equipment for their raid: hooks and a rope for
       yen, a small blowtorch and a drill for basher.

                                   danny
                           (to basher and yen)
                    you two ready?

       they nod and, with danny, start out the van's rear door.
       linus starts to follow but...

                                  danny
                    what are you doing?

                                  linus
                    coming with you.

       danny smiles and shakes his head.

                                    linus
                             (furious)
                    but...
                                                           (continued)

      the van door slams in his face.
