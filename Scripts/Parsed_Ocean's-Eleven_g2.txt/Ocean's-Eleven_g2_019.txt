33   ext. vacant, weedy drag racetrack - day                      33

     close on a souped-up tractor-wheeled monster truck, its
     engine roaring before a starting line, itching to cross
     it. now take a step back...

     that souped-up monster truck stands a foot-and-a-half off
     the ground and sprouts an antenna from its back bumper.
     it's a remote-controlled toy.

     the roaring engine comes from the vehicle next to it: an
     actual monster truck. both vehicles peer down the track
     at a finish line a hundred yards away. this is a race.

     the drivers stare each other down: turk (behind the
     wheel of the truck) and virgil (track-side, remote
     control in hand) malloy. they're nice boys. really.
     peckerwoods, sure, but nice.

               i talked to the malloys yesterday.

               the mormon twins?

                             rusty (v.o.)
               they're both in salt lake city,
               six months off the job. i got the
               sense they're having trouble
               filling the hours.

     lights flash red-to-yellow-to-green and while the truck
     coats rubber on the track, virgil's toy zips to a lead.
     it's looking to be an embarrassment for turk until he
     jerks his wheel a little and -- ka-thunk -- flattens his
     brother's vehicle.

     virgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry.

               electronics?
