44   ext. dog track/betting window (miami, fla) - day                44

     saul bloom, 50s, befuddled, wearing a corduroy jacket
     patched at the elbows and a duffer's hat, counts out
     money through the window, lists his bets. he checks his
     tickets, plunges them into his pants pocket, and moves
     off...


45   through track lobby                                             45

     rusty appears in the f.g. behind a pillar, as dapper as
     saul is down-at-heel, watching him go. when saul
     disappears into the tunnel, he moves.


46   in infield                                                      46

     saul sits on one of the long, general admission steps
     under the box seats. he produces an orange from his
     pocket, starts to peel it. a pair of well-shined shoes
     appears behind him. saul senses their presence, but
     doesn't turn around.

                                saul
                  i saw you in the paddock before
                  the second race, outside the men's
                  room, when i placed my bet. i saw
                  you before you even got up this
                  morning.

                                rusty
                  how ya been, saul?

                                  saul
                  never better.

                                rusty
                  what's with the orange?

                                saul
                  my doctor says i need vitamins.

                                rusty
                  so why don't you take vitamins?

     for the first time, saul cranes his neck and shoots a
     look up at rusty.
