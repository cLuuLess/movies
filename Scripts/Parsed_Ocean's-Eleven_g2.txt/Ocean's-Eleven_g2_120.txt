      fat and slim sit before their monitors, feet kicked up,
      as behind them walsh, benedict, and saul enter.

                                 walsh
                   this is our security center, where
                   we oversee all gaming in the
                   casino as well as our vault.
                   you'll be able to monitor your
                   briefcase from here.

      walsh, finding fat and slim as they are, coughs; the two
      watchers leap immediately to their feet. benedict checks
      his watch.

                                 saul
                   don't let me keep you.

                                   benedict
                   mr. zerga...

      and benedict takes his leave...
