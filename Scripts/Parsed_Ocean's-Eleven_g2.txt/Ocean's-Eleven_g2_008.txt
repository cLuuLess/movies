      are all young tv stars (josh jackson, seth green, barry
      watson) here for a group poker lesson with rusty. (one
      star, indeed, has brought his girlfriend, katie, also
      a known actress, to observe.)

                   don't let him fool you, seth.
                   there's boatloads. if you can
                   move the things...
                          (finishing his deal)
                   one card to me.
                          (to danny, pointedly)
                   ... but you can't.

                                 danny
                   my fence seemed confident enough.

                                 rusty
                   if you're dealing with cash, you
                   don't need a fence.

                                 danny

      now the other players realize. these guys have a
      relationship. in fact, a criminal one. and, judging
      from their steely glares across the table, not a happy
      one.

                                 danny
                   well, that's all behind us now.

                                 rusty
                   i should hope so.

      danny smiles, icily -- of course, it's not -- then pulls
      out his wallet.

                                 danny
                   i raise you five hundred dollars.

      a hush in the room. danny has thrown down the gauntlet.
      he and rusty hold each other's stares.

                                  rusty
                   guys: day one: what's the first
                   rule of poker?

                barry                      topher
        um, never bet on, uh, on           'leave emotion at the
        a --                               door.'

                                  rusty
                   that's right. my friend here just
                   raised me out of pique.
                          (beat)
                   today's lesson. how to draw out
                   a bluff. this early in the game,
                   that much money, i'm thinking he's
                   holding nothing better than a pair
                   of face cards.
                          (beat)
                   seth, raise him.

                                seth
                   okay. uh, your five hundred and...
                   another two?

      rusty nods, and seth pushes in his chips.

                                  rusty
                   tophe...

                   the hell.

                   indeed. but be careful you don't
                   push him too high too fast. want
                   to keep him on the leash. i call.

      it's josh's turn.       he hesitates...

                                 josh
                   what's that to me? a thousand?

                                 rusty
                   all you have to do is call.

                                 danny
                          (off josh's further
                           hesitation)
                   what? your girlfriend holding
                   your purse?

      that does it. josh is in. the bet's to danny. he
      checks his hand, and seth starts to whisper to topher.

                                 danny
                   contrary to what mr. ryan may say,
                   seth, i always check my cards
                   before i make a bet. but be
                   cafeful. i could tell from your
                   face you're holding three of a
                   kind or better.
                          (digging his wallet
                           out)
                   five hundred to call. and two
                   grand more.

      danny stares rusty down.      the others look a little pale.

                                 rusty
                   guys, you're free to do what you
                   like. it's a lot of money. but
                   i'm staying in. he's trying to
                   buy his way out of his bluff.

      nobody looks too eager to call, but nobody wants to
      leave a grand on the table, either. finally, seth
      ponies up, and the others -- not be outdone -- do, too.

                                   rusty
                   we call.

      danny sets down his hand. four nines. it's a winner.
      the others, jaws dropped, throw in their cards. for the
      first time tonight, rusty blanches.

                   sure he was bluffing.

      as rusty plummets in the estimation of all the guys
      around him, danny rakes in his pot.

                                 danny
                   thanks for the game, fellas.
                          (then)
                   hey, i hate to ask this, but
                   could you sign something for me?
                   it's for the guys in the joint.
                   they just love all your shows.
