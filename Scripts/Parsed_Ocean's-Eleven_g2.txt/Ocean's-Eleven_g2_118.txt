157   int. bellagio casino - by cage door - night                     157

      rising from a spotless pair of wingtips shifting side-to-
      side, over hands flexing and stretching, up to linus
      caldwell. he keeps an eye on the cage door, waiting for
      benedict to appear, as he tries anything to shake out his
      nerves. then, from a discreet earpiece he wears, comes:

                                 livingston (v.o.)
                deep breaths.     you'll do fine.

                                 linus
                          (breathes deep)
                thanks.

                              livingston (v.o.)
                no sweat, kid. you're a rock.
                       (as linus smiles,
                        feeling good about
                        himself)
                now don't fuck up.
