6    int. casino (atlantic city) - night                           6

     ... and his wingtip lands squarely on plush red
     carpeting.

     as we pull up to danny's face and spin around him, we
     hear, then see the buzz of a casino floor: the hum of
     conversation, the ding-ding-ding and thunk-thunk-thunk
     from the slots, the brisk whir of shuffled cards.

     and to danny, it's a hearth and fire and a comfy chair
     and a snifter of brandy. he's home.


     on danny's wallet

     as he pulls out several crisp one hundreds, sets them on
     green felt, then sees them replaced by a neat pile of
     chips.

                                                             4.

7   at blackjack table                                            7

    danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for
    someone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- but
    without success. he turns his attention back to his
    cards, and the cards of the dealer.

    nine-ten. stay. dealer -- seventeen. danny wins.
    king-four. dealer shows a six. stick. dealer busts.
    queen-ace. twenty-one. danny wins again.

    a second dealer relieves the first, and danny recognizes
    him with a smile -- this wasn't the friend he was
    scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar
    face is welcome.

                               danny
              hello, frank.

    the new dealer (frank catton) glances up at danny, and
    his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's
    dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself. he
    quickly hides his astonishment.

                            frank
              i beg your pardon, sir. you must
              have me confused with someone
              else. my name is ramon. see?

    he taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is
    the most african-looking ramon you've ever seen. a pit
    boss circles close by and glares at them both.

                            danny
              my mistake...
                     (collecting his chips,
                      doubled)
              table's cold anyway.

                            frank
              you might try the lounge at the
              grand, sir. it gets busy around
              one.

                               danny
                        (as he goes)
              thanks.
