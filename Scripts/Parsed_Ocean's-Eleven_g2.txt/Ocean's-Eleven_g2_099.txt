       a second-story window explodes as a desk chair flies
       through it, followed shortly by linus who leaps onto a
       steel-mesh overhang running alongside the building.

                    alright, back it up, back it up!

       virgil leaps into the driver's seat, shifts into reverse.

       linus runs along the overhang, then leaps down, onto the
       reversing van, and rolls along its roof and down its
       windshield.

       through the windshield: virgil jabs his thumb over his
       shoulder: get in the back.

                    c'mon, c'mon...

       linus scrambles back over the van, and danny and yen pull
       him in. virgil hits the gas for a quick getaway, but he
       does so before the rear doors are closed, and one of them
       slams shut right on yen's hand -- crunch!

                                  yen
                    ahhh!
