      and counting. a maitre d' scours his reservations list,
      then peers up to find reuben tishkoff approaching, on
      either side of him two gorgeous young women, all blonde
      hair and breasts and legs, women who wouldn't give hefner
      the time of day.

                                 maitre d'
                   good evening, mr. tishkoff.

                                 tishkoff
                   good evening, marcel. my nieces
                   and i would like a table.
                   something quiet before the fight.

                                 maitre d'
                   i can put you at 19 in just a
                   couple minutes.

                                 tishkoff
                   quick as you can.
                          (re: the girls)
                   the meter's running here.

      the maitre d' turns to his next customer:         tess.   she, of
      course, merits a table instantly.

                                 maitre d'
                   good evening, miss ocean.    right
                   this way...

      reuben can't help but stare as tess passes by. his eyes
      linger a little too long and a little too low...

                                 voice (o.s.)
                   hey...

      reuben pivots; it's danny, and he strolls past reuben and
      his lady friends and into the restaurant...

                                 danny
                   try to keep your tongue in your
                   mouth.

                                 tishkoff
                          (shocked to see danny;
                           thinks he's off the
                           job, but covering)
                   yeah, pal, well only if you take
                   your thumb out of your...

      ... reuben gets brushed from behind by the two
      plainclothes goons following danny.

                                 tishkoff
                          (outraged)
                   hey: you have any idea who i
                   think i am?


168   at tess's usual table                                             168

      just as she's sitting, danny approaches.       she goes
      straight at him, apoplectic.

                                   tess
                   danny:    no.

                                 danny
                   i'll just be a moment.

                                 tess
                   i'm having you thrown out of
                   here.

      she starts past him; he grabs her arm to keep her, and
      she wheels on him.

                                 tess
                   you're up to something, danny.
                   what? and don't say you came here
                   for me. you're pulling a job,
                   aren't you?

                                   danny
                   tess...

                                 tess
                   well, know this: no matter what
                   it is, you won't win me back. i
                   can't afford it.

                                 danny
                   i just came to say good-bye.

                                                         (continued)

      this surprises tess, and, truth be told, saddens her; she
      studies him a moment, unsure of what to say.

                                 tess
                   oh... then... good-bye.

                                   danny
                   good-bye.

      danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it's alright
      with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then
      gently kisses it...

                                   danny
                   be good.

      danny leaves her.       tess watches him go.

                                 tess
                          (already missing him)
                   good-bye, danny.


169   at restaurant's entrance                                         169

      danny runs smack into the plainclothes goons.

                                 plainclothes goon #1
                   mr. ocean. mr. benedict would
                   like to see you.

                                 danny
                          (resignedly, these men
                           are much too big to
                           tangle with)
                   i thought he might.

      the plainclothes goons escort danny away, right past
      reuben who frowns, concerned.
