       the room is empty save for a large table. saul places
       his briefcase on it, adjusts its numbered combination
       locks, and opens it.

       inside the case:    five rows of glittering emeralds.

                                 benedict
                   they're very beautiful.   a gift.

      saul stares at him:     none of your fucking business.

                                 benedict
                   can you lift them out, please?

      saul lifts the velvet tray out of the case, and benedict
      pats down the case's interior. saul replaces the tray.

                                 benedict
                   alright, mr. zerga. i acknowledge
                   that the case does not contain any
                   dangerous or illicit material. i
                   further agree to take custody of
                   your case for a twenty-four hour
                   period to store in our secured
                   vault. while i cannot permit you
                   to accompany the case to the
                   vault...

                                 saul
                   why not?

                                 benedict
                   insurance, for one. security,
                   another. and i don't trust you.

      there is a knock at the door, and walsh the casino
      manager enters. he speaks low in benedict's ear.

                                 walsh (manager)
                   i put two plainclothes on ocean.
                   he's at the keno bar now.

      walsh nods, and benedict turns back to saul.

                                 benedict
                   mr. zerga, this is mr. walsh, my
                   casino manager. if you will allow,
                   he will arrange for your briefcase
                   to be stored inside our vault while
                   you watch on a security monitor.
                          (beat)
                   those are my terms. yes or no?

      saul and benedict eyeball each other.

                                 saul
                   you leave me no choice.

      saul unlocks the cuff from his wrist.
