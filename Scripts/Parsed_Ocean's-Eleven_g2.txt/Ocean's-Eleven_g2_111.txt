                                manager (walsh)

                him   out? i can bounce him from
                the   state for parole violation if
                you   like.

                              benedict
                       (shakes his head)
                put a guy on him. he's here for a
                reason. i'd like to know what it
                is. but if he comes anywhere near
                tess, take it to the next level.

                                manager

      benedict nods, goes on his way.

      saul, as lyman zerga, stands ramrod straight, looking
      through sliding glass doors out at the valet station.

      from behind, terry benedict approaches, two security
      guards walking half a pace behind him. saul spots him in
      the glass's reflection; he does not turn.

                                saul
                mr. benedict.

                             benedict
                mr. zerga. it's a very busy night
                for me. are we on schedule?

                              saul
                i have no reason to suspect
                otherwise. my couriers should be
                here momentarily.

      a beat as benedict studies saul.

                              benedict
                it's a nice evening. shall we
                wait outside?
