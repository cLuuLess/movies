      bruiser throws a mean left hook across danny's face as
      the door swings open and benedict steps in. bruiser sees
      him and steps away, toweling off his bloodied knuckles.

      benedict studies danny: the man is a bloody mess, head
      rolling, eyes puffed up.

                                  benedict
                   wake him up.

      the goons step in, slap danny alert.       at last, danny
      recognizes benedict in the room.

                                 danny
                          (a little punchy)
                   heya, benedict... how's the other
                   fight going?

      benedict keeps his cool.

                                 benedict
                   did you have a hand in this?
                          (beat)
                   did you?

                                 danny
                   did i have a hand in what?

      benedict scrutinizes danny: is he bluffing?       he looks at
      bruiser, then danny again, and decides: no.

                                 benedict
                   get him out of here.

      as the goons scoop him up and drag him out, danny catches
      bruiser's eye for just a moment. and barely winks.
