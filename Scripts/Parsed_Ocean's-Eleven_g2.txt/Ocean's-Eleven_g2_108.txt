      a mug-shot of danny, complete with vital information:
      height, weight, criminal history.

                   you've been red-flagged. it means
                   the moment you step on the casino
                   floor, they'll be watching you.
                   like hawks. hawks with video
                   cameras.

                                 danny
                   this is a problem.

      a pall falls over the room: this is more than a problem,
      this is disastrous. only saul dares make a noise,
      humming and splashing in the next room.

                                  rusty
                   saul:   time to get out.

                                 saul (o.s.)
                          (as lyman)
                   it's time when i say it is.

                                  rusty
                   now!

      we hear him jump-to-it out of the tub...

                                 saul (o.s.)
                          (himself again)
                   i'm out.

                                 rusty
                          (back to danny)
                   you have any idea how this
                   happened?

      before danny can answer...

                                 linus
                   i do. he's been chasing
                   benedict's woman. got into a real
                   snarl with him two nights ago.
                          (off danny's look)
                   i was tailing you.

                                 danny
                   who told you to do that?

      before linus can answer...

                                 rusty
                   i did.
                          (he and danny
                           hold a stare)
                   i knew you couldn't leave tess
                   alone.

                                 tishkoff
                   who's tess?

                                 danny
                   my wife.

                                 rusty
                   ex-wife.

                                 saul
                          (appearing in a
                           bathrobe)
                   tess is here?

                                  rusty
                          (eyes still on
                           danny)
                   i'm sorry. i didn't know if it
                   would sting you, but it did.
                          (the most difficult
                           words he's ever
                           had to say)
                   you're out, danny.

                                  tishkoff
                   he's out?!

                                 rusty
                   it's that or we shut down right
                   now. his involvement puts us all
                   at risk.

      danny and rusty face off, furious with each other.

                                 danny
                   this isn't your call.

                                 rusty
                   you made it my call. when you put
                   her ahead of us. you made it mine.

                                 danny
                   this is my job.

                                  rusty
                   not anymore.

      danny stares daggers at rusty. but he can see: everyone
      in the room is on rusty's side. defeated, he stalks out
      of the room, onto a balcony, but not without staring down
      linus.

                                 tishkoff
                   but, but... he can't just be out.
                   who's gonna take his place?

      rusty turns to linus.

                                 rusty
                   kid, you up for it?

      linus's eyes drift to danny outside -- whatever acrimony
      he felt before, he never meant to kick danny off the job.
      he nods, half-cocksure/half-scared-pissless: he's up for
      it.

                                 rusty
                          (to livingston)
                   find everyone else. let 'em know
                   the change in plan. curtain goes
                   up at seven.

      livingston exits. everyone else in the room staggers
      about, like witnesses after an execution. rusty steps
      out onto the balcony, perhaps to console danny, but (as
      linus watches them from inside) their words cannot be
      heard.

                          (as nobody responds)
                   she's too tall for him.
