      danny and rusty ride silently, staring out opposite
      windows at sunset boulevard.

                                 rusty
                   that was, that was just...

                                 danny
                   unprofessional.

      rusty agrees.

                                 rusty
                   how was the clink? you get the
                   cookies i sent you?

                                 danny
                   why do you think i came to see you
                   first?

      danny pulls out a wad of bills from his jacket, peels off
      half, and hands it to rusty.

                                  danny
                   ten grand.   half of it's yours.

                  you barge into my new workplace,
                  ruin my professional reputation,
                  least you could do is tell me
                  you've got something better for
                  me.

                                danny
                  i've got something better for
                  you.
