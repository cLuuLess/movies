     livingston approaches the exit's keypad and swipes his
     keycard: the light does not flash red-to-green.

                                  fat
                           (on his tail)
                  hey...

     livingston looks: he swiped the wrong side of his
     keycard. he tries again. red flashes to green. he
     pulls the door...

     ... but fat blocks it.       livingston peers up, certain he's
     had it.
