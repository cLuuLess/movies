5    ext. minimum-security prison - front gate - afternoon         5

     a sign reads: "new jersey state minimum-security
     correctional facility." someone has graffitied below it:
     "if you were in prison, you'd be home now."

     the great metal door opens, and danny stands within its
     frame, ready for release. (if it matters -- and if you
     notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.)

     he hovers   there for a moment, on the precipice of
     freedom.    the wind whistles a little on the other side of
     the gate,   and the view ahead is not pleasant (new
     jersey):    life is hard out there.

     but danny musters his courage, then takes his first step
     into free america...
