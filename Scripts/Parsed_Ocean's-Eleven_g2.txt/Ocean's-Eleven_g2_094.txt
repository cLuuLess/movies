       scientists demonstrate the pinch, a lithium wire in a
       glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator.

                    a pinch is the equivalent of a
                    cardiac arrest for any broad-band
                    electrical circuitry. or better
                    yet: a pinch is a bomb... but
                    without the bomb. every time a
                    nuclear weapon detonates, it
                    unleashes an electromagnetic pulse
                    which shuts down any power source
                    within its vicinity. that tends
                    not to matter in most cases
                    because the nuclear weapon
                    destroys everything you might need
                    power for anyway. now a pinch
                    creates a similar electromagnetic
                    pulse, but without the headache of
                    mass destruction and death. so
                    instead of hiroshima, you get the
                    seventeenth century.

                    could a pinch take out the power
                    of an entire city? like, i

                    but there's only one pinch in the

       danny and rusty trade a look:        they have their answer.
