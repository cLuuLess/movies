111   int. basher tarr's hotel room - day                            111

      nobody lights a match, this place is a powder keg.
      basher sits on his bed, surrounded by combustibles,
      whittling and polishing a plastic explosive into an
      emerald shape. there's a knock at the door...

                                 maid (o.s.)
                   house cleaning.

                                 basher
                          (eyes never leave
                           his work)
                   just jumping into the shower, can
                   you come back later?

      the maid moves on, on tv:     a reporter broadcasts live...
