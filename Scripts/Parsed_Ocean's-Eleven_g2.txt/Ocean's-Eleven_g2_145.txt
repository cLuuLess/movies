      linus immediately reaches up to the elevator's ceiling,
      rips down its panel to reveal a trap door. as he starts
      to push it open...

      ... a hand yanks it free from above.    it's danny.

                              danny
                you didn't really think i was
                gonna sit this one out, did you?

                              linus
                what, didn't you trust me?

                              danny
                i do now.

      he reaches down and pulls linus, wide-eyed, up to the
      roof of the elevator.
