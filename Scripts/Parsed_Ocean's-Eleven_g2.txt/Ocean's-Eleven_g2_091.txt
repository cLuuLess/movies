116   int. warehouse - night                                         116

      the bellagio vault has been fully reproduced here, and
      what we've been watching has been a trial run. ten of
      the eleven (turk and virgil in guard costumes, basher is
      still missing) watch from offstage, like a film crew
      watching a dress rehearsal.

                                 frank
                   fin says he shorts it.

                                 livingston
                   make it a sawbuck.

      from a dead squat, yen leaps, hands first, from the cash
      cart to a ledge five yards away, and grips it safely with
      both hands without touching the floor. from this
      position, he'll inch his way to a counter, then, to the
      door...

      frank pays up. behind him, a door slams, and he turns to
      see basher, at last. sniffing the air, he double-takes
      -- basher's covered head-to-toe in sewage.

                                 basher
                          (and he's not happy)
                   we're in deep shit.
