2   int. parole board hearing room - wider view - morning         2

    three parole board members sit opposite danny, behind a
    table.

                             board member #2
               mr. ocean, what we're trying to
               find out is: was there a reason
               you chose to commit this crime, or
               was there a reason why you simply
               got caught this time?

                             danny
               my wife left me. i was upset.    i
               got into a self-destructive
               pattern.

                                                    (continued)

                               board member #3
                 if released, is it likely you
                 would fall back into a similar
                 pattern?

                               danny
                 she already left me once. i don't
                 think she'll do it again just for
                 kicks.

    glances dart between the board members.

                               board member #1
                 mr. ocean, what do you think you
                 would do if released?

    danny considers.
