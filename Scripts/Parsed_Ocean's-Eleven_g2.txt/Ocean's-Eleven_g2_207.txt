      walsh stands before several monitors as slim cues up the
      "masked men robbing the vault" image of a few minutes ago
      beside the present image of benedict staring at the vault
      wall.

                                 benedict (v.o.)
                   does it say 'bellagio' on the
                   south wall of the vault?

      in the masked-men image it does not, in fact, say
      "bellagio" there.

                   no, sir. it doesn't. i -- i
                   don't understand...
