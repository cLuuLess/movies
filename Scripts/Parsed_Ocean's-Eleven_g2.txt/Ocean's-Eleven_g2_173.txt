       yen sets the last of lyman's emeralds against the vault
       door like a plastic explosive... which, of course, it is.
       he affixes a detonator receiver (the size of a golf ball
       pencil) to it, then slaps the door twice: all set.

       danny responds with two slaps of his own. he steps
       back, detonator in hand, its wires attached to the vault
       door.

                    counting down from twenty --

                    -- now.

       yen starts his retreat from the door, but gets yanked
       back.

       his hand's bandage is caught on the door.

       yen tries to free himself, but he can't use his other
       hand lest he drop to the floor. he tries gnawing at
       his bandage, which brings his face within inches of a
       plastic explosive.

        yen, still on the door, remains frozen.       trembling.

        a beat.

        then, he starts to creep back, leaping onto a money
        shelf, then another, as far from the explosives as he
        can get.
