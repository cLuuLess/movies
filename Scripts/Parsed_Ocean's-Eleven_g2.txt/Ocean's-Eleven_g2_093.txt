      basher towels off his hair...

                                 danny
                   so...

                                 basher
                   so unless we decide to do this job
                   in reno, we're screwed.

      danny rises and paces, frustrated.      he's come too far for
      things to go awry now.

                                    rusty
                    we could --

                                    danny
                    by tomorrow?

       danny keeps pacing; rusty hangs his head and thinks;
       basher dries his hair.

                                  basher
                           (an idea occurs
                            to him)
                    we could use a pinch.

       danny stops; rusty looks up.

                                  danny
                    what -- is a pinch?
