115   int. bellagio vault - night                                      115

      from above, descending still: this is the real deal.
      the bellagio vault. a clock reads: 8:03.

                                 rusty (v.o.)
                   once the electricity goes, all
                   entry points to the vault and its
                   elevator will automatically lock
                   down for two minutes. that's when
                   we make our move...

      two guards wheel in a cash cart and leave it in the
      vault's center and march out again, closing the thick
      metal door behind them. when the vault locks click...

      ... we stop descending, just above the cash cart. there
      is silence for a spell, the lights flicker out, then...

      ... the false top of the cart springs open, revealing yen
      within, folded neatly.

                                                        (continued)

      he inhales deeply, then slowly unspools himself from the
      cash cart until, at last, he crouches atop it. he takes
      in the room: vacant and silent.

      except for rusty, who walks right by him, incongruously.

                                 rusty
                   okay: they've put you in the
                   middle of the room, far from
                   everything. you have to get from
                   here to the door without touching
                   the floor. what do you do?
