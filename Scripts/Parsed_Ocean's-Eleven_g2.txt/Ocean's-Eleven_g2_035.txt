     on a tabletop: the gucci wallet beside a half-drunk
     guinness. linus enters the front door, cases the joint,
     spots the wallet on the table, and danny behind it.

                                 danny
                  hi, linus.   sit down.

                                 linus
                  who are you?

                                danny
                  a friend of bobby caldwell's.   sit
                  down.

     linus balks, prideful, but sense finds a way, and he
     sits.

                                danny
                  bobby told me about you. said you
                  were the best set of hands he ever
                  saw. didn't expect to find you
                  working wallets on the subway.

                                linus
                  that wasn't work, that was
                  practice.

     danny reaches into his jacket and sets a plane ticket on
     the table. he keeps his hand over it.

                                danny
                  you're either in or out, right
                  now.

                                linus
                  what is it?

                                danny
                  a plane ticket. a job offer.

                                linus
                  you're pretty trusting pretty
                  fast.

                                danny
                  bobby has every faith in you.

                                linus
                  fathers are like that.
                         (off danny's reaction)
                  he didn't tell you?
                         (as danny shakes
                          his head)
                  he doesn't like me trading on his
                  name.

                                danny
                  you do this job, he'll be trading
                  on yours.

                                linus
                  what if i say no?

                                danny
                  we'll get someone else who won't
                  be quite as good. you can go back
                  to feeling up stockbrokers.

     linus considers. he looks down at the ticket, then at
     the wallet. it's one or the other.

     a waitress passes, and danny signals her for his bill.
     when his attention returns to linus, the wallet
     remains... but the ticket beneath his hand is gone.
     linus is reading it.

                                danny
                  that's the best lift i've seen you
                  make yet.

                                linus
                  las vegas, huh?

     the city looms out of the desert like an infernal
     machine, lights flashing, skyline pulsing, a neon
     fortress.

     one thing in particular catches our eye: an enormous
     billboard with an ad for the upcoming boxing match
     between mike tyson and lennox lewis. below it, a
     promoter hands out fliers for strip joints and call
     girls.
