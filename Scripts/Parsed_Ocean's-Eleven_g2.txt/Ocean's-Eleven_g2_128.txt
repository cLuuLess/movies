      frank stands at attention before linus and benedict.
      linus, straddling a desk, takes a beeper off his belt
      when it pinches him. benedict checks his watch: the
      fight's opening bell is growing closer and closer.

                                  linus
                   thank you for your cooperation,
                   mr. escalante.
                          (as frank nods,
                           not at all)
                   or should i call you mr. catton?

      frank bristles, tries not to let it show.   linus pulls
      out a xeroxed mug shot and bio of him.

                                 linus
                   you are frank catton? formerly of
                   the tropicana, the desert inn and
                   the new york state penitentiary
                   system?

                                  linus (cont'd)
                          (as frank remains
                           quiet)
                   your silence suggests you don't
                   refute that.
                          (to benedict)
                   mr. benedict, i'm afraid you've
                   been employing an ex-convict. as
                   you know, the n.g.c. strictly
                   forbids...

                                 frank
                          (under his breath)
                   goddamn cracker...

                                 linus
                          (a pause; he can't
                           believe he just
                           heard that)
                   pardon me.

                                 frank
                          (leering at linus,
                           simmering)
                   you heard me. just 'cause a black
                   man tries to earn a decent wage in
                   this state...

                                 linus
                   that has nothing to do with...

                                 frank
                          (over him, ranting)
                   ... some cracker cowboy like you's
                   gotta kick him out on the street.
                   want me to jump down, turn around,
                   pick a bale of cotton, won't let
                   me deal cards, might as well call
                   it whitejack.

                                 linus
                          (a beat, then)
                   i resent your implication that
                   race has anything to do with this.
                          (to benedict)
                   now, as i was saying, the nevada
                   gaming commission strictly forbids
                   the employment of the colored...
                          (whoops)
                   ... i mean...

      that does it: frank attacks linus, lunging at the man,
      and as benedict steps in to separate the two...

      withdraws the vault combination.

                                 frank
                   okay, okay, i'm cool.

                   you alright?
