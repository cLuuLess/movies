      a small cadre of guards await the arrival of the vault
      elevator. its doors open to reveal the six large canvas
      bags, each sealed tight, marked with an x.

                              rusty (v.o.)
                one minute after that, the
                elevator will rise to your cages.
                six of your guards will pick up
                the bags and carry them out into
                the casino.

      six guards do precisely that.

                                                               131.
