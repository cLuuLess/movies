247   ext. bellagio casino - night                                    247

      the white van (now clean of the "nevada telecom" sign)
      idles before the bellagio, its windows tinted, the
      driver's identity inscrutable. it is swarmed by
      security, but they maintain a wide perimeter.

                              rusty (v.o.)
                your guards will load the bags
                into the van's rear. if anyone so
                much as approaches the driver's
                door, we blow everything.

      the guards carry out the money and load it into the van's
      rear. there, they find a video camera mounted within the
      back seat of the van monitoring them. still they cannot
      catch a glimpse of the driver. they close the van doors.

      the white van departs the valet station in front,
      clandestinely shadowed by five sedans. meanwhile, behind
      the casino, a swat van arrives and unloads its squad.

                   now what?

                                 rusty (v.o.)
                   now, when i get word that the van
                   hasn't been followed, that the
                   money is secure, my men will exit
                   the building, and once their
                   safety is confirmed, you'll get
                   your vault back.
