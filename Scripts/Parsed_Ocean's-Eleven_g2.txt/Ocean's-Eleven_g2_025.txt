39   ext. police car - later                                        39

     basher sits in the rear, handcuffed behind his back, feet
     on the pavement. an explosives cop kneels in front of
     him.

                                cop
                  and that's all you used during the
                  event? nothing else?

                                basher
                  are you accusing me of booby-
                  trapping?

                                cop
                  well, how 'bout it?

                                voice (o.s.)
                  booby traps aren't mr. tarr's style.

     the cop turns; standing behind him, stone-faced, is
     rusty, in a dark suit and shades.

                                rusty
                  isn't that right, basher?

                                  basher
                  that's right.

                                rusty
                         (flashing badge,
                          briefly)
                  peck, a.t.f. let me venture a
                  guess. a simple g4 mainliner,
                  double-coil, backwound, quick
                  fuse with a drag under 20 feet.
                         (off cop's reaction)
                  that's our man. tell me something
                  else. have you checked him for
                  booby traps on his person? i mean
                  really checked, not just for
                  weapons...

     the cop looks bewildered. rusty steps forward, yanks
     basher onto his feet, spins him around. he moves his
     hands up and down basher's legs, around his waist, under
     his arms.

                                rusty
                  will you go find griggs and tell
                  him i need to see him?

                                  cop
                  who?

                                                         (continued)

                                rusty
                         (loud)
                  just go find him, will you?
                         (as cop stalks off;
                          under his breath)
                  how fast can you put something
                  together with what i passed you?

                                 basher
                  done.   thirty seconds all right?

                                 rusty
                  from when?

                                 basher
                          (as we hear something
                           snap from behind his
                           back)
                  now.


40   moving with rusty and basher                                40

     they're hurrying; ahead of them is a wall of squad cars,
     a police cordon, and a crowd of onlookers.

                                 rusty
                  ten seconds?

                                 basher
                  not quite.   is danny here?

                                rusty
                  around the corner.

                                basher
                  be good working with professionals
                  again.
                         (beat)
                  okay: go.

     and they both start running.

                                rusty
                  everyone down! get down!      there's
                  a bomb in the...

     and behind them the squad car erupts with a bang! a
     collective scream rises from the crowd, everyone ducks,
     cops hit the ground and cover their heads. rusty and
     basher move briskly past them, dodging their splayed legs
     like tires on an obstacle course. by the time the
     explosives cop thinks to look around for basher, they've
     both disappeared.
