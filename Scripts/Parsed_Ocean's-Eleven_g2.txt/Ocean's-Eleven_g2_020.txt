34   int. surveillance van - day                                  34

     on a black and white monitor: two mobsters, on a meet in
     a public park, peer over their shoulders, making certain
     no one is watching them. little do they know...

     ... livingston dell, audio-visual junkie, and victim of a
     continual flop sweat, crouches before their image,
     masterfully controlling his surveillance camera with a
     joystick in his left hand. he is flanked by fbi men.

                                rusty (v.o.)
                  livingston's been doing freelance
                  surveillance work of late for the
                  f.b.i. mob squad.

                                danny (v.o.)
                  how are his nerves?

                                rusty (v.o.)
                  okay.
                         (beat)
                  not so bad you'd notice.

     as a fbi man reaches to adjust a monitor...

                                livingston
                  d-don't, don't-don't... touch... it.

                                fbi man #1
                  what?

                                livingston
                  do you see me pulling the gun out
                  of your holster and firing it?

                                fbi man #2
                  hey, radio shack: relax.
