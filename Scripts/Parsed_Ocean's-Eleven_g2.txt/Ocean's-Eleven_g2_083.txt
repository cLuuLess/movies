      starts to caress her arms.

                   about to send out a search
                   party...
                          (recognizing the hands,
                            she turns, stunned)

                           him, but outraged
                           mostly)
                   what are you doing here?

                   i went for cigarettes and never

                   funny, i never got a check.

      danny smiles.    tess stares daggers.

                tess                      danny

                   you're not wearing your ring.

      a beat.

                   i told you i'd write.

      danny reaches his hand (ringed) for hers (ringless), but
      she removes it from the table.

                                   tess
                   danny.   go.   now. before...

                   benedict?

      she freezes: danny knows.       he smiles:   it's okay.   then,
      to a passing waiter:

                                  danny
                          (his fingers two
                           inches apart)
                   whiskey and --
                          (then one inch
                           apart)
                   -- whiskey.

                   you're doing a great job curating
                   the museum.

      she sighs, exasperated.

                                 danny
                   the vermeer is quite good. simple
                   but vibrant. although his work
                   definitely fell off as he got
                   older.

                   they also painted occasionally.

      a beat.

                   you don't know how many times i
                   played this conversation out in my
                   head the last two years.

                                 tess
                   did it always go this poorly?

                   sounds frustrating.

                                 danny
                   you were never easy.
                          (as she shrugs)
                   okay. i'll make this quick. i came
                   here for you. i'm gonna get on with

                                 danny
                   i only lied about being a thief.
                   but i don't do that anymore.
