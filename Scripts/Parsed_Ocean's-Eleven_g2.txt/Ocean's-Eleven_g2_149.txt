       rusty, playing doctor, inspects saul. at the same time,
       he inspects a monitor: the vault door closing with the
       yen-filled cash cart and saul's briefcase inside.

       rusty stops, listens to saul's chest, then drops his
       head...

                                  rusty
                    he's gone.

       walsh, fat and slim all bow their heads.     at the door,
       two paramedics arrive with a stretcher.

                                  walsh
                    you're too late, guys.   he's dead.

       the first paramedic turns to his partner and admonishes
       him:

                                  virgil
                           (to turk)
                    i told you to hurry.
