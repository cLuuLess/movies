               int. cia headquarters conference room -- day

               a video monitor -- full frame -- meet wombosi. he's an african 
               ex-dictator, think idi amin crossed with mobutu. he's in 
               some sort of throne room. and he's angry. bodyguards and a 
               translator hovering nervously around him. what this is, is 
               news footage -- an interview conducted by a german tv station.

                                     wombosi
                              (he speaks english)
                         ...no, no, no -- the time is not 
                         right, my enemies are too strong. 
                         i'm telling you to wait for this, 
                         you understand? i'm telling you this, 
                         and i'm making a warning to all those 
                         peoples out there that think that my 
                         powers have become so weak that they 
                         can play with me as they wish. you 
                         will see -- i will tell you when the 
                         evidence is clear. then you will 
                         have a story. my old friends will 
                         hear about themselves.
                              (stopping, freezing 
                              on that image, and --)

               marshall, a cia bigwig has the remote control. and the floor.

                                     marshall
                         that's nykwana wombosi speaking in 
                         paris the day before yesterday. i'm 
                         sure most of you have a passing 
                         knowledge of mr. wombosi. some of 
                         you on the african desks have worked 
                         with him over the years. some of you 
                         very closely...

               twelve cia mandarins sitting around the table like kids in 
               detention. we will tour the faces as marshall continues, but 
               the guy we're interested in is named ward abbott. picture a 
               sawier, slicker john poindexter.

                                     marshall
                         ...he was an irritation before he 
                         took power. he was a problem when he 
                         was in power. and he's been a disaster 
                         for us in exile.
                              (the tape --)
                         wombosi likes to send us messages 
                         through the european media. this is 
                         an interview we pulled down from a 
                         local german television station in 
                         dresden. we've been getting these 
                         little broadsides every couple of 
                         months. he knows this -- he knows 
                         that -- he's writing a book about 
                         the agency's history in africa -- 
                         he's going to name names. it's 
                         basically a shakedown...

               abbott's face says this is news to him. his hands suggest 
               otherwise.

                                     marshall
                         this interview -- and i'll make the 
                         tape available for anyone who wants 
                         it -- he goes on to claim that he 
                         has just survived an assassination 
                         attempt. he says it's us. he says 
                         he's got proof.
                              (beat)
                         the overwhelming negative 
                         ramifications of this should be 
                         obvious.
                              (hard and dry)
                         the director wants to know if there 
                         is any possible shred of truth in 
                         this accusation.

               long pause. no hands go up.
