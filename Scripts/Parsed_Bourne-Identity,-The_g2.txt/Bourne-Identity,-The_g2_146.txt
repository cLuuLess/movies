               int. moving metro car -- day

               the professor sitting there. like a dummy. like a puppet 
               that's been propped up. he's fucked -- his whole side ravaged 
               with shot -- his arm shredded -- hand barely there -- blood 
               flowing fast --

                                     bourne
                         who else is coming?

               the professor staring up at the gun. stunned. doomed. mouth 
               dry. eyes struggling to make sense of the chaos.

                                     bourne
                         i won't ask again.

                                     professor
                         i work alone. like you...
                              (confused beat)
                         ...we always work alone.

                                     bourne
                         what do you mean?

                                     professor
                         who are you? rome? paris?
                              (bourne is just staring --)
                         treadstone... both of us... i was 
                         warned but...

                                     bourne
                         treadstone?

                                     professor
                         ...which one are you?...

               bourne lowering the weapon -- head swimming --

                                     bourne
                         paris. i live in paris...

                                     professor
                         ...headaches... you have that... i 
                         get such bad headaches...

                                     bourne
                         yes.

                                     professor
                         ...it's a problem...

               he's losing blood fast -- things inside him seizing up --

                                     bourne
                         treadstone.

                                     professor
                         ...or in a car... when it's dark... 
                         something with the headlights...
                              (circuits exploding)
                         ...pills, right? treadstone had those 
                         pills...

                                     bourne
                         what is treadstone?

                                     professor
                         ...what did you do?... you must've 
                         really fucked up...

                                     bourne
                         i think so.

                                     professor
                         ...someone said caffeine -- for a 
                         headache... doesn't seem...

                                     bourne
                         what do they want me to do?

                                     professor
                         ...they won't let you go...

                                     bourne
                         why?

               the professor -- coughing -- a spasm -- helpless --

                                     professor
                         look at this...
                              (all the blood --)
                         ...least you have a woman....

               and he's gone. like that. sitting there. and bourne looks 
               paralyzed too. kneeling there. stalled out.

                         jason...

               bourne doesn't answer -- can't, because there's this sound -- 
               this pulsing hum -- bourne reaching into the professor's 
               pocket and --

               insert -- the e-phone pager -- covered in blood -- hum -- 
               hum -- hum -- bourne's hand wiping at the blood that covers 
               the display --

               bourne staring at it. very familiar to him.

                                     marie
                         we've got to go.
