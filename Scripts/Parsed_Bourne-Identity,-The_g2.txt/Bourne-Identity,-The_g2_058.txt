               marie storming away. pissed-off -- broke -- illegal -- ruined

               a little red car. a beat-to-shit euro car. a shitty little 
               red car angled in beside a dumpster with a big red zurich 
               parking ticket on the windshield.

               marie grabbing the ticket -- tearing it up -- tearing the 
               shit out of it -- blind with misfortune -- throwing the pieces 
               on the ground and stomping on them and then --

                                     marie
                              (looking up --)

                                     marie
                         it's a little late for that.

                                     bourne
                         i've got a situation here and --

                                     marie
                         get the fuck away from my car.

                                     bourne
                         i'll give you ten thousand dollars 
                         to drive me to paris.

                                     marie
                         great. you know what? i'll give you 
                         ten gazillion dollars to get the 
                         fuck away from me before i start 
                         screaming my head off.

                                     bourne

                         than i do.

               bourne tosses cash -- a stack of hundreds -- across the car 
               into her hands -- she catches it. looks at it.

                                     marie
                         jesus...
