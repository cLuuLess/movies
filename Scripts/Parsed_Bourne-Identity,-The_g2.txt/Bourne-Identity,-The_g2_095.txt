               int. the hotel room bathroom -- night

               hair dye washing down a rusted drain. it's marie alone in 
               this crappy little bathroom. jeans and bra. all of it soaking 
               wet.

               a new hair color.

               a mirror. there she is. her turn to stare at herself and 
               wonder.

               and then she smells something. smoke...
