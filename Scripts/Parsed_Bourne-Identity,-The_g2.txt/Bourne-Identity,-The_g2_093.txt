               int. cia hallway upstairs hallway -- day

               abbott and conklin walk and talk. they want to get loud, but 
               they can't. too many people passing by --

                                     conklin
                         that was two hours -- two hours to 
                         get a second opinion -- and nothing 
                         changes. he's loose. he's out of 
                         control. it's very clear what needs 
                         to happen.
                              (point blank)
                         i have work to do.

                                     abbott
                         what if he is working for someone 
                         else? what if he turned?

                                     conklin
                         turn? to who? where does he turn? 
                         what does he have to offer? he's got 
                         nothing. he's a killer. he's a piece 
                         of equipment for crissake. where's 
                         he gonna turn?
