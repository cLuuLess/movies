               int. a caf√â near la defense -- day

               bourne entering. and there's marie in the back working a 
               payphone -- waving for him to sit -- she's onto something.

               bourne sits. pulls out the alliance security brochures and 
               literature. flipping through it. boats. water. he's getting 
               closer. pictures of yachts and various security blurbs and a 
               list of references for huge yachts -- jobs they've done in 
               the past...

                                     marie
                         i found it.
                              (standing there)
                         it took six calls.
                              (she's creeped out)
                         i found kane. i found the body.

                                     bourne
                         let's go --
                              (already standing --)
                         we got to get away from this phone.
