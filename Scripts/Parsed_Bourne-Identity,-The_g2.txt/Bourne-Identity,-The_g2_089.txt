               int. wombosi compound main hallway -- day

               throne room doors flying open -- wombosi exploding out into 
               the hallway --

                                     wombosi
                         -- no! -- i say, no! -- they go this 
                         far -- out a body in the grave -- 
                         another body! -- no! -- this isn't 
                         over -- these people are not finished -- 
                         nothing will make them finish until 
                         they have wombosi! -- the real wombosi -- 
                         until i'm the one in the box! --

               six kids -- two wives -- three bodyguards -- all startled by 
               this steamrolling mass of energy and paranoia --

                                     wombosi
                         -- what are you doing? --
                              (bearing down on 
                              bodyguard #2 --)
                         -- sleeping? --
                              (to deauvage --)
                         -- he's sleeping! -- this man is 
                         sleeping at his post! --
                              (kicking the chair 
                              out from under him --)
                         -- i've had men killed for this! --
                              (but he's still moving --)
                         -- you think these people? -- these 
                         people who come for me -- you think 
                         they sleep? -- they never sleep! -- 
                         they spend all the day -- all the 
                         night -- all time thinking about how 
                         to put wombosi in that box! --
                              (he's just gonna keep 
                              going, and we're 
                              into--)

               a massive one-take tracking shot

               deauvage on his feet -- racing to follow -- kids scattering 
               out of the way -- the wives completely unfazed and --

                                     wombosi
                         -- there is no box for wombosi! -- 
                         they don't have a box that can hold 
                         me! -- i know these people -- i know 
                         they never sleep! -- i know they 
                         never stop! -- they never stop until 
                         the knife is at their throat! --
                              (suddenly distracted --)
                         -- what is the window? -- this window 
                         is open! -- who leaves this open! --
                              (before deauvage can 
                              possibly respond --)
                         -- this is a war, you fool! -- you 
                         think these people are like you? -- 
                         you think this is stupid people? -- 
                         careless people? -- these people see 
                         an open window, they reach in with a 
                         big hand and grab your heart until 
                         you die! --
                              (still rolling as--)

               we're heading down to the pool

                                     wombosi
                         -- and it won't just be me! -- they 
                         don't just want wombosi now! -- they 
                         want my babies -- they want my 
                         children! -- and i say no! --
                              (grabbing deauvage --)
                         -- you leave that window open again, 
                         you better pray they kill me --
                              (something's caught 
                              his ear in the 
                              distance and now 
                              he's trying to get 
                              there --)
                         -- everything changes here now! -- 
                         everyone is a soldier here now! -- 
                         this is a fortress now! are we clear 
                         with this?

                                     deauvage
                         yes, sir. all clear.

               wombosi stops to look at deauvage. in the background, we can 
               hear a child crying by the pool --

                                     wombosi
                         this man is out there. kane is out 
                         there. and they pretend he's dead. 
                         that means he's coming back.

               wombosi moving quickly now and we're still tracking -- taking 
               him into --

               the pool area

               forty kids going nuts in the water. one kid crying. wombosi 
               like a shot -- picking the kid up -- drying his tears -- 
               making a funny face -- getting a smile as --
