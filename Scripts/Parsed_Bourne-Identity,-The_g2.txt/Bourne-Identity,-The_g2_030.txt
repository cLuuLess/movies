               int. bank safety deposit viewing room -- day

               sterile and kind of odd. but total privacy. the man sitting 
               there, as a deposit guard places a large safety deposit box 
               before him. the guard leaves the room. closing the door behind 
               him.

               the man is alone. and there it is, right in front of him. 
               this is it. here are the answers. he lifts the lid.

               the box. there's a shallow tray on top. in this tray: a beat-
               up passport in the name of jason bourne. a french driver's 
               license with a parisian address. credit cards for jason 
               bourne.

               the man. holding these objects close -- as if by holding 
               them he might absorb their essence. forcing himself to 
               believe. this is him. his picture. there it is. he's jason 
               bourne.

                                     bourne
                         my name is jason bourne.
                              (sounds good)
                         hi, i'm jason. jason bourne. jason 
                         bourne, nice to meet you.

               back to -- the box -- the shallow tray on top. there's 
               kleenex. several sets of contact lenses. a knife. a comb. 
               three sticks of gum. a ring. a pair of sunglasses. a rolex.

               bourne setting these things aside.  lifting the top tray.  
               staring into the deep bottom tray and --

               first of all...

               money. lots of it. ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds. 
               lots of them. close to a million dollars. there's a gun. a 
               very good gun. several clips of ammo. and...

               five more passports. all clean. crisp. brand new. all with 
               his photo inside. five different names. three different 
               countries. each one of these pristine passports clipped to a 
               piece of card stock that says:

               name: 
               nationality: 
               place of issue: 
               signature sample:

               and a bar code. 
               two dutch passports. a french. a south african. a belgian.

               and...

               there's one piece of card stock still with the paper clip in 
               place. and no passport. this card reads:

               name: john michael kane 
               nationality: u.s.a. 
               place of issue: paris, france 
               there's a signature sample. 
               and a bar code. but no passport. this one is missing.

               bourne sitting there. trying to push his confusion away.

                                     bourne
                         bourne. my name is jason bourne. i 
                         live at 121, rue de la jardin, paris.

               but there's something hollow about this. he came looking for 
               one identity and now he's faced with six. the money... the 
               gun...

               suddenly, it's all fucked up.

               bourne into gear. looking around the room -- there -- there's 
               a pile of red canvas burn bags in the corner. bourne grabbing 
               one -- stuffing everything into it -- everything except...

               the gun. he doesn't want the gun. no guns.
