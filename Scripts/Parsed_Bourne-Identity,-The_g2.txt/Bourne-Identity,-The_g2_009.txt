               ext. fishing boat deck -- day

               the man alone doing chin-ups on the deck rail. he's still 
               bandaged and the wounds must hurt like hell, but he's pushing 
               himself. using the pain -- bathing in it -- maybe even hoping 
               that it will hold some answer for him.
