               int. the red car -- dusk

               bourne staring out the window. marie driving. long silence 
               until --

                                     marie
                         just so you know, if you're gonna 
                         burn me on the money, you might as 
                         well kill me.
                              (bourne looks over)
                         i was supposed to have this car back 
                         three days ago. it's not my car.

                                     bourne
                         i know that.

               marie staring at him -- glancing back to the road -- just in 
               time -- almost rear-ending a slow moving truck --

                                     marie
                         shit --
                              (trying to settle)
                         can i tell you how much you're 
                         freaking me out? okay? because you 
                         are -- you're completely freaking me 
                         out.

                                     bourne
                         i'm sorry. really. what do you want 
                         me to do?

                                     marie
                         i don't know. smile. sneeze. 
                         something. you've got a bag full of 
                         money and a ride to paris. fuck it, 
                         i don't know...
                              (the radio)
                         what kind of music do you like?

                                     bourne
                         i don't know.

                                     marie
                         what does that mean?

                                     bourne
                         listen to what you want.

                                     marie
                              (out of nowhere)
                         who pays twenty thousand dollars for 
                         a ride to paris?

               there it is. and she wants an answer --

                                     bourne
                         i don't know. i don't know who i am.

                                     marie
                         yeah, well, welcome to the club.

                                     bourne
                         no. no, i mean, i really don't know 
                         who i am. i can't remember anything 
                         earlier than two weeks ago.
                              (it's not flying)
                         i'm serious.

                                     marie
                         what? like amnesia?

                                     bourne
                         look, go ahead... put the radio on...

                                     marie
                         amnesia?
                              (total incredulity)
                         you're saying you don't remember 
                         anything that happened before two 
                         weeks ago?

                                     bourne
                         that's what i'm saying.

                                     marie
                              (german)
                         give me a fucking break.

               bourne staring at her. she's furious. she's downshifting -- 
               she's accelerating -- pulling out to pass the truck on a 
               blind turn, as we --
