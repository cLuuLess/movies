               int. paris apartment building foyer -- night

               bourne and marie standing at the directory. five apartments. 
               one per floor. five names. a buzzer. an intercom. there it 
               is.

               j. bourne.

               bourne presses the buzzer. after a moment, he presses again. 
               nothing.

                                     marie
                         i guess you're not home.

               bourne checking the door. how to pop it open? just about to 
               get into it, when --

                                     concierge (o.s.)
                              (from the shadows 
                              inside --)
                         monsieur bourne...i'm coming...

               the concierge is sixty. plump and proper.

                                     concierge
                              (opening the door --)
                         mr. bourne, there you are -- i was 
                         wondering -- i haven't seen you --

                                     bourne
                         here i am.

               the concierge looking at bourne like maybe she's never seen 
               him look like this before. and she's looking at marie like 
               here's the reason her tenant looks like such shit.

                                     bourne
                              (he tries a smile)
                          i seem to have lost my key.

               the concierge nods. instant chilly disapproval.

                                     concierge
                         i've been ringing your bell. it's 
                         good you were away. we had some 
                         trouble with the hot water. it's 
                         been repaired.

                                     bourne
                         great. we could use a shower.
                              (they look like shit --)
                         it was a long drive.

               the concierge steps aside and --
