               int. zurich airport hotel room -- night

               one of those rooms. just a plain functional box. manheim 
               laying on the bed. fully dressed. suit and tie. just laying 
               there, staring at the ceiling. who knows how long he's been 
               like this.

               just waiting.

               on the nightstand -- a gun. a knife. his e-phone pager. his 
               fresh credentials. and a photo of jason bourne.
