               int. the hotel room -- night

               it's a shitty little room. bourne sitting on the bed. and 
               the smoke is coming from...

               his passport -- the jason bourne passport -- on fire. bourne 
               holding it as it burns away. bourne's face -- melting -- 
               bubbling -- finally disappearing, -- bourne letting go just 
               before it burns his fingers and --

               bourne sits back. and there's marie standing there. and she's 
               holding out her passport --

               he looks at her. big moment.

                                     bourne
                         no.
                              (he won't do it)
                         you know who you are. you know what 
                         that's worth? that's everything.
                              (pause)
                         i can't live like this. i can't do 
                         anything until i know who i am. 
                         believe me, you don't want what i 
                         have.

               he looks away. silence. and then, she touches him. his 
               shoulder.

               bourne almost recoils. almost. he doesn't know what to do. 
               doesn't know how to react.

               marie in front of him now -- she's taking his hand -- and he 
               hesitates -- looking at her -- is this happening? -- she's 
               taking his hand -- moving it down her body -- staring at him -- 
               both of them silent -- his hand -- her skin -- his mind racing -- 
               he wants this -- wants it in every way -- but it's 
               overwhelming -- when was the last time something like this 
               happened? -- he can't remember -- he doesn't care -- he's 
               pulling her toward him -- and they're kissing -- and you 
               know the rest...
