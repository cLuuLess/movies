               ext. ocean -- night

               the darkness is actually water. a searchlight arcs across 
               heavy ocean swells. half-a-dozen flashlights -- weaker beams -- 
               racing along what we can see is the deck of an aging fishing 
               trawler.

               fishermen struggling with a gaff -- something in the water --

               a human corpse.
