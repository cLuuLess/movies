               int. u.s. consulate -- visa room -- day

               bourne on line. fear meter rising by the minute.

               bourne's pov

               scanning the room -- the perimeter -- the people -- a turkish 
               man almost in tears as he tries to explain his case to a 
               desk clerk -- two american backpackers that have lost their 
               passports -- marie still in the midst of her madness -- a 
               security camera high on the wall capturing everything -- 
               lots of data -- too much going on and --

                                     man on line (o.s.)
                              (from behind him)
                         you're up.

               bourne comes to. shit. it's his turn.

               a woman clerk waving him forward. bourne trying to think -- 
               what the fuck is he doing? -- what's he gonna say? -- now 
               he's at the window, and if he was looking for a friendly 
               face, he came to the wrong place --

                                     woman clerk
                              (cold shit)
                         you're a u.s. citizen?

                                     bourne
                         yes.
                              (pause)
                         i mean, i think so. yes. yes...

                                     woman clerk
                         well, either you are, or you aren't.

                                     bourne
                         right.

                                     woman clerk
                         you have your passport?

                                     bourne
                         i have a passport. i've got...
                              (the bag there, but...)
                         actually, it's a little complicated.

                                     woman clerk
                         do you have your passport, sir?

                                     bourne
                         look, maybe i should just...

                                     woman clerk
                         sir, you waited on line.

                                     bourne
                         yeah, i know...

               but he's already bailing, walking away from the woman, the 
               window, the room -- he's out of here --
