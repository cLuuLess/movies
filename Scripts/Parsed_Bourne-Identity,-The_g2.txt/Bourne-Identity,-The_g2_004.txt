               int. fishing boat bunk room -- dawn -- time cuts

               transformed into a makeshift operating room. a light swings 
               overhead. the man layed out across the table. sounds -- groans -- 
               words -- snatches of them -- all in different languages.

               giancarlo playing doctor in a greasy kitchen apron. cutting 
               away the clothes. turning the man on his side. two bullet 
               wounds in the back. probing them, judging them.

               now -- giancarlo with a flashlight in his teeth -- tink -- 
               tink -- tink -- bullet fragments falling into a washed-out 
               olive jar.

               now -- something catching giancarlo's eye -- a scar on the 
               man's hip -- another fragment -- exacto knife cutting in -- 
               tweezers extracting a small plastic tube, not a bullet at 
               all, and as it comes free --

               the man's hand slams down onto giancarlo's and we smash cut 
               into a --

               first person pov -- we are staring up at --

                                     giancarlo
                         you're awake. can you hear me?
                              (we're blinking --)
                         you've been shot. i'm trying to help 
                         you.
                              (we're trying to find 
                              our voice --)
                         you were in the water. you've been 
                         shot. it's okay now.

                                     the man
                         where am i?

                                     giancarlo
                              (switching to english)
                         you're american. i thought so. from 
                         your teeth -- the dental work --

                                     the man
                         where am i?

                                     giancarlo
                         you're on a boat. a fishing boat. 
                         italian flag. we're out of vietri.
                              (he smiles)
                         it's the cold that saved you. the 
                         water. the wounds are clean. i'm not 
                         a doctor, but the wounds, it looks 
                         okay. it's clean.

                                     the man
                         how did i get here?

                                     giancarlo
                         you we're lost at sea. they pulled 
                         you out.
                              (we say nothing)
                         who are you?
                              (still nothing)
                         you were shot -- two bullets -- in 
                         the back. you understand me?
                              (we try to nod)
                         who are you?

               long dead pause.

                                     the man
                         i don't know.
