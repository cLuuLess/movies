               ext. fishing boat deck -- night

               the man stands at the rail, staring out to sea. so lost. he 
               turns to head inside -- there, a surfcasting rod propped 
               against a locker.

               the man picks up the rod -- flips the bail -- traps the line -- 
               now he's casting far out into the darkness. and for the first 
               time, he smiles.
