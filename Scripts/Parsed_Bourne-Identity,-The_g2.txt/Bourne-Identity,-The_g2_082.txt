               int. the little red car -- day

               marie driving. bourne checking building numbers as they pass --

                                     bourne
                         slow down. no, don't stop. just...

                                     marie
                              (looking over)
                         that's it? is that it?

               an apartment building. big building. elegant but cold.

                                     bourne
                         four-fifty. that's the address...

                                     marie
                         looks familiar?

                                     bourne
                         no.
                              (staring back as they 
                              pass --)
                         no. go around. keep going...

               marie pulling up -- turning a corner -- watching him as she 
               does. but he's pre-occupied -- eyes scanning -- taking it 
               all in --

                                     marie
                         where?

                                     bourne
                         yeah. pull in here. park it.

               marie angles into an alleyway. cuts the engine.

                                     marie
                         so this is it, right?

                                     bourne
                         i guess.

               dead pause. she's waiting. he's still scanning the street.

                                     marie
                         i should go.

                                     bourne
                         i don't remember any of this.

                                     marie
                         jason...

               he turns back. she's staring at him.

                                     bourne
                         sorry. the money, right?

               before she can say anything, he's digging in the backpack. 
               he pulls out another stack of hundreds. hands it over. she 
               takes it. it's not what she wanted, but she's used to being 
               disappointed. fighting it.

                                     marie
                         okay, so...

                                     bourne
                         thanks for the ride.

                                     marie
                         anytime.

               silence. that moment. he focuses. getting it.

                                     bourne
                         look, i don't know what's up there.

                                     marie
                         you got me pretty fucking curious.

                                     bourne
                         look, you could come up. or you could 
                         wait if you want. i could go check 
                         it out. you could wait.

                                     marie
                         nah...
                              (hide the pain)
                         with you, i mean, you'd probably 
                         just forget about me, right?

                                     bourne
                         how could i forget about you?
                              (he smiles)
                         you're the only person i know.

               marie smiles. we've never seen it before. worth waiting for.
