               abbott with coffee. conklin not lingering.

                         storm clouds are gathering, ted. it 
                         looks like rain and i don't have a 
                         thing to wear.

                                     conklin
                         i don't know what we're talking about.

                                     abbott
                         we're talking about marseille. we're 
                         talking about nykwana wombosi. and 
                         i'm asking you if this abortion in 
                         marseille has anything to do with 
                         treadstone.
                              (silence)
                         was this treadstone?

                                     conklin
                         you're asking me a direct question?

                                     abbott
                         yes.

                                     conklin
                         i thought you were never going to do 
                         that.

               silence. pressure drop.

                                     abbott
                         they're putting together an agency 
                         oversight committee. they're going 
                         to look through everyone's budgets. 
                         treadstone is a rather sizable line 
                         item in my ledger.
                              (beat)
                         what am i going to do about that?

                                     conklin
                         you'd want to make that go away. 
                         you'd want to remind them that 
                         treadstone is a training organization. 
                         that it's all theoretical. you'd 
                         want to sign off on that.

                                     abbott
                         and what if i couldn't do that?

                                     conklin
                         then i'd have to explain treadstone. 
                         and you'd have to explain how you 
                         let me get this far.
                              (silence)
                         doesn't sound like much of a plan-b, 
                         does it?
                              (abbott staring)
                         we'll clean up the field. you clean 
                         up your budgets.
