               int. treadstone conklin's office -- day

               marie's face -- a passport photo -- she's eighteen -- she's 
               smiling -- really alive and fresh and --

               conklin behind his desk. abbott staring grimly at the picture --

                                     abbott
                         who is she?

                                     zorn
                         marie helene kreutz. she's twenty- 
                         six. born outside munich. father was 
                         a welder. he died in '91. we don't 
                         have the mother. there might be a 
                         step-sister, we're trying to track 
                         that down.
                              (apologetic)
                         it's tough. she's a wanderer. she 
                         pops up on the grid here and there 
                         but... i mean, the last time she 
                         paid an electric bill in europe was 
                         '94. no taxes. no steady employer. 
                         she's got three arrests. two 
                         shoplifting cases, one in spain, one 
                         in germany. and she actually did 
                         three months in an italian detention 
                         center for credit card fraud.

                                     abbott
                         no political affiliations?

                                     conklin
                         she's a gypsy. if it's a cover, it's 
                         a great one.

                                     abbott
                         i'm assuming we're exploring that 
                         possibility.

                                     conklin
                         we're exploring every possibility.
                              (tighter by the moment)
                         we are in pursuit. how much more do 
                         you want me to tell you?

                                     abbott
                         pursuit would indicate that you know 
                         exactly where he is.

                                     conklin
                         no. pursuit ends when we know exactly 
                         where he is.

                                     abbott
                         yes, well, i think we need some fresh 
                         eyes on this problem. i'm bringing 
                         in some people from upstairs.

               conklin hesitates. inside he's screaming.

                                     conklin
                         we've been down here for two weeks 
                         banging our heads against the wall. 
                         we've been sleeping down here. we 
                         just got our first lead fourteen 
                         hours ago, and now? -- now that we 
                         finally have something to work with -- 
                         you want to bring planning personnel 
                         down here?
                              (real steam)
                         i'd rethink that.

                                     abbott
                         i want a second opinion.

                                     conklin
                         this is an operations desk.

                                     abbott
                         i'm not asking.
