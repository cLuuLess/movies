               int. treadstone research desk -- night

               conklin and the research techs jamming on the console --

                                     conklin
                         -- let's check that interpol window 
                         again --

                                     research tech #1
                         -- i'm on it --

                                     conklin
                         -- i want that red car -- the girl -- 
                         we gotta get lucky here --

                                     research tech #2
                         sir.
                              (conklin turns --)
                         i've got a code here from nsa -- 
                         they're not gonna give us keyhole 
                         satellite clearance unless we have 
                         sign-off from upstairs.

               conklin turns and --

                                     abbott
                         no.
                              (sitting there tensely)
                         we can't risk it.

                                     conklin
                         our last sighting was forty-eight 
                         hours ago. even if they stayed in 
                         the car, the grid is huge.
                              (please)
                         this is it. he's trained -- 
                         conditioned -- they're built to 
                         disappear. you give him another day 
                         to run and we may never find him.

                                     abbott
                         this doesn't go upstairs.

               conklin left hanging. abbott clear on this one.
