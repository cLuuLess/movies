               int. fishing boat bunk room -- day

               giancarlo is hunched over a desk -- tweezers and flashlight -- 
               busy working at that strange plastic tube that came out of 
               the man's hip.

               the man is bandaged. he's sitting up, and it must hurt like 
               hell, but physical pain is not the thing troubling him right 
               now. he's staring around the room -- at his body -- at the 
               walls -- haunted --

                                     the man
                         what if it doesn't come back?

                                     giancarlo
                              (still working that 
                              tube)
                         i told you. you need to rest.

               silence. the man can't rest. too busy trying to make sense 
               of all this.

                                     the man
                         i can read. i can read that sign on 
                         the door. i can count. i can talk...
                              (focusing now --)
                         what are you doing?

               giancarlo rummaging around -- finding a magnifying glass --

                                     the man
                         what is that?

               insert -- magnified pov -- a slip of plastic from the tube -- 
               written there -- 000-7-17-12-0-14-26.  gemeinschaft bank, 
               zurich.

                                     giancarlo
                         it came from your hip. under the 
                         skin.
                              (turning back --)
                         you have a bank in zurich.
                              (waiting)
                         you remember zurich?

                                     the man
                         no.

               giancarlo staring at him now. different suddenly. suspicious.

                                     giancarlo
                         look, i'm just on this boat, okay? 
                         i'm an engineer. whatever this is, 
                         it's not for me to be involved, okay?

                                     the man
                         i don't remember zurich.

               giancarlo pulls his pint. takes a hit.

                                     giancarlo
                              (offering the bottle --)
                         you drink rum?

                                     the man
                         i don't know.
