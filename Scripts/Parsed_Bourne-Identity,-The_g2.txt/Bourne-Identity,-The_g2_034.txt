               int. u.s. consulate zurich -- visa room -- day

               the passport and visa office. big room. no windows. unpleasant 
               on purpose. two lines: a short one for u.s.  citizens, a 
               marathon for everyone else. consulate clerks stationed in 
               open cubicles along the back wall. and it's a zoo. american 
               tourists who've lost their passports. foreigners looking for 
               visas. asylum seekers. everyone here has a problem.

               bourne on the u.s. line. standing there trying to think. 
               what's he gonna say? what can he say? with the cops outside, 
               and the incident in the park, then the bank...

                         -- no, this is not my current address. 
                         it was my current address two days 
                         ago when i started standing in line 
                         outside --

               a nearby cubicle. meet marie kreutz. german. big energy. 
               real beauty hidden beneath the armor. and armor it is, because 
               this is a warrior in full, crisis battlemode.

                                     marie
                         -- and so now i lost my apartment, i 
                         have no address, and i have no visa, 
                         and you keep telling me how much 
                         help you cannot give me!

               a consulate clerk caught in her headlights.

                                     clerk
                         miss kreutz, please... i'm gonna 
                         have to ask you to keep your voice 
                         down.

                                     marie
                         all the papers -- all the papers 
                         they asked for -- i brought all the 
                         papers --

                                     clerk
                         miss kreutz, excuse me, but you 
                         entered into a fraudulent marriage 
                         in an effort to circumvent the 
                         immigration laws of the united states --

                                     marie
                         you only know that because i told 
                         you!
                              (she's incredulous)
                         ask the case officer -- find his 
                         name -- it's on the papers -- i told 
                         him all this myself! --
                              (tearing through the 
                              papers now --)

                                     clerk
                         -- it's not the source of the 
                         information that's important here --

                                     marie
                         -- i paid this fucking guy -- i paid 
                         him four thousand dollars -- my last 
                         four thousand dollars to marry me, 
                         okay? -- i told this to the case 
                         officer last week...
                              (she's found it --)
                         ...here -- mr. thomas. i told mr.  
                         thomas i didn't know this guy was 
                         already married -- i admitted this!

                                     clerk
                         -- miss kreutz, please --

                                     marie
                         -- i'm the one that got ripped off! -- 
                         not you -- not the united states 
                         government -- me -- i'm the one being 
                         ripped off!

                                     clerk
                         so now you're asking for a student 
                         visa?

               that shuts her up. yes. today she's a student.
