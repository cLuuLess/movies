               int. u.s. consulate fifth floor grand hallway -- day

               completely clogged now -- panicked trade people all over -- 
               embassy types -- trying to herd them toward the main stairs -- 
               everyone talking at once -- that alarm still blaring and --

                                     voice (o.s.)
                         -- no! -- the other way! -- take the 
                         backstairs! -- the backstairs! -- 
                         he's on the other side -- there's a 
                         bomb! --

               and as the crowd reacts -- as they mob back away from the 
               main stairway -- we see -- holy shit, the guy yelling was 
               bourne --
