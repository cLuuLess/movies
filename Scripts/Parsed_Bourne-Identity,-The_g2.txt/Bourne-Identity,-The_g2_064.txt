               ext. a road on the outskirts of zurich -- day

               the little red car parked. marie pacing around. bourne poring 
               over a map spread out over the hood.

                                     marie
                         so what's in paris?

                                     bourne
                         i want to go home.

                                     marie
                         for twenty thousand dollars.

               bourne looks back from the map.

                                     bourne
                         i said ten thousand.

                                     marie
                         you have blood on your pants.

                                     bourne
                         okay.
                              (beat)
                         twenty thousand. ten now. ten there.

                                     marie
                         no. no, that was too easy --
                              (pacing away --)

                                     bourne
                         wait up --
                              (after her now --)
                         -- just wait up --

                                     marie
                         -- get the fuck out of here -- all 
                         this money, this crazy offer, i mean 
                         give me a fucking break with this, 
                         this is --
                              (stopping because--)

               bourne just grabbed her. both of them shocked that he's done 
               this. he immediately pulls back.

                                     bourne
                         look, i want a ride to paris.
                              (wide open now)
                         that's all i want. i swear.

                                     marie
                         you swear?
                              (cold here)
                         that's great. i feel so much better 
                         now.

                                     bourne
                         i don't want anything but a ride. 
                         all i want to do is go home.

               silence now. she looks back. measuring him.

                                     marie
                         you could buy a car for twenty grand. 
                         you could buy this car.

                                     bourne
                         i don't want to go alone. i want you 
                         to drive me to paris. like we're a 
                         couple. like we're a couple and we're 
                         travelling together. that's all we're 
                         doing.

                                     marie
                         and i don't get hurt. i get twenty 
                         thousand dollars and i don't get 
                         hurt.

                                     bourne
                         i won't hurt you.

                                     marie
                         what if i say no?

                                     bourne
                         then i'll find another ride.
