               int. fishing boat galley -- night

               a ratty old espresso machine. the man standing there, staring 
               at the thing like it's a test. then his hands begin to move -- 
               trying to pack a grind -- trying to fit it in -- turning on 
               the steam and --

               the whole thing explodes.
