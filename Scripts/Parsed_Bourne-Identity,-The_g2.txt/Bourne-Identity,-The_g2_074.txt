               int. truckstop cafe -- night

               it's a weird spot. open all night. but euro-style. quiet 
               tonight. a few alpen-truckers chowing down. a local or two 
               at the bar and --

               bourne and marie at a back table. drinking coffee. he's got 
               the red bag open. all the passports -- the personal junk -- 
               the money -- all the shit from the zurich bank box -- he's 
               been showing it to her --

               and he's got her attention now.

                                     marie
                         and you have no idea -- not a clue -- 
                         what came before that?

                                     bourne
                         no.

                                     marie
                         when you think of it, before the 
                         ship -- before you wake up on the 
                         ship, what do you see?

                                     bourne
                         nothing. it's just not there.

                                     marie
                         well, this is great.
                              (she sits back)
                         i'm sick of myself and you have no 
                         idea who you are.

                                     bourne
                         i kept trying things, i thought if i 
                         could find all the things i could 
                         do, i could --

                                     marie
                         -- you could put it together --

                                     bourne
                         -- which was okay for a while, i was 
                         okay with it...
                              (hesitating now)
                         but then -- there's all these other 
                         things -- all these other things i 
                         know how to do -- and this -- this 
                         stuff from the bank and...
                              (suddenly flat out --)
                         i think something bad happened.

                                     marie
                         what are you talking about?

                                     bourne
                         i don't know.

                                     marie
                         sounds like you were in an accident 
                         or something.

                                     bourne
                         i was shot twice in the back.

                                     marie
                         okay, so you're a victim.

                                     bourne
                         there was a gun. who has a safe 
                         deposit box with a gun and all this 
                         money and all these passports?

                                     marie
                         lots of people have guns. you're 
                         american. americans love guns.

                                     bourne
                         i fought my way out of an embassy.  
                         i climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- 
                         i went out the window and i was doing 
                         it -- i just did it. i knew how to 
                         do it.

                                     marie
                         people do amazing things when they're 
                         scared.

                                     bourne
                         why do i? -- i come in here -- 
                         instinctively -- first thing i do -- 
                         i'm looking for the exit -- i'm 
                         catching the sightlines -- i know i 
                         can't sit with my back to the door --

                                     marie
                         you're paranoid. you were shot. it's 
                         natural.

               she's not listening. he leans in. flat out now.

                                     bourne
                         i can tell you the license plate 
                         numbers of all three cars out front. 
                         i can tell you that the waitress is 
                         left-handed and the guy at the counter 
                         weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds 
                         and knows how to handle himself. i 
                         know that the best, first place to 
                         look for a gun is the cab of that 
                         grey truck outside. i know that at 
                         this altitude i can run flat out for 
                         half a mile before i lose my edge. i 
                         knew that you were my first, best 
                         option out of zurich? how do i know 
                         all that? how can i know all that 
                         and not know who i am? how is that 
                         possible?

               long dead pause.

                                     marie
                         god, you're not kidding, are you?
