               ext. belleville -- street -- day

               and bourne and marie are running. and he is reaching into 
               his pocket -- fishing around -- and just as he pulls out the 
               car keys -- we recognize this as the street they parked their 
               car on and --

               by marie's car

               bourne unlocks the door -- pops marie's open. and --

               there's a cop -- yelling at them and -- bourne hits the gas -- 
               they fly out of their parking space -- bam!! the cop fires, 
               shattering their windshield and there -- up ahead -- the 
               professor coming out -- about to fire -- bourne aims for him -- 
               forces him to dive out of the way and -- one quick move around 
               a truck and they are free.
