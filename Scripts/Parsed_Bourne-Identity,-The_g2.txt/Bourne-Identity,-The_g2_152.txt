               ext. treadstone paris -- night

               conklin done with the dirty work -- out into the street --

               as he's about to leave -- he hears a sound -- a familiar 
               sound -- hum -- hum -- hum --

               he cross the street -- looks down to the quai below --

               holy shit -- there's one of his e-phone pagers --

               he goes down -- picks it up --

               and now --

                                     bourne
                         what did you do to me?

               conklin wheels around. there he is. right behind him.

                                     conklin
                         what did i do? what've you done? do 
                         you have any idea? any conception? 
                         what you've destroyed? do you have 
                         any idea how much time and work -- 
                         how many people have their lives 
                         wrapped up in this?

               so now you know.

                                     bourne
                         are you treadstone?

                                     conklin
                         am i treadstone? me?
                              (peering at him closely 
                              now --)
                         what the hell're you talking about?

               bourne showing nothing -- or is he trying too hard not to?

                                     bourne
                         what did you do to me?

                                     conklin
                         what did i do? i spent thirty million 
                         dollars on you. i spent three years 
                         finding you -- four years training 
                         you --
                              (incredulous)
                         what did i do?
                              (staring now)
                         what in the name of god have you 
                         been doing, jason?

                                     bourne
                         i don't know.

                                     conklin
                         they're right about you, aren't they? 
                         you're fried.
                              (on it now)
                         you really don't know what's going 
                         on, do you?

                                     bourne
                         i know you've been trying to kill 
                         me.

                                     conklin
                         of course. we had to try. we didn't 
                         know what was wrong.
                              (warming to this --)
                         we didn't know you were in trouble.

                                     bourne
                         so now you know.

                                     conklin
                         so it's time to go home.

                                     bourne
                         that's all i get?

                                     conklin
                         we'll make you better. we can put 
                         the pieces back. we can do that.

                                     bourne
                         i don't think so.

                                     conklin
                         we have to go home, jason.

                                     bourne
                         jason bourne is dead.

                                     conklin
                         there never was a jason bourne.
                              (that gets him)
                         you have to come with me. it's the 
                         only way. we can give it back to 
                         you...

                                     bourne
                         keep it.
                              (and he's walking --)

                                     conklin
                         jason...
                              (trying to follow --)
                         they can't let you go...

                                     bourne
                         that'll be their second worst mistake.

               and with that, bourne scrambles up a wall -- like it's nothing -- 
               conklin just left there -- on the quai -- in the dark --
