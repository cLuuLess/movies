               int. fishing boat bunk room -- night

               a wreck. too small for all the people in here right now -- 
               sailors sweeping off the table -- rough hands laying the man 
               down --

               the captain -- brutal and impatient -- watching from the 
               door as --

               giancarlo tears through the clutter -- searching for a medical 
               kit buried in the shambles. giancarlo is sixty. a bloodshot 
               soul.

                                     giancarlo
                         -- it's here -- hang on -- it's here 
                         somewhere -- give me a minute -- get 
                         some blankets -- get some blankets 
                         on him --
                              (finding the kit --)
                         -- here we go -- here it is --

               giancarlo with an old trunk -- just getting it open, as --

                                     the captain
                         giancarlo.
                              (giancarlo turns back --)
                         we pick him up? okay, we have to 
                         pick him up. but that's as far as it 
                         goes.

                                     giancarlo
                         he needs a doctor.

                                     captain
                         fuck that. he lives? he dies? i don't 
                         care. we've wasted two hours on this 
                         shit already. you do what you can, 
                         but we're not going back.
                              (pure steel now)
                         you understand me?

                                     giancarlo
                         yes, sir.

                                     captain
                              (to the rest of them)
                         let's get back to work!

               giancarlo watching them run out. snagging a quick pull on a 
               pint of rum he's got stashed and --
