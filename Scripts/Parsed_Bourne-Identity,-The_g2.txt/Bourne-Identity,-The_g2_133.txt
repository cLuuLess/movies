               ext. belleville -- quiet street -- day

               and bourne and marie are hurrying down this street when -- 
               bam -- the professor comes out of a building -- across and 
               down the street. no time to hide -- he's seen them -- he's 
               firing.

               bourne tackles marie to the ground behind a car. ratatat -- 
               the professor is literally shredding it. and now bourne is 
               moving --

                                     marie
                         what are you doing?

               and bourne is on the offensive. bam! bam! moving towards the 
               professor who is ducking behind cars on the other side.

               they are shredding the street -- firing ruthlessly at each 
               other and -- now the police are here -- blocking both ends 
               of the street. guns are drawn -- bourne's vulnerable on two 
               flanks. the cops are yelling. and now --

               the professor blasts the cops -- and now things have changed.

               three way firefight and bourne grabs marie and they dive 
               into --
