ext. rest stop

morpheus charges smith.  smith ignores reloads  him, and sights  in on
the exposed back of niobe as she is reaching up to put the phone  back
on the  hook. as  the sights  rest right  between her shoulder blades,
morpheus grabs his gun with both hands. he squeezes off one shot,  the
action freeze  back on  an empty  chamber, before  morpheus throws his
hands up in the air

the shot ricochets clips niobeÂ’s ear and ricochets off the booth.  she
hangs up the phone and touches the blood of her ear. the phone  rings.
she looks at it, then back at morpheus and smith, raising dust as they
fight.

she leaves the ringing phone and runs to join the fight.
