int. main deck

the ships operator, a lean asian  kid with a gaze like a  laser scan,
sits behind  neo, whos  sitting at  the operators  console with  his
hands on the abbreviated keyboard. trinity sits with them, her feet up
as she observes.

neo  stares  at  the  screen. its  a  huge  syllabus  of matrix  code
characters. he struggles to learn the complex code.

                                 neo

          "ka equals 9. but reverse ka is point-nine, right?

                             razor nods.

                                razor

                      "you catch on quick, man."

                                 neo

"i know these symbols from the hacking trainer. but how come its so
                 hard to find them on the keyboard?"

                               trinity

"your brain knows what to do. but it has to associate characters with
                             your body."

                                razor

"its muscle memory, neo. think of the space bar and your thumbs nail
it. because your thumbs have hit the space bar millions of times. but
think about reverse ka, and your fingers dont hit automatically hit
            the reverse key and the ka key in one shot."

                                 neo

             "where did these symbols come from, anyway?"

                                razor

"most of it is from the old japanese. its katakana. see, the machines
 arent binary. no zero and one. theyre quantum-based, so instead of
   an open-close base of zero or one, open or closed, they use all
                    numbers between zero and one."

                                 neo

"all numbers between zero and one. that could be an infinite number of
                              numbers."

                                razor

                        "not could be, it is."

                          neo is astounded.

                                 neo

            "holy shit. how many calculations per second?"

                                razor

"how many cps? well, thats kind of hard to estimate. put it this way:
 picture all the particles in the known universe. not just atoms, but
              sub-atomic particles that compose atoms."

                                 neo

"ok. at last count that was what, a gazillion, right? two gazillion?"

                   razor barely smiles at the joke.

                                razor

  "well, its up there. in any case, the number of calculations per
second the matrix can perform is greater than the estimated number of
                  particles in the known universe."

                                 neo

                               "woah."

                               trinity

  "thats how they have the operating power to create entire worlds
                          within their pcs."

                                 neo

 "ok. thats why it looks like reality. they have the computing power
                      to create entire worlds."

                                razor

                               "right."

                                 neo

  "so, if we hack into the matrix, why cant we just change the code
                         while were at it?"

                                razor

 "no, no. see, its not that simple. the machines, the programs that
 code, create, and maintain the matrix, the agents, they are code.
    there are different types of agents, many work unseen with no
interaction in the matrix. then, there are the enforcers, the ones we
                         know all too well."

                                 neo

                               "right."

                                razor

 "well, my point is, the machines code and recode the matrix by pure
will. interaction with the matrix, the physical act of being there,
 by default, allows people to change their environment - the matrix.
            they move objects, make sound, affect cause."

                                 neo

                           "like reality."

                               trinity

  "almost. reality is unalterable. but the fabric of reality in the
   matrix can be rewoven. some can reach beyond normal cause. their
 affects on the matrix are deeper than average. they have learned to
change it according to their needs. but they dont have total control.
thats why we need operators like razor here. but you, you go further
                         than any of us can."

                                 neo


                                "how?"

razor stands  and taps  neos skull.  he stretches,  grabs a  japanese
style  wooden  sword, and,  out  of boredom,  starts  performing slow,
precise kendo moves around the main deck as he talks.

                                razor

"the equipment you carry up here. youre a freak. a good freak. youre
  neural kinetics blast past those of average humans. this, combined
   with your ability to suspend disbelief, allow you to change the
                       reality of the matrix."

                                 neo

                   "how did i end up as... a freak?"

             razor practices the same strike a few times.

                                razor

  "good question. the machines create people through cloning, since,
obviously, no coppertops have physical sex. theoretically, all clones
  in the matrix are exactly the same as when the first clones. they
         shouldnt be any different from normal, homegrowns."

                                 neo

                   "ok, so how do you explain me?"

                               trinity

      "not just you. morpheus, myself. we were all born inside.

                                 neo

                "well, what separates us from others?"

                               trinity

"for the past 50 years or so, something has been happening to children
 in the matrix. theyve been mutating, changing in ways the machines
   never predicted. some seem to gain faster reflexes and strength.
                 others seem to have psychic powers."

razor looks up to see morpheus,  hanging back as he listens. he  comes
forward.

                               morpheus

  "and others are able to change the reality of the matrix itself."

                          he points to neo.

                               morpheus

                    "discussing history, are we?"

                        razor shakes his head.

                                razor

 "im trying to teach this fool some programming, man. hes stuck in
     the 20^th century. hes got no skills, man. without us, hes
                              helpless."

                               morpheus

            "in the matrix, without him, were helpless."

                               trinity

         "morpheus, can you tell us what the mission is now?"

                               morpheus

  "not until we reach broadcast depth. its slow going out there. i
guess they know were coming back, so theyre patrolling. we have time
                         to rest and ready."
