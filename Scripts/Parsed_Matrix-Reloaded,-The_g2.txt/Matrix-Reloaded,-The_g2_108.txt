he exits into the street. the scene is one from hell.

under the neon  sky, fires are  frozen and smoke  columns hang in  the
air, still, like massive tree trunks.

the battle rages and surges,  a thousand smiths pouring onto  one neo.
all around, nearly covering the ground, are corpses, destroyed  bodies
abandoned  by the  agent. men  and women,  of all  ages and  designs,
smashed, decapitated and broken.

cu: neo

the smiths overwhelm him  with sheer numbers. neo  is a blur, a  human
chainsaw now,  crushing or  smashing them  all, but  they crowd on all
sides. the bodies pile up as they fall, and neo finds himself stepping
up the rubbery mass of corpses. a few more smashed smiths fall,  morph
back into their stolen forms, and neo is knee-deep in the dead.

he cant take it. choking, neo struggles to free himself. smiths climb
up the corpse pile and drop onto him, pounding viciously. neo  stalls,
in shock, his eyes  locked with the lifeless  blue eyes of a  woman he
just killed. she looks amazingly like trinity.

perhaps for the first time, he is confronted with the consequences  of
this war, and his mind seizes as the smiths pummel him.

neo goes  berzerk! screaming  and fighting,  he claws  his way out and
surges into the wall of agents. they throw him back, and he cant kill
them fast  enough. he  leaps upward,  trying to  fly away,  but smiths
cling on to him, and cling on to each other.
