ext. building rooftop

morpheus and niobe  stand atop a  building a few  blocks away, looking
toward the metacortex building.

                             angle on neo

he fixes his gaze on the building, then lowers his head and closes his
eyes.

the building tremors slightly, like  a heat mirage. slowly, it  starts
moving downward.

angle on: the first  level. the exterior glass  disappears, vaporizing
in a million crystal shards that melt into the air, exposing the  hive
of office cubicles and corridors within.

the walls, desks and cubicles vaporize, leaving a few hundred  people
- office  workers, security,  maintenance men,  standing with  nothing
between them.

              the massive load bearing members vaporize.

cut to: the bottom of the building. one can look straight through  the
entire  building.  we go  through  the empty  building,  passing dazed
people, until we pass out the other side, and come to neo.

he looks up. the office  building is supported by nothing.  slowly, it
descends on the stunned people. they rush, screaming, some laughing in
hysteria, before the ceiling can come down on them. the last few  flee
just before  the ceiling  touches the  ground. the  second floor melts
away just like the first.
