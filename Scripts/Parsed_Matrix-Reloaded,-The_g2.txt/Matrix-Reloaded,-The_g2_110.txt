ext. alley (matrix) day

the sky and matrix are still  frozen. trinity and choi make their  way
along cautiously, leapfrogging from cover to cover. they pause  behind
a dumpster, and  just before looking  out, theres the  sound of metal
tapping metal, twice.

trinity looks in  the direction of  the sound. morpheus  and niobe are
standing still in the shadows, near the end of the alley. trinity  and
choi make their way to them.

trinity peeks  cautiously around  the edge.  on the  other side of the
street is a phone booth.

                               trinity

                            "is it clear?"

                               morpheus

                         "i smell an ambush."

                                niobe

                         "me too. too quiet."

                   choi grips his gun and grimaces.

                                 choi

           "too quiet? the world is frozen. ill go first."

                        no one likes the idea.

real-time suddenly returns.  the lightning bolts  in the sky  suddenly
re-animate, thundering out of existence, making the four of them  jump
out of their skulls. the sounds of the city suddenly flood back.

on the street, people stir to  their feet. everyone is confused as  to
what happened.
