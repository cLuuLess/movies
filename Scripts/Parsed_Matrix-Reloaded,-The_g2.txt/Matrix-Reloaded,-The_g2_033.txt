ext. beach

a campfire blazes only a few  feet away from the high tide.  a billion
stars shine overhead as gregory and his biker gang, including the cop,
sit or  lie around  the fire.  a few  people are  still awake, and one
picks drunkenly at a guitar.

gregory stands,  throws a  blanket over  his shoulder,  and scoops  up
chandra. they make their way into the dunes.
