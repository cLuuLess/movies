int. tank turret

                           cu: tank gunner

his eye is glued to the tank  site and his trigger finger on the  fire
button.

                            pov: tank site

               the green crosshairs sit on neos chest.

                               cu: neo

his eyes open, but the building continues to collapse. he stares up at
a mirrored window, and somehow, straight into the eyes of:

                           cu: agent smith

                                smith

                             "open fire."

a wall of flame and fingers of tracers bursts from the skirmish lines.
the tracers grow into a cone of orange flame bearing down on neo as we
drop into bullet time.

the bullets sizzle  as tracers burn  off their backs.  the draw toward
him like  slugs. thousands  of bullets  fired at  perpendicular angles
close  in on  him. as  they draw  close to  one another  along almost
perpendicular paths, they tinkle and chime and bounce.

the bullets come to a stop, glowing as their tracers backs continue to
burn.  the world  is in  stop motion  as the  bullets stop,  turn 180
degrees, and  suddenly accelerate  back at  their origins.  faster and
fast they fly, until we drop back into real time.

the skirmish line  of troops is  ripped apart by  a hail of  their own
bullets.

cu: machine gunner. with an m-249 saw, he blazes away at neo, only  to
be shredded by his own bullets. a  private takes a shot at neo, and  a
bullet slaps into his  shoulder. realizing whats happening,  he drops
his weapon.

the soldiers are dropping like flies. the firing quickly subsides.

neo stands  alone in  the center,  unharmed. he  turns to the skirmish
lines.  the  surviving soldiers  drop  their weapons,  and  run. panic
ensues. only a few officers, ncos, and soldiers too amazed to think of
running remain.
