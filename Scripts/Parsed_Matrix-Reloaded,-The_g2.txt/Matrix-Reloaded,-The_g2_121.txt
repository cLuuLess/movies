ext. street (matrix) - day

soldiers pick themselves up  just in time to  hear another engine -  a
super powerful track bike, emerges from the burnt rubber smoke screen.
a wheely bar on the back of the bike keeps it from flipping around the
rear tire as it accelerates like a bullet out of a barrel. there isnt
even time to take a shot until shes gone.
