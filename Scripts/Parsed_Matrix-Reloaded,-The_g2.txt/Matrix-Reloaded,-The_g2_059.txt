ext. downtown street

neo walks  calmly, observing  the people  that filter  by. men, women,
children, all oblivious to their true nature.

a dirty homeless whino, nose  explosion red with burst blood  vessels,
is  staggering  along  the  edge of  the  crowd,  unseen  and ignored.
somehow, he catches neos eye.

                               homeless

                      "spare a quarter, buddy?"

                neo shakes his head, but still stares.

angle on  the homeless.  he mutters  something, and  reaches into  his
shopping cart to  open a garbage  bag. its filled  with twenty dollar
bills, thousands of them.

                                 neo

                      "how bout a quarter mil?"

the homeless  man is  astounded. as  he stands,  speechless, neo fades
back into the crowd.
