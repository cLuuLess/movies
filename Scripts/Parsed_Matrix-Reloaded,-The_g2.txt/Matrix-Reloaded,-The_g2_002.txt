int. nebachanezzer cockpit

the neb is slung between the two hovercraft, with the cockpit   facing
backwards.  trinity,  morpheus,  tank,  and  neo,  the  former  thomas
anderson, crowd the cockpit. helpless, the landscape speeds away  from
them, while a wall of red-eyed squiddies speeds to them.

it's been a mere two days  since the realization of neos powers   and
the defeat of agent smith. the slipstream whistles violently into  the
interior  of the  ship, and  the crew  is cold,  tired, haggard,   and
stressed beyond  belief as  they can  only watch  the action in  their
knocked-out ship.

                      morpheus is on a headset.

                               morpheus

                      "niobe, theyre closing."

                                niobe

                             "how many?"

                               morpheus

              "just a few. maybe two or three. hundred."
