ext. m1a2 abrams

we drop into bullet time as a cone of fire - bigger than the tank  and
the shape of a  pine tree, blows out  of the barrel, pushing  the tank
back. from the fire streaks a  heat round, white hot, leaving a  laser
like tracer as it bears down on neo.

                              real time

 the tracer stops in front of neo, and out of the air the heat round
  appears. suspended in air, it shakes with violence. it accelerates
        backwards, flying straight back into the tank barrel.
