ext. street (matrix) - day

gregory slows from a run. he looks back as police cars and  ambulances
race toward  the metacortex  building. he  cant shake  what hes just
witnessed. he looks forward, only to run into:

                             agent smith

             gregory freezes, then bursts into questions.

                               gregory

                    "what the fuck just happened?"

                                smith

         "we need you, gregory. will you help us stop this?"

          gregory is perplexed. resolve comes over his face.

                               gregory

                          "i can stop this?"

                                smith

                                "yes."

                               gregory

                 "alright. but how can i fight him?"

                                smith

                "i will give you the power you need."
