ext. rooftop

cu: agent brown

with  his hand  on his  ear piece,  he comes  out the  elevator door,
slowly. pistol drawn, he looks around the corner.

morpheus and niobe stand there, their backs to him.

without hesitating, he advances on them, blasting away with impunity.

the bodies of morpheus and  niobe are wracked by gunfire  and collapse
in a heap of bullet-ravaged flesh.

brown  walks  up  to the  corpses  and  kicks one  with  his  shoe. it
shimmers, and then disappears, followed by the other.
