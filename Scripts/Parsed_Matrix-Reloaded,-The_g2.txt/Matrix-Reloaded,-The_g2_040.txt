ext. gutted cruiser

the crumpled door is knocked out  of the frame. we see a  black loafer
step from the vehicle and a man in an immaculate black suit steps  out
slowly.

we rise  up from  the loafer.  as the  other cruisers  catch up to the
scene of the accident, agent brown watches. he looks into the desert.

                a police lieutenant approaches brown.

                              lieutenant

                       "sir, should we pursue?"

                             agent brown

 "withdraw your men and pursue the others. we have our own plans for
                              this one."
