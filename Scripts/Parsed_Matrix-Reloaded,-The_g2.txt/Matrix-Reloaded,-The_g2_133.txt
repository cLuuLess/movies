int. main deck (night)

razor clears the  screen in front  of him and  cracks his fingers.  he
looks at circa.

                                circa

                            "theyre ok?"

                                razor

           "gotta get em out. they need an exit program."

cu: keyboard.  razors fingers  fly at  inhuman speeds  over the keys.
data  pours down  the console  as he  blazes away.  finally, he  hits
enter so hard it rocks the station.

razor  turns to  circa as  matrix code  resumes its  cascade down  the
screens.

                                razor

                      "yes! did you like that?"

                      circa just rolls her eyes.
