int. sephora cockpit

                              man (v.o.)

                 "theyre on me! shit! losing power!"

niobes lieutenant, a muscular asian woman, circa, notes something  on
a console.

                                circa

                      "multiple bogies closing!"

                                niobe

                              "no shit."

                                circa

                          "from the front!"

niobe is grim faced as she peers into the sky ahead. several  objects
are closing in fast.

                                circa

                            "are they - "

she doesn't have time to finish the question, as the oncoming fighters
launch a massive  volley of missiles.  from afar, they  look like dark
irises  surrounded by  a corona  of flame.  at first,  we can't   tell
exactly what they  are, until their  fiery trails rip  straight at the
sephora cockpit.

circa ducks as the missiles harmlessly streak by.
