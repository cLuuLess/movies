int. freedom cockpit

the  freedoms captain,  a silhouette  in a  dark cockpit,  is flying
blind. his cockpit is awash in the blue flares from niobes ship.

his lieutenant, a shadowy female figure, reaches for the radar screen.
as she does, we see her  bare shoulder fall into view, a  white rabbit
tattoo is conspicuous.

they switch their screens to the radar, squiddies right on their ass.

                                 man

       "oh shit, were screwed. we gotta set down and emp em."

                             niobe (v.o.)

                             "too many!"
