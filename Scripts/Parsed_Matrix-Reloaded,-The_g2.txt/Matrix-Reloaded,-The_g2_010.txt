int. neb cockpit

the crew of the neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they  leave
the scene of aerial carnage behind them.

neo has been gripping an oh-shit handle on the edge of the cockpit. he
relaxes his grip as their escape is clear. their ship suddenly  enters
a cave, and starts  to descend. the blue  wash of the ship  shows rock
walls and pipes. the ships are slowing down as they descend back  into
the earth.

tank's shoulders drop, and he leans back into his chair.

                                 tank

                            "we're home."

                               trinity

          "well, not yet, but we're in the defense screen."

                                 neo

                            "what's that?"

                               morpheus

 "a concentric ring of defenses that shields zion. the fighters that
              just saved us constitute the first ring."

                             niobe (v.o.)

                    "neb crew, you can relax now."

                               morpheus

       "for the moment, perhaps. its still a long drive home."

                                                              fade out

and
