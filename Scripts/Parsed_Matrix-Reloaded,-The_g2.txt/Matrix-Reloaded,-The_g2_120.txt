int. countach (matrix) - day

the street scene spins before them. trinity is at the wheel, a  broken
and dusty morpheus sitting next to  her. the tach is redlining as  the
car rips up the street. pedestrians dive for cover.

trinity holds her wounded hand to her chest and drives one-handed.

                               "shift."

morpheus does so,  and the tires  squeal again when  she releases into
second, then  third. in  a few  seconds theyÂ’re  over 60  on the  busy
street.
