ext. street (matrix) - day

agent brown  and his  men rush  into position  around the building the
rebels are hiding in.


suddenly, an unimaginably powerful engine  starts, and as we stare  at
the  garage door,  it explodes  outward. a  jet-black, hyped  countach
explodes out onto the street, tires literally on fire as they throw up
smoke. it cuts through a few  soldiers, hitting them in the knees,  as
it rips up the street, the throttle going way too high.
