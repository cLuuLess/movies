ext. tunnel

the freedom hovers  slowly, silently, like  a submarine as  it cruises
through  the murky  depths. it  suddenly comes  to a  quiet stop,  and
descends. the engines fade out, and the vessel rests, darkened, on the
cave.

a quartet of  squiddies slips by.  we follow as  they worm their  ways
through  the  twisted passageway,  watching  as they  pass  the bubble
cockpit by mere feet.

freeze on the cockpit. within the shadows we see morpheus and choi  at
the controls.
