int. countach (matrix) - day

they rocket up the entry to a highway, ripping past cars by driving up
the breakdown lane.  once they hit  a straightaway trinity  floors it,
and the speedo creeps up past 130 as they dodge in and out of cars.

morpheus grabs his twisted, folded legs. he was literally poured  into
the seat. concentrating, his face knotting in pain, he straightens the
broken, fractured legs. he closes his eyes and concentrates.

             the legs reform into straight, strong limbs.

                      morpheus grabs the wheel.

                               morpheus

              "keep your foot on the gas. heal thyself."

trinity pulls her bleeding wound from her arm. her face tightens,  and
she closes her eyes, fervently concentrating, shutting the world  out,
which  is  good,  as  they suffer  constant  close  calls  as morpheus
controls the wheel from his awkward spot.

when she opens her eyes again, she grabs the wheel. with both hands.

morpheus pulls out  his cell and  tries the line.  its still full  of
static.

                               trinity

                             "any luck?"

                               morpheus

               "none. theyve killed city-wide comms."

                               trinity

         "then the agents are out of touch with each other."

                               morpheus

  "they cant track us, but that gives them more time to destroy our
exits, and find the neb. well try the desert. communications might be
                        working there still."

                               trinity

                         "what about niobe?"

                               morpheus

                    "she knows to meet us there."
