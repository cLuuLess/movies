ext. main street, zion

the lights are dim, and only a few late night revelers stagger through
the  streets  on their  way  back home.  walking  straight and  calmly
through the stragglers are morpheus and niobe.

                               morpheus

            "so, how do you like having your own command?"

                                niobe

             "its good. but trying. the responsibility..."

           they stop before the entrance to the dead duck.

                               morpheus

          "you must be both mother and father to your crew."

niobe nods, and looks into the bar. inside, the crews are raging drunk
and loud.

                                niobe

          "who will you be now? the mother, or the father?"

              morpheus peers in on the scene and grins.

                               morpheus

   "as long as they dont get out of line, ill just be a brother."
