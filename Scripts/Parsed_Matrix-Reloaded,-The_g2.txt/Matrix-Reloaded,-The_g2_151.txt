circa helps morpheus off the interface chair. razor is triumphant.

                                razor

   "did you see that? we beat him! a fucking agent! he gave up!"

morpheus, unflappable, rises and rushes to the operations consoles.

                               morpheus

                           "where is neo?"

                                circa

 "havent heard from him. the city is still cut off from the rest of
                             the matrix."

   morpheus appears enraged. he looks at neo, supine on his chair.

                               morpheus

      "why does it still exist? why hasnt he destroyed it yet?"

                                razor

                          "maybe he cant."

 trinity is sitting on the edge of her interface chair, looking like
                                hell.

                               trinity

                 "is he even alive? is he captured?"

                                razor

  "last we saw he was trying to blow up the building. havent locked
                           onto him since."

                               morpheus

                           "what? why not?"

                                circa

    "call me crazy, but i think hes masking his own displacement
                             signature."

                                razor

"his carrier signal just goes nowhere. but there is data going back
                             and forth."

morpheus  stares at  the data  on the  screens. the  matrix lives.  he
pushes razor out of the way, and starts hacking at the keyboard at  an
incredible rate. its obvious morpheus can handle computers.

                               morpheus

               "i found him once. ill find him again."

we  go deeper  into the  miasma of  green symbols,  swallowed by  the
blackness of the screen, and emerge into:
