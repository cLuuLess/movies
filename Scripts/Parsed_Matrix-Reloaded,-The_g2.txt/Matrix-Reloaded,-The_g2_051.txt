ext. desert rock

gregory is fully  awake, but he  thinks hes dreaming.  he reaches out
and pokes the black-clad leg of the immaculate man standing before him
- a man who doesnt sweat even in the sauna heat. he looks up, but the
glaring sun obscures the face.

           gregorys voice is raspy as he starts to speak.

                               gregory

                     "oh my god. its... the man."

                             man in black

      "ive been searching for you for a long time, my friend."

                       gregory lowers his head.

                             man in black

                       "we need you, gregory."

                               gregory

                             "what for?"

                             man in black

                         "to save our world."

gregorys face  raises, the  man in  black eclipses  the sun  with his
head, making a hallo of hazy sunlight around an all-too familiar face:
agent smith.

gregorys head drops back down. he strokes chandras hair.

                               gregory

                     "its too late. were dead."

                             agent smith

                        "do you want to live?"

                               gregory

                             "what for?"

                             agent smith

   "a better life for all. life for her. and for you, a chance for
                              revenge."

                       gregory raises his head.



agent smith grins. he turns away, and the desert landscape before them
turns into a soothing, cool,  crystal forest lake. smith takes  a step
toward it, then turns and extends his hand.

                             agent smith

                            "interested?"

gregory  is  mystified.  speechless, he  drags  himself  to his  feet,
hoisting chandra, and steps toward the lake.

                               gregory

                        "this cant be real."

           he steps forward, only to have the image recede.

                             agent smith

                        "you this, dont you?"

                               gregory

                                "yes."

                             agent smith

                         "will you help us?"

                               gregory

                             "anything."

cu:  smith  extends his  hand.  gregory grasps  it.  he lets  go,  and
collapses into the cool shallow waters of the lake edge.
