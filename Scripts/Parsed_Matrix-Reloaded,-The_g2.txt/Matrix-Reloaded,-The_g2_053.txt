int. cockpit (night)

morpheus and  neo sit  together. the  cockpit lights  are dimmed down,
only the emp pulse button glows.  outside the ship, in the dark  mists
of the underworld,  patches of eerie  phosphorescent moss glow  on the
walls. occasionally, a squiddie will pass over the darkened ship.

           the two of them watch the deadly outside world.

                               morpheus

                   "were deep in their territory."

                                 neo

                            "i see that."

 morpheus stares out at the night, deep in thought. he turns to neo.

                               morpheus

                          "are you rested?"

                                 neo

                                "yes."

                               morpheus

              "you know now, that you had predecessors."

                                 neo

                      "yes. ive heard things."

                               morpheus

                       "what types of things?"

                                 neo

  "that there were others, like me, who you thought were going to be
                  special. but they ended up dead."

                        morpheus nods slowly.

                               morpheus

   "its true. there were others. and i didnt tell you right away.
                     because you were not ready."

                              neo nods.

                               morpheus

                        "does this anger you?"

                                 neo

 "i dont know yet. so much has happened so fast, that i cant decide
 whether or not im angry, or dissappointed, or even if i should be."

                               morpheus

  "you shouldnt be, neo. you are the key in the oracles prophecy.
     everything forseen to come to pass, has, except one thing."

                                 neo

                               "what?"

                               morpheus

                   "the destruction of the matrix."

                morpheus looks out into the darkness.

                               morpheus

 "your coming was heralded, and it is my destiny to prepare the world
  for you, and to baptize you by fire. but from here on out, no one
                               knows."

                                 neo

                       "can we ask the oracle."

                               morpheus

                         "not in this life."

                           neo is confused.

                               morpheus

  "no one has heard from her or her priestesses since the day cypher
                            turned on us."

                         neo is taken aback.

                                 neo

           "but she must have known, if they came to her."

                               morpheus

                          "perhaps she did."

                         neo shakes his head.

                                 neo

"i cant believe it. i dont know, morpheus, if im prepared for this
        war. im not a soldier. how, how are we going to win?"

                               morphues

   "for decades, we have fought force-on-force, in the real world,
 without a conclusion. now, after nearly a century of war, were at a
standstill. the only way that we can see to win is by destroying their
source of energy. we have to pull the plug on them. we must crash the
                               matrix."

                        morpheus grins slyly.

                               morpheus

  "remember, when i told you, that ill show you how deep the rabbit
                             hole goes?"

                                 neo

                                "yes."

                               morpheus

 "i brought you deep, yet i no longer know the way. no one does. with
 every second we sink deeper than before. you are our guiding light,
now. your powers exceed mine a millionfold. i have shown you the path
                  to victory, neo. lead us down it."
