	dick and barbara dismout.

				barbara
		i started racing after my parents
		died.  there was something about the
		speed, the danger, that took me out
		of myself, that made the hurt
		go away.  you wouldn't understand.

				dick
		you'd be surprised.

				barbara
		street racing isn't exactly an
		acceptable major at oxbridge.  they
		kicked me out.  it doesn't matter.
		i've won enough money to do what
		i've always dreamed.

				dick
		just don't tell me you're hoping to
		run away and join the circus.

	they head towards the entrance tot he house.

				barbara
		alfred has supported me my whole
		life.  now i'm going to pay him back.
		i'm going to liberate him from his
		dismal life of servitude.

				dick
		what are you talking about?

				barbara
		servants, masters, it's  ridiculous.
		alfred is the sweetest, most noble
		man alive and he's subjugated all
		his life and dreams to someone else.
