127	int. pamela's workshop - continuous

				pamela
		join you?  i've spent my life trying
		to protect plants from extinction
		and now you corrupt my research into
		some maniacal scheme for world
		domination. when i get through you
		won't be able to get a job teaching
		high school chemistry, do you hear
		me, you psycho?

				woodrue
		well, i can respect your opinion.

	woodrue shoves pam viciously backwards into the inter-
	connected tables, plants and poisonous beasts raining
	down on top of her.

				woodrue
		sadly, i'm not good at rejection.

	woodrue begins pulling shelves of cages and bubbling
	beakers crashing down atop the struggling pam, burying her
	and all her specimens entirely.

				woodrue
		i'm afraid you'll have to die.

128	woodrue - close.  smiles as the sounds of pam's struggle
	are finally silenced.  he turns, heading back into the
	hallway.

				woodrue
				(loud)
		fellow maniacs, bidding begins!
