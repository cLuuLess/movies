81	ext. night sky - falling

	as the capsule explodes above them raining falling
	debris, batman and robin skyboard on the doors down
	towards...

82	freeze is rocketing to earth, the diamond in his hand.

83	batman and robin race towards freeze and the city
	below.

	the caped crusaders avoid skyscraper turrets and elevated
	bridges as they follow in freeze's wake.

84	batman swoops down above the villain, pushing off his
	skyboard, grabbing freeze around the neck, the diamond
	flying into mid air.

85	robin maneuvers in a grand flip, grabs the falling gem.

86/87 freeze releases his glide pack buckle, dislodging batman,
	the hero and the glide pack spinning away from freeze.

88	batman dumps the glide pack, arcs back into his rushing
	drop.

92	freeze is descending fast towards the giant smoking
93	chimney of a towering industrial complex.  he aims his gun
	at the smoking toward and fires, the fast maw quickly
	covering with snow.

94	freeze plummets into the snowy chimney.

95	batman and robin drop into the ice shaft after the
	villain.

96	freeze fires his gun as he falls, slowing his descent by
	turning the chimney into a madly snaking tunnel of ice
	before him.

97	batman and robin tumble head first through layers of snow
	after the villain.   they pull their batgrapples and fire.

98	batgrapples - close.  hit the wall.  catch.

99	batman and robin use their tethers to slow their descent,
	landing hard in...
