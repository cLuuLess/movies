257	ext. rooftop abyss

	the batmobile is falling across the abyss like frozen
	sculpture.  suddenly the windscreen explodes as batman is
	catapulted through the glass like a torpedo, flying into
	the air high above the busy city.

257a	ext. lower rooftops

	the frozen batmobile drops to the safety of the rooftops on
	the other side of the abyss.
