290	int. wayne manor - living room - night

	candlelit. a table set for two.  alfred fills bruce's wine
	goblet, walks away.  his forehead beads with sweat.  a man
	hiding pain.

291	bruce - pov.  across the table sits ivy.  she licks her
	lips.

				ivy
		bruce?

	bruce blinks.  looks again.  not ivy at all but julie.

				julie
		you're not even listening to me.

				bruce
		what?  i'm sorry.  you were saying...

				julie
		we've been going out over a year
		now and...okay, here goes.  bruce,
		i want to spend my life with you.

	ivy saunters up behind bruce, runs her hands down his chest.
	bruce rises, shaking off the vision.  goes over to julie.

				bruce
		julie, i'm not the marrying kind.
		there are things about me you
		wouldn't understand.

				julie
		i know you're a dedicated bachelor.
		that you've had a your wild nights.

				bruce
		wild doesn't exactly cover it.

				julie
		but there's nothing you've done
		under the cover of darkness i
		couldn't learn to understand.

				bruce
		i wouldn't bet on that.

				julie
		i'm betting on you.  you'll make
		someone a good husband one day.
		but i can't wait around forever.
		don't answer now.  just think it
		over.
			(leaning close)
		here's some food for thought.

	they kiss passionately.  bruce opens his eyes.  he's kissing
	ivy.  he recoils.  but it's only julie before him, looking
	up, puzzled.

				julie
		who's ivy?

				bruce
		what?

				julie
		you just called me ivy.  who's ivy?

				bruce
		i wish i knew.
