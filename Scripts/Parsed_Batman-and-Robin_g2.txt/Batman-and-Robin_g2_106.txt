395	int. wayne manor - foyer

	(over) the doorbell is ringing.  dick follows bruce
	downstairs, the billionaire donning his coat.

				dick
		mcgregor's syndrome.  that's what
		freeze's wife had.

				bruce
		yes.  but alfred's condition is less
		severe.  freeze's research says he
		cured a case like alfred's.  it just
		doesn't say how.

				dick
		i checked the medical database.  no
		one else is even close.

				bruce
		i'm late for the dedication.  then i
		go after freeze and ivy.  alone.

				dick
		like hell you do.

				bruce
		dick, don't push me right now.

				dick
		or what?  no one can capture ivy but
		the big bad bat.  crap!  you just want
		her for yourself.  don't you?  answer
		me, damn it!

				bruce
		yes!  yes, i want her so badly i can
		taste it.  that's the whole point.
		look at us.  orphans.  isolated.
		obsessed to the exclusion of life,
		love, family.  we're perfect targets.
		she's done something to us, got us
		fighting over her somehow.

				dick
		hail the all-knowing bruce wayne.
		here's what i know, she loves me,
		not you and it's driving you crazy.
		it's why you stopped us from kissing.
		because if you can't have her,
		nobody can.

				bruce
		she's clouded your mind.  you're not
		thinking straight.

				dick
		oh but i am.  for the first time in
		a long time.  i'm through living in your
		shadow.  all that ends right now.

395a	dick walks away.  bruce stares after him. (over) the bell
	rings again.  the front door swings open, julie enters.  a
	limo sits out front.

				julie
		i've been ringing forever.  where's
		alfred?

	but bruce doesn't answer.

395b	int. wayne manor - alfred's quarters - night

	barbara stands over the old man.

				barbara
		i'm sorry.  i was too late.

				alfred
		too late for what, dear child?

				barbara
		i came to give you your freedom,
		a chance to live the life you choose.
		the same gift you gave me.

				alfred
		i have been part of the greatest
		adventure ever know.  i have found
		purpose here, and the family i
		could never have.

	alfred smiles, is hit by a sudden wave of pain.

				alfred
		you must do something for me.

	alfred takes her hand, puts an envelope in her grasp.

				alfred
		find my brother wilfred.  give him
		this.  i have duties he must fulfill
		in my stead.  only family can be
		trusted.

				barbara
		what is it?

				alfred
		it is the hearts of two good men
		whom i have had the honor of
		calling son.  take it, child.  but
		i implore you, never open it.
			(he touches her cheek)
		you look so like your mother.

	and with that his eyes close.

				barbara
		uncle alfred?
