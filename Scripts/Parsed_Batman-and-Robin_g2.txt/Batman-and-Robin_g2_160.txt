591	int. observatory floor

	batman walks over to freeze who lies amidst the rubble, weak
	and gray with the growing heat, straining to breathe.

				freeze
		go on, kill me too.  just as you
		killed my wife.

				batman
		i didn't kill your wife.

	batman presses a button on his utility belt.

				batman
		run ivy evidence tape 001.40.

592	batman's gauntlet - close.  a tiny monitor shows an image
	of poison ivy.

				ivy (over)
		as i told lady freeze when i pulled
		her plug, this is a one woman show.

	freeze screams his rage.  his face streams with frozen
	tears, like tiny diamonds.

				batman
		but she's not dead, victor.  we found
		her, restored her icy slumber.

593	batman's gauntlet monitor shows mrs. fries restored in
	cryogenic slumber.

				batman
		she's still frozen, victor, alive,
		waiting for you to find a cure.  i
		know what it's like to lose
		everything you've ever loved.  but
		vengeance isn't power.  any two-bit
		thug with a gun can take a life.  to
		give life, that's true power, a
		power you once had.  i don't know
		if you'll ever find a cure for your wife.  
		but i'm asking you now, doctor
		victor fries, to save another life.
		show me how to cure mcgregor's
		syndrome stage one.  and maybe you
		can also save the man your wife once 
		loved.  he's still inside you, buried 
		somewhere deep beneath the snow.  
		will you help me?  doctor?

	freeze stares at batman.  finally he unseals his
	chestplate, removes two glowing power orbs, holds them
	out, his smile, bittersweet.

				freeze
		take two of these and call me in
		the morning.
