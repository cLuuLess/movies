138	int. tented greenhouse lab

	woodrue stands at pam's workstation, talking on his
	portable phone as he rifles through her research.

			woodrue
		yes, sir, i'm so pleased you won the
		bidding, your supreme ruthlessness..

	(over) bane screams in the distance.

			woodrue
		we're making the final modifications
		on bane right now.  we'll have a
		thousand super soldiers out to you
		tomorrow by overnight mail...

139	he hangs up.  hold on a patch of ivy in the b.g. perfectly
	still.  suddenly the leaves rustle, as if being moved from
	beneath.

	woodrue turns as a figure bursts, fast, from beneath the
	brush.

	magenta hair.  chlorophyll green eyes.  ravaged clothes
	revealing the form and demeanor of a goddess.  the woman
	who was once pamela isley smiles, moves forward.

				woodrue
		dr. isley?  pamela?  you look great.
		especially for a dead woman.

				pamela
		hello, jason.  i think i've had a
		change of heart.

	her lips glisten.  she leans in and kisses him.

				pamela
		quite literally.  i don't think i'm
		human anymore.  the animal-plant
		toxins had a rather unique effect on
		me. they replaced my blood with
		aloe, my skin with chlorophyll and
		fill my lips with venom.

	woodrue begins to choke.  he falls, clutching his throat.

				pamela
		oh, and jason?  one other thing.
		silly me, i probably should have
		mentioned this earlier.  i'm poison.
				(shrugs)
		it's a jungle in here.

140		pam spills beakers of chemicals onto the floor.  she
		throws a bunsen burner to the ground, the lab suddenly in
		flames.

				pamela
		let the flames touch the sky. for i
		am nature's arm, her spirit, her 
		will.  hell, i am mother nature.
		the time has come for plants to take
		back the world so rightfully ours.
		because it's not nice to fool with
		mother nature.

	something catches pam's eye.  pam lifts a broken beaker
	on it, the wanye enterprises logo.  (over) bane screams
	in the distance.

				pamela
		coming, bane darling.  we've got a
		plane to catch.
