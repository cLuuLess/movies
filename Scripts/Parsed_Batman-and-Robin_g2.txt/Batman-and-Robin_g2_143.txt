	monitor - close.  graphic satellites begin to adjust.
	targeting flashes over a blinking graphic of gotham
	a digital clock reads:  11:54.

523	batman - pov.  as he aims the telescope.  the skyline
524	through the crosshairs is suddenly obscured by a blur as
	freeze drops from the rafters onto the telescope, his face
	now visible in the targeting scope.

				freeze
		tonight's forecast...

		...a freeze is coming!

526	freeze grabs batman and hurls the caped crusader up over
	his head onto the telescope barrel, using his free hand to
	yank the telescope control joystick.  the telescope tilts
	sharply downward.

527	batgirl and robin tumble down the telescope barrel,
	rolling towards the lens and the drop to the city below.

528	batman tumbles, rights himself, spins.

529	batman - pov.  freeze is climbing towards the control
530	console.  batgirl and robin are rolling towards the end
	of the telescope.

531	no way to get both.  a beat.  batman rushes towards
	freeze.
