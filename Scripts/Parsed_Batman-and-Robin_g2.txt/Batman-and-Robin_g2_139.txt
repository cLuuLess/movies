	batman uses batpitons to pull himself up onto a ledge just
	below the observatory.  that's when another wave of icemen
	descend on him from the mists.

	batman reaches for a batarang.  a beat.  then he smiles.

				batman
		let's do this the old-fashioned way.

	batman leaves his batarang belted, begins wailing on the
	icemen using only his hands and feet, flying back fists,
	and spinning roundhouse kicks felling the thugs one
	after another.
