316	ext. gotham bridge - night

	barbara stands in the b.g. receiving her winnings from
	banker and spike.  dick rights his bike as she approaches.

				barbara
		i could have made it, you know.  i
		didn't need your help.

				dick
		whatever you say, lady.  it's all in
		a day's work for me.

	barbara tries to hand dick her winnings.

				barbara
		this is to replace the bike i lost.
		i'll get you the rest.

				dick
		keep it.

				barbara
		of course, dick grayson, ward of
		the fabulously wealthy bruce wayne.
		why would you need a few hundred
		dollars?

				dick
		hey, what's your problem?

				barbara
		i guess, the truth is i'm just not
		comfortable with the idle rich.  even
		when they try to act like heroes.

	dick pats the back of his seat.

				dick
		well you better get comfortable real
		fast, sister.  cause we've only got
		one bike and it's a long walk home.
