404	ext. police hq - roof - night

	a giant door swings open.  bane and ivy emerge onto the
	roof.

				ivy
		let there be light.

	bane walks to he dormant batsignal, tears it from its
	shackles.

404a	int. wayne manor - barbara's room - night

	barbara enters, lost in grief.  she sits, turns alfred's
	envelope over in her hand.  a long beat.  she withdraws a
	single, silver cd.

				barbara
		only family can be trusted?

	barbara slides the disk into her computer.

				computer
		access denied.  protected files.

				barbara
		perhaps you didn't give me your
		genes.  but you gave me your heart.

	barbara begins hacking the disk, trying to break the code.

406a	int.-wayne manor-hallway-night

	bruce, still in his tux, enters, sits at the main batcomputer
	console, distraught, starting in to the darkness of the cave.

407a	a younger alfred stands with an adolescent bruce, working
	together over the original batsuit prototype.

407b	bruce - close.  as the images dissipate to memory.

				bruce
		alfred, old friend, i could use
		your help right now.

				alfred (over)
		right here, sir.

408	bruce spins, stunned.  a monitor flickers into life.
	the words computer simulation flash under an image of
	alfred.

				alfred
		i anticipated a moment might arrive
		where i became...incapacitated.  as
		such, i programmed my brain algorithms
		into the batcomputer and created a
		virtual simulation.

	bruce stares a beat.  then he smiles.

				bruce
		it's good to see you.

				alfred
		what seems to be the problem?

				bruce
		women.

				alfred
		that, sir, does not compute.

				bruce
		first ivy had an intoxicating effect
		on both dick and me.  tonight my
		feelings spread to someone else.

				alfred
		specify, please.

				bruce
		pamela isley.  i was so attracted to
		her i couldn't reason clearly.  i
		still can't.  she used to work for
		wayne enterprises.  find a file.

				alfred
		coming on line now, sir.

	a spinning isley appears on the monitor.

				bruce
		what was her area of research?

	study and report titles scroll up the side of the image.

				alfred
		advanced botany.  dna splicing.
		recombinant animal plant patterns.
		pheromone extractions.

				bruce
		pheromones?

				alfred
		glandular secretions from animals.
		scents that create powerful
		emotions.  fear.  rage...

				bruce
		passion.  of course.  find the photo
		of ivy after the flower ball.

	a spinning ivy appears beside the spinning isley.

				bruce
		deconstruct and resolve.

	schematics of various features, finger and retina prints,
	height, weight, are highlighted and compared.  all match.

				bruce
		amazing what a good wig and contact
		lenses can do.  and i thought clark
		kent got away with murder just
		wearing those glasses.

	suddenly alert panels start flashing.  alarms sound.

				bruce
		what is it?

				alfred
		it appears, sir, that someone has
		stolen the batsignal.

408a	int. wayne manor - night

	barbara is still hacking away at the disk.

				computer
		access code accepted.

				barbara
		this better be one hell of a
		secret.

	she hits a key. a pictures begin to reflect in the dark of
	her eye.

				barbara
		oh my god.
