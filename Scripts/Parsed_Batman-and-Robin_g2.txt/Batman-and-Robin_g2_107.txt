400	int. gotham observatory - night

	a black tie gala celebrating the telescope unveiling.
	pamela isley stands in the center of the room.  alone.
	her drab outfit and demeanor make her anything but a 
	conversation magnet.

	bruce and julie enter, smiling through the storm of
	flashbulbs, and the crowd of press, being greeting
	guests.  commissioner gordon steps away, reaches for
	champagne off a try.

				voice (over)
		i've always wondered, where does
		that big old bat light come from?

	pamela stands before gordon.  she flips open a compact,
	blows a pile of love dust, the tiny swirl catching the cop
	in the face, a bit more hitting bruce who stands behind
	the commissioner.

	gordon - close.  stunned.  and suddenly in love.

				gordon
			(stammering)
		it's on top of police headquarters.

	pam takes gordon's arm, leads him like a puppy into an alcove.

				pamela
		i'd just love to see it.  but you
		probably don't have access.

				gordon
		why, i'm commissioner of police.
			(patting his pocket)
		i have the keys right here.

401	bruce, still standing with julie, amidst the press and
	well-wishers, seems suddenly distracted, begins looking
	around the room.

	as if summoned by an inaudible call, bruce peels away from
	a perplexed julie, begins searching the crowd.  a man on a
	quest.

	pam has gordon against the alcove wall.  her fingers slip
	into his pocket.

				pamela
		on second thought, you're way too
		old for me.

	she pushes a stunned gordon away, spins, heads towards the
	door, tossing something in her hand.  gordon's keys.

402	a hand grabs her.  pam spins to face bruce wayne.

				bruce
		dr. isley.  it was like i could feel
		you in the room.  you're...enchanting.
		gorgeous.  the most beautiful woman
		i've ever seen.  if you're..um...
		free...this evening.

				julie
			(arriving)
		bruce?  what are you doing?

				pamela
		i think he's asking me on a date, in
		an awkward, stammering sort of way.

				julie
		i've heard of commitment anxiety,
		but this is insane.  you're not
		really propositioning another
		woman right in front of me.
		are you?

				bruce
		well, define 'propositioning'.

	the press has noticed the conflict, now surround bruce,
	julie and pam.

				julie
		make a choice, bruce.  her or me.

				bruce
	well...um...her.

				julie
			(crestfallen)
		you were right.  i get it.  you're not
		the marrying kind.  you've made your
		point.  goodbye bruce wayne.

				pamela
		physical perfection, charm and
		wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster.
		how do you explain your behavior?

				bruce
				(puzzled)
		i can't.  but perhaps tonight, over
		dinner...i've just had an opening.

				pamela
		maybe your witless playboy persona
		works on every bimbo du jour but i
		am not the least bit titillated by
		your attentions.  so back off or i'll
		have you in court quicker than you
		can spell sexual harassment.  got me?

402a	wider

	folks are staring.  murmur to each other.  bruce is
	chagrined.

				bruce
		does that mean dinner's a no?

	pam has already pushed past him, out the door.

				bruce
		it's just i sort of...kind of
		...love you.
