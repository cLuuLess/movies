585	int.  observatory

	batman flips in through the telescope slat, followed
	immediately by batgirl and robin, all landing together on
	the observatory floor.

				robin
		winded, old timer?

				batman
		don't make me kill you in front
		of the girl.

				batgirl
		it's midnight.  the telescope's gone.
		there's no way to thaw the city.

				batman
		theoretically, the satellites could
		be positioned to thaw the city
		directly.  but it would take a
		computer genius.

				robin
		i'm on it.

	robin clears the rubble from a fallen console, begins to type.
	nothing.  the equipment is dead.

				batgirl
			(shouldering him aside)
		no.  i'm on it.

	she quick patches a couple of broken wires, the console
	lighting up, whirring to life.  begins hacking.

				batgirl
		ms.  genius.  madame genius.  her
		geniusness.  which sounds better?
