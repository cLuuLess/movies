271	int. wayne manor garage - night

	the competition bike's headlight goes out.

272	wider

	barbara walks the bike steahtlfully back into the garage.

273	a hand touches her shoulder.  barbara moves fast, flipping
	the assailant over her shoulder in an expert judo move.

274	she spins to face...dick.  floored in every sense of the
	word. barbara's demeanor suddenly changes.  all school 
	girl politeness.

				barbara
		oh.  i'm so sorry.  i'd just never
		seen anything like it.  so massive.
		i took it out for a spin.  i do so
		hope i didn't inconvenience you.
			(off his look)
		ah yes, the outfit.  for a...costume
		party.  just trying it out.  one never
		knows how leather will wear.
			(helping him up)
		judo lessons at school, you know.
		all the rage, really.  i suppose
		they've taken better than i thought.
		again, my greatest of pardons.

	she's gone before dick has a chance to speak.  he stares
	after her.  all is not as it seems in wayne manor.
