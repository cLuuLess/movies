3	int.batcave
	batman - close.  emerges from his costume vault.
	wider
	deeper excavation has doubled the size of the cavern.
	
	new state-of-the-art computing systems flash.  
	surveillance screens monitor news and police frequencies.
	crime's worst nightmare.
	
	batman strides towards the rising steam-obscured pedestal
	which bears the sleek, redesigned batmobile.
	
	robin appears in the door of his costume vault, dressed in
	the black and red of his nightwing costume.
	
	two dark avengers stand suited, ready to take back the night.

				batman
		nice suit.  and today you are?

				robin
		nightwing.  scourge of darkest evil.

				batman
		this is all about fashion for you, isn't it?

				robin
		it's the gear.  chicks love the gear.

	alfred steps forward, out of the shadows.

				alfred
		do call if you're going to be late for dinner, sir.


4	turbos - close.  roar.  the batmobile shoots away through
	the arches of the cave access tunnel.

5	the compass to of the batmobile service pedestal splits
	wide like the opening petals of a flower, revealing a
	sleek, turbo-charged motorcycle.  meet robin's bike:  the
	redbird.

				alfred
		drive carefully, master wing.

				robin
		don't wait up, al.

6	the redbird's turbo - close.  explodes into life.
	the powerful bike shoots after the batmobile.

7	alfred watches them go.

	then, he relaxes, lets his weight
	fall against the main console, a man not as well as he seems.
