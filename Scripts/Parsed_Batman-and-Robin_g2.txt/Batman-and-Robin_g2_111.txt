412	int. batcave - night

	the robin signal glows on the central monitor.

	bruce stands in civvies talking to dick who is suiting up.

				dick
		that's no batlight, it's a birdcall.

				bruce
		her name is pamela isley.  i saw
		her talking to gordon.  she must
		have stolen his keys, altered
		the signal-

				dick
		and she did it all for me.  for love.

				bruce
		she's infected us with some kind of
		pheromone extract-

				dick
		is that it, bruce?  i'm under some
		magic spell?

				bruce
		she wants to kill you.

				dick
		you'd say anything to keep me away
		from her.  to keep her for yourself.

				bruce
		you once said to me that being
		part of a team means trusting
		your partner.  that sometimes
		counting on someone else is the
		only way to win.  do you remember?

	dick doesn't answer.

				bruce
		you weren't just talking about being
		partners.  you were talking about
		being a family.  well, part of our
		family is dying.  i'm not going to
		lose everyone i've ever loved.  so i'm
		asking you now, friend, partner,
		brother - will you trust me?
