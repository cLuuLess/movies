188	int. observatory

	an immense circular hall under construction.  within, a
	partially installed telescope.  bruce stands flanked by
	his stunningly beautiful date (julie madison), a scientist
	and his associate, all on a podium backed by blueprints,
	facing the press.

				bruce
		my father once told me that to
		succeed we need only pick our
		star and follow it.  and so wayne
		enterprises is donating the world's
		most advanced telescope to gotham's
		observatory restoration project.
		perhaps this telescope will give
		future generations a chance to
		find their own stars.

				gossip gerty
		brucy, is it true this new telescope
		can see all around the globe?

				scientist
		yes, if you'll watch the monitors -

189	a monitor bank - close.  a graphic of the earth.
	equidistant satellites in geosyncronous orbit are
	highlighted.

				scientist
		satellites already in orbit allow us
		to reflect light around the planet.

	on screen - a graphic ray of light is reflected from a
	satellite over australia, to a satellite over the u.s.,
	and then beamed to a graphic of the gotham-based telescope.

				associate
		from here we'll be able to see the
		sky anywhere on earth.

				bruce
		just don't point it at my bedroom.

				gossip gerty
		brucy, you and the exquisite julie
		madison have been going out forever.
		are you planning to tie the knot?

				bruce
		get married?  me?  no...

				julie
		no!?

				bruce
		umm.  what i mean is...no plans at
		the moment...

				julie
		but soon...

				gerty
		soon?

				bruce
		ah...sooner or later...all
		relationships evolve and...

				julie
		and?

				bruce
			(to julie)
		can i get some help over here?

	julie smiles, turns to the press. the very picture of
	composure.

				julie
		bruce and i are lucky enough to be
		recklessly in love. and that is
		most certainly enough for us.
			(to bruce)
		for now.

	folks laugh, charmed.

				scientist
		now, if you'll all follow me, i'll
		show you the central control grid...

	the scientist and associate tour julie and the press around
	the telescope, leaving bruce to confer with two of his aides.

				guard (over)
		mr. wayne?

190	wider
	pam, hair in a bun, face behind glasses, cloaked in a
	frumpy suit, is standing behind two door guards.

				guard
		she doesn't have a pass, sir.

	bruce smiles, waves off the guards with a gesture.

				bruce
		they're overly protective.  you're
		not going to hurt me are you, ms...

				pamela
		dr. pamela isley.

				bruce
		what can i do for you, doctor?  a
		research grant?  a hospital wing?

				pamela
		actually, i already work for you.
		or did.  your arboreal preservation
		project in south america.

				bruce
		we cut our support.  a conflict of
		ideologies.  dr. woodrue was a lunatic.

				pamela
		i see you knew him.

				bruce
		that lab was consumed by fire last
		week.  how did you manage to escape?

				pamela
		i have here a proposal showing how
		wayne enterprises can immediately
		cease all actions that toxify our
		environment.

	bruce takes the proposal, scans it.  pam's eyes shine
	despotic.

				pamela
		forget the stars.  look here, at the
		earth, our mother, our womb.  she
		deserves our loyalty and protection.
		and yet you spoil her lands, poison
		her oceans, blacken her skies.
		you're killing her.

				bruce
		your intentions are noble, but no
		diesel fuel for heat.  no coolants to
		preserve food.  millions would die of
		cold and hunger alone.

				pamela
		acceptable losses in a battle to save
		the planet.

				bruce
		people come first, dr. isley.

191	the tour has returned.  pam turns to the press.
	begins to soapbox.

				pamela
		mammals.  so smug in your towers of
		stone and glass.  a day of reckoning
		is coming.  the same plants and
		flowers that saw you crawl blind
		from the primordial soup will
		reclaim this planet.  earth will
		be a garden again.  somehow, some
		way, i will bring your man-made
		civilization to its knees and
		there will be no one to protect you.

	pam's tirade is so extreme, folks around her laugh.

				gossip gerty
		you must be new in town.  in gotham
		city, batman and robin protect us.
		even from plants and flowers.

				bruce
		perhaps you'd like to meet them.

	bruce nods and an aide hands pam an invitation.

192	inviation - close.  batman and robin to appear at the
	flower ball.

				bruce
		the caped crusaders are helping us
		auction off a prized diamond to
		raise money for the gotham botanical
		gardens.  just a few mammals doing
		what we can for our world's plants.

				gossip gerty
		so, brucy, will the delicious ms. madison
		be your date for the flower ball tonight?

				pamela
		tell me, billionaire, would you warm
		faster to my pleas if i looked more
		like ms. january here?

				bruce
		although the wayne foundation is
		hosting the event, sadly i will be
		unable to attend.  thank you all.
				(to pam)
		good day, doctor.

	pam watches him go, trailed by press.  peers at her invitation.

				pamela
		batman and robin.  militant arm of
		the warm-blooded oppressors.  animal
		protectors of the status quo.  first
		i'll rid myself of the fur and
		feathered pests.  and then gotham
		will be mine for the greening.
