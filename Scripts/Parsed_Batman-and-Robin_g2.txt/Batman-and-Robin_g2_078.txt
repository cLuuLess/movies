270	int. alfred's quarters - night

	alfred is completing a cassette tape.

				alfred
		i have tried every address i
		know for you.  i am praying this
		reaches you.  we have very little
		time.

	alfred puts the tape in the envelope.  (over) a knock.
	bruce enters.

				alfred
		congratulations on your
		apprehension of mr. freeze.  batman
		monopolized the evening news.

				bruce
		thanks.

	but the billionaire seems anything but celebratory.

				alfred
		is there something wrong, sir?

				bruce
		alfred, am i pigheaded?  is it always
		my way or the highway?

				alfred
		why, yes, actually.  death and chance
		stole your parents.  but rather than
		become a victim, you have done
		everything in your power to control
		the fates.  for what is batman if
		not an effort to master the chaos
		that sweeps our world, an attempt
		to control death itself.

270a	bruce - pov.  out the window, young bruce and alfred lay
	wreaths on a windy grave.  alfred puts his arm around the
	boy, holds him close.

270b	back to scene

				bruce
		but i can't can i?

				alfred
		no, my boy.  i'm afraid none of us can.
