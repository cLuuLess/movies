122	int. labs - gilgamesh chamber
	banks of flashing supercrays.  a gurney is surrounded by
	sparking and humming equipment.  frankestein meets
	frankenstien.

	woodrue emerges from the shadows, a portable phone in
	hand.

				woodrue
		ladies and gentlemen of the
		un-united nations.
			(into the phone)
		and our mystery bidder.

123	pull back to reveal

	a small bridge arcs over the room.  an american general,
	a russian commissar, a sheik, and a dictator all watch on
	from above.

				woodrue
		i give you the future of military
		conquest.

	a scrawny prisoner in a too-large tank suit is dragged
	into the room by several gun-toting capos and shackled to
	the gurney.  his bald skull is adorned with three
	surgically implanted ducts.

				woodrue
		may i present antonio diego, serial
		murderer serving life in prison and
		sole surviving volunteer.

	diego spits.

				woodrue
		and what a charmer he is.

124	wider.  pam slips in, unseen, hides behind a stack of
	circuit boxes, watching on as woodrue lifts the jar of
	milky venom.

				woodrue
		the super solder serum, code named
		venom, patent pending of course.

	woodrue pours the venom into a high-tech injector pack
	strapped to the back of the gurney.  he lifts an open-front
	black and white mask attached by snaking tubes to the
	injector pack.

				woodrue
		notice the hassle free zipper.

	he pulls the oversized mask over diego's head, tubes fitting
	into the ducts in his skull, zips the fabric closed over his
	face.

				woodrue
			(lifts a remote)
		time to scream.

	he hits a control stud on the remote.  the injector pack
	begins pumping the milky venom into diego's skull.  diego
	screams.

125	something strange happens to the prisoner.  his chest
	begins to enlarge.  his neck becomes thick.  his forearms grow.

				woodrue
		behold, the ideal killing machine.  i
		call this little number...bane. bane
		of humanity.  imagine it, your own
		personal army made up of thousands
		of these super soldiers.  bidding
		begins at a mere 10 million.

	woodrue ups the venom flow.  impossibly the prisoner grows
	larger.  arm and leg shackles snap.  bane lurches for the
	venom pump, smashing consoles, sparking components raining
	down around pam.

	pam screams.

	as capos rush to subdue bane, woodrue strides to the dazed
	pam.

				woodrue
		welcome to my parlor.
