	dark.  dormant.  the automatic activation sequence engages.
	ambient lights come on.  computers flicker into life.

	the giant batmobile pedestal begins to rise.  on it, no

	cave.  barbara.

	screen.

421a	ext. blossom street turkish baths

	robin arrives the entrance to the dark baths, lush,
	inviting, mysterious.  he passes the giant bird signal
	chained to the door, the spotlight shutting out as he
	disappears inside.
