511	int. observatory - night

	batman pulls himself up onto the aperture ledge as robin
	and batgirl climbs in from the other side.  the giant
	chamber is empty, the telescope still aimed at gotham.

				batman
			no sign of the snowman.

				robin
			maybe he melted.

512	batman shoots a batgrapple into the ceiling, swings
	across the room, dropping two bat-charges at the feet of
	the frozen scientists, continues his swing landing on the
	telescope platform.

	batgirl and robin swing onto the telescope platform to
	join batman.

513	the bat charges begin to glow, their radiating heat
	starting to melt the scientists.

513a				batgirl
		i hope you've got about ten million
		more of those little toys.

514	batgirl points at the control console clock.  11:52

515				robin
		eight more minutes and a city full
		of gothamites are ice cubes forever.

				batman
		sunlight could reverse the freezing
		process.

				batgirl
		sunrise isn't for five hours.

				batman
		here.

				robin
		but it's morning in the congo.

516	batman points to a screen showing a graphic represent-
	tation of the satellites in orbit.

				batman
		if we could relay the sunlight-

				robin
		from the other side of the equator-

				batgirl
		it'll take the satellites about a
		minute to re-align, but...damn!

				robin
		damn?  damn is not good.

				batgirl
		those targeting mirrors are frozen.
		the sun beam won't work.

517	pull back to reveal two small mirrors sitting on the
	telescope barrel.  both are encased in ice.

				batman
		i'll set the telescope.  you two
		thaw the mirrors.

518	batgirl and robin race out onto the telescope, each
	pulling a laser from their utility belts.

				batgirl
		i love this belt.  can i get a 
		matching handbag?

519	their lasers flare.  batgirl and robin begin thawing the
	mirrors.

520	batman goes to the main console, begins working the
	keyboard.

				batman
		who ever thought aunt harriet's
		typing lessons would lead to this?
