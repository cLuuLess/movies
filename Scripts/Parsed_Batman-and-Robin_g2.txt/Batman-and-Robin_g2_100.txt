342	int. wayne manor - night - walking

	bruce walks with alfred through the old house, shutting out
	lights.

				bruce
		are you well, old friend?

	alfred stops, stares into his charge's eyes, then turns
	away.

				alfred
		i am as well as can be expected.

				bruce
		alfred, i know you're sick -- i
		can get you the best doctors.

				alfred
		i've seen the best doctors--! a
		gentleman does not discuss his
		health.  it's not civilized.  i
		hope i've taught you at least
		that much, young man.

	bruce bites back a bitter smile.  he knows better than to
	push him when he's like this.

				bruce
		have you ever regretted your life
		working here, alfred?

				alfred
		attending to heroes?  no sir.  my
		only regret is that i was never
		able to be out there with you.

				bruce
		not all heroes wear masks.

	alfred smiles.

				bruce
		alfred, if i've never told you...i
		just want to say...

				alfred
		yes?

	bruce looks away, fighting tears, unable to say the words.

342a	bruce - pov.  out the window, a young bruce plays hide
	and seek with alfred, the old butler gone behind a hedge,
	then back again.

342b	back to scene
				dick
			(running in)
		freeze has escaped.

	out the window.  the batsignal shines in the night sky.
