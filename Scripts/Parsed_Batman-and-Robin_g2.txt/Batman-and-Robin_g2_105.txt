394	int. wayne manor - alfred's room - evening

	alfred lays on his bed.  bruce in black tie, kneels beside
	him.

				bruce
		i've spent my whole life trying to
		beat back death.  what good are all
		my heroics now if i can't save you?

				alfred
		everyone dies, master bruce.  there's
		no defeat in that.  victory comes in
		fighting for what we know is right
		while we still live.

394a	bruce looks past alfred.  there in the adjacent suite, a
	young alfred finishes reading to a  young bruce.  shuts out
	the light.

394b	back to scene

				bruce
		i love you, old man.

				alfred
		remember this.  and remember it
		always.  i'm proud of you.  and
		i love you too, son.

	they embrace.
