	a tiny basement room with a single barred window where
	prisoner's effects are kept.  mannequins display familiar
	costumes, joker's, riddler's, freeze's.

	fists smash through the cement wall and grab the chair,
	wrenching the seated guard through the wall in a storm of
	dust.

	bane enters, walks to freeze's suit.
