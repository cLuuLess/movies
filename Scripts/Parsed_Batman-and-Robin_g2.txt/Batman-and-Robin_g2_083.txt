281	ext. gotham alley - night

	the entrance to an abandoned turkish bath-house.  ivy and
	bane approach a boarded-up portal.

				ivy
		batface and birdbrain turned out to
		be more resistant to my love dust
		than expected.  no matter, i'll give
		them a stronger dose.  next time,
		they'll literally be dying for me.

282	bane smashes through the wooden boards with joined fists,
	two by fours splintering like balsa.  they disappear inside.
