177	int. alfred's room

	the door is ajar.  (over) a gentle knock.  barbara pushes
	inside, wearing a long terry robe.

	the room is empty.  she notices a pile of envelopes on the
	desk.

	envelopes - close.  all addressed to wilfred pennyworth.
	royal court of mirajanpore.  all stamped return to sender.

				alfred (over)
		i didn't know sneaking around was on
		the curriculum at oxbridge.

	barbara starts, turns.  alfred steps from the shadows in
	his robe.

				barbara
		i'm sorry, uncle, i came to tuck you
		in.  and...

				alfred
		you came to tuck me in.  that's quite
		a switch.
			(off the envelopes)
		i am looking for my brother, wilfred.
		he is first butler to the maharajah
		of mirajanpore.  but mirajanpore is a 
		floating court, it travels across
		india, so wilfred can be rather
		difficult to find.

178	alfred taps his computer keyboard.

179	screen - close.  full motion images of a resplendent royal
	court, carried entirely on the back of elephants.

				barbara (over)
		i guess they don't have fax machines
		on elephants.

				alfred
		i have been trying to reach wilfred
		with no success.  as one grows older,
		one yearns for family.

				barbara
			(she smiles)
		it's good to see you again, uncle.
		i've missed you.

				alfred
		as i've missed you.
			(kissing her head)
		sleep well, child.

	barbara heads out, closing the door behind her.
