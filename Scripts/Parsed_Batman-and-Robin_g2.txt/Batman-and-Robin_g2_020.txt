110	int. boiler room

	(over) a rumbling.
	suddenly the wall explodes.  freeze's
	drilling truck appears in the clearing smoke.

111				freeze
		can you be cold, batman?  you have
		eleven minutes to thaw the bird.
		what will you do, chase the villain
		or save the boy?

	freeze leaps onto the giant vehicle.

				freeze
		your emotions make you weak.  that is
		why this day is mine.
				(smile)
		stay cool, bats.

112	and freeze is gone, sealing the tunnel hole after him
	with a blast of ice, clearing the frosted pane to wave
	goodbye.

113	batman moves fast to the boy wonder, touches his frozen
	skin.  he whips out his bat-laser, points at the icy
	reservoir and fires.

114	the reservoir - close.  the frozen water melts, begins to
	simmer.

115	the caped crusader immerses robin in the steaming sea.

115a	under the water, the boy's face is perfectly still.

116	a long beat.  then robin's head breaks the surface.
	coughing.  alive

				robin
		did we get him?
