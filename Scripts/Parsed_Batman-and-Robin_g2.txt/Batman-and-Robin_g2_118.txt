427	int. blossom street turkish baths

	ivy sits on the bed, draws robin down beside her, faces
	close.

				ivy
		i'm glad you came.  i can't breathe
		without you.

				robin
		i want us to be together.  but i
		need to know you're serious about
		turning over a new leaf.  i need a
		sign.

				ivy
		how about dangerous curves?

				robin
		of trust. tell me your plan.

				ivy
		kiss me and i'll tell you.

				robin
		tell me and i'll kiss you.

				ivy
		freeze has turned the new telescope
		into a freezing gun.  he's about to
		turn gotham into an ice cube.

				robin
			(recoiling)
		i've got to stop him.

				ivy
			(pulling him back in)
		one kiss, my love.  for luck.

	robin can't resist.  they kiss.  ivy pulls back, holds his
	gaze.

				ivy
		bad luck, i'm afraid.  it's time to
		die, little bird.

				robin
		what do you mean?

				ivy
		you should have heeded your pointy-
		eared pal.  these lips can be murder.

				robin
		then you never loved me?

				ivy
		love you?  i loathe your bipedal
		arrogance, your animal superiority.
		my only joy is knowing that even now
		my poison kiss is sucking the life
		from your ape-like face.

				voice(over)
		i'm not saying i told you so.

428	ivy spins.  from the shadows, a figure emerges.  batman.

				ivy
		you're too late.  say bye-bye birdie.

				robin
		sorry to disappoint you.  but rubber
		lips are immune to your charms.

	robin peels a rubber coating from his mouth.  ivy stares
	in dismay.

428a				batman
		robin and i found the cure to your
		evil spell.  and that's teamwork.

428b	then she screams her rage. she shoves robin into the
	lily pool, the boy wonder immediately tangled into predatory
	vines.

428c	more vines wrench batman hanging upside down to the
	ceiling, the stalks squeezing our heroes.

				ivy
		sorry, boys, my vines have a little
		crush on you.

	ivy begins leaping across lily pads towards the exit.

				ivy
		gotta run.  so many people to kill.
		so little time.

431	the skylight - explodes.  the room fills with moonlight.

432	a figure comes flipping down from above.  long cape.  tall
	ears.  black leather. batgirl.

				batgirl
		you're about to become compost.

433	ivy and batgirl begin a furious martial arts battle.
	(choreography to come).

	batman pulls a bat-knife, begins cutting himself free.

	robin struggles to untangle himself from the aquatic vines.

	batgirl is fighting ivy, feet flying, hands moving like
	lighting.

				batgirl
		using feminine wiles to get what
		you want.  trading on your looks.
		exploiting men's weakness for sex.
		read a book, sister.  that passive-
		aggressive crap went out in the
		seventies.  chicks like you give
		women a bad name.

	batman deftly slashes through his captor vines.

	robin struggles, trying to free himself

	ivy gets the upper hand, backs batgirl against the wall.

				ivy
		as i told lady freeze when i pulled
		her plug, this is a one woman show.

				batgirl
		i don't think so.

438	batgirl grabs ivy's hair, knocking her out with a knee
	to the forehead, then batcuffs her.

	batman cuts himself freed, drops to the floor to face batgirl.

	robin pulls himself, dripping, from the pool.

438a				batman
		and you are?

				batgirl
		batgirl.

				batman
		that's not awfully pc.  how about
		batwoman?  batperson?

				batgirl
		it's me.  barbara.  i found the cave.

				robin
		we gotta get those locks changed.

				batman
		she knows who we are.

				robin
		i guess we'll just have to kill her.

				batman
		kill her later.  we've got work to do.

439	the three heroes race into the night.
