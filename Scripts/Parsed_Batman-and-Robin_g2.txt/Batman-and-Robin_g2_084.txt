283	int. blossom street turkish baths - night

	abandoned.  mid-eastern furniture crumbles.  slaves and
	sycophants cover the walls, weeping color.

				ivy
		a fixer-upper, yes.  but with a
		certain homey charm.

	that's when the shadows in the cave begin to move.  one
	slips across the doorway.  more appear on all sides,
	encroaching.

				ivy
		ah, a minus.  current tenants.

	one figure steps into a column of moonlight.  pale.  the
	toughest of urban predators.  these are a gang of punks
	called the golums.

				golum
		hello, pretty.

				ivy
		hello yourself.  i love this place.  i
		hope it's priced to sell.

				golum
		we love you.  you look good enough to
		eat.

				ivy
		oh, that i am.  come and get me.
		if you can.

	the golums close in.  ivy slams the activation stud on
	bane's chest.

284	bane - close.  venom is pumped from his backpack through
	the tubes on his back into his skull.

285	the golums attack.  but bane hurls them off like animals.
	kick and beats them, tossing them into walls, until the
	survivors race away.

				ivy
		for the strong, silent type, you are
		most persuasive.  let's redecorate.
			(crossing the baths)
		first, the light is all wrong.

286	bane rips a hanging board from the ceiling, the old
	wooden planks tumbling to the floor, sudden moonlight
	streaming in from above.

				ivy
		also, what is this floor?

287	bane stomps the floor, now revealing the dirt beneath.

				ivy
		au natural.  still, i've always
		hankered for something on the water.

288	bane smashes a water main with his foot, irrigating the
	soil.

				ivy
		now a little color.  it took god
		seven days to create paradise.

	ivy withdraws a handful of tiny seeds from bane's satchel.

				ivy
		let's see if i can do better.

289	ivy drops the tiny plants on the ground.  they begin to
	sprout into vines that spawn fast-budding flowers.

	ivy lifts the welcome to gotham bauble in her hand.

				ivy
		bane, i've found a fellow who strikes
		my fancy.  a cool customer, yes.  icy
		demeanor, no question.  but i detect
		a certain ruthless charm i may be
		able to use to my advantage.
			(off the dead thugs)
