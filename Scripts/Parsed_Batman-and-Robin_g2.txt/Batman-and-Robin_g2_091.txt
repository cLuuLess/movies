				dick
		alfred and bruce are like family.

				barbara
		paying someone to prepare your
		meals and do your laundry and
		clean your dishes, you call that
		family?

				dick
		alfred's happy here.

				barbara
		happy.
				(a beat)
		you honestly don't know, do you?
		you can't even see what's in
		front of your own eyes.

	they've reached the main stair.  dick stares at her
	puzzled.

				barbara
		look at his skin. at how he's hiding
		the pain all the time.  can't you see
		it?  alfred's sick.

	and with that, barbara disappears upstairs.  dick stares
	after her.

				bruce (over)
		alfred's not sick.

	bruce steps from the shadows.  sits now at the foot of the
	steps.

				bruce
		he's dying.  and i can't deal with it.

				dick
		but he's never said a word-

				bruce
		you know alfred.  he'd never say
		anything.  but i can tell.  until
		you came along, alfred was the
		only family i ever had.  without
		him, i don't know how i would
		have survived.  he saved my life,
		dick.  and i've never told him.

				dick
		talk to him, bruce.  there's nothing
		worse than losing someone without
		telling them how you feel.

				bruce
		i'm scared, dick.  maybe for the
		first time in my life.  i'm really
		scared.
