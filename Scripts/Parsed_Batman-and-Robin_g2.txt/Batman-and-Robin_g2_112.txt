416	int. observatory - tower platform

	the scientist and his associate stand amidst the debris
	from the party, testing the telescope.  (over) a tremendous
	smashing.

	on the floor below freeze and bane enter.

				freeze
		hi.  sorry about the door.  is the
		party over?

	bane begins pulling charges from his satchel and setting
	them around the room.

				scientist
		who the hell is this nutball?

417	freeze points up, fires a cryonic blast at him, turning
	him to ice.

				freeze
		that's mr. nutball to you.  half a
		set of bookends.
			(to the associate)
		you.  go like this.

	freeze pantomimes the scientist's frozen expression of
	terror for the associate.  the associate, terrified,
	imitates freeze's move.

				freeze
		no.  move your hands up.  higher.
		now a hint more fear.  excellent.

418	freeze fires another blast, freezing the associate in
	the same position as the scientist.

				freeze
		a matched pair.  sometimes i exceed
		even my wildest expectations.

	freeze smiles at the mighty telescope.

				freeze
		if revenge is a dish best served
		cold, then put on your sunday
		finest.  it's time to feast.
