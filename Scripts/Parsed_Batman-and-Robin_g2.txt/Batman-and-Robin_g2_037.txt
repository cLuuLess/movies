162	int. wayne manor - foyer - afternoon

	columns of dancing sunlight fill the giant entryway.  dick
	goes to the front door as bruce meets alfred emerging in
	the b.g.

				alfred
		i must have dozed off.  my sincerest
		apologies, sir.

				bruce
		no apology necessary.  that's the
		first time in thirty years.

	bruce smiles, but he can't take his eyes off alfred.  the
	butler seems pale, older than usual.

				dick
		mystery pizza delivery?

163	dick opens the door.  a young girl stands in the autumn
	light, beautiful, dressed in prim, schoolgirl clothes,
	barbara wilson.

				dick
		please be looking for me.

				barbara
		i'm so sorry to trouble you, but-

	that's when the girl sports alfred.  the old man's eyes
	widen.

				barbara
		uncle alfred?

164	barbara rushes in, past dick and bruce, into the old
	butler's arms.  he holds her close.  bruce and dick face
	each other.

				bruce & dick
				(mouthing)
		uncle?
