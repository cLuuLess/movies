	glowing rings on the floor and ceiling project a shimmer-
	ing column of snowing cold within the center of the room.

	two guards dump a suitless freeze out of his frigidaire
	prison onto the floor, begin dragging him into the cold field.

278	freeze throws off the guards in a sudden fury, smashing
	one in the head with closed fists, kicking the other in the face.

279	he rushes for the door.  mistake.  as his body passes out
	of the hypothermic field, he tumbles to his knees, his
	skin turning gray as he begins to wither and die.

		look at him stew.  how do you like
		your bad guy, medium or well done?

280	the guards stand over him, laughing as he crawls back
	over the filed threshold.  his color begin to return to
	normal.

				guard #2
		get used to it.  you're gonna be here
		a very long time.

	freeze looks up at the guard who stands now at the wall
	sink, washing his hands.  a beat.  then freeze smiles.

				freeze
		i'm afraid not.  you see the means
		of my liberation is in your hands.
		sadly, you will not live to see it.
