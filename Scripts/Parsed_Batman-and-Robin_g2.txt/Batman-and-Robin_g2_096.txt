328	int. freeze's cell

	pam's saunter has brought her back to the two mesmerized
	guards.

				ivy
		men.  the most absurd of all god's
		creatures.  we give you life and we
		can take it back just as easily.

	she holds one guard's chin in each hand.  leans in to kiss
	them.

				ivy
		what if i told you one kiss from me
		would kill you?

				guard						
		right

				guard #2
		whatever.

				ivy
		i really am to die for.

	she kisses first one, then the other.  they choke, fall.
	dead.

				freeze
		impressive

				ivy
		well, i, my most unabominable
		snowman, have been impressed by you.
		in fact i propose a pairing.  so i'm
		here to set you free.

				freeze
		an enticing offer.  but what does the
		lady want in return?

				ivy
		let's cool it for now.  there's
		someone i want you to meet.

330	ivy presses a button and the door slides open.  bane
	runs in, wheeling freeze's suit.  ivy seals the door
	behind him.

				freeze
		ah, a laundry service that delivers.

	bane rolls the cart across the cryonic field.  freeze
	begins to dress.

				ivy
		i love that belt.  what are you,
		about a fifty big and tall?

				freeze
		i always go a size smaller.  makes
		me look slimmer.

331	freeze - pov.  his watch like status display shows his
	power supply.  dangerously low.  auxiliary power only.

	freeze opens his sleeve compartments.  empty.

				freeze
		they've confiscated my generator
		diamonds.  i'm running on empty.

332	(over) the shouts of approaching guards.  the flame of a 
	laser torch begins to cut around the side of the front
	door.

333/	ivy hits the venom pump.  bane lifts his fists and tries
334	to shash the far wall.  it doesn't break.

				ivy
		not good.

335	(over) the shouts of more guards coming down the hall.
	freeze reaches for his holster.  empty.

				freeze
		no gun.  how disarming.

				ivy
		i wonder if i can get a cell with
		a view of the gardens?

				freeze
		dear daisy, don't despair.

336	freeze walks to a sink set into the cell wall.  he turns
	on the water.  freeze cracks his gauntlet seal, cryo-gas
	hissing out.

				freeze
		always winterize your pipes.

337	freeze aims the gas jet at the spigot.  pipes around the
	room begin to freeze, bulging with the cold, frozen water
	within them splitting metal, rushing towards, cracking,
	the stone wall.
