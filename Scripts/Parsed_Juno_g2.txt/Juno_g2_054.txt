               ext. dancing elk school - track - day

               bleeker is running alone on the track. his exhalations are 
               icy puffs in the air. bleeker's friend vijay jogs up alongside 
               him. vijay is a solemn, skinny boy, much like bleeker.

                                     vijay
                         hey man.

                                     bleeker
                         oh, hey vijay.

                                     vijay
                         did you hear juno macguff is pregnant?

                                     bleeker
                         yup.

                                     vijay
                         just like our moms and teachers!

                                     bleeker
                         yup.

                                     vijay
                         did you hear it's yours?

                                     bleeker
                         yup.

                                     vijay
                         what a trip, man.

                                     bleeker
                         i don't really know anything about 
                         it.

                                     vijay
                         you should grow a moustache. you're 
                         a real man now.

                                     bleeker
                         i can't grow a moustache. it never 
                         comes in evenly.

                                     vijay
                         me neither. but i'm going to stop 
                         wearing underpants in order to raise 
                         my sperm count. see you.

               vijay jogs off. bleeker stops and wipes away his sweat.
