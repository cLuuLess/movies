               int. loring house - living room - day

               mark and vanessa usher juno and mac into the austere, spacious 
               living room. a woman in a business suit sits on the couch 
               with a briefcase in her lap.

                                     mark
                         this is our attorney, gerta rauss.

                                     juno
                              (in exaggerated, 
                              growling german accent)
                         geeeerta rauuuss!

                                     gerta
                              (straight)
                         nice to meet you.

               mac seizes mark's hand and pumps it heartily.

                                     mac
                         i'm mac macguff, and this, of course, 
                         is my daughter juno.

                                     mark
                         like the city in alaska?

                                     juno
                         no.

                                     mark
                         cool. well, let's sit down and get 
                         to know each other a bit.

                                     vanessa
                         i'll get drinks. what would everyone 
                         like? i've got pellegrino, vitamin 
                         water...

                                     juno
                         a maker's mark, please. up.

                                     mac
                         she's joking. junebug has a wonderful 
                         sense of humor, which is just one of 
                         her many genetic gifts.

                                     juno
                         i also have good teeth. no cavities. 
                         we finally got fluoridated water in 
                         dancing elk.

               she bares them frighteningly to demonstrate.

               vanessa stares, unflappable.

                                     mac
                         we're fine, thank you.

               mac and juno join mark and gerta rauss on the couch.

                                     gerta
                         so, juno. first off, how far along 
                         are you?

                                     juno
                         i'm a junior.

                                     gerta
                         no, i mean in your pregnancy.

                                     juno
                         oh. uh, my stepmom took me to the 
                         doctor yesterday and they said i was 
                         twelve weeks.

               vanessa enters with the refreshments on a tray.

                                     vanessa
                         oh, that's marvelous. so you're almost 
                         into your second trimester, then?

                                     juno
                         yeah, apparently. i'm having it on 
                         may 4.

                                     vanessa
                         the tough part's almost over for 
                         you. i mean, my girlfriends always 
                         tell me the first couple months are 
                         the hardest.

                                     juno
                         yeah, but i hardly noticed it. i'm 
                         more worried about the part where i 
                         have to start wearing jeans with an 
                         elastic panel in the front.

                                     vanessa
                         i think pregnancy is beautiful.

                                     juno
                         well, you're lucky it's not you.

               vanessa's looks to the ceiling.

                                     mark
                              (clearing throat)
                         so, let's discuss how we're gonna do 
                         this... thing.

                                     juno
                         well, i just have the baby and give 
                         it to you, right?

                                     gerta
                         mark and vanessa are willing to 
                         negotiate an open adoption.

                                     mac
                              (protective)
                         wait. what does that mean?

                                     gerta
                         it means they'd send annual updates, 
                         photos, let juno know how the baby 
                         is doing as he or she grows up. of 
                         course, juno's legal rights would be 
                         terminated...

                                     juno
                         whoah. i don't want to see pictures. 
                         i don't need to be notified of 
                         anything. can't we just kick it old 
                         school? i could just put the baby in 
                         a basket and send it your way. you 
                         know, like moses in the reeds.

                                     mark
                         technically, that would be kickin' 
                         it old testament.

               mark and juno lock eyes.

                                     juno
                         yeah. yeah! the way people used to 
                         do it. quick and dirty, like ripping 
                         off a band-aid.

                                     gerta
                         well, then we agree a traditional 
                         closed adoption would be best for 
                         all involved, then?

                                     juno
                         shit, yeah. close it up.

               vanessa is clearly ecstatic.

                                     mark
                         obviously, we'll compensate you for 
                         your medical expenses.

                                     vanessa
                         are you looking for any other 
                         compensation?

                                     mac
                         excuse me?

                                     juno
                         well, no... i'm not going to sell 
                         the baby. i just want it to grow up 
                         with people who are ready to love it 
                         and be parents. i'm in high school, 
                         dude. i'm ill-equipped.

                                     vanessa
                         you're doing an amazing and selfless 
                         thing for us.

                                     mark
                         vanessa has wanted a baby since we 
                         got married.

                                     vanessa
                         i want to be a mommy so badly!

               juno and mac stare at her.

                                     mac
                         you don't say.

                                     vanessa
                         well, haven't you ever felt like you 
                         were born to do something?

                                     mac
                         yes. heating and air conditioning.

                                     vanessa
                         well, i was born to be a mother. 
                         some of us are.

                                     juno
                         mark, are you looking forward to 
                         being a dad?

               mark is caught off guard.

                                     mark
                         sure, why not? i mean, every guy 
                         wants to be a father. coach soccer, 
                         help with science projects and... i 
                         don't know. fatherly stuff.

               mac casts a subtle, dubious glance at mark.

                                     vanessa
                         well, shall we start looking over 
                         the paperwork? gerta has already 
                         drafted some preliminary documents.

                                     juno
                         can i use the facilities first? being 
                         pregnant makes you pee like 
                         seabiscuit.

                                     vanessa
                         sure. the powder room down here is 
                         being re-tiled, but you can use the 
                         master bath upstairs. go up, then 
                         turn left and on your right...

                                     juno
                         room with a toilet, got it.
