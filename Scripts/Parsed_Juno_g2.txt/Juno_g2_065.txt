               int. loring house - entry way - day

               vanessa and mark walk juno out. juno peers at some shopping 
               bags from various kids stores.

                                     juno
                         hey, what kind of swag did you score?

                                     mark
                         yeah. mall madness, huh?

                                     vanessa
                         oh it's just some stuff i picked up. 
                         for, you know, the baby. babies need 
                         a lot of things. i want everything 
                         to be just right.

                                     juno
                         i thought people got all that stuff 
                         at baby showers. when my stepmom had 
                         my sister i remember she got about a 
                         million presents. they were all lame 
                         though, so i wasn't jealous.

                                     mark
                         i doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.

                                     juno
                         why?

                                     vanessa
                         um, i think people are kind of unsure 
                         about the situation because it's 
                         not, you know, set in stone.

                                     juno
                         what do you mean? you mean...
                              (aghast)
                         do you think i'm going to flake out 
                         on you?

                                     vanessa
                         no, no, i don't think that, juno. 
                         it's just that, we went through a 
                         situation before where it didn't 
                         work out.

               juno glances at mark and again at vanessa. vanessa looks 
               embarrassed.

                                     mark
                         cold feet.

                                     juno
                         you should have gone to china. i 
                         heard they give away babies like 
                         free ipods. they shoot 'em out of 
                         those t-shirt guns at sports events.

                                     vanessa
                              (abruptly)
                         right. well, juno, your parents must 
                         be wondering where you are. you might 
                         want to head home.

                                     juno
                         naah. i'm already pregnant, so they 
                         figure nothing worse could happen to 
                         me. i gotta bounce anyway. it was 
                         nice seeing you guys again.

               she waves and heads for the door.

                                     mark
                              (to juno)
                         hey, don't forget your bag.

               vanessa looks pain-stricken as mark helps juno with her bag.
