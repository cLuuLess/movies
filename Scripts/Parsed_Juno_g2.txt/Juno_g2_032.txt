               ext. women's choice clinic - day

               juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic. there 
               is a lone abortion protester, a teenager of asian descent 
               holding a hugely oversized sign that reads "no babies like 
               murdering."

                                     lone protester
                              (chanting in extremely 
                              shy, accented voice)
                         all babies want to get borned! all 
                         babies want to get borned!

               juno recognizes the protester as a classmate of hers.

                                     juno
                         uh, hi su-chin.

                                     su-chin
                         oh, hi juno. how are you?

                                     juno
                         good. i'm good.
                              (pause)
                         did you finish that paper for worth's 
                         class yet?

                                     su-chin
                         no, not yet. i tried to work on it a 
                         little last night, but i'm having 
                         trouble concentrating.

                                     juno
                         you should try adderall.

                                     su-chin
                         no thanks. i'm off pills.

                                     juno
                         wise move. i know this girl who had 
                         a huge crazy freakout because she 
                         took too many behavioral meds at 
                         once. she took off her clothes and 
                         jumped into the fountain at ridgedale 
                         mall and she was like, "blaaaaah! 
                         i'm a kraken from the sea!"

                                     su-chin
                         i heard that was you.

                                     juno
                         well, it was nice seeing you.

               she continues on toward the clinic entrance.

                                     su-chin
                              (calling out)
                         juno! your baby probably has a beating 
                         heart, you know. it can feel pain. 
                         and it has fingernails.

                                     juno
                         really? fingernails?

               she considers the concept, then pushes open the clinic door.
