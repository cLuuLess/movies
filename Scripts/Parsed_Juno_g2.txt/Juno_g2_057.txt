               int. doctor's office - afternoon

               splooge! we see ultrasound goo being squirted onto juno's 
               exposed pregnant belly. an ultrasound technician is using a 
               doppler device to view the contents of her burgeoning bump. 
               bren and leah ooh and ahh at the resulting image.

               the tech takes measurements and types them into her database.

                                     ultrasound tech
                         that's the feet...

                                     all three
                         oooh...

                                     ultrasound tech
                         and there's a hand...

               the monitor reveals the baby's head.

                                     all three
                              (various)
                         check that out... no way...

                                     bren
                              (dreamily)
                         would you look at that?

                                     leah
                         check out baby big-head. that kid is 
                         scary!

                                     juno
                         hey, i'm a sacred vessel. all you've 
                         got in your belly is taco bell!

                                     leah
                         touche.

                                     juno
                              (gazing at the monitor)
                         it is really weird looking. it's 
                         like it's not even real. i can't 
                         believe there are saps who actually 
                         cry at these things.

               juno and leah look at bren, who is dabbing her eyes 
               discreetly.

                                     bren
                         what? i'm not made of stone.

                                     ultrasound tech
                         well, there we have it. would you 
                         like to know the sex?

                                     leah
                         aw, please junebug?

                                     juno
                         no way. no, i definitely don't want 
                         to know.

                                     ultrasound tech
                         planning to be surprised when you 
                         deliver?

                                     juno
                         i want mark and vanessa to be 
                         surprised, and if i know, i won't be 
                         able to keep myself from telling 
                         them and ruining the whole thing.

                                     ultrasound tech
                              (condescending)
                         are mark and vanessa your friends at 
                         school?

                                     juno
                         no, they're the people who are 
                         adopting the baby.

                                     ultrasound tech
                         oh. well, thank goodness for that.

                                     bren
                         wait, what's that supposed to mean?

                                     ultrasound tech
                         i just see a lot of teenage mothers 
                         come through here. it's obviously a 
                         poisonous environment for a baby to 
                         be raised in.

               juno, leah and bren become immediately defensive.

                                     juno
                         how do you know i'm so poisonous? 
                         like, what if the adoptive parents 
                         turn out to be evil molesters?

                                     leah
                         or stage parents!

                                     bren
                         they could be utterly negligent. 
                         maybe they'll do a far shittier job 
                         of raising a kid than my dumbass 
                         stepdaughter ever would. have you 
                         considered that?

                                     ultrasound tech
                         no... i guess not.

                                     bren
                         what is your job title, exactly?

                                     ultrasound tech
                         excuse me?

                                     bren
                         i said, what-is-your-job-title, missy?

                                     ultrasound tech
                         i'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.

                                     bren
                         well i'm a nail technician, and i 
                         think we both ought to stick to what 
                         we know.

                                     ultrasound tech
                         what are you talking about?

                                     bren
                         you think you're special because you 
                         get to play picture pages up there?

               bren gestures to the ultrasound monitor.

                                     bren
                         my five year-old daughter could do 
                         that, and let me tell you, she is 
                         not the brightest bulb in the tanning 
                         bed. so why don't you go back to 
                         night school in manteno and learn a 
                         real trade!

               the ultrasound tech exits in a huff.

                                     juno
                         bren, you're a dick! i love it.
