               int. dancing elk school - science lab - day

               students bustle in, as the teacher, mr. tinker tries to 
               maintain order. juno heads toward her desk and sets down her 
               bag.

                                     mr. tinker
                         people! we're doing our photomagnetism 
                         lab today, so find your partner and 
                         break out into fours.

               juno looks up and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner: 
               bleeker. sound the gong of awkwardness!

               juno and bleeker head separately over to an available lab 
               station and unpack their bags in silence.

                                     juno
                         well! nothing like experimenting.

                                     bleeker
                         i did the prep questions for this 
                         lab last night. you can copy my 
                         answers if you need to.

               he slides a piece of graph paper in front of juno without 
               looking at her.

                                     juno
                         oh, i couldn't copy your work.

                                     bleeker
                         but you copy my work every week.

                                     juno
                         oh yeah. i'm kind of a deadbeat lab 
                         partner, huh?

                                     bleeker
                         i don't mind. you definitely bring 
                         something to the table.

                                     juno
                         charisma?

                                     bleeker
                         or something.

               the other two lab partners, a humorless couple, join them at 
               the station.

                                     juno
                         so, who's ready for some 
                         photomagnificence?

                                     girl lab partner
                         i have a menstrual migraine, and i 
                         can't look at bright lights today.

                                     guy lab partner
                         amanda, i told you to go to the 
                         infirmary and lie down. you never 
                         listen.

                                     girl lab partner
                         no josh, i don't take orders. not 
                         from you and not from any man.

                                     guy lab partner
                         you know, you've been acting like 
                         this ever since i went up to see my 
                         brother at mankato. i told you, 
                         nothing happened!

                                     girl lab partner
                         something happened. because your 
                         eyes? are very cold? they're very 
                         cold, josh. they're cold, lying eyes.

                                     guy lab partner
                         what? my eyes are not lying!

                                     girl lab partner
                         yes they are, josh. since mankato, 
                         they have been lying eyes.

               juno and bleeker observe the argument like tennis spectators, 
               fascinated by the dynamics of a real couple.

                                     bleeker
                         okay... i'm going to set up the 
                         apparatus. juno, want to get a c 
                         clamp out of that drawer?

                                     girl lab partner
                         i'm going to the infirmary.

                                     guy lab partner
                         good. call me when you're off the 
                         rag.

                                     girl lab partner
                         fine. call me when you learn how to 
                         love just one person and not cheat 
                         at your brother's college just because 
                         you had four smirnoff ices and a 
                         bottle of snow peak peach flavored 
                         boone's!

                                     guy lab partner
                         good, i'll be sure to do that, amanda. 
                         i'll make a note of it.

               he furiously scrawls a fake memo in his notebook.

                                     juno
                         snow peak peach is the best flavor 
                         of boone's. right, bleek?

               bleeker reddens and continues constructing the apparatus. 
               girl lab partner stalks off dramatically.

               bleeker shakes his head and rifles through his textbook.
