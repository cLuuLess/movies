               ext. macguff house - evening

               juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, 
               gnawing on the super rope. she stops and loops the super 
               rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to 
               fashion a noose.

               juno trudges toward her house. the yard is a wild tangle of 
               prairie grass and wild flowers.
