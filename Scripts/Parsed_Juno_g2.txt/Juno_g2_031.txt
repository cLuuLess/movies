               int. macguff house - dining room - night

               liberty bell coughs pitifully as bren leans over her plate.

                                     mac
                         so juno, how did your maneuver go 
                         last night?

                                     juno
                         which maneuver, sir? the one in which 
                         i moved an entire living room set 
                         from one lawn to another, or the one 
                         in which i cleared a sixty-four ounce 
                         blue slushie in ten minutes?

               bren speaks in her strong city accent.

                                     bren
                         juno? did you happen to barf in my 
                         urn? mac, you know that nice urn by 
                         the front door, the one i got up in 
                         stillwater? i found some weird blue 
                         shit, i mean stuff, gunk, in there 
                         this morning.

                                     juno
                         i would never barf in your urn, 
                         brenda. maybe l.b. did it.

               we see liberty bell blithely pouring bacon bits onto her 
               dinner.

                                     mac
                         liberty bell, if i see one more baco 
                         on that potato, i'm gonna kick your 
                         monkey ass.
