               ext. macguff house - night

               juno parks her car and walks up to her house. a porch light's 
               been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         i never realize how much i like being 
                         home unless i've been somewhere really 
                         different for a while.

               she picks a crocus from the unkempt garden near the porch 
               and sniffs it. she lifts her shirt and tickles her belly 
               with it. then she tucks the flower into her unkempt hair.
