               ext. corner store - night

               juno lays on the hood of her previa, contemplating her future. 
               we push in close... when she gets an idea.

               she hops off the hood and scurries into the previa where she 
               finds a crumpled up jiffy lube receipt. she unfolds it and 
               pulls out a pen, ready to write something... a note?
