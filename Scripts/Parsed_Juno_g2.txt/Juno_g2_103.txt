               juno is lying on her back on the bed, staring at the ceiling. 
               she's more pregnant than we've ever seen her. she revs a 
               matchbox car against the slope of her belly and lets it roll. 
               juno suddenly sits up, looking thoroughly freaked. she pats 
               her lap frantically and jumps off the bed.
