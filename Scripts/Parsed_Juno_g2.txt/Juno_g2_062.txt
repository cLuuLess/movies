               int. loring house - den - afternoon

               as they move into the living room, juno sits down and motions 
               for mark to join her on the couch.

                                     juno
                         park it, dude.

               mark sits down. with great fanfare, juno retrieves a dark, 
               glossy sheet from the envelope. it's her ultrasound.

                                     juno
                         behold, good sir! the very first 
                         photo of your future child.

                                     mark
                         you're kidding!

               mark examines the ultrasound, baffled.

                                     juno
                         i think it kind of looks like my 
                         friend, paulie.

                                     mark
                              (joking)
                         oh, is he bald and amorphous?

                                     juno
                         no, he's the dad.

               mark looks jolted, as if it's the first time he considered 
               that her baby might have a father. he stands up and holds 
               the photo up to the light critically.

                                     mark
                         can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?

                                     juno
                         the doctor can tell, but i decided 
                         not to know. i want it to be a big 
                         surprise.

                                     mark
                         well, it can really only go two ways.

                                     juno
                         that's what you think. i drink tons 
                         of booze so you might get one of 
                         those scary neuter-babies that's 
                         born without junk.

                                     mark
                         junk?

                                     juno
                         you know... it's parts...

                                     mark
                         i know what junk is.

                                     juno
                              (teasing)
                         yeah?

                                     mark
                         we definitely want it to have junk.

                                     juno
                         well don't worry about it. my stepmom 
                         is forcing me to eat really healthy. 
                         she won't even let me stand in front 
                         of the microwave or eat red m&ms. 
                         hope you're ready.

               mark chuckles.

                                     mark
                         wait...do you hear that?

               a new song has begun. mark closes his eyes in ecstasy and 
               walks toward the stereo. juno follows him toward the source 
               of the music, looking perplexed by how happy he is.

                                     juno
                         what is it?

                                     mark
                         it's only my favorite song. it's 
                         sonic youth doing "superstar" by the 
                         carpenters.

                                     juno
                              (excited)
                         i've heard the carpenters before. 
                         chick drummer and freaky dude. not 
                         unlike the white stripes.

                                     mark
                         you haven't heard the carpenters 
                         like this. listen.

               mark grabs the stereo remote off the kitchen counter and 
               turns up the volume to a roar. mark and juno stand in silence 
               in the kitchen. mark mouths along with the lyrics.

                                     mark
                              (lipsynching)
                         don't you remember you told me you 
                         loved me, baby...

                                     juno
                         hey, i like this.

                                     mark
                         this album is all carpenters covers 
                         by alt-rock bands. it's called if i 
                         were a carpenter. it is god. i'll 
                         rip a copy for you before you leave.

                                     juno
                         you don't have to do that.

                                     mark
                         it's the least i can do. what did 
                         you say your favorite band was?

                                     juno
                         i didn't. but it's a three-way tie 
                         between the stooges, patti smith and 
                         the runaways.

                                     mark
                         yeah, i definitely need to make you 
                         some cds. at least while my kid is 
                         hanging out in there.

               he gestures at juno's burgeoning paunch.

               mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling 
               cd's. he's got a carpenter's disc, the "no alternative" 
               charity compilation, and mother love bone.

               juno spots a vhs tape on the coffee table and picks it up.

                                     juno
                              (reading title)
                         the wizard of gore?

                                     mark
                              (distracted)
                         oh yeah. it's herschel gordon lewis. 
                         he's the ultimate master of horror.

                                     juno
                         please. dario argento is the ultimate 
                         master of horror.

               mark swivels around slowly on his desk chair, surprised.

                                     mark
                         argento's good, but lewis is 
                         completely demented. we're talking 
                         buckets of goo. red corn syrup 
                         everywhere. and fake brains up the 
                         yin-yang.

                                     juno
                              (examining the tape 
                              box)
                         frankly, this looks kind of stupid.

               mark gives a look - "oh, really?"
