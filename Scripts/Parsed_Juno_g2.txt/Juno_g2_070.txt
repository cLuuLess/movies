               int. bleeker house - paulie's bedroom - night

               paulie is on the floor surrounded by old quizzes, studying 
               like the tortured brainiac he is. mrs. bleeker opens the 
               bedroom door. juno appears. paulie jumps, startled.

                                     juno
                         hey, don't concentrate so hard, man. 
                         i think i smell hair burning.

               bleeker smiles faintly.

                                     bleeker's mom
                         ten minutes.

               she closes the door halfway and leaves. juno rolls her eyes 
               and pulls the door shut entirely.

                                     bleeker
                         what's up?

                                     juno
                         i just wanted to come over. you know, 
                         say hi. i miss hanging out with you 
                         on school nights.

                                     bleeker
                         i miss it too.

               he nervously cracks open a container of orange tic-tacs and 
               pours them into his mouth.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         orange tic-tacs are bleeker's one 
                         and only vice. when we made out, the 
                         day i got pregnant, his mouth tasted 
                         really tangy and delicious.
