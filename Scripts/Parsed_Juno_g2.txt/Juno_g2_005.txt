               int. drugstore - continuous

               rollo, the eccentric drugstore clerk, sneers at juno from 
               behind the counter. he wears a polyester uniform vest.

                                     rollo
                         well, well. if it isn't macguff the 
                         crime dog! back for another test?

                                     juno
                         i think the last one was defective. 
                         the plus sign looked more like a 
                         division sign.

               rollo regards her with intense skepticism.

                                     juno
                         i remain unconvinced.

               rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach.

                                     rollo
                         this is your third test today, mama 
                         bear. your eggo is preggo, no doubt 
                         about it!

               an eavesdropping tough girl wearing an oversized jacket and 
               lots of makeup gapes at juno from the beauty aisle.

                                     tough girl
                         three times? oh girl, you are way 
                         pregnant. it's easy to tell. is your 
                         nipples real brown?

               a pile of stolen cosmetics falls out of the girl's jacket 
               and clatters to the floor.

                                     tough girl
                         balls!

               juno crosses and crosses her legs awkwardly, hopping. it's 
               obvious she has to use the bathroom urgently.

                                     rollo
                         maybe you're having twins. maybe 
                         your little boyfriend's got mutant 
                         sperms and he knocked you up twice!

                                     juno
                         silencio! i just drank my weight in 
                         sunny d. and i have to go, pronto.

               rollo sighs and slips her the bathroom key. juno races down 
               one of the aisles.

                                     rollo
                         well, you know where the lavatory 
                         is.
                              (calling after her)
                         you pay for that pee stick when you're 
                         done! don't think it's yours just 
                         because you've marked it with your 
                         urine!

                                     juno
                         jesus, i didn't say it was.

                                     rollo
                         well, it's not. you're not a lion in 
                         a pride!
                              (to himself)
                         these kids, acting like lions with 
                         their unplanned pregnancies and their 
                         sunny delights.
