               ext. bleeker house - morning

               paul bleeker steps onto the front porch of his house for 
               early morning track practice. he wears a cross country uniform 
               that reads "dancing elk condors." he is eating some kind of 
               microwaved snack gimmick.

               bleeker is startled to discover that juno is outside waiting 
               for him. she has somehow arranged the living room set on the 
               front lawn, and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe 
               officiously.

                                     juno
                         hey bleek.

                                     bleeker
                         hey, cool tiger. looks proud.

                                     juno
                         yeah, i swiped it from ms. rancick.

                                     bleeker
                         cool.

                                     juno
                         your shorts are looking especially 
                         gold today.

                                     bleeker
                         my mom uses color-safe bleach.

                                     juno
                         go carole.
                              (a beat)
                         so, guess what?

                                     bleeker
                              (shrugs)
                         i don't know...

                                     juno
                         i'm pregnant.

               stunned silence. juno pops up the footrest of the recliner 
               and leans back comfortably.

                                     bleeker
                         i guess so.
                              (fidgeting)
                         what are you going to do?

               the dancing elk prep cross country team runs past bleeker's 
               house in a thundering herd, wearing a motley assortment of 
               warm-ups. their momentum stirs the crackling fall leaves. 
               they wave and holler at bleeker and juno.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         when i see them all running like 
                         that, with their things bouncing 
                         around in their shorts, i always 
                         picture them naked, even if i don't 
                         want to. i have intrusive thoughts 
                         all the time.
