               int. ridgedale mall - elevator bank - a half hour later

               leah and juno approach the elevator.

                                     juno
                         i want a huge cookie. and like, a 
                         lamb kebob. simultaneously.

                                     leah
                         god, spermy. must you always feed?

               the elevator door opens, revealing... vanessa.

                                     vanessa
                         juno?

               juno tries her best to look enthused.

                                     juno
                         well hi vanessa! what brings you to 
                         the mall today?

                                     vanessa
                         just, you know, shopping with my 
                         girlfriends.

                                     leah
                         you're gay?

               juno glares at leah.

                                     vanessa
                              (confused)
                         no...

                                     juno
                         please excuse leah. she's mentally 
                         challenged.

                                     vanessa
                         oh, okay. so... how are you feeling?

                                     juno
                         happy? oh, you mean like, physically. 
                         i'm good. look, i have a snooze button 
                         now!

               she lifts her shirt and presses her popped-out navel.

                                     vanessa
                         that's great.

               vanessa is admiring the belly, when juno grimaces.

                                     juno
                         dude, it's moshing all over.

               vanessa looks confused.

                                     juno
                              (explains)
                         it's kicking.

               vanessa nods in understanding then begins summoning the 
               courage for an unusual request.

                                     vanessa
                         um... juno, can i -- can i touch it?

                                     juno
                         are you kidding? everyone at school 
                         is always grabbing at my belly. i'm 
                         like a legend. they call me the 
                         cautionary whale.

               she grabs vanessa's hand and plants it on her stomach.

                                     vanessa
                         i can't feel anything.

               vanessa moves her hand, wanting desperately to feel the baby.

                                     vanessa
                         it's not moving for me.

               she says this as though it's an admission of failure.

                                     juno
                         oh, you should try talking to it. 
                         they can apparently hear speech in 
                         there, even though it sounds all ten 
                         thousands leagues under the sea.

               vanessa kneels down next to the swell of juno's belly.

                                     vanessa
                         hi. hi, baby. it's me. my name is 
                         vanessa. i can't wait to meet you.

               leah gives a look to juno as if she's about to barf.

                                     vanessa
                         can you hear me sweet angel?

               vanessa looks like she's giving up hope. then suddenly,

                                     vanessa
                         oh my god -- it moved! i felt it!

                                     juno
                              (nods)
                         elbow.

                                     vanessa
                         wow! it's magical.

               juno smiles at vanessa in awe of her genuine affection.
