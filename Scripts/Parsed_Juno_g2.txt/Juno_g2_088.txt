               int. loring house - basement - afternoon

               the lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and 
               unattractive, much like paulie bleeker's. mark pulls a chain 
               to illuminate a bare bulb.

                                     juno
                         oh, mark! is this the baby's room? 
                         it's beautiful!

                                     mark
                         hilarious. no, i just keep all of my 
                         old comics down here, and i want to 
                         show you one of them.

                                     juno
                         oh god, you're one of those guys...

                                     mark
                         you're gonna like this, i promise.

               mark rummages through a cardboard box in the corner.

                                     mark
                              (extracting a bagged 
                              comic from the box)
                         here it is.

               he shows the comic to juno. it's called "most fruitful yuki." 
               it depicts a pregnant japanese girl kicking ass and taking 
               names.

                                     juno
                         "most fruitful yuki"? what is... oh 
                         my god, she's a pregnant superhero!

                                     mark
                         isn't that great? i got it when i 
                         was in japan with my band. she reminds 
                         me of you.

               juno examines the comic. "most fruitful yuki" does resemble 
               her.

                                     juno
                         wow, i actually feel like less of a 
                         fat dork now.

                                     mark
                         most fruitful yuki is bad ass, man. 
                         you should be proud to be the same 
                         condition.

               she throws a karate kick in mark's direction with a kee-ya!

               juno is sincerely pleased.

                                     juno
                         okay, how about some tunes?

               there's a battered portable cd player in the corner. juno 
               kneels down and pops in one of the discs.

                                     juno
                         now this first one is kinda slow. 
                         but it's mott the hoople so it's 
                         still totally rad and hardcore.

               juno puts in the cd and "all the young dudes" fills the room.

               mark laughs.

                                     juno
                         what?

                                     mark
                         i actually know this one.

                                     juno
                         you do?

                                     mark
                         yeah, this song's older than me, if 
                         you can believe that. i danced to it 
                         at my senior prom.

                                     juno
                         that's almost interesting, mark. who 
                         did you dance with?

                                     mark
                         her name was cynthia vogel and she 
                         was a good dance partner. even let 
                         me put my hands on her butt.

                                     juno
                         oh man, i can just picture you slow 
                         dancing like a dork!

               she mockingly places her hands on mark's waist and moves 
               back and forth stiffly.

                                     mark
                         no, i put my hands on your waist. 
                         then you put your arms around my 
                         neck. that's how we did it in '88.

               mark puts his hands on what remains of juno's waist. she 
               drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.

                                     juno
                         oh, okay. like this.

                                     mark
                         you've never been to a dance, have 
                         you?

                                     juno
                              (casually defensive)
                         only squares and nerds go to dances.

                                     mark
                         what are you?

                                     juno
                         i don't know.

               they sway slowly to the music. juno's belly bumps up against 
               mark.

                                     mark
                         i feel like there's something between 
                         us.

               they laugh.

               juno rests her head on mark's chest. they dance in silence 
               for a few moments, then stop moving. mark pulls juno as close 
               as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.

                                     mark
                         i'm leaving vanessa.

                                     juno
                              (quiet at first)
                         what?

                                     mark
                         it's just not working out, but i'm 
                         getting my own place in the city... 
                         and i've got it all planned out. 
                         it's something i've wanted to do for 
                         a long time...

               juno backs away.

                                     juno
                              (growing)
                         no.

                                     mark
                         no?

                                     juno
                         no. no, you definitely cannot do 
                         that, mark. that's a big, fat sack 
                         of no!

                                     mark
                         what's the matter?

                                     juno
                         this isn't what we agreed on. you 
                         guys have to take care of... this! 
                         you are the chosen custodians of the 
                         big-ass bump!

               she gestures wildly to her belly. suddenly, something matters 
               to her far more than the approval of an older guy.

                                     mark
                         but i thought you'd be cool if...

                                     juno
                              (interrupting)
                         i want you guys to adopt the buglet. 
                         i wanted everything to be perfect. 
                         not shitty and broken like everyone 
                         else's family. listen, once i have 
                         the baby, vanessa is going to finally 
                         be happy, and everything will be all 
                         right. believe me on this one!

                                     mark
                         a baby is not going to fix everything. 
                         besides, i don't know if i'm ready 
                         to be a father.

                                     juno
                              (aghast)
                         but you're old!

                                     mark
                         i... how do you think of me, juno? 
                         why are you here?

                                     juno
                         i don't know. i just liked being 
                         your friend. i sort of liked becoming 
                         furniture in your weird life.

                                     mark
                         this...
                              (he gestures to the 
                              dank surrounding 
                              room)
                         ...this is what my life has become. 
                         stuff in boxes. stuff underground. 
                         is that so appealing to you?

                                     juno
                         yeah, i guess... is this my fault? 
                         is vanessa mad at you because of me?

                                     mark
                         that's not the point. we're just not 
                         in love anymore.

                                     juno
                         yeah, but didn't you love vanessa 
                         when you married her? if you love 
                         someone once, you can love them again, 
                         i know it. my friend leah has gone 
                         out with the same guy, like, four 
                         times. you're just not trying.

               mark suddenly sees juno for what she is -- a teenage girl.

                                     mark
                         i'm such an idiot. i can't believe 
                         what an idiot i am.

               he paces over to the wall and kicks it softly.

                                     juno
                         please don't get a divorce! god, 
                         mark, just do me a solid and stay 
                         with your wife.

                                     mark
                         god, you're so young.

                                     juno
                         not really. i'm sixteen. i'm old 
                         enough to tell when people are acting 
                         like total a-holes!

               juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at 
               mark.

                                     juno
                         oh and by the way, i bought another 
                         sonic youth album and it's the worst 
                         thing i've ever heard! it's just 
                         noise, man!

               she bolts up the stairs, sobbing.
