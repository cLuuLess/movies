               int. leah's house - bedroom - night

               leah's room is cluttered with the sentimental junk that 
               certain girls love to hoard. the phone rings.

                                     leah
                              (answering phone)
                         yo-yo-yiggity-yo.

                         i am a suicide risk.

                                     leah

                                     juno

                         that need collecting?

                                     leah
                         only the one in my pants.

                                     juno
                              (in low tones)
                         dude, i'm pregnant.

                                     leah
                         maybe it's just a food baby. did you 
                         have a big lunch?

                                     juno
                         it's not a food baby. i took three 
                         pregnancy tests today. i am definitely 
                         up the spout.

                                     leah
                         how did you even generate enough pee 
                         for three pregnancy tests?

                                     juno
                         i drank like ten tons of sunny 
                         delight. anyway, yeah. i'm pregnant. 
                         and you're shockingly cavalier.

                                     leah
                         is this for real? like for real, for 
                         real?

                                     juno
                         unfortunately, yes.

                                     leah
                         oh my god! oh shit! phuket thailand!

                                     juno
                         that's the kind of emotion i was 
                         looking for in the first take.

                                     leah
                         well, are you going to go to 
                         havenbrooke or women now for the 
                         abortion? you need a note from your 
                         parents for havenbrooke.

                                     juno
                         i know. women now, i guess. the 
                         commercial says they help women now.

                                     leah
                         want me to call for you? i called 
                         for becky last year.

                                     juno
                         eh, i'll call them myself. but i do 
                         need your help with something very 
                         urgent.
