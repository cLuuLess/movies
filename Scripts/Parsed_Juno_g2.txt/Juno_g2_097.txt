               mark opens the door. there's a folded piece of paper sitting 
               on the doormat. he squints and sees juno pulling away in the 
               van.

               mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper -- it takes a minute 
               because of juno's proficiency in "teen girl origami." he 
               holds it up. we can see there's writing on the back.

                                     mark
                         it looks like a bill from jiffy-lube.

               vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over, 
               examining it.

                                     vanessa
                         it's for me.
