               int. loring house - mark's special room - day

               mark has strapped on the les paul and is playing and singing. 
               "doll parts" by hole.

                                     juno and mark
                              (quietly singing 
                              together)
                         "yeah, they really want you... they 
                         really want you... they really do."

               building together.

                                     juno and mark
                              (singing together and 
                              connecting)
                         yeah, they really want you... they 
                         really want you... and i do to.
                              (both blush)

               vanessa appears in the doorway. juno immediately puts down 
               the guitar. mark doesn't notice her immediately.

                                     mark
                              (passionate singing)
                         i want to be the...
                              (notices vanessa)
                         oh, sorry honey...

               mark clumsily puts down the guitar and stands up.

                                     vanessa
                         you guys are playing music?

                                     mark
                         juno just wanted a closer look at 
                         kimber here.

                                     juno
                         your guitar is named kimber?

                                     mark
                         yeah.

                                     juno
                         that's all right. my axe is named 
                         roosevelt. after franklin, not ted. 
                         franklin was the hot one with the 
                         polio.

                                     vanessa
                         i think gerta is waiting for us 
                         downstairs with some important stuff 
                         for us to go over.

               mark hangs the guitars back on the wall. he and juno exit 
               the room, chastised. vanessa looks to mark in question.

                                     vanessa
                         didn't mean to interrupt the jam 
                         sessions.
