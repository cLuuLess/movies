               int. dancing elk school - corridor - day

               juno and leah are sitting inside an emptied awards case on 
               the wall, eating their lunch.

               juno notices that the other kids in the cafeteria can't help 
               but glance her way. some look derisive, others are amused.

                                     juno
                         god, why is everyone always staring 
                         at me?

                                     leah
                         well, you are kind of... convex.

               she illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach.

                                     juno
                         wow, someone's been actually doing 
                         her geometry homework for once!

                                     leah
                         i don't have a choice. keith's been 
                         grading me really hard lately.

                                     juno
                         please do not refer to mr. conyers 
                         as "keith," okay? my barf reflex is 
                         already heightened these days.

                                     leah
                         keith's hot.

                                     juno
                         eww, he's all beardy!

               we see keith the teacher talking to some science kids in the 
               background. he has a wild america beard. he lifts a cup of 
               coffee to his lips and slurps lustily.

               back on juno and leah:

                                     leah
                         did you hear bleek is going to prom 
                         with katrina de voort?

                                     juno
                         katrina? pfft, no way. he doesn't 
                         like katrina. it must be a pity date.

                                     leah
                              (shrugging)
                         he asked her. i heard they were going 
                         to benihana, then the prom, then to 
                         vijay's parents' cabin.

                                     juno
                         bleeker told me katrina's whole house 
                         reeks of soup!

                                     leah
                         oh, it totally does. i was there for 
                         her birthday about four years ago 
                         and it was like lipton landing. but 
                         you know, boys have endured worse 
                         things for nookie.

                                     juno
                         there's no way in hell they're having 
                         sex or even holding hands.

                                     leah
                         i wouldn't be so sure about that. he 
                         did it with you. he's a man now.

                                     juno
                         yeah, well, bleek trusted me. we're 
                         best friends.

                                     leah
                         are you jealous? i thought you said 
                         you didn't care what he did.

                                     juno
                         i'm not jealous, and i don't care. i 
                         just know he doesn't like katrina 
                         and i don't think he should toy with 
                         her emotions like that. she seems so 
                         nice and all.

                                     leah
                         okay juno, i'm really convinced.

                                     juno
                         prom is for wenises, anyway. once 
                         you're old enough to go, it's not 
                         cool anymore.
