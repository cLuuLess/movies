               int. drugstore - bathroom - day

               in the dim, reeking public bathroom, juno hovers over the 
               commode with her boxer shorts around her ankles. she clumsily 
               tries to use the pregnancy test.

               we see the test box sitting on the sink. it's a teenwave 
               discount pregnancy test. the accompanying outdated package 
               photo is of a shrugging 80s teen with a resigned expression. 
               the fine print on the box reads "from the makers of sun-glitz 
               lightening hair spritz!"
