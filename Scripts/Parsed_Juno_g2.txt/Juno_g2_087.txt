               int. loring house - entry - day

               mark opens the door. juno stands there, looking radiantly 
               knocked-up. she holds a stack of cds. mark breaks into a 
               grin.

                                     mark
                         wow. that shirt is working hard.

                                     juno
                              (furtive)
                         is vanessa here?

                                     mark
                         nope. we're safe.

               he and juno smile conspiratorially.

                                     juno
                         cool.

                                     mark
                         come on, i have something for you.

               he gestures for juno to follow him into the house.
