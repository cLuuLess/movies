               ext. macguff house - day

               it's a sparkling summer afternoon. juno wheels her bicycle 
               out of the detached garage. she waves goodbye to bren, who 
               is playing in the yard with two weimaraners. she looks almost 
               as happy with her dogs as vanessa looked with her baby.
