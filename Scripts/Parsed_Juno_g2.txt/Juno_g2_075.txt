               int. ridgedale mall - day

               juno and leah are walking through the mall, looking bored. 
               juno is wearing one of mac's giant hockey jerseys in lieu of 
               actual maternity wear. leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel.

                                     leah
                         yum. this pretzel tastes like a 
                         friggin' donut!

                                     juno
                         share the love, tits!

               she wrestles leah for the pretzel. onlookers stare at them, 
               appalled, as leah puts juno in a half-nelson.

                                     juno
                              (to eavesdroppers)
                         she's assaulting me! she's denying 
                         me fresh-baked goodness!

               leah claps a hand over juno's mouth.

                                     juno
                              (muffled)
                         hly shht!

                                     leah
                         what?

               juno drags leah behind a pillar and peers out from behind 
               it. they're watching a group of well-heeled women and their 
               children shopping en masse. one of the women is pushing a 
               toddler in an ultramodern stroller. and one of the women is 
               vanessa, looking vaguely detached.

                                     juno
                              (hushed)
                         that's her. that's vanessa loring.

                                     leah
                         of the penny saver lorings?

               juno nods.

                                     leah
                         no way! she's pretty.

                                     juno
                         you sound shocked or something.

                                     leah
                         i just thought she'd look really old 
                         in real life.

               the women gather near a play area, sip frapps and loudly 
               discuss their outfits for an upcoming party.

                                     woman #1
                         and i was like, "no offense, sweetie, 
                         but nobody looks good in gauchos."

                                     woman #2
                         especially not with her build.

                                     juno
                              (mimicking the women, 
                              peanuts-style)
                         wah-wah-waaah!

               one of the little girls in the group tugs at vanessa's sleeve. 
               vanessa happily follows the little girl over to their play 
               area and begins to play energetically with her.

               juno watches intently, but leah just snickers.

                                     leah
                         she's gonna steal that kid for her 
                         collection.

                                     juno
                         right, seriously.

               they watch vanessa for a few more moments. the other kids 
               wander over toward the play area while their mothers ignore 
               them. vanessa continues to entertain the children.

                                     leah
                         bo-ring!

               leah stands up. juno lingers for a moment.
