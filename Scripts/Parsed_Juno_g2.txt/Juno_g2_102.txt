               ext. dancing elk school - track - morning

               juno waddles toward the field. the guys on the track team, 
               ridiculously arrayed as usual, are doing hurdler stretches. 
               they stare at her quizzically. bleeker spots juno approaching 
               and jogs up to the chainlink fence.

                                     bleeker
                         did you put like a hundred things of 
                         tic tacs in my mailbox?

                                     juno
                         yeah. that was me.

                                     bleeker
                         why?

                                     juno
                              (blushes)
                         because they're your fave. and you 
                         can never have too much of your 
                         favorite one-calorie breath mint.

                                     bleeker
                         well... thanks. i think i'm pretty 
                         much set until college on the tic 
                         tac front.

                                     juno
                         you know, i've been thinking. i'm 
                         really sorry i was such a huge bitch 
                         to you. you didn't deserve that. you 
                         never deserve any of the poo i unload 
                         on you.

                                     bleeker
                         you know it's okay.

                                     juno
                         also, i think i'm in love with you.

                                     bleeker
                         what, you mean as friends?

                                     juno
                         no, for real. i think you are the 
                         coolest person i've ever met. and 
                         you don't even have to try.

                                     bleeker
                         i try really hard, actually...

                                     juno
                         no, you're naturally smart. you always 
                         think of the funniest things to do. 
                         remember when you passed me that 
                         postcard during spanish class, and 
                         it was addressed like, "junebug 
                         macguff, row 4, third seat from the 
                         blackboard"? and it said, "i'm having 
                         fun in barcelona -- wish you were 
                         here"? that was hilarious.

                                     bleeker
                         i was just bored. i only think school 
                         is awesome like, 80% of the time.

                                     juno
                         plus, you're the only person who 
                         doesn't stare at my stomach all the 
                         fucking time. you actually look at 
                         my face. and every time i look at 
                         you, the baby starts kicking me super 
                         hard.

                                     bleeker
                         it does?

               juno presses bleeker's hand against her belly.

                                     bleeker
                         wizard!

                                     juno
                         i think it's because my heart starts 
                         pounding when i see you.

                                     bleeker
                         mine too.

                                     juno
                         basically, i'm completely smitten 
                         with you, and i don't care if i'm 
                         making an ass out of myself right 
                         now, because you've seen me make an 
                         ass out of myself a million times, 
                         and you still want to be my friend.

                                     bleeker
                         well, yeah. you're the best friend 
                         i've ever had, even when you're being 
                         kind of evil.

                                     juno
                         that's all i need from you. that's 
                         more than i could ever ask for. you're 
                         just golden, dude.

                                     bleeker
                         can we make out now?

                                     juno
                         okay.

               bleeker and juno kiss, oblivious to the gawking track team 
               guys in the background.

               in the distance, near the school entrance, we see steve 
               rendazo (the kid who always torments juno) regarding the 
               makeout session with a sad, envious expression.

               leah passes by, does a double take, then hurries up to the 
               fence, rolling her eyes.

                                     leah
                              (disgusted)
                         you know, you can go into early labor 
                         sucking face like that!

               juno gives her the finger, not breaking the clinch with 
               bleeker.
