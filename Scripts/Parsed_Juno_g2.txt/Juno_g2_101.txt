               ext. bleeker house - morning

               bleeker steps out of the house for his usual early-morning 
               run. he looks down to see a message scrawled in chalk on the 
               stoop: "bleeker -- check the mail."

               he walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch 
               on the mailbox.

               at least one hundred containers of orange tic tacs come 
               pouring out in an colorful deluge. they spill out onto the 
               driveway. bleeker smiles.
