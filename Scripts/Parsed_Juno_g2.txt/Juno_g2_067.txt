               int. macguff house - kitchen - night

               bren sits at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee and an 
               issue of dog fancy.

               juno enters nonchalantly, drinking a giant slushie.

                                     bren
                         where the hell have you been, junebug?

                                     juno
                         i drove to st. cloud to show mark 
                         and vanessa the ultrasound. and i 
                         wound up staying for a couple of 
                         hours.

                                     bren
                         a couple of hours? why are you going 
                         up there in the first place?

                                     juno
                         they said they wanted to know about 
                         this stuff. they said to keep them 
                         updated, so i did!

                                     bren
                         you could have sent it to them. why 
                         would you drive an hour out to east 
                         jesus, nowhere?

                                     juno
                         i don't know, i just did. and while 
                         we were waiting for vanessa, mark 
                         and i watched the wizard of gore and 
                         he burned me some cds of weird music. 
                         he's kind of cool.

               a beat as bren absorbs this.

                                     bren
                         that was a mistake, juno. mark is a 
                         married stranger. you overstepped a 
                         boundary.

                                     juno
                         listen, bren-duhhh, i think you're 
                         the one overstepping boundaries. 
                         you're acting like you're the one 
                         who has to go through this and get 
                         huge and push a baby out of your vag 
                         for someone else. besides, who cares 
                         if he's married? i can have friends 
                         who are married.

                                     bren
                         it doesn't work that way, kiddo. you 
                         don't know squat about the dynamics 
                         of marriage.

                                     juno
                         you don't know anything about me!

                                     bren
                         i know enough.

               bren rises to leave, clutching the dog fancy magazine.

                                     juno
                              (gesturing to the 
                              magazine)
                         we don't even have a dog!

                                     bren
                         yeah, because you're allergic to 
                         their saliva. i've made a lot of 
                         sacrifices for you, juno. and in a 
                         couple years you're going to move 
                         out -- and i'm getting weimaraners.

                                     juno
                         wow, dream big!

                                     bren
                         oh, go fly a kite.

               bren storms out. juno heads to the urn by the door and 
               defiantly pours the remains of her blue slushie into it.
