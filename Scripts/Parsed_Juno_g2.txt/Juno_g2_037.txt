               int. bleeker's house - paulie's bedroom - night

               bleeker lies on his car-bed in his track uniform, listening 
               to the same lp from when he and juno went all the way.

               he stares between the pages of his embossed dancing elk prep 
               yearbook.

               we see the object of his gaze is juno's black and white 
               yearbook photo. next to it, we see a sloppy, handwritten 
               message from juno. we hear juno's voice reading the message:

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         hey bleeker! spank off to this with 
                         motion lotion. just kidding (kind 
                         of.) your best friend, juno.

               bleeker picks up the phone. it's the same hamburger phone 
               juno has. he reconsiders and puts it down.

               there's a knock on the bedroom door.

               bleeker's mom pokes her dowdy head inside.

                                     bleeker's mom
                         paul? are you coming downstairs to 
                         eat?

                                     bleeker
                         i don't think so.

                                     bleeker's mom
                         you ran eight miles today, puppy.

                                     bleeker
                         i'm not hungry, oddly.

                                     bleeker's mom
                         but it's breakfast for supper. your 
                         favorite, paulie. i made french toast 
                         and sausage. patties, not linkies, 
                         just like you like it.

               bleeker places his hand silently on his stomach.

                                     bleeker's mom
                         juno macguff called while you were 
                         out running. she wants to know if 
                         you're coming to her little 
                         coffeehouse performance on saturday.

                                     bleeker
                         thanks for the message.

                                     bleeker's mom
                         you know how i feel about her.

                                     bleeker
                         you've mentioned it about fifty times.

                                     bleeker's mom
                         i just hope you don't consider her a 
                         close friend.

               bleeker's mom gives up and closes the door.

               we see that bleeker is clutching a pair of panties in one 
               hand, which he slowly releases as the 45 ends.
