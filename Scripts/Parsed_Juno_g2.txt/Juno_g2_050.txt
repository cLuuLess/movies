                         my wife just ordered one of those 
                         tony little gazelles off the tv, you 
                         know, from the guy with the ponytail?

               vanessa and gerta have no response.

                                     mac
                         that guy just doesn't look right to 
                         me.

               suddenly, a shriek of amp feedback, followed by loud, 
               discordant guitar strumming can be heard drifting down from 
               upstairs. vanessa's looks to the ceiling.

                                     vanessa
                              (to her guests)
                         will you excuse me?
