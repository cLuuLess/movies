               int. macguff house - living room - afternoon

               bren and mac are seated on the couch. leah is standing nearby 
               for reinforcements. juno paces nervously, trying to suss out 
               how to break the massive news.

                                     juno
                         i have no idea how to spit this out.

                                     bren
                         hon, did you get expelled?

                                     juno
                         no. the school would probably contact 
                         you in the event of my expulsion.

                                     bren
                         well, i was just asking. it seemed 
                         plausible.

                                     mac
                         do you need a large sum of money? 
                         legal counsel?

                                     juno
                         no, no, i'm definitely not asking 
                         for anything. except maybe mercy. 
                         like, it would be really great if 
                         nobody hit me.

                                     mac
                         what have you done, junebug? did you 
                         hit someone with the previa?

                                     leah
                         best to just tell them, man. rip off 
                         the band-aid and let it bleed.

                                     juno
                         i'm pregnant.

               bren and mac are predictably speechless.

                                     bren
                         oh, god...

                                     juno
                         but i'm going to give it up for 
                         adoption. i already found the perfect 
                         people.

               leah presents the penny saver photos of the lornings.

                                     juno
                         they say they're going to pay my 
                         medical expenses and everything. i 
                         promise this will all be resolved in 
                         thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend 
                         it never happened.

                                     mac
                         you're pregnant?

                                     juno
                         i'm so sorry, you guys. if it's any 
                         consolation, i have heartburn that's 
                         like, radiating down to my kneecaps 
                         and i haven't gone number two since 
                         wednesday. morning!

                                     bren
                              (interrupting)
                         i didn't even know you were sexually 
                         active!

               juno cringes upon hearing her most-hated term.

                                     mac
                         who is the kid?

                                     juno
                         the baby? i don't know anything about 
                         it yet. i only know it's got 
                         fingernails, allegedly.

                                     bren
                         nails? really?

                                     mac
                         no, i mean the father! who's the 
                         father, juno?

                                     juno
                         oh. it's, well, it's paulie bleeker.

               bren and mac burst into shocked laughter.

                                     juno
                         what?

                                     mac
                         paulie bleeker? i didn't know he had 
                         it in him!

                                     bren
                              (giggling)
                         he just doesn't look, well, virile.

                                     leah
                         i know, right?

                                     mac
                         okay, this is no laughing matter.

                                     juno
                              (indignant)
                         no, it's not. paulie is virile, by 
                         the way. he was very good in... chair.

               leah fires a be quiet glance at juno.

                                     mac
                         did you say you were thinking about 
                         adoption?

                                     juno
                         yeah, well, there's this couple who've 
                         been trying to have a baby for five 
                         years.

                                     leah
                         we found them in the penny saver by 
                         the exotic birds section.

               bren looks understandably alarmed. juno hastily attempts to 
               make the situation sound more legitimate.

                                     juno
                         but they have a real lawyer and 
                         everything. i'm going to meet with 
                         them next weekend.

                                     bren
                         junebug, that is a tough, tough thing 
                         to do. probably tougher than you can 
                         understand right now.

                                     juno
                         well, i'm not ready to be a mom.

                                     mac
                         damn skippy, you're not! you don't 
                         even remember to give liberty bell 
                         her breathing meds.

                                     juno
                         once! and she didn't die, if you 
                         recall!

                                     bren
                         honey, had you considered, you know, 
                         the alternative?

               leah and juno exchange glances.

                                     juno
                         no.

                                     bren
                         well, you're a brave young lady. 
                         you're made of stronger stuff than i 
                         thought. you're a little viking!

                                     juno
                         cool it.

                                     bren
                         first things first, we have to get 
                         you healthy. you need prenatal 
                         vitamins. incidentally, they'll do 
                         incredible things for your nails, so 
                         that's a plus. oh, and we need to 
                         schedule a doctor's appointment. 
                         find out where you're going to 
                         deliver.

                                     juno
                         the term "deliver" is so weird. can 
                         we not say "deliver"?

                                     leah
                         how does "crap it out" sound?

                                     mac
                         juno, i want to come with you to 
                         meet these adoption people. you're 
                         just a kid. i don't want you to get 
                         ripped off by a couple of babystarved 
                         wingnuts.

                                     juno
                         sure, dad.

               mac nods, satisfied, then contemplates the situation dismally.

                                     mac
                         i thought you were the kind of girl 
                         who knew when to say when.

                                     juno
                         i have no idea what kind of girl i 
                         am.

                                     bren
                              (sensing tension)
                         why don't you girls go upstairs for 
                         a while? i think mac's gonna blow.

               juno and leah hightail it upstairs.

                                     mac
                         just tell it to me straight, bren. 
                         do you think this is my fault? her 
                         mother's fault?

                                     bren
                         i think kids get bored and have 
                         intercourse. and i think junebug was 
                         a dummy about it. but we have to 
                         move on from here and help her figure 
                         it out.

                                     mac
                         i'm not ready to be a pop-pop.

                                     bren
                         you're not going to be a pop-pop. 
                         and juno's not going to be a ma. 
                         somebody else is going to find a 
                         precious blessing from jesus in this 
                         garbage dump of a situation. i 
                         friggin' hope.

                                     mac
                              (conspiratorially)
                         did you see it coming when she sat 
                         us down here?

                                     bren
                         oh god yeah. but i was hoping she 
                         was expelled or into hard drugs.

                                     mac
                         that was my first instinct too. or 
                         d.w.i. anything but this. and i'm 
                         going to punch that bleeker kid in 
                         the weiner the next time i see him.

                                     bren
                         oh mac, no! he's a sweet kid. you 
                         know it wasn't his idea.

               mac shrugs in agreement.
