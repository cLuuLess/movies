               ext. loring house - front porch - day

               mark and vanessa loring have an impressive, though generic 
               mcmansion. the entire yard is unlandscaped soil. mac presses 
               the doorbell while juno chews her nails uncomfortably. both 
               look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them.

               vanessa opens the door. she's a pretty, meticulous woman in 
               her early thirties. very banana republic.

                                     vanessa
                         hi! i'm vanessa. you must be juno 
                         and mr. macguff. i'm vanessa.

                                     juno
                         vanessa, right?

                                     mac
                         hello. thank you for having me and 
                         my irresponsible child over to your 
                         home.

                                     vanessa
                         oh no. thank you. come on in.
