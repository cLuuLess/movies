               leah and juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well 
               manicured suburban lawn. they make a formidable team.

                                     leah
                         heavy lifting can only help you at 
                         this point.

                                     juno
                         that is sick, man.

               leah busts a gut laughing. it's a stunningly accurate 
               portrayal of bleeker's parents.

                                     leah
                         so, you were bored? is that how this 
                         blessed miracle came to be?

                                     juno
                         nah, it was a premeditated act. the 
                         sex, i mean, not getting pregnant.

                                     leah
                         when did you decide you were going 
                         to do bleeker?

                                     juno
                         like, a year ago, in spanish class.
