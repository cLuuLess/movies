               int. hospital room - birthing suite - evening

               juno lies on the bed. she looks rested and relaxed compared 
               to her earlier crying jag, but her face is still pink and 
               swollen. bleeker is curled up next to her, still in his track 
               uniform and spikes.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         bleeker decided he didn't want to 
                         see the baby. neither did i, really. 
                         he didn't feel like ours.
