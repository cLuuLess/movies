               int. bleeker house - paulie's bedroom - night

               bleeker glances at juno's midsection, embarrassed.

                                     bleeker
                         so, it looks like you're getting 
                         pregnant-er these days.

                                     juno
                         yeah. um, i hooked up a whole private 
                         adoption thing. these married people 
                         in saint cloud are going to be the 
                         parents.

               bleeker is visibly relieved.

                                     bleeker
                         really? what are they like?

                                     juno
                         the guy is super cool! his name is 
                         mark and he's into old horror movies 
                         and he plays guitar. i actually hung 
                         out with him today.

                                     bleeker
                         is that normal?

                                     juno
                         i asked my dad and bren not to narc 
                         us out to your folks, so we should 
                         be safe.

                                     bleeker
                         oh. that's a relief.

               juno walks over to the bed and sits down next to bleeker.

                                     juno
                         i'm going to really start looking 
                         like a dork soon. will you still 
                         think i'm cute if i'm huge?

                                     bleeker
                         i always think you're cute. i think 
                         you're beautiful.

               juno is caught off guard by his sincerity.

                                     juno
                         jesus, bleek.

                                     bleeker
                         well, i do.

               the song playing ends, and another one begins. it's "the 
               song," the track that bleeker and juno both recognize from 
               the infamous night in the basement.

                                     bleeker
                         hey junebug, when all this is over 
                         we should get the band back together 
                         again.

                                     juno
                         yeah. sure. once tino gets a new 
                         drumhead we should be good to go.

                                     bleeker
                         we could get back together too.

                                     juno
                         were we together?

               bleeker picks at the carpet, dejected.

                                     bleeker
                         well, we were once. you know, that 
                         time.

                                     juno
                         what about katrina de voort? you 
                         could go out with katrina de voort.

                                     bleeker
                         i don't like katrina.

                                     juno
                         i totally heard you did.

                                     bleeker
                         i don't. katrina smells like soup. 
                         her whole house smells of soup.
