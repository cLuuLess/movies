               ext. bleeker house - night

               juno parks her previa on the street. she walks up to the 
               house and rings the doorbell.

               bleeker's mom answers, visibly annoyed. her eyes drift down 
               to juno's middle.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         bleeker's mom was possibly attractive 
                         once. but now she looks a hobbit. 
                         the fat one that was in the goonies.

                                     bleeker's mom
                         hi juno. what can i do for you?

                                     juno
                         i borrowed paulie's physics notes in 
                         school today. i'm pretty sure he 
                         needs them back, or his grade could 
                         plummet to an a minus.

                                     bleeker's mom
                         fine. come in.

               she steals another glance at juno's belly.
