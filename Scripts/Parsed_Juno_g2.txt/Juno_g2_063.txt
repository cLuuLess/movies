               int. loring house - den - afternoon

               we see some particularly memorable footage from the wizard 
               of gore.

               mark and juno are watching the movie and drinking root beer 
               floats. they're sitting dangerously close on the sofa.

                                     juno
                              (watching movie)
                         this is even better than suspiria. 
                         you've got decent taste in slasher 
                         movies, mark.

                                     mark
                         here's to dovetailing interests.

               he raises his mug in a toast and juno clinks it awkwardly.

                                     juno
                         so, have you and vanessa thought of 
                         a name for the baby yet?

                                     mark
                         well, sort of. vanessa likes madison 
                         for a girl.

                                     juno
                              (aghast)
                         madison? isn't that kind of... i 
                         don't know, gay?

                                     mark
                         god, pretentious much? i guess 
                         everyone should have a mysterious 
                         name like juno, huh?

                                     juno
                         my dad went through this phase where 
                         he was obsessed with greek and roman 
                         mythology. he named me after zeus's 
                         wife. i mean, zeus had other lays, 
                         but i'm pretty sure juno was his 
                         only wife. she was supposed to be 
                         really beautiful but really mean. 
                         like diana ross.

                                     mark
                         that suits you.

                                     juno
                         uh, thanks.

                                     mark
                         you know, not many teenage girls in 
                         your situation would actually go 
                         through with this.

                                     juno
                         i weighed my options. but after all 
                         this, i'm glad i didn't, you know, 
                         get rid of it. i want to have it. 
                         for you guys.

                                     mark
                         you're something else.

               a door suddenly slams upstairs. vanessa's home.

                                     mark
                         vanessa. shit, you better get out of 
                         here.

                                     juno
                         why? what the big deal?

                                     mark
                         nothing. she just hates when i sit 
                         around watching movies and 'not 
                         contributing.'

                                     juno
                         i'll handle this. i'm really good at 
                         diffusing mom-type rage.

               juno jumps up and rushes out.

                                     mark
                         wait... aww, crap!
