               int. loring house - living room - day

               vanessa, mac and gerta rauss are waiting in awkward silence 
               for juno and mark to return. mac notices a brand new pilates 
               machine sitting in its packaging in a corner of the room.

                                     mac
                         so. what's that thing?

                                     vanessa
                         a pilates machine?

                                     mac
                         what do you make with that?

                                     vanessa
                         you don't make anything. it's for 
                         exercising.
