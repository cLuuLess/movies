               juno rings the doorbell, shifting her weight in the cold.

               mark answers the door, dressed in a t-shirt and jeans.

                         juno? wow, i didn't expect to see 
                         you here.

                                     mark
                         no, she's working late tonight. she's 
                         trying to accrue some extra time off 
                         for when, you know...

               he gestures awkwardly to juno's belly.

                         right. i hear they can be kind of a 
                         time-suck.
