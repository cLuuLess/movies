               int. broom's office - night

               the room is full of forensics people taking pictures, picking 
               up evidence, etc. tom manning is there. seeing hellboy, he 
               respectfully steps back.

               broom's fragile body lies slumped in his chair. at his feet, 
               a pool of blood. liz enters, then stifles a whimper.

               with tears in his eyes, a disbelieving hellboy looks at liz, 
               then at his dead father. he holds broom's body close to his 
               chest.

                                     hellboy
                         father -- i'm back. i'm back. i'm 
                         back.

               manning herds everybody out. from the door, liz blinks back 
               tears as the red giant kneels by the body: a dog with a lost 
               master.

                                     hellboy
                         i wasn't here. you died alone --

                                                               dissolve to:

               omit
