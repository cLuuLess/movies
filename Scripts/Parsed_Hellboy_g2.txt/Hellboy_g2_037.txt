               ext. b.p.r.d. complex - gate entrance - day

               a dolled-up mod-style moped stops at the massive gate. 
               strapped to the luggage rack are two cheap suitcases. the 
               driver, a very wet young man named myers, touches an old 
               fashioned buzzer under a sign reading "waste management"

               a crackling intercom voice answers.

                                     intercom voice
                         yes?

                                     myers
                              (shivering)
                         john myers, f.b.i. transfer from 
                         quantico.

               a beat, then -- whirrr!!! an eyepiece and an lcd screen 
               scanner pop out.

                                     intercom voice
                         look at the birdie, son.

               myers looks into the eyepiece. on the screen, myers' cornea 
               is scanned. two violet flashes. his id and badge numbers 
               appear. clack! the gate opens.
