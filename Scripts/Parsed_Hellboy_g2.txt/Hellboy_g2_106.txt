               myers looks at liz through a see-through mirror. she sits on 
               a bench inside a padded cell. a security camera and monitor 
               records her constantly.

               a worried-looking dr. marsh stands alongside him.

                                     doctor marsh
                         she's been like this since it 
                         happened. there were no casualties. 
                         but it's put a big dent in our 
                         thorazine supply...
                              (dubious look at myers)
                         are you sure you want to go in?

               myers nods, loosens his tie and enters.
