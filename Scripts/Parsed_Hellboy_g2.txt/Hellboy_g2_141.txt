               int. hellboy's den - dusk

               a cat bats at a ball of paper. on it, two words are visible: 
               dear liz. hellboy's tail scoops up the paper and throws it 
               in a brimming wastebasket.

               he's sitting at a stainless steel desk, deep in concentration, 
               writing with evident difficulty. the floor around him is 
               covered with more crumpled pages. in the background, the 
               projector is showing duck soup. myers pushes in a cartload 
               of chili.

                                     myers
                         where do you --

                                     hellboy
                         shh! just a second.

               myers sets the tray on the table.

                                     hellboy
                         myers, you're a talker. what's a 
                         good word -- a solid word for "need" --

                                     myers
                         "need" is a good, solid word.

                                     hellboy
                         nah, sounds too "needy."

                                     myers
                         start in, you got nachos coming.

               as he goes out, liz appears in the doorway. hellboy quickly 
               stops writing.

                                     liz
                              (notices the small 
                              feline army)
                         oh, my god... look at them all! who 
                         had babies? c'mere, tiger...!

               liz plays with a cat. hellboy lifts the piece of paper, which 
               looks like a postage stamp in his stone hand.

                                     hellboy
                         um... liz -- i -- there's something 
                         i'd like you to -- something i need 
                         you to hear.

                                     liz
                         well. is it long?? i'm going out, 
                         but --

                                     hellboy
                         out? out out?

                                     liz
                         for a cup of coffee, but go ahead, 
                         read.

                                     hellboy
                         you're going alone?

                                     liz
                         no. myers is taking me.

               hellboy stands up, walks towards her.

                                     hellboy
                         him!! why him? why not me?

               myers walks back in pushing a tray of nachos.

                                     myers
                              (to hellboy)
                         hey, your chili's getting cold --

                                     hellboy
                              (sits back down)
                         not hungry.

                                     liz
                         what did you want me to hear -- ?

               hellboy folds the paper.

                                     hellboy
                         it's nothing. just a list -- it's 
                         not finished --

                                     liz
                         oh, okay then. maybe later then.

               she leaves. myers smiles.

                                     myers
                         anything else you --

                                     hellboy
                              (snappy)
                         not from you.

                                     myers
                         well good n-

                                     hellboy
                              (furious)
                         good night.

                                                                    cut to:
