               ext. an alley - behind machen library - night

               -- two stories down, landing sideways in an industrial garbage 
               bin. hellboy fights to stay conscious. blood drips from his 
               mouth

                                     grigory's voice
                         child...

               hellboy looks up: standing in the alley, like an apparition, 
               is grigory, in a black suit and overcoat, his eyes shielded 
               by pitch-black sunglasses

                                     grigory
                         all grown up, i see.

               hellboy's in shock, confused.

                                     hellboy
                         that voice --

                                     grigory
                         i sang the first lullaby you ever 
                         heard, my child. i ushered you into 
                         this world.
                              (beat)
                         i alone know your true calling, your 
                         true name.

                                     hellboy
                         don't tell me, it's zeppo.

               hellboy catches sight of his big gun, lying on the ground. 
               he goes for it but, bammm!!!! sammael lands before him.

                                     grigory
                         i can see that you're still young 
                         and don't know your place.
                              (turns to sammael)
                         teach him.

               before hellboy can reach the weapon --

               wshhhp!!! a 7-foot tongue lashes out from sammael's mouth 
               like a whip. it's arm-thick, with yellow sacs billowing from 
               its sides. it wraps around hellboy's right arm.

               hellboy falls to the ground, writhing, grinding his teeth. 
               the tongue squeezes and pulls. smoke pours from hellboy's 
               skin.
