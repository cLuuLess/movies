               int. "magik exhibit" hall - night

               manning and broom walk through the mess. a crew is cleaning 
               up. the dead guards are carried out.

                                     manning
                         every time the media get a look at 
                         him, they come to me. i'm running 
                         out of lies, trevor.

                                     broom
                         i thought you liked being on tv.

                                     manning
                         i do.
                              (beat)
                         how many escapes?  this year alone: 
                         five!

                                     broom
                         tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.

                                     manning
                         your "guest" happens to be six foot 
                         five, bright red, and is government 
                         funded.

                                     broom
                         he's just going through a phase --

               manning moistens and lights a fine cigar, using a kitchen 
               match.

                                     manning
                         a "phase"? what do you think this 
                         is, "the brady bunch?" these... freaks --

               abe sapien listens while pacing the exhibition hall, palm 
               open.

                                     manning
                              (lowers his voice, 
                              tense)
                         these freaks, trevor, they give me 
                         the creeps. and i'm not the only 
                         one. you're up for review. you and 
                         your petting zoo.

                                     broom
                         i know where to find him. i'll get 
                         him back.

               manning watches as abe finds a sharp dagger embedded in the 
               floor.

                                     manning
                         hey, fishstick -- don't touch anything --

               abe silences him.

                                     abe
                         i need to touch it to "see"...

                                     manning
                         see what??

                                     abe
                         the past, the future, whatever this 
                         object holds.

                                     manning
                              (eyes broom)
                         is he serious??

                                     abe
                         don't worry about fingerprints. i 
                         never had any.

               abe holds the dagger in his hand, turns to broom.

                                     abe
                         they were over here, professor.

                                     manning
                         oooh!! who was here? nixon? houdini? 
                         you mind sharing your mystic insights?

               broom examines the dagger: a ragnarok symbol crowns the hilt. 
               the dragon and swastika.

                                     broom
                         show me, abe... show me.

               he solemnly extends his hand. as soon as abe takes it, the 
               room...

                                                                 morphs to:
