               ext. abbey ruins - altar area - night 

               grigory walks to the top of the altar, cables trailing behind 
               him.

                                     grigori
                         tonight, we will open a portal and 
                         awaken the ogdru jahad: the seven 
                         gods of chaos.
                              (beat)
                         our enemies will be destroyed. in an 
                         instant, all impurity in this world 
                         will be razed and from the ashes a 
                         new eden will arise.

               he looks down at the machine and whispers --

                                     grigory
                         ragnarok, anung ia anung.

               he flexes his fingers and in response --

               -- the two metal rings swing around the machine's central 
               axis. tchink!!! whirrr!!! steam escapes from the ducts and 
               pipes. an invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain 
               to swerve momentarily away from grigory's body.

               ilsa signals two nazi scientists standing at a control panel.

                                     ilsa
                         more power!! don't let the level 
                         drop!!

               one of them inserts a 20 inch solid gold cylinder into the 
               machine. two openings remain vacant next to it.

               a blade of light opens in the air!

               burning symbols slash the air, like living serpents of fire.
