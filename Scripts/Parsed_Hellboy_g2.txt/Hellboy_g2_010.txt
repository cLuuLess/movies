               grigory walks towards the machine, its colossal steel and 
               copper clockworks gleaming in the floodlights.

                         five years of research and 
                         construction, grigory. five years!!

               he strides alongside grigory and ilsa, who holds an umbrella 
               to shield her master from the pouring rain.

                         the furhrer doesn't look kindly on

                         there will be no failure, general. i 
                         promised herr hitler a miracle. i'll 
                         deliver one.

               kroenen mutters excitedly as he opens a polished oak box 
               containing a massive gold and copper mecha-glove.

               grigory extends his hand so that kroenen may fit him with 
               the contraption, which is attached to cables and hoses.
