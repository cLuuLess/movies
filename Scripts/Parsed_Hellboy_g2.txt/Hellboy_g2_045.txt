               int. hellboy's den - night

               clay pushes the cart into a solid concrete bunker, windowless, 
               austere except for a few samurai suits of armor and weapons. 
               dozens of cats wander around; others are curled up on the 
               furniture.

               there are zippo's everywhere, from every era.

               on a sofa (made from the bed of a pickup truck) is a heap of 
               blankets and comic books. all in all, a mega bachelor pad.

                                     clay
                              (sotto voce)
                         he gets fed six times a day. he's 
                         got a thing for cats. you'll be his 
                         nanny, his keeper, his best friend. 
                         he never goes out unsupervised --

                                     myers
                         who?!

               clay points at a torn comic book: hellboy, the uncanny. myers 
               picks it up, looks at the cover: it shows hellboy -- in a 
               u.s. uniform, fighting a monstrous ape.

               myers watches, amazed, as a bright red tail waves in and out 
               of a pool of light about ten feet away. one of the cats 
               playfully paws at it.

                                     myers
                              (sotto voce)
                         you're kidding --

                                     hellboy
                         those comics -- they never got the 
                         eyes right.

               the voice is a deep baritone, chesty and powerful.

                                     myers
                              (to clay, sotto voce)
                         oh, jesus!! hellboy -- ?? is real --

                                     clay
                              (sotto voce)
                         yup. sixty years old by our count.  
                         but he doesn't age like we do -- 
                         think dog years: he's barely out of 
                         his teens.

               myers gasps, seeing a monumental figure in the shadows, 
               exercising with a 300 lb. stainless steel dumbbell. crimson 
               biceps like cooked hams. chomping an unlit cigar stub.

                                     hellboy
                         what's with the hair, clay?? finally 
                         got those implants??

               agent clay blushes as he hides his scalp.

                                     clay
                         it'll fill in. where do you want 
                         your dinner, red? by the couch?

               on a nearby pile of junked tv sets, a loop of fleischer 
               cartoons and home movies cycles endlessly. one subject appears 
               over and over: an attractive young woman with a pale face 
               and raven-black hair.

                                     hellboy
                         who's the squirt?

                                     clay
                         agent myers is your new liaison.

                                     hellboy
                         got tired of me?

                                     clay
                         nah. i'll be around, red, just back 
                         in the field.

               bang!!! hellboy lets the dumbbell drop. instinctively, myers 
               jumps.

                                     hellboy
                         i don't want him.

                                     clay
                         manning says i'm too soft on you --
                              (sotto voce, nudging 
                              myers)
                         the candy. give him the candy.

               myers remembers he's holding the baby ruths.

                                     myers
                         oh. uh. hello. i -- i have these. 
                         for you.

                                     hellboy
                              (realizing)
                         father's back?
                              (clay nods)
                         still angry?

                                     clay
                         well, you did break out --

                                     hellboy
                         i wanted to see her.
                              (grunts)
                         it's nobody's business.

                                     clay
                         it is. you got yourself on tv again.

                                     hellboy
                         "myers", huh? you have a first name??

                                     clay
                              (sotto to myers)
                         try not to stare. he hates when people 
                         stare.

                                     myers
                         uh-oh -- john.
                              (sotto)
                         staring at what?

                                     clay
                         his horns. he files 'em. to "fit 
                         in."

                                     myers
                         his what??!!

               hellboy finally enters the light. he's awe-inspiring, with 
               chiseled features, patterned red skin and deep-set golden 
               eyes. involuntarily, myers recoils.

               in spite of himself, myers is staring at the horn stumps.

                                     hellboy
                         whatcha looking at, john??

                                     myers
                         oh-n-no -- i --

               an alarm sounds, and a red light blinks on the wall. myers 
               looks around, bewildered.

                                     hellboy
                              (to clay)
                         hey, hey, hey. they're playing our 
                         song.

                                     clay
                         we're on the move.

                                     hellboy
                              (to myers)
                         c'mon, champ! happy halloween!!! 
                         you're taking me for a walk!

                                                                    cut to:
