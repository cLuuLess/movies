               liz doesn't acknowledge myers' presence. he kneels and looks 
               up at her.

                                     myers
                         miss sherman? i'm agent myers, fbi.

               liz turns away.

                                     myers
                         miss sherman? i'm agent myers, fbi.
                              (no response)
                         the hospital called us. they don't 
                         feel they're capable of caring for 
                         you any longer, and --

               silence.

                                     myers
                         liz -- can i call you liz? it's a 
                         beautiful name --

                                     liz
                              (sighs)
                         60% of the women in this world are 
                         named "liz".

                                     myers
                         it's still impressive by my standards: 
                         my name's john.

               she looks at him. he offers his hand. she looks away.

                                     myers
                         dr. broom asked me to invite you 
                         back to the bureau. no special 
                         precautions, no security escorts. 
                         you and me in a taxi. like regular 
                         folks.

                                     liz
                         doesn't sounds like him.

                                     myers
                         miss sherman, he's asking you back, 
                         but it's entirely your choice.

               liz turns to the 2-way mirror. both their reflections are 
               there.

                                     liz
                         choice, huh? that's cute. i've quit 
                         the bureau thirteen times. i always 
                         go back.
                              (snaps two rubber 
                              bands)
                         where else would i go?

                                                                    cut to:

               omit
