               the computer beeps having finished an analysis. on a monitor, 
               an enlarged color image of one of the throbbing eggs.

                         the eggs are very sensitive to heat 
                         and light. they need a humid, dark 
                         environment to breed.

               abe picks up an egg with a pair of tweezers, passes it on to 
               hellboy, who sports a bandage on his arm.

                         down there. did you ever loose track 
                         of him?

                                     hellboy
                         well, let's see -- there was that 
                         moment, when i had a train on top of 
                         my head --

               broom frowns, worried.

                                     broom
                              (to hellboy)
                         we can't risk it: you'll go back to 
                         the tracks tomorrow with a group of 
                         agents, search the area, top to 
                         bottom.

               myers observes, repelled, as inside the egg a small foetal 
               thing wiggles.
