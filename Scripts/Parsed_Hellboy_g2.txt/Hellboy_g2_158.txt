               ext. ruins of n.y. - dusk

               the ruins of new york, charred, smoldering. human remains 
               litter the landscape. monstrous shapes lumber in the 
               distance... an army of apocalyptic beasts outlined against 
               the blood-red sky.

               dominating the horror is a mountain of festering skeletons 
               and skulls. at the top, a figure: hellboy, transformed. his 
               horns are in full bloom, his eyes and mouth stream unearthly 
               fire.
