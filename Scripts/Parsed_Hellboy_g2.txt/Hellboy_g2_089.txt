               int. b.p.r.d. medical bay "a" - night

               in the depths of the b.p.r.d infirmary, hellboy lies flat on 
               a stainless steel table. broom sits alongside him.

               abe peers through a magnifier at hellboy's wounded arm.

                                     abe
                         you were burned by some organic acid.

                                     hellboy
                         i'm lucky that way.

               using a scalpel, abe probes the gash. hellboy lets out a 
               grunt.

                                     broom
                         son. about rasputin --

                                     hellboy
                         don't worry. i'll get him soon enough --

                                     broom
                         listen to me. this time is different. 
                         there's more at stake than ever 
                         before.

                                     hellboy
                         how hard can it be? i punched the 
                         crap out of that thing that he sent -- 
                         ouch!!

                                     broom
                         i worry about you.

                                     hellboy
                         me?? c'mon --

                                     broom
                         well, i won't be around forever, you 
                         know?

                                     hellboy
                         oh, stop that --
                              (grimaces in pain)
                         damn! be careful, there --

                                     abe
                         red. how long was it latched onto 
                         you?

                                     hellboy
                         i dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!

                                     myers
                         you want me to hold him down?

                                     hellboy
                              (snickers)
                         that's right, stud, hold me down.

                                     abe
                         professor...

               broom moves to abe's side of the table. abe is poking at the 
               depths of the wound.

                                     broom
                              (sharp, to hellboy)
                         don't look! turn around.

                                     hellboy
                         is it bad?

               broom comes closer, eyes wide: inside the wound on hellboy's 
               forearm, nestled like ticks, are 3 translucent eggs.

               hellboy jumps as abe plucks the first one out. abe deposits 
               it in a glass container.

                                     abe
                         touched you five seconds. laid three 
                         eggs.

                                     hellboy
                         didn't even buy me a drink.
