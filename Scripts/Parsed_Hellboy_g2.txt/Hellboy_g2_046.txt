               an imposing four-story structure, all pillars and pediments. 
               a halloween banner advertises: magick: the ancient power.

               super: the machen library, manhattan 

               chaos near the entrance: policemen, tv reporters, mounted 
               police.

               loud protests from the reporters as a line of black sedan 
               cars are waved through.

                         the nypd has yet to issue a statement. 
                         we've got swat vans, paramedics, you 
                         name it...  and now here's -- a 
                         garbage truck --
                              (double take)
                         -- a garbage truck?

               trailing behind the cars, a garbage truck. on its side a 
               mirrored sign reads: squeaky clean inc. waste management 
               services.
