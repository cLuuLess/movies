               int. broomÂ´s office - night

               startled, broom snaps out of it --

                                     grigory
                         if only you had him destroyed sixty 
                         years ago, none of this would come 
                         to pass. but, then, how could you 
                         have known?

               broom is speechless.

                                     grigory
                         your god chooses to remain silent. 
                         mine lives within me.

               rasputin stands, the flesh of his neck and shoulders heaving 
               and twitching beneath his human skin.

                                     grigory
                         in the frozen waters of the malaya 
                         nevka, in the darkness of the void: 
                         every time i died and crossed over, 
                         a little more of the master came 
                         back with me. he disclosed to me the 
                         child's true name... would you like 
                         to know it??

                                     broom
                         i know what to call him. nothing you 
                         can say or do will change that. i 
                         call him son.

               discreetly, broom removes his rosary and places it on the 
               book. kroenen settles in behind him.

                                     broom
                         i am ready.

                                     grigory
                         good. now, i'll add two crumbs more:
                              (kroenen displays his 
                              knives)
                         grief and revenge...

               kroenen's knife goes in.

                                                                    cut to:
