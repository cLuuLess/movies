               int. tunnel "a" / chamber - day

               hellboy and manning come into a vast chamber: slavic motifs 
               crown the rugged stone pillars and archways. water runs down 
               the walls.

               across a small stone bridge, light pours from a hexagonal 
               structure.

               they step onto the bridge. klanggg!!! two gears release a 
               steel door from above, forcing them to forge ahead.

               somewhere, a  massive clockwork is ticking.

                                     manning
                         what's that --

               hellboy motions for silence. the corpse mutters: "it's 
               something big"

               they stare into the darkness.

                                     manning
                         we should go back -- you -- you could 
                         tear that door apart --

                                     hellboy
                         don't move. we --

                                     manning
                         -- should go back. now!

                                     hellboy
                         no. don't --

                                     manning
                         i'm in charge. we go back!

               hellboy yanks manning just in time. bammm!!!! a gigantic 
               metal pendulum swings past and demolishes one third of the 
               bridge a few feet from their feet. it takes lime and the 
               corpse with it.

               another door on the far end of the bridge shudders downward.

                                     hellboy
                         son of a --

               whoosh! the pendulum swings back. it destroys more of the 
               bridge. manning sprints for all he's worth and crawls under 
               the door.

               hellboy runs, but chunks of stone disintegrate under his 
               feet.

               the pendulum swings back taking out the final piece of the 
               bridge just as hellboy rolls under the door --

               -- and makes it into the hexagonal building.
