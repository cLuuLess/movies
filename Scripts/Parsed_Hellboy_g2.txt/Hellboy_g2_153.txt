               int. b.p.r.d. medical bay - night

               kroenen's body lies on the table. slowly, his chest starts 
               to rise and fall. he sits up.

               his arm stump docks into the prosthetic hand -- click! he 
               flexes the shiny fingers.

               kroenen's hideous cranium is visible for an instant before 
               he zips up his mask. he takes the sharp ragnarok knives and 
               turns one over. it reflects a figure standing behind him: 
               grigory.
