               int. b.p.r.d. medical bay - day

               unconscious, abe floats in a special tank. led strips read 
               water temperature, ph level, etc. he's encased in a bio-cast: 
               a cybernetic healing unit wrapped around his thorax and right 
               arm. a web of tubes and hoses keeps him in place.

               shirtless and bandaged, hellboy sits and studies him, as if 
               in a trance.

                                     manning's voice
                         he'll make it --

               hellboy turns, manning is there:

                                     manning
                         but not everyone was so lucky.
                              (beat)
                         two agents died today. clay probably 
                         won't survive the night. you're 
                         reckless.

                                     hellboy
                         i knew those men better than you did --

                                     manning
                         ah, i see. that makes it all alright 
                         then.

               he turns to leave. hellboy gets up.

                                     hellboy
                         no, it doesn't make it right, but i 
                         stopped that creature, didn't i?

                                     manning
                         that's what you do. that's why we 
                         need you. you have an insight.
                              (beat)
                         you know monsters.

                                     hellboy
                         what are you trying to say?

                                     manning
                         in the end, after you've killed and 
                         captured every freak out there -- 
                         there's still one left: you.

                                     hellboy
                              (a deep sigh)
                         i wish i could be more gracious but --

               bammmmm!!!! he smashes a metal locker with his stone hand 
               and raises it above his head.

               manning cowers, realizing that hellboy's rage is a dangerous 
               thing.
