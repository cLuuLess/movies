               ext. moscow cemetery (location) - day

               the group gawks as hellboy climbs out, carrying the corpse 
               on his back. with an ear-to-ear grin, he approaches the team.

                                     hellboy
                         sixty feet further, comrades, and 
                         three rows in...

               the corpse fidgets on hellboy's back. its bony hand weakly 
               points, as if in confirmation.

                                     hellboy
                         this here is ivan klimentovich: say 
                         "hi" ivan.

               the corpse mutters again. subtitled: go that way, red monkey.
