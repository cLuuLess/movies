               as bprd agents clear the area, clay, myers, abe and hellboy 
               march through the main lobby. on view, various display cases. 
               two banners flank the marble staircase.

                              (reading a report)

                         checked this place. fakes, and 
                         reproductions.

               myers observes as the red goliath sheepishly averts his gaze 
               from that of the fragile old man.
