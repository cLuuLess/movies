               int. (set/location built sugar factory) furnace room - day

               makeshift living quarters tucked below a maze of furnace 
               ducts. scores of old clocks fill the room with ticking.

               at a desk, kroenen calmly repairs a mechanical hand: his 
               own.

               his face is partly exposed. under his leather mask, horrible 
               lidless eyes glitter over a skull-like grin, made of raw 
               gums and taut skin.

               as hellboy's pounding reaches his ears, he rises, like a 
               spider whose web has twitched. the mechanical hand rattles 
               blindly on the table.

               he opens an ancient leather folder and extracts an engraving 
               depicting sammael. carefully places it on the table. then he 
               opens a drawer and, from an envelope, takes two torn pieces 
               of paper. he puts them in a pouch in his belt.
