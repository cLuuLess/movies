               int. broom's office - dusk 

               hellboy stands before broom's desk, pensive, his naked chest 
               bandaged.

               liz watches him from across the room. he finds broom's rosary 
               on top of the book. reads the underlined phrase on the page.

                                     liz
                         hi --

               he turns to her. she slowly comes towards him.

                                     hellboy
                         hi.

                                     liz
                         i've changed my mind. i'll come to 
                         moscow. if you -- are still going --

               hellboy nods, then clears his throat.

                                     hellboy
                         i am.
                              (beat)
                         but -- i have something to say, too.
                              (beat)
                         i never had the guts before -

               he looks her in the eye.

                                     hellboy
                         but i understand what you don't like 
                         about me. i do. what i am makes you 
                         feel out of place -- out there --

                                     liz
                         red, i --

                                     hellboy
                         listen. i'm not like myers. he makes 
                         you feel like you belong. and -- 
                         that's good. it really is. i -- wish 
                         i could do something about this --
                              (points at his own 
                              face)
                         but i can't.
                              (beat)
                         i can promise you only two things... 
                         one: i'll always look this good. 
                         two: i won't give up on you. ever.

                                     liz
                         i like that...

                                     hellboy
                         good.

                                                                    cut to:
