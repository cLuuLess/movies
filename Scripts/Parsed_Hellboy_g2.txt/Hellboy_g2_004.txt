               ext. scotland chapel remains

               they enter the remains of a small chapel. broom produces the 
               small box. it's full of rosaries.

                                     broom
                         your men -- they'll need these --

               whitman scowls and huffs. a life-sized wooden christ 
               contemplates the scene from above.

                                     whitman
                         you are a catholic??

                                     broom
                         amongst other things, yes -- but 
                         that's hardly the point.

               whitman locks and loads an automatic.

                                     whitman
                         here. you'll need one of these.

                                     broom
                         i abhor violence.
                              (whitman moves away)
                         sergeant whitman, i hope you don't 
                         think me mad --

                                     whitman
                         three days too late for that one, 
                         "professor."

               he moves away. broom looks up to the wooden christ: it has 
               no eyes.
