               int./ext. garbage truck lab - library crowd - night

               the mounted policeman is visible as he rides by. the mirrors 
               are see-through. the back of the truck is a fully-equipped 
               crime lab, crammed with hi-tech gear and low-tech talismans.

               abe fits a respirator over his face. it looks like a 
               mechanized elizabethan collar. valves bubble and hiss as he 
               inhales liquid through his mouth and out his gills. 

               hellboy looks out onto the crowd.

                                     hellboy
                         look at them ugly suckers, blue. one 
                         sheet of glass between them and us.

                                     abe
                         story of my life.

                                     hellboy
                         i break it, they see us, happy 
                         halloween. no more hiding.
                              (nostalgic)
                         outside. i could be outside --

                                     abe
                         you mean, outside... with her.

               hellboy straps on a huge utility belt heavy with amulets, 
               rosaries, horseshoes. from an ashtray he grabs a handful of 
               stogie stubs. lights one, puts the rest in a pouch.

                                     hellboy
                         don't get psychic with me.

                                     abe
                         nothing psychic about it. you're 
                         easy.

               hellboy unlocks a steel box (stenciled on its lid: "the good 
               samaritan") and extracts the meanest-looking, custom-built, 
               double-barrel, blue-finished, handgun ever made. a veritable 
               cannon.

                                     hellboy
                         how am i ever gonna get a girl?? i 
                         drive around in a garbage truck

                                     abe
                         liz left us, red. take the hint.

                                     hellboy
                              (hefting the gun)
                         we don't take hints.
