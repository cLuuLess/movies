               int. tunnel "b" - underground tunnel - cavern area - day

               liz and myers reach a wider section of tunnel "b". they find 
               themselves calf-deep in brown water.

               myers lights liz's path as she steps onto a large stone.

                                     myers
                         watch out. it's slippery...

               his light shorts out. she shines her light past him.

                                     liz
                         oh, my god...

               myers turns. his flashlight comes back on, revealing a complex 
               natural cavern. an entire wall is covered with translucent 
               eggs.

               sammael is there, gnawing on a dry arm bone, with the hand 
               still attached. when the light hits his face, his milky pupils 
               constrict. a snarl...

               a second sammael emerges from the water. it shakes itself 
               off. a third one raise its head.

               myers and liz try to back away, but a metal wall rises right 
               behind them klankkkkk!!! they are trapped!!

               myers goes to grab a set of explosive belts. tries to set up 
               the timer. zipp! -- one sammael snatches them away. myers 
               falls to the ground, clothes torn, injured.

                                     liz
                              (into the radio)
                         marco, marco, marco... get your big 
                         red butt over here!

               something stomps on the ceiling directly above them. again 
               and again.
