               int. b.p.r.d. - liz's room - day

               a familiar cell. fireproof insulation covers the walls. liz 
               throws her bags on the bed. myers lingers in the doorway.

               she reflexively pulls on one of the rubber bands on her wrist, 
               then lets it snap.

                                     liz
                         a little something i learned in 
                         therapy. i'm depressed --
                              (snaps a rubber band)
                         one rubber band. i'm impatient: two 
                         rubber bands...

               he sits by her side on the bed.

                                     myers
                         i'll get you a fresh pack.
