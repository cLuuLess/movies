               ext. abbey ruins - altar area - night

               grigory's face is distorted, pulled like ectoplasmic taffy, 
               his body contorting and breaking. the cosmic portal suddenly 
               implodes! nothing is left but a few burnt rails and the metal 
               glove, empty and smoking.

               as the allies approach, the fighting rages on.

               grigory and ilsa are gone. and for now, so is kroenen. 
               embedded in the wall where he was pinned, two bloody rails, 
               nothing more.

               omit
