               ext. moscow warehouse - day

               super: topockba steel mills, moscow a wasteland of rust and 
               decay. rotting warehouses line the street like dead steel 
               watchdogs. no one's around but a few lonely sentries.

               a limo and motorcycle caravan are waved through the security 
               gates.
