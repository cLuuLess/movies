               int. abandoned shower room (set) - day

               waiting above, hellboy chews a baby ruth and pokes around. 
               finds a pile of children's shoes covering some yellowing 
               albums. in the albums, a myriad of sad faces, the orphans 
               from the past.

               some of the faces have been cut out. there's an unfinished 
               letter to father christmas, dated 1866.

               clay stands below a grate, admiring his hair implants with a 
               hand mirror.

                                     clay
                         see? it's thicker. isn't it? it's 
                         not that doll-hair thing --

               suddenly, something moves. hellboy shines his light into an 
               adjoining tunnel. kroenen is standing there, like a deer 
               caught in headlights.

                                     hellboy
                         son of a -- !

               the figure darts away. hellboy tears after it, gun in hand.

                                     clay
                         red, wait!

               clay tries his radio. static.

                                     clay
                         red's on the move!! i'll cover him!!

               he pulls out his gun and runs after hellboy.
