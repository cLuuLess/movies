               int. doctor's office - day

               mechanized rollers transport x-ray films over a backlit 
               screen. a group of 4 doctors studies the pictures and 
               exchanges somber looks. rain spatters the windows.

               doctor 1 glances at the others.

                                     doctor 1
                         have you told him yet?

               doctor 2 looks through a glass partition at an aged but 
               dignified broom, 72, who slowly buttons his shirt. hanging 
               from his wrist, his rosary.
