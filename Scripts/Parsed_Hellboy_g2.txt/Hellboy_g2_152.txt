               int. hellboy's den - night

               broom examines the damage to the wall. he turns to see 
               hellboy's locator belt hanging on the wall. broom shakes his 
               head.

                                     lime
                         should we send out some scouts?

               broom motions for him to stop. it's useless,

                                     broom
                         no. enough. he will never change -- 
                         always a child. always.
