               ext. tenement building courtyard - day

               somewhere in a smokestack city, grown-ups and kids hang 
               banners and prepare a ragged birthday party in a cement 
               courtyard.

               angle - liz - continuous

               sitting on some tenement steps, liz, age 11. sullen, alone, 
               a gold crucifix hanging on her chest.

               a woman -- liz's mother -- comes down the courtyard steps, 
               carrying a basket of apples.

                                     mother
                              (to liz)
                         liz!! liz!! come on, darling, give 
                         mummy a hand.

               nearby, under a balloon archway, munching candy-coated 
               apples... three kids giggle and point at her.

                                     blonde kid
                         freak!

               liz turns to see them.

                                     blonde kid
                              (to his friend)
                         see? she knows her name.

               liz shies away from them.

                                     blonde kid
                         go home, you freak. we don't want 
                         you here.

               they start throwing stones. one hits the steps. another misses 
               her by inches. a third hits her in the shoulder.

               scared, liz turns but a rock catches her full on the face. 
               she falls down, blood trickling from her forehead, splattering 
               the pavement. she starts sobbing. another rock sails across, 
               but this time, in mid-air, it catches fire and turns to ash.

               a ripple of heat starts crawling up liz's hands. soon a pale 
               blue flame rings her entire arm.

                                     liz
                              (sobbing)
                         not again, please, not again...

               firelight glints off the crucifix.
