               ext. newark n.j. streets - night

               liz and myers pause at a corner, waiting for the light. the 
               shops are closing.

                                     myers
                         i admire him. he's a force of nature.

                                     liz
                         he's just pushy.

                                     myers
                         no... he's determined. unstoppable --

                                     liz
                         cocky.

                                     myers
                         strong.

                                     liz
                         a brute.

                                     myers
                         my uncle used to say... we like people 
                         for their qualities but love them 
                         for their defects.

               liz half-smiles, sips her coffee.

                                     myers
                         he -- loves you.

                                     liz
                         i know.

                                     myers
                         what about you?

                                     liz
                         don't know. really. i grew up with 
                         him.
                              (beat)
                         i've missed him too, but now, every 
                         time i see him, i get confused. hardly 
                         a day goes by he's not in my mind. 
                         even now, i feel he's here --

               as they walk down the street. a red streak jumps over roof 
               tops.
