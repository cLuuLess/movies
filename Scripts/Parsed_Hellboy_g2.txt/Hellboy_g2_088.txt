               ext. bellamie mental hospital - garden area- night

               hellboy's sitting on a bench, next to liz.

                                     hellboy
                         we miss you at the bureau. abe's 
                         crazier every day. and father's still 
                         mad at me --
                              (liz smiles)
                         come back, liz. come back. i --

                                     liz
                         no. not this time, h.b. it's been 
                         months since i've had an episode. 
                         and you know what? i'm learning to 
                         control it.

               around her right hand a faint blue aura of fire blooms, 
               crawling over her fingers like a velvet haze. she stares at 
               the pale flame.

                                     liz
                         i'm learning where it comes from.
                              (beat)
                         and for once in my life i'm not 
                         afraid.

               she clenches her fist and puts the flame out.

                                     liz
                         looks like your ride is here.

               the garbage truck and the two black sedan cars have pulled 
               into the hospital grounds. a dozen agents climb out of the 
               vehicles.

                                     hellboy
                         the nanny squad.

               angle - the cars - continuous

               clay starts towards hellboy, but myers stops him and turns 
               to broom:

                                     myers
                         sir, may i go first??

                                     clay
                              (to broom)
                         not so fast. he barely knows him --

                                     broom
                              (cuts him off)
                         then he should make it his business 
                         to change that.

               angle - the bench - continuous

               liz stands up, puts her hand on his shoulder.

                                     liz
                         listen, h.b. i've got a chance out 
                         here. if you truly care about me, 
                         don't come back anymore.

               hellboy smiles sadly. she walks away.

                                     hellboy
                         goodnight, then.

                                     liz
                         goodnight.

               she doesn't turn back.

                                     hellboy
                         yeah, i gotta go, too. lots to do --

               feeling light-headed, he stands up. on the bench and at his 
               feet, a pool of his own blood.

               he sees myers tentatively approaching.

                                     hellboy
                         what took you so long?

                                     myers
                         c'mon, time to go home. tape you up.

                                     hellboy
                         what are you, a boy scout?

                                     myers
                         no. i never was.

                                     hellboy
                              (weak)
                         could've fooled me. go away.

               hellboy drops to his knees. clay, quarry and moss reach him. 
               help him up.

                                     clay
                         c'mon, champ. you look a little woozy, 
                         there.

                                     hellboy
                         this -- ? this is nothing. you know 
                         what'll kill me?
                              (points at the doorway)
                         her.

               liz stands at the hospital door and sees hellboy keel over. 
               a few of the agents help him to the vehicles.

               myers looks back at liz. they hold each others' gaze, their 
               unfamiliar faces filled with curiosity. eventually, she goes 
               inside.
