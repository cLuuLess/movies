               ext. cosmic slit - from the other side - night

               the six-foot work light tumbles by the massive ogdru jahad: 
               seven egg-like monoliths of unholy origin.

               within their translucent walls, horrible creatures lie 
               slumbering. as the light sweeps by, one of the giants opens 
               a filmy eye, and then another, and another, and another...

               fleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison.
