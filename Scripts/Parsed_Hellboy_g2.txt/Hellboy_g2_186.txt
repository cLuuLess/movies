               int. underground corridor and intersection - day

               tchkanggg!!!!! large spiked metal plates shoot up from below, 
               blocking both their way out, demolishing the staircase and 
               ramming stone: he's gone.

               wicked spikes cover the metal surface. hellboy still bangs 
               on it, but to no avail: it's at least six inches thick. liz 
               and myers are on the other side.

                                     hellboy
                              (into his walkie-talkie)
                         okay, someone's expecting us. turn 
                         on your locators -- anyone sees 
                         anything...

                                     liz
                         marco...

                                     hellboy
                         ...polo.

               on the other side of the panel, myers takes the radio from 
               liz.

                                     myers
                              (into radio)
                         are you sure about this?

                                     hellboy
                         on a scale of one to ten: two. but --
                              (beat)
                         -- she'll take care of you, myers. 
                         she's a tough one.

               liz and myers move off. hellboy shines his light down the 
               tunnel on the left. agent lime picks up the corpse and 
               follows.
