               within, an incongruously proper young englishman "reading" 
               an ancient set of tarot cards.

                         his name was trevor. profesor trevor --

                         -- broom! topside, now.

               trevor "broom" bruttenholm is a gaunt, olive-skinned man in 
               his late twenties. in his hands, a tarot deck. he turns the 
               cards face up: the fool, the moon...

                                     whitman
                         the sooner we're done, the better.

               broom grabs a worn-down wooden box full of books and amulets. 
               it has a leather strap that allows him to carry it, much 
               like a carpenter's tool box.

                                     broom
                         this is an important mission, sgt. 
                         whitman. i hope you realize that.

                                     whitman
                         oh -- you don't wanna know what i 
                         think. topside, now.

               he moves away. broom takes a small box and a few amulets.

               before exiting, he pauses and tensely turns the last tarot 
               card: the devil.

                                                                    cut to:

               super: october 9, 1944, scotland.

               it's raining like hell now. soldiers move through a short 
               tunnel carved into the mountain.

               whitman signals his men to spread out, then comes alongside 
               broom.

                                     broom
                         sgt. whitman!! sgt. whitman!! may i 
                         have a word??

                                     broom
