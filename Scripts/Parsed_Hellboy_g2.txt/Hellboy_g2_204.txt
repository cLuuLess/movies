               int. tunnel "c" - underground tunnel - steep slope - day

               hellboy labors up a steep slope, using rocks and roots for 
               handholds. he reaches a dead end and collapses, out of breath.

               light filters through a crack in the ground; he can faintly 
               hear liz and myers.
