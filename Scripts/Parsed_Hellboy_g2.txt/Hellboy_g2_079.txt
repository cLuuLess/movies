               int. main abandoned baths alcove - night

               an abandoned shower room. a series of sinks and stalls, lined 
               with dirty white tile. a phonograph nearby plays wagner. 
               kroenen stands next to it.

               ilsa is nearby, a straight razor glinting in her hand. she 
               stands over grigory -- his back to us -- lovingly shaving 
               her master's scalp. she grabs two glass eyes from a table. 
               places them in grigory's sockets -- his back to us -- as he 
               turns, a glass eye shifts lazily into position. he opens his 
               hand: in it the pale black light that escaped from sammael's 
               body. he cradles it like a precious stone.

                                     grigory
                              (smiling)
                         sammael has fulfilled his destiny... 
                         die in peace and be reborn again and 
                         again...

               he closes his fist.

                                     ilsa
                         only seven more days to the eclipse, 
                         grishka...

               rasputin stands, his neck and shoulders rising, engorged by 
               moving flesh beneath his human skin. ilsa stares in 
               fascination.

                                     grigory
                         the child will be there. and so will 
                         we all -- won't we?

               behind him, in the darkness of a tunnel: two sammael 
               silhouettes appear.

                                                                    cut to:

               omit
