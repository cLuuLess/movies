               under a sheet, kroenen's cold, naked body lies on a slab. 
               broom talks into a tape recorder.

               the visible areas of the body make us grateful for the sheet 
               covering the rest.

                                     broom
                         suffered a masochistic compulsion 
                         known as surgical addiction.

               the silver hand and harness lie on a table.

                                     broom
                         both eyelids were surgically removed 
                         along with his upper and lower lips, 
                         making speech impossible. the blood 
                         in his veins dried up decades ago. 
                         only dust remains.
                              (looks at an x-ray 
                              film)
                         four pulverized vertebrae. a steel 
                         rod inserted into his pelvis held 
                         him up.
                              (beat)
                         what horrible will power could keep 
                         a thing like this alive?

               he finds the small pieces of paper kroenen planted in his 
               pouch.
