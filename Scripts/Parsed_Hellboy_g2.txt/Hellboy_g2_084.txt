               ext. central park - night

               a small nighttime halloween celebration. lanterns hanging 
               from the trees, couples drinking and listening to pop music 
               on picnic tables.

               on a bench, a young guy pulls out a cold six pack of beer 
               and passionately kisses his girlfriend. as he shuts his eyes, 
               a bright, red tail neatly snatches the six-pack.

               behind the bench, hellboy smiles.
