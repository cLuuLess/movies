               int. hexagonal trap door pit - day

               bam!!! under his feet, a huge trapdoor falls open. he and 
               manning drop through, along with the phonograph.

               hellboy grabs a rope. it spins through a copper pulley, but 
               a large knot jerks him to a stop. hellboy snatches manning's 
               hand, but loses his backpack.

               he looks down. the phonograph hits the ground with a crash.

                                     manning
                              (panting, whispers)
                         well, it's not that big a fall...

               klangggg!!!!! the entire bottom bristles with six-foot, 
               sparkling steel blades.
