               int. above the hexagonal trap door pit - day

               manning sits down, bandaging his injuries. hellboy kneels 
               down.

                                     hellboy
                         are you okay?

               manning nods weakly. hellboy brings out a cigar and fires up 
               his zippo.

                                     hellboy
                         you'd better stay here. i'll find a 
                         way out. we'll come back for you.

                                     manning
                         you call that thing a cigar??

                                     hellboy
                         yup.

                                     manning
                         you never, ever light a cigar that 
                         way.

               he digs out one of his fine cigars, cuts it and hands it to 
               hellboy.

                                     manning
                         use a wooden match. it preserves the 
                         flavor.

               he lights it for him. hellboy grins.

                                     manning
                         thank you.

                                     hellboy
