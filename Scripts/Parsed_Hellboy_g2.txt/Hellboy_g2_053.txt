               int. "magik exhibition" hall - night

               blue emergency lamps are on. the exhibits are destroyed; 
               piles of debris are burning. hellboy walks past a fallen 
               display case.

               he moves around cautiously. a couple of large carvings and 
               statues startle him.

               on the floor: boots, half chewed. bitten belts and shreds of 
               uniforms and hats.

                                     hellboy
                              (whispers into radio)
                         blue: it stinks in here -- finely 
                         aged roadkill.

               the sickening sound of snapping bones and mastication reaches 
               his ears. hellboy reacts to a smell, raises his eyes to 
               discover --

               a huge pale creature hangs from the ceiling, chewing slowly. 
               sammael: equipped with powerful arms, a head full of tentacles 
               and two well-muscled hind legs. most of its face is hidden, 
               but the jaws are shiny with blood.

                                     hellboy
                         hey. stinky. kitchen's closed.

                         raw? plus belts and boots? man, you're 
                         gonna need some heavy fiber to move
