               ext. rooftop - night

               hellboy lands neatly on the adjacent roof. he looks down at 
               myers and liz --

               myers offers her cream and sugar.

                                     hellboy
                         no cream and sugar, moron. she takes 
                         it black.

               she takes the coffee, waves off the half and half.

                                     hellboy
                         toldya.

               trying to feel superior, hellboy chuckles. as they walk, liz 
               gestures vigorously. his smile fades.
