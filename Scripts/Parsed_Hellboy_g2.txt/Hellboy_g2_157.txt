               int. broomÂ´s office - night

               kroenen's two pieces of paper are joined together under a 
               micro-scanner. broom watches as computer enhancement fills 
               out a couple of missing areas.

               cyrillic letters are now legible.

                                     broom
                              (pensive)
                         sebastian plackba #16... moscow.

               broom pulls out a few old photos. finds one of grigory in 
               german uniform, and in a book, another of grigory in an 
               orthodox priest's black cassock.

               he pulls out his old wooden box, pulls out a dusty book from 
               it. his fingers scan the text, finding rasputin's date of 
               birth, date of death. they pause at a particular line: "his 
               mausoleum is at sebastian plackba #16".

                                     broom
                         it's rasputin's mausoleum.

               tchk!! a noise -- broom turns in time to see kroenen 
               delicately descending a spiral staircase, blade in hand. in 
               spite of all his experience, broom is shaken.

                                     broom
                         i see the puppet. but -- where is... 
                         the puppet master?

               in the dark, a voice hisses --

                                     grigory
                         very good, professor broom.

               broom turns. grigory steps from the shadows.

                                     broom
                         it was you: the scraps of paper, 
                         liz's sudden relapse and return...

                                     grigori
                              (nods)
                         bread crumbs on the trail. like in a 
                         fable. they both distract him and 
                         guide him exactly where i need him.

                                     broom
                         moscow.

                                     grigory
                         his destiny.

               he touches broom's forehead, lightly --

                                     grigory
                         you raised the child. nurtured him. 
                         so, in return... would you permit 
                         me? a brief, brief glimpse? of the 
                         future --

               flash!!

               a nightmarish tableau...
