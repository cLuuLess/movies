               int. bellamie mental corridor - night

               doctor marsh, a female psychiatrist, moves down a line 
               patients, distributing pills.

               behind her, a lithe young woman in a patient's gown carries 
               the medicine tray. this is liz sherman, age 26, her pale 
               skin contrasting with her raven-black hair and piercing dark 
               eyes. a scar mars her forehead. three thick rubber bands 
               circle her wrist.

               near a window, a down's syndrome patient senses something.

                                     down's patient
                              (pointing)
                         there's a big red guy down there!

                                     doctor marsh
                              (readying more pills)
                         that's fine, darling, santa's not 
                         here for another month.

                                     down's patient
                         not santa. big and red. with gold 
                         eyes. and he has beer!

               hearing this, liz stops. she closes her eyes, tugs at one of 
               the rubber bands on her wrist and lets it snap against her 
               skin. she winces and peers out the window. the garden below 
               seems empty.
