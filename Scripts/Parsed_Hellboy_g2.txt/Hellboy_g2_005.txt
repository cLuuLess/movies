               matlin hauls his tripod and gear and joins the troops on the 
               move. broom catches up with whitman.

                         you're wasting our time: there's 
                         nothing on this island but sheep and 
                         rocks.

                         ruins. not rocks. the remains of 
                         trondham abbey. built on an 
                         intersection of ley lines, the

                         i have seen ghosts, whitman.

                         oh, i'll bet you have.

               reaching a slope, matlin sets down his camera. turning, he 
               sees lights.

               drenched, broom and whitman look down upon an impressive 
               romanesque ruin. under worklights, dozens of nazi soldiers 
               swarm among thick stone walls and archways.
