               int. taxi cab (moving) / ext. bprd adjacent avenue - day

               an ethnic pop song blasts from the taxi radio. liz pokes her 
               head out of the window and shoots a polaroid snapshot. she 
               passes it to myers:

                                     liz
                         it feels good to be outside!! it's 
                         been so long...

               he can't hear her over the music. myers knocks on the 
               bulletproof acrylic divider.

                                     myers
                         hey!! the music!! turn down the 
                         music!!

                                     driver
                         yeah, yeah, music!!

               he merely changes the radio station; the music stays at the 
               same volume. myers looks back at liz.

               she is halfway out the window, sitting on the door.

                                     myers
                         jesus! that's not -- that's not safe, 
                         miss sherman -- miss sherman?

               she takes another polaroid and passes it down to him. myers 
               looks at the polaroid, then smiles. he climbs out of the 
               other window, hands her the photograph.

                                     myers
                         nice view --

               he waves at her. for the first time, she smiles.

                                     myers
                         a smile, huh? that's good.

               she takes his picture. with the cold morning wind blowing 
               liz's hair and the sun on her face, she looks beautiful.

                                     liz
                         don't get used to it.

               myers taps his fingers on the roof, to the beat of the music. 
               he can't take his eyes off her. they drive towards the bprd.
