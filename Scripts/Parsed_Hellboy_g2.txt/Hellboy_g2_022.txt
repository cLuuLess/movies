               ext. inside chapel ruins - night

               broom hastily bandages his bleeding leg. matlin and whitman 
               roam over the debris. rain pours through the broken roof.

                                     matlin
                         do you believe in hell?

                                     broom
                         there is a place -- a dark place 
                         where evil slumbers and awaits to 
                         return. from there it infects our 
                         dreams. our thoughts. grigory gave 
                         us a glance tonight --

                                     matlin
                         grigory -- that's russian, right?
                              (broom nods)
                         thought they were on our side...

                                     broom
                         grigory yefimovich rasputin --

                                     matlin
                         c'mon -- rasputin??

                                     broom
                         spiritual advisor to the romanovs.
                              (beat)
                         in 1916, at a dinner in his honor, 
                         he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, 
                         clubbed, drowned and castrated.

                                     matlin
                         that makes him more than a hundred --

               a rustling sound reaches their ears. matlin readies a handgun 
               as broom scans the walls with his flashlight. something moves, 
               accompanied by a loud scrape.

               matlin cocks his pistol and nervously approaches a crumbling 
               statue. screeeech!!!! a red thing jumps into the air!! 
               instinctively, matlin shoots at it.

               the red thing leaps from arch to arch, followed by a trail 
               of bullet hits. whitman and other soldiers join them --

                                     matlin
                              (to broom)
                         what the hell was that? an ape?

                                     broom
                         no. it was red. bright red.

                                     whitman
                         what are you two talking about??

                                     matlin
                         a red ape.

                                     broom
                         it's-not-an-ape --

               they hear the labored breathing of a living creature.

                                     matlin
                         it's got a big stone -- in its hand --

                                     broom
                         i think that is its hand.

               hissing, the thing cowers between a gargoyle and a stone 
               saint.

               whitman points his gun at the scarlet shape above. broom 
               stops him from firing.

                                     broom
                         wait --

               in deep shadow, the red thing observes with bright, golden 
               eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna.

               broom slowly fishes a baby ruth candy bar from his pocket. 
               peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. the red 
               thing shrinks back.

               broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his 
               lips. offers the candy again. this time, out of the dark 
               comes a small face, not very different from the stone demons 
               around it.

               the creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with 
               tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist. 
               four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the 
               chocolate.

                                     young soldier
                         jesus! would'ya look at the size of 
                         that whammer!

               whitman moves closer. on the wall behind him, a shadow shows 
               the red thing climbing into broom's arms.

               broom tenderly covers it with a blanket. the stubby fingers 
               snatch the candy. broom smiles.

                                     broom
                         it's a boy. just a baby boy.
