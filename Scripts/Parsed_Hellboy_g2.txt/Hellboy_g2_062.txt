               ext. an alley - behind machen library - night

               then -- bang! bang! bang! myers appears at the end of the 
               alley, firing round after round into sammael's tongue. amber 
               blood explodes in the air. the tongue recoils with an infernal 
               squeal!!

               hellboy manages to roll away.

               myers goes for hellboy's gun... and grabs it! he takes cover 
               behind the trash container. hellboy is there.

                                     hellboy
                         what do you think you're doing??

               myers proudly shows him the gun.

                                     myers
                         helping you -- i just --

                                     hellboy
                         no one ever helps me. it's my job.

               he grabs his gun and tries to reload, but his arm hurts too 
               much.

                                     hellboy
                         damn -- okay. here --

               he hands him the gun and a fresh clip. reaching into his 
               belt, hellboy extracts a vacuum-sealed packet.

                                     hellboy
                              (throws it at myers)
                         -- then load this.

               in the packet: a single bullet.

                                     hellboy
                         it's a tracking bullet. crack the 
                         pin. load it.

               klang!!! the tongue punches through the steel like a ramrod. 
               again and again... hellboy and myers can barely dodge it.

               myers cracks a safety pin. the glass head on the bullet glows 
               like a chemical flare.

                                     myers
                         jeez... what the hell is that?

               he's looking at hellboy's smoking arm. inside a bloody gash, 
               a big, black stinger is gleaming.

               hellboy pulls it out, then steps on it. it pops like a ripe 
               grape.

                                     hellboy
                         lemme go ask --

               hellboy steps from behind the container. sammael's tongue 
               instantly wraps around the gun's muzzle.

               bam! bam! hellboy shoots repeatedly. his face lit weirdly 
               green as the tracking bullet lodges within the gun. then -- 
               bam!!!!

               inside gun shot

               the glowing bullet flies through the barrel and out towards --
