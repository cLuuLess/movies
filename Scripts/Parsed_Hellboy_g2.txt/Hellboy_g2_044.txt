               int. b.p.r.d. - freak corridor "a" - night

               myers and broom walk down a corridor. the walls are lined 
               with glass cases containing occult artifacts. myers eyes a 
               mummified hand, a clay golem, a sumptuous pagan altar...

                                     broom
                         1937: hitler joins "the thule society" -- 
                         a group of german aristocrats obsessed 
                         with the occult.

               he points to an ancient, broken lance.

                                     broom
                         1938: he acquires the spear of 
                         longinus, which pierced the body of 
                         christ. he who holds it becomes 
                         invincible.

               he gestures at an ancient lance. next to it: a silver and 
               gold reliquary.

                                     broom
                         hitler's power increases tenfold.

               they go through a series of pneumatic doors.

                                     broom
                         in 1943, president roosevelt decides 
                         to fight back. the bureau for 
                         paranormal research and defense is 
                         born.

               workmen are replacing two of the doors. big dents from an 
               oversized fist have deformed the 2-inch thick metal plates. 
               myers stares.

                                     broom
                         1958, the occult war finally ends 
                         when adolf hitler dies.

                                     myers
                         1945, you mean. hitler died in '45.

                                     broom
                              (enigmatic smile)
                         did he, now?

               they reach a final door. stainless steel, like a bank vault. 
               waiting there is agent clay, a burly guy in a suit, with a 
               cartful of beef and mashed potatoes. a dinner pile at least 
               4 feet high.

                                     broom
                         agent myers, this is agent clay. 
                         follow his lead.

               broom hands myers two baby ruth bars and walks away.

                                     myers
                         you're not coming?

               broom signals "no."

                                     broom
                         i hand-picked you from a roster of 
                         over seventy academy graduates. make 
                         me proud.

               the door closes behind him.

                                     clay
                         they're not speaking. professor broom 
                         had him grounded.

                                     myers
                         grounded? who's grounded?

                                     clay
                         okay. you saw the fish man, right?

               myers nods.

                                     clay
                         well, come on in and meet the rest 
                         of the family.

               clay uses an odd-shaped electronic key to unlock the door. 
               three solenoid locks turn. two steel vertical pistons open 
               up.
