               int. main corridor / machen library (set) - night

               they approach an oversize set of brass doors.

               abe removes a leather glove from his hand. fwap!! he spreads 
               his webbed fingers on the door. he closes his three eyelids 
               and concentrates.

               two agents arrive with a rolling munitions case. myers 
               observes as hellboy opens it and looks over a potpourri of 
               bullets of all colors and shapes.

                                     broom
                         a 16th century statue was destroyed. 
                         saint dionysius the aeropagite.

                                     hellboy
                         who wards off demons.

                                     broom
                         smuggled into this country by an 
                         overzealous curator. the statue, 
                         however, was hollow --

                                     broom
                         a prison. the vatican deemed its 
                         contents dangerous enough to include 
                         it on the list of avignon. of which 
                         we hold a copy.

               hellboy selects a clip full of bullets and a speed loader.

                                     hellboy
                         would'ya look at this babies? made 
                         'em myself. holy water, silver 
                         shavings, white oak: the works.

                                     abe
                              (pulling his hand 
                              away)
                         behind this door. a dark entity -- 
                         evil, ancient and hungry.

               abe quickly starts scanning a few leather-bound volumes of 
               ancient magic.

                                     hellboy
                         oh, well. lemme go in and say "hi".

               as hellboy opens the big doors, a flickering amber glow 
               illuminates him. he steps inside.
