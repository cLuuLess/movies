               ext. bellamie mental hospital - garden area - night

               liz steps out a side door into the hospital garden. hanging 
               from her neck: an old polaroid camera. she follows a trail 
               of blood to a large, thorny bush. as she circles it...

                                     liz
                         back so soon?

               visible in the branches, a leg and part of hellboy's overcoat. 
               his tail emerges, dangling the six-pack.

                                     hellboy
                         uh, i brought beer.

               liz shoots a polaroid.

                                     liz
                         to wash down my lithium pills?
                              (beat)
                         i may get a few perks, h.b. but i'm 
                         still a patient.

               shyly, he climbs out from the bush. she sees the bloody arm.

                                     liz
                         you better have that looked at.

                                     hellboy
                         just a scratch.
                              (shrug)
                         i wanted to see you.

               liz sighs.
