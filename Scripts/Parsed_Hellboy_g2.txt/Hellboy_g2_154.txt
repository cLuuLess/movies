               ext. building rooftop - night

               the pigeon kid walks towards hellboy, carrying two glasses 
               of milk and a plate of cookies.

                                     kid
                         my mom baked 'em.

               he sits by hellboy's side as he watches liz and myers chatting 
               and laughing.

                                     hellboy
                         that's it: she's laughing. i'm done.

               hellboy grabs three cookies off the plate and scarfs them 
               down.

                                     kid
                         they don't look like spies.

                                     hellboy
                         come on! look at him, those shifty 
                         eyes, that -- phony grin...!!
                              (seeing the last cookie)
                         you gonna eat that?

               below, myers yawns. hellboy slaps his forehead.

                                     hellboy
                         oh, the yawning trick. that's so 
                         1950's! watch his arm --

               he looks around, picks up a pebble, hefts it.
