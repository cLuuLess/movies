               int. moscow warehouse - dusk

               a metal door trundles back and the limo and escort motorcycles  
               enter.

               fleshy russian general -- lapikov -- gets out of the limo. 
               then ilsa and grigory.

                                     general lapikov
                         i have accumulated many objects of 
                         great interest. preserving our 
                         heritage.

               the warehouse contains a world of bric-a-brac: a towering 
               marble lenin head, old master paintings, tanks, warheads, 
               missiles, etc.

                                     general lapikov
                         many -- like me -- believe mother 
                         russia to be very close to a historic 
                         rebirth.

               they stop before a cargo container. with a butane torch, a 
               soldier melts away the lead kremlin seal, then open the doors.

                                     grigory
                         rebirth? i like that.
