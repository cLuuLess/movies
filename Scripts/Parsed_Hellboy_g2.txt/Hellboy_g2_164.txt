               int. medical bay - day

               abe, conscious now, but still in the cast, floats upside 
               down, solving a rubik's cube. liz stands by the tank.

                                     liz
                         i've never seen him like this. never.
                              (beat)
                         should i stay? with him, i mean?

               she smiles faintly.

                                     abe
                         listen -- i'm not much of a problem 
                         solver...
                              (displays the cube)
                         three decades and i've only gotten 
                         two sides.
                              (beat)
                         but i know this much: if there's 
                         trouble -- all we have is each other. 
                         and i'm stuck here.
                              (beat)
                         so -- take care of the big monkey 
                         for me, will you?

               their hands almost touch, separated only by the glass.
