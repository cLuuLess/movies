               int. underwater chamber 2 (location r. warehouse) - day

               abe nears the bottom of the cistern. as his feet touch bottom, 
               a cloud of silt fogs the water. he picks out a translucent 
               egg!

               suddenly, something big glides by. abe turns: sees nothing.

               he places the egg in a glass canister. now eggs are floating 
               everywhere, undulating in the water like amber fireflies. 
               abe swims slowly, collecting them one by one.

               some of them are snugly wedged between two rusty machines.

               abe's reliquary gets caught in a lever and snaps loose!! it 
               lands --

               on a grate on the floor. abe swims down and tries to grab 
               it, but it falls through. abe curses and stands up --

               -- only to find himself face to face with sammael!!

               the monster rakes abe across the chest; dark blue blood begins 
               to flow. abe shoves himself into a long, concrete fissure.

               sammael can't fit through, but the tongue darts out, missing 
               abe by inches. sammael scratches at the walls, trying to 
               reach deeper, screaming in rage.

               abe screams too, emitting a trail of bubbles.
