     int.  incinerator.  early morning.

     a naked man, thirties, seen in profile, is crouched upon a metal
     floor inside a small, brushed stainless steel tank, rubbing his
     skin raw with a wire brush.  jerome morrow.

     having completed his scrupulous ablutions, jerome arches his
     lean frame through the small, oval door of the metal room
     with practised ease.

     securing the thick, fireproof windowed door behind himself, he
     turns a switch to release gas into the vacated chamber.  the gas
     instantly ignites in what is now revealed to be a gleaming
     modern stainless-steel custom-made incinerator.

     we refocus on a magnified close up of his exfoliated flesh in
     the incinerator as it blackens, curls and burns.

     jerone covers himself with a silk robe and steps into a pair of
     backless slippers.
