     ext.  gattaca aerospace corporation - workout center.  day.

     twenty gattaca employees, identically-outfitted men and women,
     run in a perfectly straight line towards the tranquil lake of
     the picturesque grounds, never getting any closer to their goal.
     they run at a steady 10mph on twenty identical state-of-the-art
     treadmill machines sunken into the floor and arranged in a
     uniform row facing a floor to ceiling window.  the strain is
     beginning to show on many of the faces.  the heartrate of each
     employee is monitored via a wireless electrode attached to the
     chest.

     outside in the sunshine the next batch of twenty employees
     limbers up in readiness for their physical.  jerome's only
     preparation consists of thoughtfully dragging on a
     cigarette while staring out at the man-made lake.  his
     nonchalant attitude disheartens nearby colleagues, including
     irene who is amongst a group of workers excused from the run
     by benevolent, over-protective trainers.

                           trainer
              you're excused, irene.  you may resume your duties.

     on the way into the work-out facility jerome stubs out his
     cigarette in a stainless steel ashtray.  only we are aware of
     the slim credit card-sized recording device that he furtively
     slips out of his cigarette pack and secrets in his hand.  as he
     takes his place on one of the treadmills and adheres the
     cordless electrode to his chest, jerome surreptitiously attaches
     his device to the underside of the running machine's control
     panel.
