     int.  family planning clinic.  day.

     maria, wearing a medical gown, lies on an examining table, feet
     in stirrups.  a nurse, forties, wheels an instrument tray
     towards her.  maria suddenly disengages her feet from the
     stirrups and swings her legs off the table.

                           nurse
              what are you doing?

                           maria
                      (shaking her head)
              i can't do this.

                           nurse
                      (misinterpreting the problem)
              i told you, the government pays.  it's all
              taken care of.

                           maria
              no, you don't understand.  i can't.

     the nurse places a comforting hand on maria's shoulder.

                           nurse
                      (reassuring)
              the doctor will give you something.

                           maria
                      (removing the hand, adamant)
              i'm not doing it.

                           nurse
                      (trying to make her see reason)
              honey, you've made one mistake--

     the remark stings maria.

                           nurse
                      (softening her tone)
              --i've read your profile.  i don't
              know about the father but you carry
              enough hereditary factors on your own.
                      (pause)
              you can have other children.

                           maria
                      (holding her swollen stomach protectively)
              not like this one.

                           nurse
                      (trying to be diplomatic)
              honey, look around you.  the world doesn't
              want one like that one.

     maria gets off the table and reaches for her clothes laying
     across a chair.

                           maria
                      (irate)
              you don't know what it will be!

     the nurse watches maria as she dresses, genuinely bewildered.

                           nurse
                      (calling out to maria as she disappears
                      out of the door)
              the child won't thank you!
