     int.  housing project - apartment.  night.

     eugene turns his nose up at the plate of boiled meat and
     potatoes that vincent puts in front of him.  vincent catches the
     look.

                           vincent
              what's wrong with it?

                           eugene
              i think i'd better choose the menu.  after all,
              you're learning how to be me, i'm not learning
              how to be you.

                           vincent
                      (shrugs)
              suit yourself.

                           eugene
                      (trying to be more diplomatic)
              listen, i don't want you to think i'm ungrateful
              --i know you and that little broker--what do you
              call him?

                           vincent
              german.

                           eugene
              you're both going to a lot of trouble--
                      (trying to be tactful)
              maybe you can con somebody into believing
              you're me to get your foot in the door--but
              once you're inside, you're on your own.  i'm
              sure you're sincere...
                      (glancing to the space paraphenalia)
              ...but i was being groomed for something like
              this myself.  even without the accident i don't
              think i would have made it.  my point is--how the
              hell do you expect to pull this off?

     jerome merely stares back as if the thought of failure has never
     occurred to him.

                           vincent
                      (shrugs and states it simply)
              i don't know exactly, jerome.

                           eugene
                      (laughing)
              at least you're honest.
                      (a thought occurs)
              call me by my middle name--eugene--if you're
              going to be jerome, you may as well start
              getting used to it.

     nb:  for the remainder of the screenplay "vincent" is referred
     to as "jerome".
