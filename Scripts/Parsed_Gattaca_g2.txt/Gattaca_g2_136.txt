     int.  gattaca - computer complex.  night.

     in the dimly-lit, empty computer complex, jerome takes a last
     look around.  he sits at his computer, one final time replaying
     the graphic representation of his path through the cosmos that
     he is on the eve of taking for real.

     he notices the key missing from his keyboard.  instantly
     realizing the significance, he rises from his seat to flee.

                           investigator
              vincent--

     jerome is stopped in his tracks by the sound of his given name
     and the voice that calls it.

     he makes no further attempt to flee but turns to face his
     pursuer.  the investigator steps out of the shadows.

                           investigator
              vincent, what are you running from?

                           jerome
                      (disturbingly calm)
              from vincent.

     the two men face each other for the first time in a long
     time.  the investigator is transfixed by jerome's face -
     scarcely able to believe his eyes.

                           investigator
              has it been so long, you don't remember
              who i am?

                           jerome
                      (nodding to the investigator's badge)
              maybe it's you who's forgotten.
                      (meeting his gaze)
              what are you doing here, anton?

     it is finally apparent the investigator is jerome's younger
     brother anton [as we shall refer to the investigator for the
     rest of the film].

                           anton
              i could ask you the same question.
                      (glancing to the impressive complex)
              i have a right to be here, you don't.

     jerome smiles at him condescendingly.

                           jerome
              you almost sound like you believe that.

                           anton
                      (ignoring the remark, extending his hand)
              come with me now, vincent.  you've gone as far
              as you can go.

                           jerome
                      (refusing anton's hand, glancing
                      to the telescope above them)
              there are a few million miles to go yet.

                           anton
                      (adamant)
              it's over.

                           jerome
                      (shaking his head)
              is that the only way you can succeed, anton,
              to see me fail?

                           anton
              it's for the best.

                           jerome
                      (increasingly angered)
              god, even you want to tell me what i can't do.
              in case you hadn't noticed, anton, i don't
              need rescuing.  but you did, once.

     anton is clearly stung by the memory.

                           jerome
                      (goading)
              well?  you have all the answers.  how is that
              possible?

                           anton
                      (resolute)
              you didn't beat me that day.  i beat myself.

                           jerome
              who are you trying to convince?

                           anton
                      (angry)
              i will prove it to you.  come swim with
              me now, vincent.  now--tonight.

     jerome regards anton with a knowing smile.  somewhere in gattaca
     a phone rings.


     int/ext.  irene's car outside condominium complex.  night.

     irene, sitting in her car outside jerome's condominium, hangs up
     her portable phone.  in her agitation, her finger involuntarily
     goes to her pulse.  she catches herself and removes the finger
     from her wrist as if it has burned her.  she exits the car.
