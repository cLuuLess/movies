     int.  spacecraft.  night.

     we focus on jerome's face - seeing little if any of the craft.
     jerome's eyes are closed.  his head is still - alarmingly still.
     could the launch itself have been too much for him?  he hear the
     thoguhts in his head.

                           jerome (vo)
              we came from the stars so they say, now
              it's time to go back.  if i was conceived
              today, i would not get beyond eight cells,
              and yet here i am.  in a way they were
              right, i don't have the heart for this world.
                      (pause)
              the question is, why am i having so much
              trouble dying?

     jerome's eyes blink open.  he holds the letter from eugene in
     his hand.  it contains no words, merely a lock of eugene's hair
     - for once preserved solely for its sentimental value.  the
     hair, weightless, floats off the page.

     we focus on a porthole looking out upon a starscape.


     a starscape

     as we pan across the constellations, a title is superimposed
     upon the starscape:

              in a few short years, scientists will
              have completed the human genome project,
              the mapping of all the genes that make
              up a human being.

              after 4 billion years of evolution by the
              slow and clumsy method of natural selection,
              we have now evolved to the point where we
              can direct our own evolution.

     the first title is replaced in the heavens by a second title.

              if only we had aquired this knowledge
              sooner, the following people would never
              have been born:

     a succession of portraits and photographs of renowned and
     historic figures fades in and out of the constellations - the
     accompanying titles list their affliction rather than their
     accomplishments.

                               homer
                         blind from birth

                         napoleon bonaparte
                              epileptic

                               colette
                              arthritic

                              lou gerhig
                      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
                         (lou gerhig's disease)

                             rita hayworth
                         alzheimer's disease

                             helen keller
                            blind and deaf

                           stephen hawking
                        lou gerhig's disease

                         jackie joyner-kersee
                             asthmatic

                           charles darwin
                          chronic invalid

     the face of charles darwin fades off and another title appears
     out of the stars.

              even charles darwin, the man who told of
              the survival of the fittest, numbered
              amongst our frailest.

     the title fades off and is replaced by one final title in the
     night sky.

              of course, the other birth that would
              surely never have taken place is your own.
