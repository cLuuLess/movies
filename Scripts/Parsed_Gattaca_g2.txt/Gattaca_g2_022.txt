     ext.  beach.  later in the day.

     while antonio and maria doze under a beach umbrella, anton and
     vincent enter the water, diving through the waves.  from above
     we watch their two young bodies swimming beside each other
     beyond the breakers.

              our favorite game was "chicken".  when our
              parents weren't watching, we used to swim outside
              the flags, as far out as we dared.  it was about
              who would get scared and turn back first.

     suddenly vincent stops swimming, pulling up sharply in the
     water, exhausted and fearful.  he watches anton swim on into the
     distance.

              of course, it was always me.  anton was by far
              the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail.
