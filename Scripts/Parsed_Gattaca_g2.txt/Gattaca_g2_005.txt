     it is still early as jerome exits the building's underground
     parking garage in an immaculate studebaker avanti and proceeds
     down the long straight driveway.  he exchanges a wave with a
     gardener trimming a lawn.

     the whir of the car's electric powered engine belies its
     conventional appearance.
