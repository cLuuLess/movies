     int.  eugene's condominium.  day.

     jerome readies himself for an evening out - a bandage around his
     arm from the needle puncture.  eugene wheels himself in.

                           eugene
              where are we going?

                           jerome
                      (slightly guilty)
              i'm sorry.  i've got plans.

                           eugene
                      (feigning hurt)
              again?

                           jerome
                      (referring to his bandage)
              she's already got her doubts.  i have to act
              like nothing's wrong.

                           eugene
              i'm sure you'll be very convincing.

     jerome ignores the remark.

                           eugene
              where are you taking her?

                           jerome
              michael's.

     eugene looks at him askance.

                           jerome
              everybody goes there.

                           eugene
                      (incredulous, glancing around the room)
              you may as well invite her here.

                           jerome
                      (afterthought as he picks up his jacket)
              will you be okay?

                           eugene
              don't worry about your little pin cushion.
              to be honest, i'm looking forward to having
              the place to myself.

                           jerome
                      (seeing through the bravado)
              we'll still be able to talk when i'm away.
              the conversation will just keep getting longer.

                           eugene
              how long?

                           jerome
              by the time i'm at the belt, you phone and
              say, "how are you?"  forty-five minutes
              later i reply, "not bad.  how are you?"

                           eugene
              i guess i'd better have something important
              to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
