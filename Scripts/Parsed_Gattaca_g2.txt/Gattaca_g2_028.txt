     int.  home.  night.

     anton stands at the mantlepiece in the dimly-lit living room.
     he gazes at a framed family portrait - vincent's face has been
     torn out of it.  he suddenly spies vincent exiting the front
     gate, carrying a suitcase.  anton goes to shout vincent's name
     but the words don't get out.
