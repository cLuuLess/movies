     int.  gattaca aerospace corporation - computer complex.  day.

     irene prepares a stack of id photos of crew members for the
     investigator.  she closely inspects the doctored photo of
     jerome, hesitating before adding it to the file.

     the camera dwells on jerome's vacant work station.  the
     investigator curiously regards the empty chair.  he is
     accompanied by detective hugo, director josef and irene.

                           detective hugo
              he's the only absentee.

                           director josef
              a little nausea.  quite common.

                           investigator
              at least it's nothing contagious.

                           director josef
                      (unduly agitated)
              i will not permit any further testing on the
              eve of a mission.  we're already counting
              backwards.

     the investigator ignores josef and takes a pocket knife from his
     jacket.  he prises out the "esc" key from jerome's keyboard,
     places the key in a specimen bag and deposits it in his jacket.

                           irene
                      (picking up a phone)
              i'll call and let him know.

     the investigator gently but firmly removes the phone from
     irene's hand and replaces the receiver in the cradle.

                           investigator
              let's not spoil the surprise.
                      (to irene)
              i understand you can show us the way.

     the anxious director josef calls out to protest one further
     time but the investigator is on his way out of the door.
