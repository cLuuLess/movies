     ext.  condominium.  night.

     jerome, dishevelled and distressed, arrives back at the
     condominium.  he notices irene standing at the edge of the pool.

     she turns.  he approaches her.  they stand several yards apart.
     looking into each other's eyes, they do not speak.  jerome
     abruptly pulls a hair from his head - for once one of his own.

                           jerome
                      (wry smile, offering the hair to irene)
              here, take it.

     irene takes the hair, the significance not lost on her.

                           jerome
                      (echoing irene's words from
                      their first encounter)
              if you're still interested, let me know.

     irene contemplates the hair in her fingers for a moment, then
     deliberately lets it fall to the ground.

                           irene
                      (never taking her eyes from him, echoing
                      jerome's words from their first encounter)
              sorry, the wind caught it.

     once again there is not a breath of wind.  the hair lies,
     plainly visible on the edge of the pool.

     from an upstairs window, eugene observes the couple.
