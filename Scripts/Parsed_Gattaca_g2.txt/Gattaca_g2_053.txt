     int.  gattaca aerospace corporation.  morning.

     detective hugo, late-forties, wearing a crime-scene hygenic suit
     and gloves and a full clear mask - looking more like a surgeon
     or a toxic waste worker than a detective - places a blood-
     spattered computer keyboard alongside the director's shattered
     skull.  the indentations match the blunt corner of the keyboard.
     hugo detaches the dangling keyboard from its parent computer and
     seals the likely murder weapon in a marked, transparent plastic
     bag.

     a crew of similarly-suited homicide detectives systematically
     vacuum the surrounding office area with metallic, industrial-
     looking mini-vacs.  once each work space has been vacuumed, the
     transparent plastic vacuum bag is detached, sealed and labelled.

     other detectives video the scene with camcorders.  video prints
     spit out of the cameras for instant inspection.
