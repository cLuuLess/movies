     ext.  home.  day.

     antonio reluctantly shows off his spotless buick riviera to a
     prospective buyer.

                           jerome (vo)
              it meant selling the beloved buick.

     the two men haggle over the price while maria, holding vincent
     in her arms, looks on.  finally money and a pink slip are
     exchanged.

                           vincent (vo)
              my father got a good price.  after all,
              the only accident he'd ever had in that
              car was me.

     as the buyer drives away, antonio shrugs to maria to hide his
     disappointment.
