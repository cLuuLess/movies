     eugene is starting to prepare jerome's specimen bags for the
     first time.  he winces in pain as he plucks several hairs from
     his head.  jerome, now out of his casts, prepares job
     applications.

                           eugene
                      (still grimacing, referring to the follicles)
              you really need that much?

                           jerome
              more than that.  you'll get used to it.

                           eugene
                      (yanking out another hair)
              god, what wouldn't you do to leave the planet?

                           jerome
                      (inspecting a hair follicle)
              leave?  just a few million years ago every atom in
              this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star.
              i don't see it as leaving.  i see it as going home.

                           eugene
                      (marvelling at jerome's earnestness)
              god, you're serious, aren't you?

     jerome ignores him.  having learnt his lesson, he hands the
     envelopes to eugene to lick the flaps.
