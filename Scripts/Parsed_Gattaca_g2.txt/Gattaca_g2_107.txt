     int.  michael's.  night.

     the investigator is grilling michael, the club's owner.  the
     investigator suspiciously regards the multitude of mini-vacs in
     the kitchen and the incinerator burning the refuse.

                           investigator
                      (an accusing tone)
              you run a clean establishment.

                           michael
              are you a health inspector?

                           investigator
                      (showing vincent's mugshot)
              do you recognize this man?

                           michael
              my eyes aren't so good.

                           investigator
              i bet.

     hugo calls out from the side door where he has discovered
     his fallen colleague.

                           hugo
              sir.

     the investigator hurries to him.

                           investigator
                      (to the still dazed detective,
                      examining his injuries)
              did he hit you with his fist?

                           detective
                      (head in his hands)
              more like a hammer.

                           investigator
                      (reprimanding the beaten detective)
              don't touch your face.  don't swallow.
              don't spit.
                      (to hugo)
              quick, clean his teeth.

     hugo uses a flashlight and a small dental-like implement to try
     to pick skin from jerome's knuckles from between the detective's
     teeth.  the investigator finds the hidden side door.
