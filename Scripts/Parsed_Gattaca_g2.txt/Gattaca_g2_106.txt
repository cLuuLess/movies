     ext.  michael's club - side alley.  night.

     spilling out of the exit, jerome and irene find a burly
     plain clothes detective barring their way.  before the detective
     can say a word, jerome has wrapped his fist in his jacket sleeve
     and smashed him in the face.  he continues to beat the detective
     until he lies motionless on the ground.

                           irene
                      (stunned)
              jerome!

     spying other detectives some distance away in the parking lot.
     jerome leads irene out of a hidden side gate.

                           irene
              what about the car?

                           jerome
                      (grabbing her by the hand)
              let's walk.

                           irene
              who are they?

                           jerome
                      (holding his bruised knuckles)
              it's not safe.  i shouldn't have brought you here.

     jerome drags irene across a vast, desolate lot, lit only by
     moonlight.  feeling exposed, he breaks into a run.

                           irene
              i can't.

                           jerome
                      (anxious)
              come on.

                           irene
              my medication.  i left it back there.

                           jerome
              we'll get it later.
                      (forcing her to look him in the eye)
              irene, please.

     irene realizes his seriousness.  she begins to run with him.
     the clearing is wider than jerome anticipated.  they are only
     halfway across - extremely vulnerable if the detective think yo
     look in their direction.
