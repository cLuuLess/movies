     int.  housing project - apartment.  day.

     jerome is doing a late-minute cram on a geriatric computer from
     the late 1990's.  checking the time, jerome hurriedly picks up
     the shirt that eugene has been ironing from a prone position on
     the floor.

                           jerome
              it's not too late to back out.

                           eugene
              you don't know what a relief it is not to
              be me.  are you sure you want the job?

     jerome contemplates the question for a moment.

                           jerome
              what about you?  what's in this for you, eugene?

                           eugene
                      (referring to the bladder bag he wears)
              listen, i bag this stuff anyway.  it may
              as well pay my rent.

     jerome hurrise to the bathroom where, with some difficulty, he
     inserts his urine device for the first time.  the new improved
     jerome emerges into the living room ready for his interview.
