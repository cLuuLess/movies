     int.  home.  day.

     in the living room of their modest home, the dark-haired, 17-
     year-old, bespectacled vincent sits opposite his parents.  the
     crestfallen vincent has a book on his lap entitled "careers in
     space".

                           mother
                      (trying to break it gently)
              vincent, you have to be realistic.  a
              heart condition like yours--

                           vincent
              --i don't care.  i'll take the risk.

                           mother
              it's not just you they have to be concerned
              about.  perhaps we could get you one of
              those new pacemakers.  they're not perfect
              but--

                           father
                      (letting his frustration show)
              for god's sake, vincent, don't you understand.
              the only way you'll see the inside of a space
              ship is if you're cleaning it!

     vincent looks at his father in disbelief.

     on a dinner table on the other side of the living room, 15-year-
     old anton looks up from the biological specimen he is studying
     with a magnifying glass.
