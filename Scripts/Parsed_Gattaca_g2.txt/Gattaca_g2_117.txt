     int.  gattaca corporation.  later that morning.

     in the vast, empty gattaca complex the investigator inspects a
     specimen bag containing jerome's paper cup with director josef
     and detective hugo.

                           detective hugo
              positive saliva match.  the cup was
              definitely used since the original sweep.

                           investigator
              so we have two choices.  either our suspect
              came back to the murder scene for a drink of
              water and i don't know anybody that thirsty or...
                      (looking out over the empty complex)
              ...he is here.
                      (resolute)
              we test again.  you're right, hugo, this was a
              desperate act.  someone had a lot to lose that
              night--perhaps their place in line.
                      (to director josef)
              i'd like the profiles of everyone with an
              upcoming mission.

                           director josef
                      (nervous)
              twelve have a mission within the week.

                           investigator
              this time i will supervise each test personally.


     int/ext.  gattaca.  morning.

     jerome and irene walk towards the entrance to gattaca.  spying
     the homicide investigation trucks parked at the rear of the
     building and the silhouette of the investigator in the doorway,
     jerome pulls up sharply.  irene notices his unease.

                           irene
              what is it?

                           jerome
              i forgot something--something at home.
              i'll see you later.

     jerome kisses her.  irene, also aware of the trucks,
     interrogates jerome with her eyes.

                           irene
              i'll miss you.

     jerome is still focussed on the entranceway.

                           irene
                      (looking skywards)
              --when you go away.

                           jerome
              we could go together one day.

     irene considers the idea.  she enters gattaca alone.
