     int. concert hall - auditorium.  night.

     jerome and irene step over feet, apologizing as they go,
     eventually finding their seats in a box in a sold-out concert
     hall.

     on the stage below, a young pianist - a teenage prodigy - has
     already taken his place at the keys of a grand piano.  the
     pianist removes his white gloves and begins to play - an
     extremely complex and beautiful piece we have never heard
     before.  irene looks to jerome.  he is clearly caught up in the
     music.
