     int.  eugene's condominium.  night.

     jerome unlocks eugene's condo and wheels his chair inside.  we
     see their reflection in a full-length mirror as jerome pushes
     eugene to the bedroom.  after removing eugene's soiled clothing,
     he heaves the tall man from the chair and onto the bed.

                           eugene
                      (maudlin, sobbing like a child)
              i'm sorry.  i'm sorry.

                           jerome
                      (attempting to comfort)
              it's okay, eugene.

                           eugene
              you know i wasn't drunk--i knew what i was
              doing when i walked in front of that car--

                           jerome
              --what car?--go to sleep.

                           eugene
              --i walked right in front of it.  i was never
              more sober in my life.

     jerome looks at eugene's lifeless legs, trying to cover his
     shock at the revelation.

                           jerome
              it's all right.

                           eugene
                      (grabbing jerome by the collar)
              i'm proud of you, vincent.

     eugene's head falls back onto the pillow.

                           jerome
                      (smiling to himself)
              you must be drunk to call me vincent.

     but eugene does not reply, drifting into sleep once again.
     jerome pulls a blanket over him.

     on the verge of leaving, jerome's attention is drawn to a wall
     on the far side of the room.  approaching the wall, near
     eugene's mirrored closet, he detects a faint mechanical whir
     coming from inside the adjacent condominium.  jerome
     contemplates investigating but exits the condominium instead
     - climbing the spiral staircase to his own condominium.
