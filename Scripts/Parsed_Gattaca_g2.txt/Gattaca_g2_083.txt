     ext.  gattaca aerospace complex.  afternoon.

     as jerome and irene walk between the wind turbines, jerome
     pretends not to notice that irene keeps furtively checking the
     pulse on her wrist.  they pause in the shade.

                           jerome
                      (as if making conversation)
              have they found our friend?

                           irene
              friend?

                           jerome
                      (shrugs)
              it was a mercy-killing after all.

                           irene
              they found an eyelash.

                           jerome
              where?

                           irene
              in the south wing.

                           jerome
              does it have a name?

                           irene
              just some in-valid.  vincent--
                      (trying to come up with the last name)
              --somebody.

     jerome turns away to disguise his alarm.  he quickly recovers.

                           jerome
              perhaps we ought to celebrate, irene.

                           irene
                      (a smile playing around her lips)
              you celebrate, jerome?
