     int.  gattaca.  morning.

     the investigator and detective hugo keep a wary eye on the
     outfitted detectives re-vacuuming the empty computer complex
     with their mini-vacs.

                           hugo
                      (reading newspaper)
              my wife and i--we're thinking of starting a family.

                           investigator
                      (shrugs, ambivalent)
              why not?

                           hugo
              these new personality corrections i've been
              reading about.

                           investigator
              you worried about the cost?

                           hugo
              not that.

                           investigator
                      (regarding hugo with a condescending smile)
              they said the same thing about myopia and
              obesity.  you think your children would be
              less human if they were less violent, angry,
              spiteful?  maybe they'd be more human.  from
              where i sit the world could stand a little
              improving.

     we dwell on one detective in particular, snatching a garbage
     bag from caesar, the janitor.

                           detective
              don't touch that.  it's evidence.

     he puts a pile of discarded paper cups aside for later testing.
