     int.  condominium complex - parking garage.  night.

     having plugged his car into an overnight charger, jerome pushes
     eugene in his wheelchair to the elevator.  bottle in hand,
     eugene leans over and vomits on the ground.  jerome shakes his
     head resignedly.  eugene looks drunkenly up at jerome.

                           eugene
                      (sarcastically referring to the pool of vomit)
              i'm sorry.  did you want it?

     jerome meets eugene's gaze.  there is a trace of bitterness
     in eugene's drunken smile.

                           eugene
              let me get it for you.

     eugene bends down to scoop up some vomit with his hand but the
     elevator arrives and jerome quickly wheels him away.  eugene's
     head flops to the side as he passes out.
