     int.  in-valid housing project.  night.

     german leads vincent through a maze of corridors.

                           jerome (vo)
              for the genetically superior, success
              is easier to attain but is by no means
              guaranteed.  after all, there is no gene
              for fate.  and when, for one reason or
              another, a member of the elite falls on
              hard times, their genetic identity becomes
              a valued commodity for the unscrupulous.
              one man's loss is another man's gain.

     he gives a conspiratorial nod to another passing dna broker,
     both men carrying their palm-top computers.

                           german
                      (enthusiastically reading from data on
                      his portable screen as he walks)
              he has the heart of an ox.  he could run
              through a goddamn wall--if he could still run.
              actually, he was a big college swimming star.

                           vincent
              i hope he's not just a body.

                           german
              no problem.  before he dropped out he was
              an honor student, the right majors--

                           vincent
              how do i square the accident?

                           german
                      (still reading data from his
                      palm-top computer)
              it happened in australasia.  he checked
              in yesterday.  no family complications, no
              record he ever broke his neck.  as far as
              anybody's concerned, he's still a walking,
              talking, fully-productive member of society.
              you just have to get him off the pipe and
              fill in the last two years of his life.
                      (correcting himself)
              excuse me, your life.

     german has stopped walking as if they have arrived.

                           vincent
                      (looking around for a likely
                      candidate but finding none)
              where is he?

     german reaches towards a paraplegic sitting in his wheelchair
     in the stairwell directly in front of them, his head slumped, an
     incriminating bong nestled in his lap.  german pulls the man's
     head up by the hair.  eugene.  depsite the patchy, unkempt
     beard and thick glaze over his eyes he bears a striking
     similarity to vincent.  vincent holds a mirror beside the face
     of the lethargic eugene to compare his own reflection.

                           german
                      (smiling confidently
              what did i tell you?  which one's the mirror?

                           vincent
                      (still not fully convinced)
              that's the hair color in his profile?

     german checks an entry in his computer:  "hair: blonde"

                           german
              yeah.

                           vincent
                      (touching his own dark strands)
              i'd have to bleach my hair.

                           german
                      (irritated, impatient)
              why are you inventing problems?  you two
              are a couple of goddam clones.  you look
              so right together, i want to double my fee.

                           vincent
                      (a thought occurs, addressing the
                      paraplegic for the first time)
              how tall are you?

                           eugene
                      (deadpan)
              four foot six.

     vincent grins, realizing that eugene is referring to his seated
     height.  there is an instant connection between the two men.

                           vincent
              okay, how tall did you used to be?

                           eugene
                      (apathetic, still under the
                      influence of whatever he's been smoking)
              six one.

                           vincent
                      (to german, disappointed)
              he's too tall.

                           german
                      (shrugs)
              you can wear lifts.

                           vincent
              even with lifts i'm never that tall.

                           german
              there's a way.
