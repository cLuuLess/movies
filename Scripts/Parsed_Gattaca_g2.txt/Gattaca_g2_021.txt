     ext.  beach.  day.

     13-year-old vincent and 11-year-old anton sit together on a
     windswept beach.

     anton picks up a broken shell and deliberately slices the tip of
     his thumb with the sharp edge.  he hands the shell to vincent
     who hesitantly follows suit.

              by the time we were playing at blood
              brothers i understood that there was something
              very different flowing through my veins.

     the two brothers press their thumbs together, merging the blood.

                           jerome (vo)
              and i'd need an awful lot more than
              a drop if i was going to get anywhere.
