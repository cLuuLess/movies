     int.  day care center.  day.

     maria and antonio drop off dark-haired 2-year-old vincent at a
     day care center.

                           jerome (vo)
              and my parents soon realized that wherever
              i went, my genetic prophecy preceded me.

     while healthy children play outside on tricycles, clamber over
     jungle-gyms and finger-paint, the pre-school teacher shows
     vincent into a room where children with obvious disabilities
     sleep on mats.

     maria wheels around and marches out of the center with vincent
     in her arms.  antonio follows close behind, pleading with his
     wife to see sense.

                           jerome (vo)
              they put off having any more children
              until they could afford not to gamble -
              to bring a child into the world in what
              has become the "natural" way.
