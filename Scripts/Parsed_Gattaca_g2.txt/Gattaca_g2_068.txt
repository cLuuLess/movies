     int.  crime laboratory - autopsy room.  night.

     the body and clothing of the mission director, lying on a metal
     examining table is scanned with a blue-light magnifying
     instrument.  fingernail specimens are taken for analysis.  in
     another area of the laboratory, the labelled vacuum bags are
     attached to analyzers and the contents sucked out and
     automatically identified.  id names and photographs of gattaca
     employees begin appearing on a computer screen at high speed
     along with other personal details - all data automatically
     logged for later review.

     the photographs and personal details of jerome and irene flash
     past, amongst the faces of other employees.

     we focus on a magnified close up of jerome's eyelash, still
     clinging stubbornly to the side of its specimen bag.  we
     continue to follow its journey as it is finally sucked into the
     analyzer.
