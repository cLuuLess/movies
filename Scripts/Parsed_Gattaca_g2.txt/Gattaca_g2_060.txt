     int.  gattaca - simulator room.  day.

     in a large, bare room a simulator does a slow dance back and
     forth on its hydralic legs, miming the path of the space
     craft jerome will soon be aboard.  the simulation ends and
     jerome exits the simulator through a small door.  irene
     hesitantly approaches, carrying a slim electronic tablet.

                           irene
              excuse me, jerome.  i'm sorry to bother you.

     jerome turns, not displeased by the interruption.

                           jerome
              no bother.

                           irene
                      (referring to her notepad)
              i've been asked to compile a log for the
              investigators--they want to know everyone's
              whereabouts last night.

                           jerome
              last night?  i was at home.

     irene makes a note with her stylus.

                           irene
              can that be, er, verified?  were you alone?

                           jerome
              no it can't be verified.  yes i was alone.

     irene makes another note.

                           jerome
                      (wry smile)
              looks bad, doesn't it, irene?  what about
              you?  where were you last night?

                           irene
              i was at home.

                           jerome
              were you alone?

                           irene
                      (hesitant)
              yes.

                           jerome
                      (teasing)
              so we don't know for sure about you, either.

                           irene
                      (wary, wondering where the
                      conversation is headed)
              no.

                           jerome
              why don't we say we were together?

                           irene
                      (confused)
              why would we do that?

                           jerome
              i have better things to do this week than
              answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot.
              don't you?

     irene contemplates the question.

                           jerome
                      (gently pressing)
              well, shall we say we spent the evening together?

     irene is still unsure whether or not jerome is serious.

                           irene
              to be convincing, jerome, i would have to know
              what that was like.

     irene turns and departs.  jerome watches her go.
