     int.  eugene's condo.  night.

     eugene talks irritably on the phone, examining a container from
     a newly opened case of hair bleach.

                           eugene
                      (into phone)
              --i know what i ordered.  i ordered "honey
              dawn" and you sent me "summer wheat".

     jerome descends the staircase, taking the steps two at a time.
     he immediately goes to the refrigerator, removing trays of
     samples.  eugene abruptly hangs up the phone.

                           jerome (oc)
              call german.

                           eugene
              any particular reason?

                           jerome
                      (collecting up sample bags from
                      the work bench)
              we can't stay here.

                           eugene
              what are you talking about?

                           jerome
              they think i offed the director.

     eugene wheels himself over to jerome, unconcerned.

                           eugene
              what makes them think that?

                           jerome
              they found my eyelash.

                           eugene
                      (a flicker of anxiety)
              where?

                           jerome
              in a corridor.

                           eugene
                      (blas√à once again)
              could be worse.  they could have found
              it in your eye.

     jerome half-smiles despite the situation.

                           jerome
                      (resuming his collection of samples)
              come on--we're taking off.

                           eugene
              i'm not going anywhere.  less than a week to go.
              not on your life--

                           jerome
              --you don't understand, they'll make the
              connection, they'll hoover again.  we should
              cut our losses.

                           eugene
                      (angrily grabbing a tray from jerome's hands)
              where is your head, jerome?  you're acting
              like a guilty man.  they won't marry the eyelash
              to you.  they won't believe that one of their
              elite navigators could have suckered them for the
              last five years.

                           jerome
              they'll recognize me.

                           eugene
                      (scoffing)
              how could they recognize you?
                      (referring to the torn photo of
                      20-year-old vincent on the wall)
              i don't recognize you.  anyway, you don't have a
              choice.  you run, you may as well sign a confession,
              turn us both in right now.  no, we stick this out--
              find out what we can but change nothing.  this is
              a minor inconvenience is all it is.  we've taken
              worse heat than this.
                      (angry now)
              jesus, if i'd known you were going to go
              belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, i
              wouldn't have bothered.  you can't quit on me
              now.  i've put too much into this.
                      (returning the samples to the fridge)
              besides, this stuff is mine.  i had other offers,
              you know.  i could have rented myself out to
              somebody with a spine.  you want me to wheel in
              there and finish the job myself?
                      (meeting jerome's gaze)
              we'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like
              we planned.

     jerome slumps down in a chair, eugene's tirade starting to get
     to him.

                           eugene
              and keep your lashes on your lids where
              they belong.  how could you be so careless?

                           jerome
              i'm sorry.
                      (reluctant admission)
              i think i was crying.

     eugene is uncomfortable at the notion.

                           eugene
              well save those tears.

     jerome shrugs awkwardly and pours them both a drink.

                           jerome
              you really had other offers?

                           eugene
                      (shrugs)
              i'm sure i could have.
