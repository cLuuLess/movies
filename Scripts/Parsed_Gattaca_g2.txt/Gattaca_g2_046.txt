     int.  housing project - apartment.  day.

     hair already bleached and cut to match eugene's hairstyle,
     jerome sits in a chair against a hastily erected white paper
     backdrop.  from his wheelchair, eugene puts the finishing
     touches to jerome's hair.  he wheels himself out of the way.
     the final accomplice in jerome's deception, a black market
     computer graphics designer, takes jerome's photo with a video
     camera.  manipulating the captured image, the designer morphs
     jerome's face into the face of eugene.  the resulting photo that
     spits out of a printer is neither one nor the other but an
     acceptable combination of the two.
