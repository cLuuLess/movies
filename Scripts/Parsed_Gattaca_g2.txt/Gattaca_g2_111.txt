     int.  irene's bedroom.  night.

     jerome and irene climb a staircase to her bedroom.  without
     another word they begin to make love.

     later that night, jerome cannot sleep.  he rises quietly so as
     not to disturb irene.  he silently opens the double-windows of
     the upstairs bedroom.  he carefully gathers his pillow from the
     bed and shakes it out of the window.

     slowly jerome turns to gaze at the wood floor.  in the moonlight
     we see an extreme close up of a single hair lying on the
     floorboards.  jerome bends and picks up the hair, trying to
     identify it in the dim light.  on his hands and knees he tries
     to clean the floor with a towel.  irene turns over in the
     bed.  jerome freezes but she continues to sleep.  he realizes he
     may be spreading even more of his skin and hair over the floor.
     overcome with frustration and the enormity of his task, he
     begins to quietly weep.
