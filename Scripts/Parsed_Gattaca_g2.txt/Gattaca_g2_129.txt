     int.  jerome's condominium - bathroom.  day.

     the investigator immediately pulls a specimen bag from his
     jacket pocket and closely inspects the stainless steel toilet
     and sink.  they are both spotless.  the shower stall is also
     scrupulously clean.  he flushes the toilet and exits.

     lost in thought, the investigator approaches the closet again
     and wheels out jerome's upright vacuum cleaner.  he is
     disappointed a second time to find no vacuum bag inside.  the
     investigator returns the vacuum cleaner to the closet and
     produces a mini-vac from detective hugo's crime bag.

                           investigator
                      (to eugene, referring to ther mini-vac)
              may i?

                           eugene
              clean the whole house if you want.

                           irene
                      (taking eugene's lead)
              actually, the kitchen needs doing.

     the investigator switches on the mini-vac to take a specimen
     from the floor, then promptly kills the machine.  looking down,
     the investigator notices the trail of eugene's perspiration
     on the highly polished floor leading to the spiral staircase.

     eugene, reading the investigator's mind, goes to call out but
     the words remain frozen on his tongue.  hugo follows his
     superior as they start to descend the stairs.  irene and eugene
     are left staring at one another.
