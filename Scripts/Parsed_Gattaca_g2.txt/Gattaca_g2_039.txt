     int.  housing project - apartment.  day.

     eugene awakens with a scream, bathed in sweat, arms bound to a
     bed - the only real piece of furniture in the room.  vincent,
     sitting on a crate beside him, soaking a towel in a bowl of
     water, is taken by surprise.  eugene continues to scream and
     thrash, fighting against his bindings.  vincent stuffs the towel
     into eugene's mouth and holds onto his arms.

              i confess, at first i wondered if i had rescued
              a man who was already dead.
