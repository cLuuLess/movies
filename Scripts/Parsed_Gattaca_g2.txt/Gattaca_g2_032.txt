     int.  astronomy & telescope shop.  day.

     a forest of telescopes on tripods in an astronomy shop.  vincent
     enters the store with a bucket and squeegee and immediately goes
     to clean the storefront window.  the store owner looks up from
     his tabloid - "star" magazine.

                           owner
              where's earl?

                           jerome
              he fell.  lucky it was only the second floor.

     the owner nods and returns to his magazine.  when he looks up
     again one of his tripods is missing its telescope and jerome is
     nowhere to be seen.
