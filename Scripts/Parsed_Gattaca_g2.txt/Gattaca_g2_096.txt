     ext.  jerome's pool.  morning.

     jerome sits at his own poolside in his robe, feet dangling over
     the edge, smoking a cigarette.  eugene, from his wheelchair, is
     applying bleach to jerome's hair and eyebrows with gloved
     hands.

     at the same time, jerome plays a sleight-of-hand game with a
     syringe.

                           eugene
              how was your evening?

                           jerome
              complicated.  i couldn't stop her apologizing.

                           eugene
                      (teasing)
              you are a catch.  no doubt she's worried that
              she would lower the standard of your offspring.
              everybody wants to "breed up".
                      (idly curious)
              what's wrong with her?

                           jerome
                      (trying to be blas√à)
              you know how it is with these altered births
              --somebody told her she's not going to live
              forever and she's been preparing to die ever
              since.

                           eugene
              you're not thinking of telling her, are you?

                           jerome
              of course not.  but she's have to know eventually.

                           eugene
                      (adamant)
              she doesn't have to know.  she doesn't want to know.

     the camera travels down jerome's scarred legs to find that the
     pool is completely drained.  we now realize that it never
     contained water.


     a barren wasteland.

     a desolate landscape, resembling the surface of the planet mars.
     we pull back to find that we are peering at this forbidding
     desert through a circular aperture.
