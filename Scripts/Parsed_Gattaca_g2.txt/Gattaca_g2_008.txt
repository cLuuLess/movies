     int.  gattaca aerospace corporation - testing laboratory.  day.

     white-coated lamar, forties, buzzcut, a man's man, checks
     jerome's eyes with an instrument.  satisfied with his
     examination, he passes a transparent plastic container to
     jerome.  standing directly in front of the technician with his
     back to camera, jerome opens his fly.  a steady stream of urine
     begins to flow into the container from jerome's hidden pouch.

                           lamar
                      (staring admiringly at the discharge)
              jerome...never shy.  pisses on command.
              you've got a beautiful cock.  i ever told
              you that, jerome?

                           jerome
                      (deadpan as he continues to urinate)
              only every time i'm in here.

     jerome hands the container to lamara who seals and label it as
     jerome refastens his trousers.

                           lamar
              i see a lot of cocks.  i speak from experience.
              yours is a beautiful example.  why didn't my
              folks order a cock like that for me?

     lamar pours the urine sample into a high-tech device where it
     is instantly analyzed.  the urine identifies jerone while also
     registering a negative drug reading.  the computer reads
     "valid".

                           lamar
                      (walking jerome to the door)
              if everything goes to plan, this could be the
              last time i see you for a while.  one week to
              go.  please tell me you're the least bit excited.

                           jerome
              i'll tell you at the end of the week.

     jerome departs.
