     german wheels the dazed eugene into the apartment, cluttered
     with space paraphenalia.  one wheel of his rusting wheelchair is
     flimsily held on with wire.  vincent follows behind on crutches,
     both lower legs in casts and cross-braces.  vincent signs the
     contract german puts in front of him.
