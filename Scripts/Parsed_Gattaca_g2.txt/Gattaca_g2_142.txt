     int.  jerome's condominium.  night.

     irene and jerome lie in bed together after making love.  for
     once jerome is able to sleep unconcerned.  it is irene who lies
     awake, head against jerome's chest, listening to the sound of
     his erratically beating heart.  however it has a soothing
     effect on her.

     she kisses jerome and reluctantly rises from the bed.

                           jerome
                      (awakening)
              a year is a long time.

                           irene
              not so long--just once around the sun.

     jerome smiles.  for once irene seems to be looking forward
     to the trip.  she exits the room.
