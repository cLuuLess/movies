     int.  gattaca aerospace corporation - computer complex.  night.

     the complex is virtually empty - only a handful of the hundreds
     of programmers working late into the night.  irene approaches
     jerome's work station on the pretext of delivering some
     documents.  trying to act casually, she looks under the papers
     on his desk, then opens the top desk drawer.

     we see an extreme close up of the comb lying there - the two
     hairs trapped between the teeth of the comb.  irene removes one
     of the follicles and drops it into an envelope she is carrying.
