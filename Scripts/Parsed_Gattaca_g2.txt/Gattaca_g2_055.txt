     int.  gattaca - corridor.  day.

     we focus on jerome's eyelash, still lying on the floor.
     a huge crescent-shaped hair that fills the screen.  suddenly
     there is a roar of a mini-vac and the eyelash is sucked up.  we
     follow the eyelash's journey, down the throat of the cleaner
     into the specimen bag where it is sucked against the bag's
     clear, plastic wall.
