     int.  housing project - apartment.  day.

     jerome practises writing with his right hand, trying to
     replicate eugene's signature.

                           eugene
                      (wheeling by, looking over jerome's
                      shoulder at the signature)
              it needs work.

                           jerome
                      (rueful)
              you had to be a right-hander.

                           eugene
              noone orders southpaws anymore.
