     int.  crime laboratory.  day.

     an extreme close up of dried blood - brittle and cracking - on
     a pair of soiled latex gloves.  a latex head mask, suit of
     clothes and shoe covers are similarly caked.  the investigator
     and detective hugo watch as a white-coated forensic technician
     feeds a minute sample of the dried blood into an analyzer.

     the investigator wanders over to a one-way glass window through
     which he can observe director josef, sitting numb but strangely
     serene in an interrogation room.  the investigator, in a state
     of shock himself, cannot yet bring himself to believe what is
     plainly obvious.

                           investigator
                      (gazing at the director, struggling
                      to come to grips with the turn of events)
              this can't be him.

     the detective regards his superior incredulously, intrigued that
     he could still cling so stubbornly to his theory in the face of
     such overwhelming evidence.

                           detective hugo
                      (intrigued)
              we found his spit in the dead director's eye.
              he's signed a confession--supplied us with the
              suit he wore on the night.  what more do you
              want?

                           investigator
                      (a trace of desperation, grasping at straws)
              luca could still be an accomplice.

     the investigator turns away, unwilling or unable to accept the
     explanation.  hugo regards the investigator with a trace of
     sympathy.  he furtively retrieves the investigator's tissue
     from the trash.
