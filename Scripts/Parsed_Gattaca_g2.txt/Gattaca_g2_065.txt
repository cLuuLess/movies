     int.  michael's dinner club.  night.

     the chic, elegant establishment inside belies its darkened
     exterior.  jerome wheels eugene into a decadent dinner club
     full of an odd assortment of people.  they are immediately
     greeted respectfully by michael, the owner and maitre d'.
     jerome and eugene are obviously regulars.

                           michael
              good evening, gentlemen.  your table is ready.
                      (referring to jerome's mission)
              not long now, sir.  you'll be upstairs
              before you know it.  we're going to miss you.

                           jerome
              not as much as i'll miss your stroganoff.
              i'd like to take one of your chefs with me.
