     ext.  michael's dinner club.  night.

     jerome and eugene, dressed to the nines, pull up in the car
     to a darkened doorway in a poorly lit street.  a valet appears
     out of the shadows.  familiar with the car, he goes immediately
     to the trunk to retrieve eugene's collapsible wheelchair.
     jerome tips the valet - a credit card wiped through a device.
