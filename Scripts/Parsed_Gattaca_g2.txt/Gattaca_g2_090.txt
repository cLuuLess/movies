     int.  in-valid housing project - prostitute's boudoir.  night.

     from an upstairs window we observe the investigator's car
     cruise slowly back into the squalid housing project.  a man is
     buckling his pants at the window.

                           john
              shit!  one of those hoovers is back.

     a prostitute, valerie, a slender, sylphlike beauty, joins him at
     the window.

                           valerie
              it's alright.  he's here to see me.

     her client looks at her askance.  despite her assurances, he
     hurries into his clothes anyway.

                           valerie
                      (to an unseen woman in the next room)
              sonja, i can't see anyone else tonight.
