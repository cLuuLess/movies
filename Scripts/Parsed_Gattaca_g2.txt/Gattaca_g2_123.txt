     int.  eugene's condo/jerome's condo.  day.

     having wheeled his chair out of sight, eugene eases himself out
     of his wheelchair and onto the floor.  using his elbows,
     commando-style, dragging his lifeless legs behind him, he
     proceeds to crawl across the floor and up the first step of the
     long spiral staircase.  we observe his agonizingly slow progress
     up a staircase that, from eugene's point of view, appears to
     have doubled in length.
