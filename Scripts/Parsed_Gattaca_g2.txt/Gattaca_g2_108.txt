     ext.  desolate lot.  night.

     jerome and irene continue to sprint across the enormous vacant
     lot in the moonlight, splashing through deposits of mud and
     water.  just as the gate opens in the distance, jerome hurls
     irene into the safety of the undergrowth on the other side.
     irene, out of breath, desperately feels for her pulse.

                           irene
                      (upset, a strangled protest)
              are you trying to kill me?  are you?!
              don't you understand, i can't do that!

     jerome tenderly removes irene's hand from her pulse.

                           jerome
              you just did.

     irene looks back across the vast clearing they have just
     negotiated, realizing what she has just done.

     from across the other side of the clearing comes an echoing
     cry from the center figure.

                           investigator (oc)
              vincent!  vincent!
