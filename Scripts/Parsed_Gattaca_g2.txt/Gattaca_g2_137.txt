     int.  jerome's condominium/eugene's condominium.  night.

     irene quietly knocks on jerome's door but there is no response.
     trying the handle, the door opens.  her curiosity takes her
     inside.  all is quiet.  irene calls out.

                           irene
              hello.

     no reply.  irene hesitantly ventures further, drawn to the
     spiral staircase.  she tentatively makes her way down the stairs
     and into eugene's dimly lit condominium.  with wonder and
     reverence, she examines the instruments and samples laid out on
     eugene's work benches.  she opens the refrigerator in the
     bathroom and inspects the samples and sachets.  finally she
     regards the empty incinerator.

                           eugene (oc)
              quite something, isn't it?

     irene turns.

     eugene has entered through the mirrored door, not at all
     displeased by her unexpected visit.

                           eugene
                      (referring to the incinerator)
              that's where we get rid of the traces of him
              although we never truly succeeded.

                           irene
              i've been looking for him.  do you know where
              he is?

                           eugene
                      (unconcerned)
              he's probably leaving some more of me
              around the place before he goes.

     eugene idly inspects one of the blood sachets.

                           eugene
              don't be deceived, irene.  these are
              just the clothes.  he has to wear them.
              something i could never do.

                           irene
              what's wrong with him?

                           eugene
                      (sympathetic smile)
              you have more in common than you know.

     irene's hand involuntarily goes to her heart.

                           eugene
              but they say hisis already ten thousand beats
              overdue.  i have my doubts.
                      (wry smile)
              for all my gifts, they could never engineer
              me a heart like vincent's.

     irene turns back to the incinerator, lost in though.
