     int.  housing project - apartment - bathroom.  night.

     vincent holds eugene's head over the toilet bowl as he vomits
     violently.  eugene's paralysis and vincent's broken legs make
     the operation doubly difficult.

     finally eugene has nothing left in his stomach to vomit.  he
     drops to the floor in exhaustion.  vincent, also exhausted from
     the effort of holding eugene over the bowl, joins him on the
     broken linoleum.  both men stare up at the ceiling that carries
     a map of the constellation.

                           vincent
              you okay, jerome?

                           eugene
                      (ironically referring to
                      their mutual immobility)
              yeah.  you want to go dancing tonight?

     vincent smiles.
