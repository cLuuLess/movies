     int.  gattaca - mezzanine floor.  later in the day.

     from above, the investigator and hugo observe the final employee
     exit the testing lab.

     lamar, following the employee out of the lab, throws a look of
     vindication to the two cops.

                           detective hugo
              that's the last.

                           investigator
              something's not right.

                           detective hugo
                      (losing his patience)
              he's not here.  it's a blind alley.

                           investigator
                      (resolute)
              no, we've missed something.  we hoover again.

                           detective hugo
              we don't have the manpower.

                           investigator
              get it.  from outside, if you have to.

                           detective hugo
              from what budget?

                           investigator
                      (angered by hugo's excuses)
              i'll take it out of your damn pension if
              you question my authority one more time!

     the investigator turns his back on his subordinate and idly
     contemplates the nearby telescope.  hugo resignedly relays the
     news to director josef who is standing some distance away.
     josef's immediate reaction is to march towards the investigator,
     hugo trailing behind.  director josef collects himself as he
     notices the investigator's hand on the telescope.

                           director josef
              would you care to look--in the telescope?

                           investigator
              thank you, no.

                           director josef
                      (still referring to the telescope)
              one look through there and you would know why
              i can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations
              any further.

                           investigator
                      (unfazed)
              you're so unconcerned that you have a killer
              in your midst.

                           director josef
              right now, your presence is creating more of
              a threat.  i don't think you have any concept
              of what we do here--how meticulous our
              preparations must be.  we are about to send
              twelve people through 140 million miles of
              blackness to rendezvous with an object the size
              of a house and the color of coal.  so it's rather
              critical to point them in the right direction.
              and we certainly don't need you looking over our
              shoulders.  besides, i don't believe there is
              any evidence that the killer is amongst us.  i
              don't see too many other dead bodies littering
              the place.

                           investigator
                      (surveying the mostly empty facility)
              no, but since there aren't too many live ones
              tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one
              further sweep.  if he does not work here, then
              there should be no other trace of him.
                      (to hugo)
              i think you'd better get some people out of bed,
              detective.
                      (a thought occurs)
              in the meantime we can re-check his favorite
              haunt.

     director josef quietly seethes.

                           investigator
                      (to josef, referring to the telescope)
              you see, director, i prefer my microscope.
