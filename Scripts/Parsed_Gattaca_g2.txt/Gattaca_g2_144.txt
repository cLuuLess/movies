     int.  eugene's condominium.  morning.

     jerome, dressed for his departure, emerges down the spiral
     staircase into eugene's condo.  jerome notices several suitcases
     at the foot of the stairs.

     eugene wheels into the room.

                           eugene
              i have your samples ready.

                           jerome
                      (confused)
              have you forgotten?  i don't need any samples
              where i'm going.

                           eugene
                      (meeting jerome's gaze)
              no, but you might need them when you get back.

     eugene wheels across the room and opens the mirrored door.  the
     water vapor billows out.  jerome regards eugene.

     eugene leads jerome inside for the first time.

     inside are two rows of four identical, industrial refrigerators.
     they contain thousands of blood and urine specimens.

     jerome regards them with awe and more than a little unease.

                           eugene
              everything you need to last you two lifetimes.

     eugene points out an extra specimen of semen in the first
     refrigerator.

                           eugene
              there's an extra specimen.  i wish i
              could give it to her myself.
                      (afterthought)
              but then, you always were better at being me.

     eugene leads the way out of the refrigerator room.

                           jerome
                      (struggling to come to terms
                      with the discovery)
              why have you done this?

                           eugene
                      (as he seals the mirrored door)
              in case you get back before i do.

                           jerome
              where are you going?

                           eugene
                      (glancing to the suitcases)
              i'm travelling too.

     jerome goes to question eugene's travel plans but thinks better
     of it.  he kneels before his friend and embraces him.

                           jerome
              thank you.

                           eugene
              i got the better end of the deal.  i just
              lent you my body--you lent me your dream.

     jerome smiles and hugs eugene a final time.  eugene stuffs an
     envelope into jerome's pocket.

                           eugene
                      (referring to the note,
                      glancing heavenwards)
              not until you're upstairs.

     jerome exits.  eugene watches him go.
