     int.  gattaca corporation - corridor.  day.

     a line of male gattaca employees snakes out the door and down
     the corridor.  the investigator walks slowly down the line,
     trying to eyeball his suspect.  concentrating on the shorter,
     dark-haired men in the line, he looks straight past jerome.
     however, as the investigator ignores him and walks by, we see a
     haunted look in jerome's eyes.
