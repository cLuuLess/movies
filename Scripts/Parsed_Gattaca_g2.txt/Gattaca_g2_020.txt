     a red pencil draws a mark on a doorway at the height of a
     child's head.  the child moves away and the name, "anton 11" is
     written beside the mark by proud father, antonio.

              that's how my brother, anton, came into the
              world - a son my father considered worthy
              of his name.

     there is little physical similarity between 11-year-old anton
     and 13-year-old vincent standing beside him, apart from their
     height.  in fact vincent is mortified to see that his younger
     brother's mark is a fraction of an inch higher than the mark
     beside his own name, "vincent 13".  vincent runs from the room.
