     int.  jerome's condominium.  day.

     eugene, bathed in sweat, finally crests the landing of the
     staircase.  no respite.  as he drags himself across the floor
     the internal phone rings.  he frantically stretches up and
     knocks the phone off its hook so he can talk from his prone
     position on the floor.
