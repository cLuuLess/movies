     int. housing project - apartment.  night.

     jerome looks through eugene's personal effects, including a
     photograph album.  he is drawn to a swimming medal inside the
     album at a page displaying a photo of a wealthy, austere
     mother - eugene evidently comes from money.

     even as he wheels into the room in his rickety wheelchair we see
     that eugene has the bearing of someone of good breeding.  he has
     a bag of blood on his lap.  more blood is being drawn from his
     arm through an iv.  eugene catches jerome looking at the album.

                           jerome
                      (guiltily closing the book)
              i have to know where you come from.

                           eugene
              if anybody asks, tell them the truth--
              your family disowns you.  you are a
              disappointment, jerome.

                           jerome
                      (referring to eugene's medal, impressed)
              what about this?

                           eugene
              wrong color.  it's silver.
                      (tossing the bag of blood to jerome)
              it's not easy living up to this.

     eugene wheels away.
