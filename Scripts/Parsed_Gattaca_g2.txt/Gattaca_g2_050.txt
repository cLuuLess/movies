              the majority of people are now made-to-order.
              what began as a means to rid society of
              inheritable diseases has become a way to design
              your offspring--the line between health and
              enhancement blurred forever.  eyes can always be
              brighter, a voice purer, a mind sharper, a body
              stronger, a life longer.  everyone seeks to give
              their child the best chance but the most skilled
              geneticists are only accessible to the priveleged few.

              anyone who is the product of an altered
              dna is proudly referred to as a "dan",
              "self-made man or woman", "man-child".
