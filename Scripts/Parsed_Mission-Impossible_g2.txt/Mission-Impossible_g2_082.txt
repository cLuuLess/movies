     ext. street by bank/florenc bus stop - day

     ethan arrives at the bus stop outside the savoy arcade. a 
     man in a black wind-breaker sits on the bench, his back to 
     ethan. 

                          ethan 
                excuse me, could i trouble you for a 
                match? 

     without turning, the man offers up a box of matches. as 
     ethan takes them, two men from behind take him by either arm 
     and escort him into a car which has just pulled up.
