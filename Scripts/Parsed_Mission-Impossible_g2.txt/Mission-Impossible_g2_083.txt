     int. car - day

     ethan slides into the back seat, between the two men. 
     matthias, the man on the left, holds up a black hood.  he 
     extends it to ethan, who doesn't take it. 

                          matthias
                would you remove your hat please? 

                          ethan 
                why? 

                          matthias 
                you wish to meet max?  this is the price 
                of admission. 

     reluctantly, ethan pulls the hood over his head and the car 
     takes off.
