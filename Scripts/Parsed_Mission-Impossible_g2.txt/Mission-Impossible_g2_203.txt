     ext. roof of train/tunnel - day

     for a moment, we see no one.  no ethan.  no phelps.  moving 
     around to the other end of the car, we see where they've 
     gone. 

     they're dangling from either side of it. 

     phelps paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself 
     back onto the roof of the train.  ethan reaches for the other 
     cup. 

     the helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track 
     and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, krieger 
     pushing it up to full speed again. 

     but it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the 
     train.
