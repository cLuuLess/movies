     int. plane - night 

     ethan hunt slumps down in his scat, dosing. a flight 
     attendant makes her way down the aisle, holding a case filled 
     with movie cassettes. she stops before a lady passenger. 

                          flight attendant 
                would you like to watch a movie, miss 
                clarke? 

     she then stops before ethan. 

                          flight attendant 
                excuse me, mr. hunt.  would you like to
                watch a movie.

                          ethan
                no, thank you.

                          flight attendant 
                would you consider the cinema of the 
                caribbean? 

     ethan just stares at her.  this couldn't be what it's 
     sounding like. 

                          flight attendant 
                aruba, perhaps? 

     the camera moves into ethan's face.  they found him.  they 
     want him back.  he looks up at her and..... 

                                                      cut to black
