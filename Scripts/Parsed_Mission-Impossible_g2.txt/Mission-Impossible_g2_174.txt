     ext. charles bridge - flashback - night                           

     a reprise of phelps's narrative only now ethan's telling it 
     and camera is showing the events as ethan sees they actually 
     happened. 

                          ethan vo 
                - first he took care of jack in the 
                elevator - 
        
     at the embassy phelps sends the elevator to the top of the 
     building, watching it go and crush kiefer. 

                          ethan vo 
                - he shot you on the bridge - 

     on the charles bridge phelps using the visco glasses aims the 
     gun toward them, fires, cants the glasses and tosses them 
     into the vltava river. 

                          ethan vo 
                - he must have had back up take out 
                golitsyn and sarah at the fence.. 

     there on the embankment, in the night and fog, it is krieger 
     who takes out golitsyn and sarah thru the fence.. 

                          ethan vo 
                how did he do hannah? 

     here it is claire with back to camera who presses the 
     detonator and turns dreamily to face it, the explosion 
     brilliant behind her... 

                          ethan vo 
                no.  no.  he could've taken out hannah 
                himself. 

     phelps presses the remote detonator and the car blows.. 

     over shoulder - phelps (int. railway cafe)

     ethan looking intently at him.

                          ethan
                why, jim?  why?

     awkward moment.

                          phelps
                ..when you think about it, ethan, it was
                inevitable..no more cold war.  no more
                secrets you keep from everyone but
                yourself, operations you answer to no one
                but yourself.  then one morning you wake
                up and find out the president of the
                united states is running the country -
                without your permission.  the son-of-a-
                bitch!  how dare he?  you realize itís
                over, youíre an obsolete piece of
                hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got
                a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a 
                year.  kittridge, weíll go after that no
                good son-of-a-bitch, big time!

                          ethan
                we donít have to, jim.  heíll come after
                us.

                          phelps
                whatís going to make him do that?

                          ethan
                what he didnít get in prague.  the noc
                list.

                          phelps
                jesus, ethan.  good for you.

                          ethan
                a meeting tomorrow on the tgv, enroute to
                paris.

                          phelps
                tight security.  no guns.  real plus.

                          ethan
                if i supposedly deliver the noc list to
                max, max has agreed to deliver job to me.
                iíll have claire and luther stickell with
                me on the train.  marcel krieger will
                have helicopter transport waiting in
                paris.

     phelps looks away.  seems badly shaken.

                          ethan
                jim...?

                          phelps
                i was sitting in a cafe waiting for you
                and suddenly there she was, standing in
                the rain just outside the safe
                house..alive and beautiful..and thinking
                iím dead and gone.  god knows what sheís
                had to do forget about me to keep going
                and get the job done, i..

     phelps breaks off abruptly.  apparently some inner struggle
     over this threatens to overwhelm him.  then, controlling it:

                          phelps
                - no.  she canít know about me.  no one
                can.  not til this is over.  thereís too
                much at stake, ethan.

                          ethan
                youíre probably right.

                          phelps
                i usually am.

                          ethan
                once we leave the safehouse, get in there
                and crash.  iíll call you from paris.

                          phelps
                you got it.

                          ethan
                and get a doctor.

                          phelps
                good luck.
