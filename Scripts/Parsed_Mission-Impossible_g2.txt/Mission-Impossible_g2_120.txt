     int. duct - day 

     ethan and krieger crawl quickly through the ducts, moving 
     horizontally now.  they reach a juncture and turn right. 

                          ethan 
                1 - 2 - 3 - toast, toast.  luther, i'm 
                going in.  don't disappoint me...krieger, 
                from here on in, absolute silence.
