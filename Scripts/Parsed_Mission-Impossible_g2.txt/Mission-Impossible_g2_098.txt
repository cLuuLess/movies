     int. train - stateroom - night
        
     the word "disavowed" dissolves slowly over the stateroom of a 
     high speed train, where the newly assembled im force has 
     gathered around a table -- krieger, a dangerous-looking 
     frenchman of forty or so, luther stickell, a muscular, soft- 
     spoken american in his mid-thirties.  ethan, and claire. 
     luther regards the others warily. 

                          ethan
                simple game.  four players. 
                     (points to krieger) 
                exfil opens the pocket -- 
                     (and to luther)
                -- cyber ops lifts the wallet. 

                          krieger 
                bank? 

                          ethan 
                imf mainframe. 

                          krieger 
                     (after a moment) 
                where exactly is it? 

                          ethan 
                in langley. 

                          luther 
                in langley?  the one in virginia, langley? 

                          krieger 
                inside cia headquarters at langley. 

     ethan nods.  krieger turns to claire. 

                          krieger (cont'd) 
                is he serious? 

                          claire 
                always. 

                          krieger 
                if we're going to virginia, why don't we 
                drop by fort knox?  i can fly a 
                helicopter right in through the lobby and  
                set it down inside the vault and it will 
                be a hell of a lot easier than breaking 
                into the god damn cia. 

                          luther 
                what are we downloading? 

                          ethan 
                information. 

                          luther 
                what kind? 

                          ethan 
                profitable. 

                          claire 
                payment on delivery. 

                          luther 
                i don't know.  this i don't know. 

                          ethan
                this doesn't sound like the luther 
                stickell i've heard of.  what'd they used 
                to call you?  the net ranger?  phineas 
                phreak?  the only man alive who actually 
                hacked nato ghostcom. 

                          luther 
                there was never any physical evidence 
                that i had anything to do with that.. 
                that.. 
                     (correcting himself) 
                with that exceptional piece of work. 

                          ethan 
                you don't know what you're missing. this 
                is the mt. everest of hacks. 

                          luther 
                you're all kidding yourselves. even with 
                top of the line crypto.  cray access. 
                stu 3's -- 

                          claire 
                krieger can get it. 
                     (to krieger) 
                right? 

                          krieger 
                may take a little time. 

                          ethan
                may take a little time. that's not what 
                claire tells me about you. 

                          luther 
                thinking machine laptops, i'm talking 
                about the 686 prototypes -- with the 
                artificial intelligence risk chip -- 

     ethan looks at krieger. 

                          krieger 
                twenty-four hours. 

     ethan looks back at luther.  luther thinks. 

                          luther 
                and i get to keep the equipment when 
                we're done. 

                          ethan 
                luther, i guess you're all out of 
                excuses.

                          luther 
                i can't just hack my way inside.  there's 
                no modem access to the mainframe, it's in 
                a stand-alone.  i'd have to be physically 
                at the terminal. 

                          ethan 
                luther, relax, it's worse than you think. 
                the terminal's in black vault lock-down.
