     ethan runs towards the getaway car, reaching a vantage point
     on the top of the stairs, he can see claireís outline,
     visible in the driverís seat.  but as he descends the stairs

     --the car explodes and bursts into flames.

     the force of the blast knocks ethan back.

     he watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment, a 
     stunned crowd starts to gather.

     remembering sarah, he rushes down the stairs towards the
     embankment.
