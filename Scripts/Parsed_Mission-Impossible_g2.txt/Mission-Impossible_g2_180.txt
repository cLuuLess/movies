     max is reading the financial times.  matthias is looking out
     of the window.  a cellular phone rings inside maxís briefcase
     in front of matthias.  matthias takes the phone out.

                          matthias
                yes...
                     (holds phone out for max)
                itís him.

                          max
                     (into phone) 
                this wasnít what we discussed.

                          ethan (o.s.)
                     (on phone) 
                my apologies max.  couldnít be helped.
                thereís a piece of black cloth under your
                seat.  tear it away and youíll find the
                disk.

     max reaches down and does as instructed, finding the computer
     disk as promised.  she hands it to matthias who strips off
     the velcro covering and slots it into the drive next to the
     computer in the briefcase.  he boots it up quickly and turns
     the briefcase containing the computer toward max for her to
     see.

     one half of the screen, with the heading "cryptonym and
     operational specs" is already jammed with information.  the
     blank second half of the screen acquires the title "true
     name," and information starts filling itself in rapidly --
     names, addresses, identities.

     as the two sides match up, a legend flashes:

                identity match

                          max
                     (back into phone) 
                ha, dear boy!  i do hope this doesnít
                prelude a meeting in private.

                          ethan (o.s.)
                it doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you
                tell me where the money is.

                          max
                the possibility alone is worth ten
                million.  baggage car, rack 3.  silver
                briefcase.  combination 314.

                          ethan (o.s.)
                what about job?

                          max
                i wouldnít worry about him.  once youíve
                got the money -- heíll find you.
