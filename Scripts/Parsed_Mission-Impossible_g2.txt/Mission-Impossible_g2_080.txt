     int. safe house - night

     he comes back into the living room. still drinking, he 
     notices flickering lights on the other side of the room, the 
     static from the four monitors phelps was watching.  one by 
     one, he switches them off. 

     the laptop 

     jack had been using lies closed at his abandoned desk.  ethan 
     wakes it up. 
        
     the computer emits a dial tone, then static as it hits its 
     connection.  it prompts ethan along: 

                select usenet group

     ethan types in 

                job 314

                          ethan
                job.  job 3:14.  march fourteen.  job 31 
                march. 

     the computer replies: 

                searching string not found

     ethan tries again: 

                max.com

     the answer: 

                search string not found

     he tries a few more, quickly -- "job," "jobs," "joblist.com," 
     but nothing comes up.  he tries something else -- "scroll 
     usenet groups."  

     the computer scrolls names of bulletin boards at a dizzying 
     speed, by the hundreds.  that's not going anywhere. 

     ethan pauses, slaking his bottomless thirst and trying to 
     figure out what permutation of "job 314" he should add to the 
     others on his computer screen.  he mumbles. 

                          ethan 
                job three fourteen.  job --
                     (a realization, 
                     the biblical pronunciation) 
                it's job! 

     he rummages around on the desk, checks the bookshelf and 
     finds a gideon bible.  he turns to job 3:14 and reads the 
     bible passage "kings and counsellors..." 

     he thinks for another moment, then punches back into the 
     internet and under the command "select usenet group" he 
     types: 

                bible

     the computer replies: 

                126 entries found, specify group

     ethan: 

                book of job

     the computer presents a multi-colored screen of religious 
     icons and artwork with an accompanying message: 

                welcome to the book of job discussion 
                group.  which chapter and verse do 
                you wish to post your entry under?

     ethan types his answer "job 3:14" and the screen presents a 
     "stickie" for him to write his message on.  he does: 

                          ethan 
                max -- goods tainted.  consider extremely 
                hazardous.  do not use.  fate will be 
                that of kings and counsellors who built 
                for themselves palaces now lying in 
                ruins.  must meet to discuss a.s.a.p. 

     angle

     a rhythmic crunching sound and from the darkness on the other 
     side of the room, phelps staggers toward him, wet and muddy, 
     his middle a hopelessly bloody mess.  he looks like he's 
     dying on his feet.  ethan freezes, appalled. 

                          phelps
                ethan, what are you doing? 

     ethan tries to speak but nothing will come out. 

                          phelps (cont'd) 
                i needed you, ethan. 1 needed you on the 
                bridge, and -- you weren't there.  ethan? 
                ethan? 

     ethan reaches out to grab phelps but can't seem to touch him. 
     phelps suddenly vanishes into thin air, ethan awakens from 
     the dream and finds himself leaping to his feet, gun cocked 
     and pointed at -- 

     angle

     it's claire. 

                          ethan 
                what are you doing here?! 

     claire freezes, her hands half-raised. 

                          claire 
                     (carefully) 
                ethan -- ethan, it's okay.  it's claire. 
                ethan what's wrong with you? 

                          ethan 
                don't move. 

     her right hand has moved a fraction.  she freezes again. 

                          ethan 
                you were in the car! 

                          claire 
                i wasn't.  i heard that jim was in 
                trouble on the radio.  he said someone 
                was... 

                          ethan 
                shut up!  i saw you.  you were in the 
                car. 

                          claire 
                no, i got out of the car and i ran to the
                bridge. 

                          ethan 
                don't give me that!  i was on the bridge. 

                          claire 
                what happened to jim? 

                          ethan 
                there was nobody on the bridge. 

                          claire 
                what happened to jim? 

     ethan grabs her wrists, shouting. 

                          ethan 
                dead.  dead.  dead!  wake up, claire! 
                jim's dead, they're dead.  they're all 
                dead! 

     ethan releases her wrists. 

                          claire 
                     (mumbling) 
                they're dead.  jim's dead. 

                          ethan
                take off your coat. 

                          claire 
                what? 

                          ethan 
                take off your god damn coat! 

     he grabs a sleeve and literally tears the coat off her, half- 
     spinning her around.  the coat hits the floor like a dead 
     body.  claire's instinctive move is to cover her chest. 

     claire begins to shiver.  ethan circles her, runs his hand 
     cursorily across her body.  it accentuates claire's 
     shivering. 

                          ethan (cont'd) 
                where were you? 

                          claire 
                i walked away.  he said abort.  he was 
                gone so i walked away. 

                          ethan 
                that was four hours ago!  who sent you? 
                did they send you here? 

                          claire 
                     (slowly) 
                who is "they?" 

                          ethan 
                did they send you...did they send you? 

                          claire 
                who is they, who is they? 

        ethan grabs her by the wrists. 

                          ethan 
                who sent you?!  who sent you? 

                          claire 
                     (screaming) 
                no one sent me!  we're supposed to be 
                back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, 
                if we abort, we don't return here until 
                four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, 
                four o'clock --! 

     she sags.  a moment.  then the clock begins to chime -- bong, 
     bong, bong, bong.  in the wake of the bells' reverb, ethan 
     releases his grip on her wrists.
