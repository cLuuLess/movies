     int. elevator shaft - night                               

     jack climbs up the elevator shaft, towards the gray metal 
     box.  he just begins to remove the cover when he hears a 
     noise from above.  he looks up and sees the elevator above 
     him descending. 

     jack quickly pulls himself flush against the wall. the 
     elevator comes down adjacent to him and stops, pinning him 
     to the wall. 

                          jack 
                great.  come on.
