     int. business car/tunnel - moving - day

     kittridge comes back into the business car and is joined by 
     barnes.  luther, only slightly bruised, stands up next to 
     them and gestures to max and her laptop. 

                          luther
                i think this is what you're looking for. 

     max looks up, stunned.  kittridge leans over and peers at her 
     screen. he just smiles and sits down next to her, content to 
     wait for her to speak. 

     when she finally does, she's almost charming. 

                          max 
                my lawyers will have a field day with 
                this.  entrapment, jurisdictional 
                conflicts -- 

     kittridge leans closer to her and lowers his voice, just as 
     friendly. 

                          kittridge 
                maybe we'll just keep the courts out of 
                this one. 

                          max 
                i'm sure we can find something i have 
                that you need. 

                          kittridge 
                you know, i would love to try.
