     ethan's ear receiver whispers ever-so-slightly.  he reaches 
     out, to the upside down keyboard, cranes his head to see it
     and starts typing, softly. 

     the computer hums, activated.  ethan unbuttons his pocket, 
     withdraws a 3.5 disk and slides it gently into the floppy 
     drive. 

     the computer accepts it with a soft whir.  ethan winces, even 
     that soft sound is deafening in these circumstances.  

     but no alarms go off.
