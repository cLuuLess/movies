     int. elevator shaft (above elevator) - night

     on top of the elevator, jack has ripped open the control
     panel again and is frantically trying to adjust wires to get
     the thing to stop.

     he swears, his fingers fumble, he works faster and faster.
     he looks up.  the roof of the building is nearly upon him.
        
                          ethan (o.s.)
                come on, jack, come on.

     jack looks up again, he cringes, he covers his head with his
     hands, he screams --

     --and he√≠s crushed to death against the roof.
