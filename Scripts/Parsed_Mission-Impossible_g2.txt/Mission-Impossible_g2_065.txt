     ext. embankment - night

     sarah comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees
     golitsyn again, slowing down.  a man comes out of the fog an
     seems to ask golitsyn for a light.

     sarah draws closer.  behind her, the drunken couple seems to
     be hanging with her for some reason.
