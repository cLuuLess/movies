     int. fire truck - day

     luther is in the belly of the fire truck with a ton of 
     equipment -- three laptops, a bundle of phone cable, a mini- 
     dish antenna, a cellular phone, several thick phone company 
     manuals with names like "cosmos" and "switched access 
     service." 

     one laptop serves as a visco monitor, showing a video image 
     in which luther watches ethan's point of view of the stubborn 
     guard, who's finishing his sentence. 
        
                          guard 
                     (on screen) 
                --and it did not go off in twenty-one! 

     luther turns to a screen on another computer and searches 
     through a complex facilities menu. 

                          luther 
                     (mouths) 
                twenty-one, twenty-one --

     he finds what he's looking for and double clicks on it.  a 
     red box on his screen lights up --
