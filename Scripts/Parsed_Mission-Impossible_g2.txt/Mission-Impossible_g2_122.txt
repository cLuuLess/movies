     int. duct - day                                              

     in the duct, ethan signals to krieger, making a triangle of 
     his hands.  krieger wriggles forward and hands him a multi- 
     sided, pyramid shaped glass object.  

     ethan raises the pyramid and intercepts a portion of one of 
     the laser net's beams. the pyramid glows and we realise what 
     it is -- a prism. 

     the laser beam now captive in the prism, ethan carefully 
     moves it out of the centre of the ventilator shaft and 
     directs it toward another prism, clearing a path through the 
     shaft.
