     int. cia computer room - day

     -- the secured terminal room.  it's not large but it's 
     impressive.  a single terminal is bolted into the middle of 
     the floor and the glass and tile walls of the room overlook 
     computer storage towers. 

                          ethan (v.o.) 
                the first system is sound-sensitive, 
                anything above a whisper sets it off. 
                the second system is on the floor and 
                pressure-sensitive --

     the analyst closes the vault door behind him and walks across 
     the room.  as he walks, the floor tiles light up under his 
     feet, turning off again when he lifts the weight from them. 

                          ethan (v.o.) 
                --and the third detects any increase in 
                temperature.  even the body heat of an 
                unauthorized person in the room will 
                trigger it. 

     a thermometer on the wall shows the temperature is 72 
     degrees.  the analyst sets his glass down, boots up the 
     computer, and starts entering data from the file folders. 

                          ethan (v.o.) 
                all three systems are state of the art. 
                
     the analyst turns and takes a sip of his iced tea.  a drop of 
     condensation runs down the glass and hits the floor. when it 
     makes contact, the floor panel lights up.
