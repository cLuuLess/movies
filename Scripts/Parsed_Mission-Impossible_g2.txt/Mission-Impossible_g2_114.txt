     int. cia cafeteria - day 

     claire, carrying a cup of coffee and a muffin, looks for a 
     spot among the tables in the cafeteria of the headquarters 
     building. 

     she sees a man sitting alone, reading a newspaper.  it's the 
     man whose picture she looked at in the storage room.  she 
     sits next to him. 

     he looks up and gives her an acknowledging half smile, then 
     goes back to his paper. 

     he turns to pick up the paper and in the moment he is facing 
     the other way, claire pulls out a small vial resembling a 
     perfume sampler.  she dumps the clear liquid contents into 
     his coffee.  he turns back and hands her part of the paper. 
     claire smiles. 

     coffee man drinks up.  claire stares at his shoulder 
     strangely.  he notices. 

     she reaches out and flicks something off his shoulder blade. 

     he smiles.  but she hasn't flicked something off his shoulder 
     blade, she's flicked something onto it -- a little piece of 
     shiny gray metallic tape.  claire leaves the table. coffee 
     man drinks up and leaves the table.
