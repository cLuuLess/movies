     int. safe house - later the same night

     ethan sits in front of the computer, staring blankly at it, 
     still waiting for a response.  claire sitting on the end of 
     the bed.  dawn approaches, it's very, very quiet. 

                          claire 
                why haven't they brought us in yet? 

                          ethan
                i've been disavowed.  they think i killed 
                jim and everyone else.  somehow a hundred 
                thousand dollars found its way into my 
                parents' bank account.  kittridge assumes 
                i'm a mole they've been tracing and i've 
                been in the employ of an arms dealer, 
                max, for the last two years, to get him 
                our noc list. 

     a long moment while she stares at ethan's back. 

                          claire 
                what are you going to do? 

                          ethan 
                i'm going to get it for him.  whoever the 
                mole is, i think goes by the name of job, 
                at least part of the time. 1 can't find 
                him, but if he knows 1 have the noc list, 
                he'll find me. 
                
                          claire 
                ethan, you're not making sense. let me 
                go in and talk to kittridge. i'm going 
                to tell him you had nothing to do... 

                          ethan
                claire, claire, claire, if you're not 
                dead, he's going to assume you're with 
                me. 

     the computer blinks and makes a noise - ethan goes to it. 

     the computer screen

     blinking -- "message waiting."  ethan hurries over and clicks 
     on the message box.  the screen blinks and the message shows 
     up: 

     ?        job - corner of nekazanka and prlkopy one p.m. 

     ?        buy a packet of dunhill 

     ?        and ask the man sitting on the bus 

     ?        stop bench for a match

     claire looks to ethan. 

                          claire 
                the message is for job. 

                          ethan
                i'm going to answer it.
