     int. an elevator shaft - night

     jack, wearing black coveralls and slightly odd-looking 
     eyeglasses (they're called visco glasses), enters an elevator 
     shaft through a small door at the base of the wall.  he looks 
     up the shaft, shining a flashlight until he finds what he's 
     looking for -- 

     -- a gray metal box, protruding from the wall one floor up.
