     ext. street -- phone booth - night

     ethan unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver.  heís
     holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it, a 
     modernist cockroach.  he clicks the cockroach into the guts
     of the phoneís wiring, piercing it with its little prongs.

     he screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phoneís tongue
     down for a second, releases it and listens.  he has a dial
     tone.  now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by
     heart.

     after a moment, a flat voice comes on the other side.

                          flat voice (o.s.)
                satcom seven.

                          ethan
                central europe.  unsecured.

                          flat voice (o.s.)
                designator?

                          ethan
                bravo echo one one.

                          flat voice (o.s.)
                switching.

     there is a long pause and then familiar voice comes on the
     line.

                          kittridge (o.s.)
                this is kittridge.

                          ethan
                go secure.

     pause.  a funny series of clicks comes over the line.      
        
                          kittridge (o.s.)
                go ahead.

                          ethan
                theyíre dead.

                          kittridge (o.s.)
                whoís dead?

                          ethan
                my team.  claire, jack, even jim -
                - hannah, maybe, i -- donít know
        
                          kittridge (o.s.)
                are you damaged?

                          ethan
                they knew we were coming.  golitsynís
                dead too.  the disk is gone.

                          kittridge (o.s.)
                are you intact?

                          ethan
                do you read me?  the list is in the open!

                          kittridge (o.s.)
                let's just bring you in safely, and then
                we'll worry about that, okay?  were you
                followed?

     ethan closes his eyes.  kittridgeís voice is strong and
     reassuring and he needs that right now.

                          ethan
                i donít think so.

                          kittridge (o.s.)
                donít think, be sure.  are you clean?

                          ethan
                yes.

                          kittridge (o.s.)
                location green.  one hour.  iíll be there
                myself.

                          ethan
                youíre in prague?

                          kittridge (o.s.)
                heard a lot about you, hunt.  donít
                disappoint me.

                          ethan
                no sir.

                          kittridge (o.s.)
                one hour.

     he hangs up.  ethan does the same.  he stares at the phone
     for a moment, thinking.  he checks his watch.
