     int. communications room - day 

     kittridge, barnes, and their staff are hard at work, 
     photographs and biographical data of ethan on various 
     computer and television screens around the room.  kittridge 
     leans back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. 

                          barnes 
                what i want to know is how hunt accessed 
                the disavowed file, even after we cut off 
                his authorization code. 

                          agent lowden/agent 
                          marek 
                he may have used phelps' code. they were 
                friends, and phelps, was still valid for 
                twenty-four hours.  

                          barnes 
                if that's the case, we need to implement 
                a system to immediately deactivate an 
                agent's code immediately... 

        kittridge brings his chair legs down on the floor with a 
        bang. 

                          kittridge 
                i can't believe what i'm listening to. 
                hunt just kicked us in the ass, you guys 
                are standing here trying to figure out 
                what kind of shoes he had on!  i don't
                care how he did it, i want to know why he 
                did it!  is he recruiting?  for what 
                purpose? 

     from somewhere in the building, an alarm sounds, not too loud 
     in here. 

                          agent pat/agent 
                          lowden 
                survival. 

     the alarm get louder as it goes off in another part of the 
     building. 

                          kittridge
                too short sighted.  this guy's proactive,
                he initiates.  the question is what does 
                he want now and where does he need to get 
                it and barnes what the hell is that
                noise?! 

     an agent is just coming in from the hallway. 

                          agent 
                fire alarm, gene. 

                          kittridge 
                oh, for -- do we have to evacuate? 

                          barnes
                that's s.o.p.. 

                          kittridge 
                s.o.p..
