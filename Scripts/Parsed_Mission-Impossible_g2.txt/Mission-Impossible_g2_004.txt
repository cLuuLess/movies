     phelps sits back in his seat, closes his eyes, and rubs his 
     tired brow.  kittridge himself comes back on the tape. 

                          kittridge (o.s.) 
                as always, should you or any member of 
                your im force be caught or killed, the 
                secretary will disavow all knowledge of 
                your actions.  this tape will self- 
                destruct in five seconds.  good luck, 
                jim! 

     phelps inhales deeply -- 

     -- the tape in the armrest starts to smolder, sending up a 
     plume of wispy smoke -- 

     -- and phelps exhales, concealing the plume in a cloud of 
     cigarette smoke.
