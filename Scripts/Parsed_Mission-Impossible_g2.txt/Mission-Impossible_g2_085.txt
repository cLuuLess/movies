     ext. max's apartment - balcony - day

     the other man comes out on the balcony.  nothing out here but 
     a beautiful day.  he walks to the railing and looks down at 
     the street. 

     down below, the dog that's still barking is tied to a street 
     sign.  woof.  woof.  woof.  abruptly, it stops.
