                i don't know, ethan. suppose you tell me? 

     click.  ethan has hung up.  kittridge looks hopefully to the 
     technician who says: 

                          barnes 
                lost him.  we needed three more seconds. 

     surprisingly kittridge is not as upset as he is puzzled. 

                          kittridge 
                he wanted us to know he was in london. 

     clearly that's the question that kittridge is turning over in 
     his mind and he doesn't have a simple answer to it.
