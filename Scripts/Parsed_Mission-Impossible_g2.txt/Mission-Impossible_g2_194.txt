     ext. roof of train - day

     -- halfway out onto the roof of the train.  he reaches into 
     his jacket pocket and pulls out a suction cup with a handle 
     on the end of it.  he smacks the suction cup down on the roof 
     and pulls himself the rest of the way out. 

     he pulls out a second suction cup and smacks it down on the 
     smooth surface of the train. 

     now for the tough part.  using the suction cups, phelps 
     slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and 
     replanting the cups as he goes.  

     he drags himself over the length of the final car, to the 
     back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply, 
     a window for the engineer. 

     half kneeling on the roof, phelps pulls out the clip from his 
     belt.

     he looks up, scanning the sky behind the train.  from out 
     of the fog, a helicopter approaches. 

     phelps turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is 
     going.  in the distance, he can see the chunnel approaching 
     the tunnel under the english channel.  his eyes widen.
