     ext. stairs to bridge - night

     ethan checks his monitor again.

     the monitor

     phelps√≠ point of view changes radically as his head swivels
     on the darkened bridge.  he whirls again, looking over his
     shoulder and this time the barrel of a gun is visible,
     pointing at him and before phelps has a chance to react a
     gunshot crackles over the monitor.

     the point of view goes crazy for a moment, then over and down
     to a bloody hole in his own chest.

     his head rocks again, then goes over the side of the bridge
     and makes the long, hard fall into the river below.
