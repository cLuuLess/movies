     int. shabby room - night

     we enter the room for the first time as the waitress does. 
     she's carrying a tray with a bottle of vodka and two shot 
     glasses. 

                          anatoly 
                now, we drink. 

     he pours them out and hands one to kasimov. 

                          anatoly (cont'd) 
                to friends. 

                          kasimov 
                yes, anatoly, yes. 

                          jack 
                cheers. 

     he drinks.  he blinks.  something felt funny about that. 
     dizzied, kasimov swoons and passes out on the floor. anatoly 
     moves to the closet door and opens it. 

     in the closet 

     anatoly reaches up to his face --

     --and tears away a mask of flesh.  he's no middle aged 
     russian mobster, he's ethan hunt, an american in his early 
     thirties.  he gestures to kasimov contemptuously.  jack hands 
     ethan a hypodermic kit and he goes quickly back into the 
     room. 

                          ethan 
                     (in english now) 
                get rid of this scum. 

     immediately, there is activity, and people everywhere.  two 
     others come into the room and carry kasimov out. 

     ethan goes quickly to the body of the dead woman. he cheeks 
     the pulse in her neck, shines a penlight in her eye. he 
     strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the 
     dead woman's thigh.  he checks her pulse again, checking a 
     stopwatch.  in about ten seconds, the woman's eyes open. 

     claire is her name, a french woman of thirty or so. she half 
     rolls over, groans, and wipes some of the blood from her 
     mouth. 

                          claire 
                did we get it? 

                          ethan 
                we got it.  on your feet. 

                          claire 
                i want to sleep.  can i sleep here. 

                          ethan 
                walk, just walk.  start walking. 

                          claire 
                i'm walking. 

                          ethan 
                talking's good, walking's better. 

                          claire 
                sleeping's better. 

     meanwhile, men in overalls take apart the room.  the ceiling 
     lifts right off the walls, and the walls themselves start to 
     come down, revealing the "hotel room" to be an elaborate set 
     in the middle of an empty warehouse. 

     jack comes into the room from the closet.  he hands claire 
     her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ethan 
     stops what he's doing, noticing.  she looks up at him 
     questioningly. 

                          claire 
                are you all right ethan.  what's wrong
                with you? 

                          ethan 
                if you're gonna do this again claire, 
                it's not gonna be on my watch. 

                          claire 
                oh yeah? 

     jack comes into the room from the closet.  he hands claire 
     her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ethan 
     stops what he's doing, noticing.  she looks up at him, 
     questioningly. 

                          jack 
                claire. 

                          ethan 
                jack. 

     she almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her 
     finger.  ethan notices.  he turns and shouts to the room at 
     large. 

                          ethan
                is there any particular reason we're not 
                out of here yet?! 

                          jack 
                just waiting for you, tubs. 

     he walks across the room and out the door.  claire, worried, 
     clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding 
     ring. 

     we move in on it --

                                                            cut to:
