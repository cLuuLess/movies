     int. embassy party - night

     sarah still has the senator's attention. 

                          sarah 
                your advance team mentioned you'd want a 
                tour of the facility, so i've gone ahead 
                and set that up for you -- 

                          senator waltzer 
                terrific.  let's get going. 
                     (to the diplomat) 
                will you excuse us?  

     he slips an arm around sarah and they walk off, not into the 
     party, but the other way, toward a staircase that leads 
     further into the embassy. 

                          diplomat 
                uh, sir?
