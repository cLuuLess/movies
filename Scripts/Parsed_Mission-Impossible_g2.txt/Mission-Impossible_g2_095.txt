     int. max's apartment - day

     kittridge waits on the balcony for his agents to complete 
     their search.  harry barnes, a middle-aged, gray suited, 
     somewhat gray-faced bureaucrat, comes to join kittridge. 

                          kittridge 
                the man's gone black, barnes.  he's under 
                until he decides to surface. 

                          barnes 
                look we can use someone from the embassy 
                and we can get the local authorities 
                involved. close off his transportation. 

                          kittridge 
                what can we do, barnes?  put a guy at the 
                airport?  how many identities do you 
                think hunt has?  how many times has he 
                slipped past custom, in how many 
                countries?  these guys are trained to be 
                ghosts.  we taught them how to do it, for 
                christ's sake! 

                          barnes 
                so what do you suggest? 

                          kittridge 
                let's not waste time chasing him.  make 
                him come to us.  everybody√≠s got pressure 
                points.  find out something that's 
                important to him personally and you 
                squeeze. 

                                                            cut to:
