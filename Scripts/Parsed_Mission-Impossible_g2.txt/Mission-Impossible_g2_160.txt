     int. cia - communications room - day                           

     in the communications room, tempers are running a little 
     high.  kittridge is on his feet, berating his staff. 

                          kittridge 
                think, for christ's sake, you guys are 
                mired in detail, open your minds, it's 
                gotta be staring us in the face!  what 
                does ethan hunt want?! 

                          barnes 
                same thing he wanted in prague!  same 
                thing he's always wanted!  the noc list! 

                          kittridge 
                okay! 

     now it's coming together in kittridge's mind and a horrible 
     thought occurs to him. 

                          kittridge (cont'd) 
                and where is the list vulnerable? 

     there is nervous silence for a moment.  behind kittridge, on 
     the other side of the room, the phone starts to ring. 

     an agent gets up to answer it as a creeping fear pervades the 
     room. 

                          kittridge (cont'd) 
                     (joking) 
                other than here. 

     nervous laughter goes around the table.  it fades.  on the 
     other side of the room, the agent who answered the phone 
     turns, receiver in hand, face ashen. 

     he holds the phone out to kittridge, terrified, the bearer of 
     extremely bad news. 

     they all turn slowly and look at him.  he holds the phone out 
     to kittridge, shaking slightly. 

                          agent 
                it's for you. 

                          kittridge 
                kittridge, yup? 

                                                            cut to:
