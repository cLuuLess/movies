     int. the denied area/elevator bank - night

     ignoring the guard, sarah turns and slides her thumb into the 
     thumbprint analyzer once more.  the panel glows, this time 
     the message flashes -- 

                          identity confirmed 

     -- and the elevator doors slide open briskly.  

     the guard, surprised, now catches sight of the senator. 

                          guard 
                oh. sorry, sir. 

     he snaps a salute.  ethan and sarah get into the elevator and 
     the doors close behind them.
