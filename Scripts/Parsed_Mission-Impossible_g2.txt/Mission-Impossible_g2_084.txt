     int. max's apartment - day

     the black hood still on his head, ethan has trouble sitting 
     upright.  he's before a desk, in an apartment somewhere in 
     the city -- it's impossible to tell where, as the blinds are 
     drawn.  the place is roomy and lavishly furnished -- 
     expensive oriental rugs, well-chosen objects of art. 

     somewhere down the block, a dog barks, steadily, every few 
     seconds. in the hallway outside the apartment door, someone 
     is vacuuming.  matthias and the other man are nearby. 

                          ethan
                i thought i was going to see max. 

                          matthias 
                you misunderstood.  no one sees max. 

                          ethan 
                then what am i doing here? 

                          matthias 
                allowing max to see you and hear what 
                you've got to say. 

                          ethan 
                i don't communicate very well through a 
                shroud. 

                          matthias 
                if max doesn't like what you have to say, 
                you'll be wearing that shroud 
                indefinitely. 

                          ethan 
                i'm willing to take the chance. 

                          matthias 
                very well. 

     max's figure into frame.  matthias removes ethan's hood. 
     when it comes off ethan finds himself looking up at a tall 
     woman of indeterminate age.  she's handsome to the point of 
     severity. 

                          max 
                who are you and what are you doing here? 
                          
                          ethan 
                i need one hundred thousand dollars. 

                          max
                really?  and you thought if you simply 
                showed up i might give it to you? 

                          ethan 
                why not?  you gave job a hundred and 
                twenty five thousand. 

                          max 
                the penny drops.  you are not job.  yes, 
                job is not given to quoting scripture in 
                his communications. and there was its 
                tone -- aggressive but playful.  job is 
                not playful.  so you're something of a 
                paradox. 

                          ethan 
                that depends. 

                          max
                on what? 

                          ethan 
                whether you like a paradox.  i want a 
                hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 

                          max
                it's quite out of the question. 

                          ethan 
                the disk job sold you is worthless.  it's 
                bait, part of an internal molehunt. 

                          max
                and how might you know that?  are you 
                another company man? 

                          ethan 
                like job? 

                          max 
                ah, but, we're asking about you. 

                          ethan
                i'm noc.  was.  now disavowed. 

                          max 
                why, may i ask? 

                          ethan
                that's the question i want to ask job. 

                          max 
                i don't know job any more than he knows 
                me. 

                          ethan 
                even so, i'm sure you could arrange an 
                introduction. 

                          max 
                why should i? 

                          ethan 
                because i can deliver the actual noc 
                list.  the one you have is not only 
                worthless, it's certain to be equipped 
                with a homing device to pinpoint your 
                exact location. 

                          max 
                it's easy to say the disk is worthless 
                when you say i can't look at the 
                information and see if it's worthless. 
                not a tenable position, sir. 

                          ethan 
                okay, boot it up and in anywhere from 
                thirty seconds to ten minutes you're 
                gonna have virginia farm boys hopping 
                around you like jackrabbits. 

                          max 
                     (pause.) 
                mm - hmmm... 

                          ethan
                tell you what.  how good's the rf scanner 
                you used in the car? 

                          max 
                very good. 

                          ethan 
                okay, use it.  but i suggest pack up 
                first. 

     angle

     matthias boots up.  there's a little musical noise and the 
     screen brightens.  the computer whirs and clicks and a 
     complex list of names, addresses, phone numbers and other 
     personal information scrolls by.  but matthias is watching 
     the digital read-out on the rf scanner. 

                          matthias 
                twenty-six, twenty-seven.  so far so 
                good. 

                          max 
                that's not so good for you, my friend. 

     on the scanner, the digital read-out is now in the thirties. 

                          matthias 
                thirty-two and change. 

                          max 
                     (to ethan) 
                doesn't mean it's a signal.  could just 
                be the hard drive heating up. 

     she looks from the scanner to ethan as if she's trying to 
     make up her mind about something. 

                          matthias 
                forty-four.  forty-five. 

                          ethan 
                i'd say you've got about two minutes. 

     max still doubts it. the other man goes to the windows -- 

     --nothing happens. he opens the french doors that lead out 
     onto a balcony.
