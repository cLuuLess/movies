     int. cia - computer room - day                               

     the technician enters the room and shuts the door.  he sees 
     the knife, picks it up, looks at it and then puts it down. 
     he resumes his work at the computer but when he punches up 
     his program, something prints out on his screen.  its header: 

                keystroke log -- file download 
                    11/18/95 9.58 am

     and it goes on.  the technician's eyes widen in disbelief. 
     he spins back in his chair and reaches for the nearest 
     telephone.
