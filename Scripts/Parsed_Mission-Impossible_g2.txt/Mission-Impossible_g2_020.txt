     int. elevator shaft - night

     jack is still pinned to the wall by the elevator, listening 
     to their conversation. 

                          phelps (o.s.) 
                jack's pinned down sarah.  should be a 
                second.  keep dancing.  

                          ethan (o.s.) 
                     (with the senator's southern accent) 
                we were forced to tie him to my best 
                stallion and drag him around the barn a 
                few times.  

     finally, the elevator moves down a floor and jack is freed. 

                          jack 
                relax your crack, foghorn, i'm workin' on
                it. 

     he quickly opens the gray metal box, revealing a maze of 
     circuitry.  he patches in his computer, climbs on top of the 
     elevator, and hits the keyboard, beginning to download.

     the laptop

     there's a split-screen of sarah's thumbprint and the id 
     picture.  jack downloads her file into the security computer.
