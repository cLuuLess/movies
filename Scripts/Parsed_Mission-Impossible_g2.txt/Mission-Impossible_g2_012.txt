     int. embassy - night

     inside the embassy, the party is a formal, tuxedoed affair 
     that's in full swing on the second floor. 

     senator waltzer, the man who was on tv, walks up a grand 
     staircase, headed in.  an american diplomat in a tuxedo 
     hurries up to him. 

                          diplomat 
                how do you do, senator, i'm rand housman, 
                the ambassador's aide.  if i could just 
                steer you through the reception line here
                --

     the diplomat pilots the senator by one arm, guiding him to a 
     reception line at the base of the stairs to the party. 

                          diplomat (cont'd) 
                allow me to introduce jaroslav reid, the 
                director of the national gallery -- petr 
                brandl, the mayor of prague -- 

     sarah, a very attractive young american dressed in an elegant 
     gown, steps out of the reception line and shakes hands with 
     waltzer. 

                          sarah 
                i bet you don't remember me, do you, senator? 

                          senator waltzer 
                of course i do.  how are you, miss 
                norman? 

     he leans in and kisses her on the cheek, and as he does so 
     sarah whispers something in his ear. 

                          sarah 
                he's in pocket.  under the archway behind me. 

     her tone, her words -- we realize she's on the team. 

     the senator pulls a pair of visco glasses from his pocket 
     (and if we didn't know the senator was ethan before, this 
     confirms it), puts them on, and looks up, over her shoulder. 

     under an archway near the entrance, 

     aleksander golitsyn, the ukrainian, has just come in from 
     outside.
