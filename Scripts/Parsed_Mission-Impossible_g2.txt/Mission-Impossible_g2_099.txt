     int. cia corridor/guard station - day

     while ethan talks, we see what he's referring to: 

     a cia analyst carrying a glass of iced tea and several file 
     folders walks down a long corridor in the headquarters 
     building.  he comes to an impressive guard station and rests 
     his chin on a strange-looking optometric device. 

                          ethan (v.o.) 
                they missed nothing in that room.  even 
                the vents have laser nets over them.  

     apparently the device approves and the analyst is buzzed into 
     a "restricted" area of the building.
