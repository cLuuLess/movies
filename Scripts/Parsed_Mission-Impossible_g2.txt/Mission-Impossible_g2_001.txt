     int. kiev apartment - night

     we're in a large closet.  jack kiefer, an athletic american
     in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a
     corner, staring at a television screen.

     the television shows a surveillance view of the living room
     that lies outside the confines of the closet.  the tv image
     is in black and white.  jack shifts, trying like hell to get
     comfortable but he's been there a while

     on the screen

     a bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel
     room.  directly under the blub a man, gennady kasimov, sits
     in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained t-
     shirt.  there are a couple of thugs and a stray hooker in the
     room behind him.  a legend:

                          kiev

     kasimov is sobbing.  uncontrollably.  a man enters the room,
     anatoly, an imperious russian in his forties, a russian
     godfather.  the thugs and hookers are ushered out.  anatoly
     looks down at kasimov pitiously and urges him to go and sit
     by him in a chair he picks up for him.  kasimov does as he is
     bid, looking gratefully up at anatoly.  they speak in russian
     which is subtitled.

                          anatoly
                kasimov, kasimov, good that you called
                us.

                          kasimov
                     (sobbing)
                i don't remember what happened!  we were
                at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having
                fun.

     anatoly gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the
     room.  a woman lies half under the sheets.  she's lying in an
     unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared
     with blood.  she's dead.  anatoly lifts her eyelid.

                          kasimov
                i don't even know how i got here.
                i swear, anatoly, i never touched her!  i
                didn't lay a finger on her.

     anatoly moves away from the woman.

                          anatoly
                kasimov.  don't flounder.

     in the closet

     jack, impatient, checks his watch. 

                          jack 
                jesus, she's been under too long.  come 
                on, come on! 

     on the screen 

                          kasimov 
                you're the only one who can help me. 

     desperately he tugs at anatoly's jacket.  but anatoly hits 
     his hand away and smacks him around the head. 

     in the closet 

     jack reacts. 

     on the screen

     anatoly bends close to kasimov. 

                          anatoly 
                c'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. 

                          kasimov 
                they'll kill me. 

     anatoly paces up the room, away from kasimov. 

                          anatoly 
                you asked for my help.  you asked for my
                help...come on... 

                          kasimov
                you're right, of course. 

     in the closet 

     jack leans forward. 

                          jack 
                the name pal...give us the name. 

     on the screen 

                          kasimov 
                the contact in minsk..the contact in 
                minsk..works in a travel agency. 

     in the closet 

                          jack 
                come on! 

     on the screen 

                          anatoly 
                come on! 

                          kasimov 
                his name is.....dimitri miediev. 

                          anatoly 
                dimitri miediev...dimitri miediev... 

     in the closet 

                          jack 
                got him. 

     on the screen 

     back on screen, anatoly places a hand on kasimov's shoulder
     as if he had just anointed him. 

     in the closet 

     in the closet, jack types the name into a computer and cross 
     checks -- "miediev" comes up, then "posting/american 
     consulate/kiev." 

     jack turns and nods to a whorehouse waitress in costume in 
     the closet next to him, dressed in traditional russian tunic 
     and virtually no bottom.  she quickly leaves.
