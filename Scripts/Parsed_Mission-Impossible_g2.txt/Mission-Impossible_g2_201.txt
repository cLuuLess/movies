     int. business car/tunnel - moving - day

     as the train roars into the tunnel, the business car goes 
     nearly dark and the message on max's computer screen changes 
     one last time.  this time it says: 

                connection terminated. 
                    transfer lost.

     max's face falls. 

                          max
                damn!
