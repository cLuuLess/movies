     int. cia computer room - day                                      

     with a strange look on his face, the technician looks up. 
     it's almost as if he senses ethan above him but instead -- 

                          technician 
                oh, god. 

     -- he vomits.  

     he reaches for the garbage can and upchucks again.  puzzled, 
     sick and feeling another wave coming on, he drags himself to 
     his feet, hauls himself across the room and leaves.
