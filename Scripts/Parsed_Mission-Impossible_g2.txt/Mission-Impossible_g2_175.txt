     int. london safe house - claireís room - night

     the door to claire's room in the safe house opens, throwing a
     shaft of light over her form.  ethan creeps in and closes the
     door behind him.

     it is approximately one a.m. .  claire is huddled in the
     corner.  ethan enters and stands looking at her.

                          claire
                what happened?

                          ethan
                  (walks towards her)
                i sent the message to max.  weíre on for
                tomorrow.

                          claire
                okay...

                          ethan 
                  (he steps towards her, stops)
                is this the only way?

                          claire
                yes.......come here....viens pres moi...

     she draws him down by his hand to kiss her.

     he kisses her again, more fully.  she wraps an arm around him
     and he holds onto the kiss.  the room appears to revolve
     around them.
