                ethan, i want to reassure you that my 
                first order of business after you come in 
                is to get these ridiculous charges 
                against your family dropped and 
                eliminated completely from their files. 
                come in now, we can plea down the charges 
                against you as well. 

     the wall clock is thirty seconds and counting down.  the 
     technician is frantically signalling kittridge to keep 
     talking.  kittridge is momentarily stuck.  fortunately: 

                          ethan (o.s.) 
                can i ask you something, kittridge? 
                
                          kittridge 
                certainly ethan.
