     ext. embankment - night

     sarah is almost to golitsyn.  suddenly, the man in front of
     golitsyn pulls him towards him.  sensing something wrong,
     sarah quickens her pace.  the man is now hunched over
     golitsyn, facing away from sarah, going through golitsynís
     pockets.

     the figure finds what itís looking for -- the disk -- and
     takes it.  sarah comes closer --

     -- and the figure whirls.  it brings a knife up sharply,
     plunges it into her chest and slinks away out of sight.

     angle

     ethan races around the corner onto the embankment.  he bursts
     out of the fog, just in time to see sarah fall to her knees,
     over golitsynís body.  ethan sees the knife in her chest and
     gasps.

     he pulls the knife out of sarah, who is close to death.  he
     looks at it -- it is a black teflon knife with a serrated
     edge.

     behind ethan

     the drunken couple seem drunk no more.  in fact, theyíre
     watching ethan.  through the fog and night, they see him
     leaning over sarah, holding the knife in his hands.

     at the bodies

     sarah goes still.  ethan lays her down, turns the other body
     over and sees that it is golitsyn.  he quickly begins
     rummaging through his pockets.

     ethan hear police sirens and sees...

     angle

     a prague police boat, siren wailing, arrives at the dock in
     front of the embassy.  the drunken man and woman stop
     suddenly.

     as three police leap off the boat and race toward the
     explosion, ethan leaps over the gate and races up the alley
     and out of sight.
