     a light flashes and a phone buzzes.  kittridge in shirt and 
     tie, picks up.  barnes and several other agents are 
     monitoring newscasts and engaged in various activities 
     related to the hunt case. 

                          kittridge 
                     (picking up) 
                kittridge. 

                          ethan (o.s.) 
                i see you've been out visiting the folks. 

                          kittridge 
                     (covers receiver) 
                it's hunt.  what do you need for a 
                pinpoint? 
                     (to ethan) 
                been watching a little t.v., have you? 

     one of the technicians frantically scratches something on a 
     piece of foolscap and waves it at kittridge:  "80 seconds". 

     kittridge nods.
