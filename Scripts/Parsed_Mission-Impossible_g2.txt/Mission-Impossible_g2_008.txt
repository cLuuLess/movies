     int. safe house - day

     ethan nods. 

                          phelps (cont'd) 
                beyond charles bridge there is our 
                embassy.  see it?  tomorrow night, if 
                anything goes wrong, this guy will steal 
                the names of our agents in every country 
                all over eastern europe.  up for grabs to 
                the highest bidders -- third world 
                terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- 
                any and everybody who'd love to get rid 
                of long term coverts like us, and some 
                very dear friends among them.  if they're 
                exposed, they'll be executed.  come over 
                here.  take a lock at this. 

     claire, who is working at a computer, has pulled up a 
     quicktime video image in a box on her screen.  in it, an old 
     edition of the mclaughlin report, the pbs news show, is 
     playing. 

     ethan is distracted by it. 

     insert - television

     senator waltzer, a bearded, bespectacled man in his forties, 
     is holding forth: 

                          senator waltzer 
                i'll go you one further.  i say the cia 
                and all its shadow organizations have 
                become irrelevant at best and 
                unconstitutional at worst.  it's time we 
                throw a little light on the whole concept 
                of the pentagon's "black budget."  these 
                covert agency subgroups have confidential 
                funding, they report to no one -- who are
                these people?!  we were living in a 
                democracy the last time i checked. 

     back to scene 

     ethan looks back at jim. 

                          ethan 
                you're going to use walter? 

                          phelps 
                he's our guy. 

                          ethan 
                isn't he chairing the armed services hearing? 

                          phelps 
                not this week. this week he's flyfishing 
                at the oughterard slough in county 
                kildare, with one of our best irish guides. 

                          ethan
                he won't be back in a hurry? 

                          phelps 
                no, not in a hurry.  what do you think? 
                you think the plot'll work? 

                          ethan 
                sure.  if the main character does. 

                          phelps 
                if you were me, ethan, who would you
                trust to make him believable? 

     jack comes breezing in with a piece of bubble gum.

                          jack 
                sorry, am i interrupting?  

                          ethan
                always. 

     jack shows the gum to ethan.

                          jack 
                stick of gum. if you come up against a 
                lock you can't pick -- 

     half the gum is red, the other half is green. 

                          jack (cont'd) 
                red light.  green light.  mash them 
                together, asta lasagna.  don't get any on 
                you -- you have five seconds. 

     he offers the gum to ethan.

                          phelps 
                are you gonna take it? 

     claire glances up from the computer and catches ethan's eye. 
     phelps may have caught the glance, but is focused on ethan. 

                          ethan 
                     (relenting) 
                give me the god damn gum. 

                          jack 
                just don't chew it. 

                          phelps 
                thank you. 

                                                            cut to:
