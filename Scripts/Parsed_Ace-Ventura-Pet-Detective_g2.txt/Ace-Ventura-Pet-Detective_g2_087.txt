ext. park - day
ace's car smashes through benches and tables. then it flips over a few times and lands on its 
wheels with a horrid smash. ace is still strapped into the drivers seat, unconscious.
ace's prized white pigeon lands on the car door right beside him. ace cracks his eyes and 
sees the bird. then, with a sudden quick lunge he successfully traps it in his hands, and forgets all 
about marino.
ace
 i did it! i did it! i caught the
white pigeon! i caught the white
pigeon!
ace jumps out of his car and starts skipping around the park with the pigeon held high over his 
head. he looks insane.
ace (cont'd)
(singing)
 i caught the white pigeon, i
caught the white pigeon, i caught
the white
ace slows down and begins to look around warily. there are now an unusual number of birds 
perched on the telephone wires around the park and on the monkey bars, and on the swings.
the sky grows darker. he slowly turns and tries to get back to the car. all the birds take flight.
ace sets the white pigeon free and starts to run, but it's too late. the birds are on him. pecking, 
and gouging, and ripping his flesh.
now we see ten birds flying away with a leg. five birds flying away with an arm. twenty others 
are trying to take ace's left arm off, and half his face is missing
ace
 aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
