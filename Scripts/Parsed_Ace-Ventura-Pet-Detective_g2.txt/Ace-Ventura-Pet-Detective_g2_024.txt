ext. playing field - a short time later
the dolphin players practice. a crowd of reporters interview marino.
marino
 we just choked in 82. we had a
chance to win it and we didn't.
nobody's gonna choke this time,
and if they do, i'll kill 'em.
ace and melissa head for snowflake's tank.
melissa
 the police were here this morning.
apparently, the kidnappers used
the back gate.
ace bends down to look at some tire tracks on the field.
melissa (cont'd)
 they said some kind of a 
ace
 four wheel drive van loaded from
the rear.
ace sniffs the turf. podacter enters nervously.
melissa
 oh, hi, roger. how are you holding
up?
podacter
 well if it looks like i'm walking
funny it's because i have a bunch
on reporters up my ass. they've
been asking me about snowflake all
day. who's this?
melissa
 roger podacter, meet ace ventura.
ace is our pet detective.
podacter shakes his hand.
podacter
 nice to meet you. martha metz
recommended you very highly.
ace
 martha metz? martha metz. oh
yeah, the bitch.
podacter
 what?
ace
 pekinese. hyperactive. lost in
highland park area. she was half
dead when i found her. is that

they both follow ace as he makes a b-line.
