int. behind machinery - continuous
vinnie rounds the corner and sees nothing. he walks a little further and notices a trail of smelts 
lined up on the ground.
he follows the trail around a corner and we see roc, unconscious but moaning. he is sitting 
against the ground, with his legs spread apart and the pail over his head. the trail of smelts leads 
to his crotch. there is one halfway into his zipper, with its tail flipping.
vinnie takes in this sight, then rushes over to roc and stands him up.
vinnie
 hey man! what happened? what's
goin on?
we see ace at the top of a giant machine. he is aiming a 200 pound steel hook, that hangs on a 
chain from the ceiling.
ace
 guess what, boys, it's nap time.
ace gently releases the hook. just as vinnie and roc turn to look, the iron hook shears both of 
their heads clean off.
two headless bodies fall to the ground in slow motion with blood gushing from their necks.
close on ace - horrified
ace
 hooooly shiiit! oh my god! i
didn't mean to - oh man!!!
ace holds his head and dances around, completely freaking out what he had done.
ace
(looking to god)
 lord, i swear! i just wanted to
knock them out!
ace abruptly stops to think.
ace
 is that murder? i don't know.
they were gonna kill me. but they
didn't but they tried. that's
self defense. that's it!! i have
nothing to worry about!!
cut to:
ace nervously whistling as he wipes his fingerprints off the hook.
