int. ray's room - continuous
it's a death shrine to dan marino. complete with lifesize cutouts of dan marino, some with 
nooses around the neck, other hacked to pieces. painted on the walls: "death to marino!", 
marino must die!!!, etc.

 Â…oooh boy.
mrs. finkle
 what a sports nut, huh?
in the center of the room is a movie projector.
ace
 may i?
mrs. finkle
 oh yes. by all means.
mrs. finkle shuts the lights off. ace turns on the projector.
the film flickers over the "marino must die!!!" graffiti. it's the final play of the super bowl. 
marino takes the snap, finkle kicks and the ball sails wide. the film repeats itself ad infinitum.
