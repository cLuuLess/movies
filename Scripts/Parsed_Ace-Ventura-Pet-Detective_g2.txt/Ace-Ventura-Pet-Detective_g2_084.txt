the commercial is winding up. the linemen ready themselves.

protect me. with isotoners.
the five linemen grab marino and run off camera.
director
 and cut! that was good. again
from one.
but two of the linemen keep running with marino
director
 i said cut!!
and they keep running.
director (cont'd)
 what the hell are they doing?
right out the studio door. then the cops arrive and race after them. two linemen stumble out 
of the dressing room holding their heads.
