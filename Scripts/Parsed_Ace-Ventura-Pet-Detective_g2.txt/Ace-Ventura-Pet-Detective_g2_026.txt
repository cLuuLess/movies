int. dolphin tank - moments later
while eating sunflower seeds, ace meticulously examines the tank, including the scratches where 
the hand banged up against the wall when snowflake was stolen. all the while, he is singing a 
bastardized version of the theme from, "flipper."
ace
 wonderful flipper glorious
flipper magnificent
flipper the flippiest flipper
podacter and melissa, watching from the rim, look at each other like, "what have we gotten 
ourselves into?" podacter spots something.
podacter
 oh, great.
a hoard or reporters are headed their way.
podacter (cont)
 i'll try to head them off.
melissa
(to ace)
 get out of the tank.
ace
(still singing)
 can't hear you flipper,
flipper lookin' for flipper,
gotta find flipper
melissa
 i said, get out of the tank! now!
the reporters draw closer. podacter heads them off.
reporter
 so where's snowflake?
podacter
 ah snowflake is just, ah, not
available right now.
reporter
 come on, i'm supposed to get a
shot of his new trick for the
evening news.
reporter #2
 what? is he sick?
other reporters chime in.
various reporters
did something happen to
snowflake?! what're you
hiding..?!
melissa and podacter don't know what to say. then, a strange voice is heard.
ace/heinz (o.s.)
(unrecognizable accent)
 how cun i be getting dis vork dun
mit all da shouting? what for is
dis shouting?
reporter
 who the hell is that?
melissa

ace/heinz

dolphins. you vant to talk to ze
dolphin, you talk to me!
reporter

trainer?
ace/heinz
 vy do you care about the dolphin?
do you know him? does he call you
at home? do you have a dorsal
fin?
(beat)

like ze dolphin. you must be
getting oonside ze dolphin's head!
just yesterday i'm asking
snowflake "ee, eee, eee." he
said, "eee, eee, eee, eee." und
you can quote him.
ace spits at the reporters' feet. podacter jumps in.
podacter
 gentlemen, please, coach shula's
press conference is just about to
begin. why don't i take you over
there and let, ah, heinz, do his
job.
he ushers the press away.
melissa
(sotto to ace)
 are you finished, heinz?
ace
 not yet.
ace goes to the filter outside the tank, opens it, and pours out its contents  mainly leaves, small 
twigs and gunk. he roots through it, notices a very tiny amber stone. he smiles to himself.
ace
 now i'm finished.
