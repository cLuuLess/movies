int. tank room - seconds later
a huge above-ground tank is covered with curtains to discourage onlookers. ace swings open the 
large door and enters.

 gravy.
ace climbs a ladder on the side of the tank, singing more intensely now. the ladder leads to a 
narrow catwalk over the center of the water. ace grabs a feeder fish from a pail and walks 
carefully out there.
close on ace. this is it.
he looks into the dark pool, but sees nothing. now he stops singing, quietly squats down and 
dangles the fish over the water.
ace
(gently)
 snowflake here, snowflake
snooowflaaaake
a great white lunges out of the water and snaps its jaws an inch 
from ace's face!!! needless to say, ace is a tad surprised.
he reels back, falling off the catwalk, into the water.
