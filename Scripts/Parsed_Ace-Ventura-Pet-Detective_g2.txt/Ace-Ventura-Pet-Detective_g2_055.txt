ext. high rise apartment building - night
chaos. police, lights flashing, paramedics, crowds of people.
ace and melissa see roger podacter's body taken away in an ambulance.
ace
 you okay?
melissa nods bravely. emilio joins them.
ace
 what'd you find?
emilio
 podacter, roger. routine suicide.
he was alone. he'd been drinking.
no sign of a struggle. neighbor
heard him scream on the way down.
just your classic fifteen story
swan dive.
melissa shudders. ace gives emilio a "way to go" look.
emilio
 sorry.
