ext. melissa's backyard - early evening
ace sits in a lawn chair depressed. melissa consoles him.
melissa
 ace, that stone could have come
from anywhere. an earring, a
necklace
ace
(with murder in his eyes)
 it came from an '82 afc
championship ring.
melissa
 lt. einhorn thinks it was an
animal rights group. have you
heard of fan?
ace
 free animals now? started in 1982
by chelsea gamble, daughter of the
famous industrialist, fischer
gamble? over half a million
members from florida to finland?
(beat)
 no. who are they?
melissa
 did you know that last year they
sent threatening letters to 127
college teams, demanding the
release of their mascots? at last
count 
ace
 what do you feed your dog?
we see melissa's dog lying near ace's feet.
melissa
 ah dog food, why?
ace
 he's miserable.
melissa
 what are you talking about?
ace
 he's just very unhappy, i feel
sorry for him. bad diet, isolated
environment. it's amazing he's
still alive.
melissa
 you're just mad because your
stupid pebble theory didn't work
out and you don't know how to
express your anger.
ace
 yeah? and you're ugly.
melissa
 i'm not even gonna' talk to you,
please leave.
ace
 what, so you can beat him? fatty!
melissa
 you are unbelievable.
the phone rings inside the house. melissa goes to answer it.
melissa
 hiring you was a huge mistake!
the door slams and ace is alone with the dog. after a moment he reaches down to pet it and we 
all see that it is one of the happiest dogs in the world.
ace
 you like her, huh? yeah, she's
alright.
ace, feeling guilty, walks into the house.
