ace cautiously makes his way through the desolate site, singing quietly now. he stops when he 
hears a familiar voice.

 i particularly like the match-ups
of the defense.
ace sees a weird sight: a huge tv projection screen tuned to the super bowl pre-game 
show. marino is tied to a football tackling sled. the two thugs take turns running into dan with 
their shoulders, driving him back five feet each time.

 but the real story of this game
is the absence of dan marino. him
being kidnapped and all has got to
be a strain on this miami team. i
really feel sorry for those guys! i
mean, it's hard enough enduring
the pressure of the super bowl,
without your star quarterback
gettin' himself kidnapped. this
is the whole ball of wax, folks!
you wanna' get kidnapped, you do
it in the off season!
marino looks incredulously at the screen. next to him, snowflake "watches" from a ground level 
cistern serving as an ad hoc tank.
