int. melissa's living room
melissa enters, followed by ace.
melissa
 so, you found a pebble in
snowflake's tank. excuse me while
i call cnn.
ace
 i found it in the filter. and
it's not a pebble. it is a rare,
triangular cut, orange amber.
ace hands melissa the stone and quickly goes to one of her bookcases.
melissa
 what are you talking about?
ace
 tonight i saw the exact same stone
in camp's ring.
ace finds a book on the dolphin team and flips through it.
melissa
 i thought you said he didn't do
it.
ace
 n. camp's clean. his ring
wasn't missing a stone. but
whoever was in that tank had a
ring just like his.
melissa
 wait a second. what ring?
ace hands her the book. it's open to a photo ofÂ…
ace
 the 1982 dolphin afc championship
ring.
melissa holds the stone up to the picture. it's a perfect match.
ace
 i find the ring with the missing
stone, i find snowflake.
melissa

ace
 simple.
