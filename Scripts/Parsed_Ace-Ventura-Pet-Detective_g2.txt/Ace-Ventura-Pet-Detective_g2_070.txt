ext. pigskin sports bar - day
a weathered dive in the middle of a swamp. ace parks.
int pigskin sports bar - day
if depression had a home, this is it. several dejected men, with various degrees of missing teeth, sit 
around the bar. a couple hapless guys play pool. one throws darts.
ace enters, pops a sunflower seed in his mouth and addresses the room.
ace
 excuse me, guy?! my name is ace
ventura, i'm a pet detective. i'd
like to ask you a few questions if
 i could.
no one even looks at him.
ace
 just a few questions, that's all.
still no one reacts.
ace
(very up)
 who wants gum?!
again, no reaction. ace walks over to the bartender and slides a five across the bar.
ace
 i'm looking for a guy who used to
work here.
the bartender takes the money.
bartender
 that right?
ace
 he was a kicker for the dolphins.
ray finkle.
a pool ball flies by ace's head shattering a mirror behind the bar. all eyes are on ace.
ace
(to guy who threw it)
 that would be a scratch.
toothless giant
 you a friend of finkle's?
ace
(thinks)
 yes?
crash! the giant guy smashes his bottle.
ace
 sorry, i have "say the opposite of
what you mean" disease.
several undesirables surround ace.
toothless giant
 that bastard ruined this town.
ace
 ewww i hate that!
hick #2
 we bet everything we had on that
super bowl and that son of a bitch
gagged.
ace
 what a diiick!
they all move closer in a threatening manner.
hick #3
 shanked a goddamn 26 yarder!!!
ace
 death to finkle! death to finkle!
the bartender steps in.
bartender
 we had a hell of a thing going
here. tourists coming to see ray
finkle's home town. he was
standing right over there when he
got the call from the dolphins.
the bartender points to a payphone. it has had the shit beaten out of it. every expletive you can 
think of is graffitied around it.
ace
 did he come back after the super
bowl?
bartender
 yeah but the boys here had ways
of letting him know he wasn't
welcome.
hick #1
 excuse me, i gotta take a wicked
finkle.
laughter.
toothless giant
 what's the difference between
finkle and a jackass? a jackass
can kick.
more laughter.
hick #2
 why did finkle cross the
road?!
ace
(facetious)
 wait  i know this one.
hick #2
 he didn't! and i've got the hair on
my bumper to prove it!
maniacal laughter and chanting ensues.
mob
 finkle sucks! finkle sucks!
finkle sucks!
ace
 it's good you're dealing with the
anger.
(beat)
 i don't suppose anyone's seen him
lately?
the chanting stops and the guys all look at ace.
bartender
 no but we know where his
parents live! don't we boys?!
hick #1
 yeah! we sure do!
they all laugh insanely again.
