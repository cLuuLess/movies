int. tea room - night
a wild thrasher club. an incredible thrash band is on stage cranking. kids jump wildly into the 
moshing pit.
ace enters, sees a burnout at the bar whose head is circling insanely to the music.
ace
(shouting)
 excuse me?! is greg here?!
the burnout's head thrashes on. no acknowledgement of ace.
ace
 thank you!
ace heads for the basement stairs.
