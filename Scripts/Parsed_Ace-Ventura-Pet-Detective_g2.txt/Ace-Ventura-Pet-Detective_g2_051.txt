int. men's room
one huge lineman uses a urinal. ace, using the urinal next to him, nonchalantly tries to catch a 
glimpse of the guy's hands. the lineman has a very angry look on his face, but after a beat it 
changes to a "come on" smile.
close on
the poster of the '82 team. there is only one face that has not been crossed out. ace circles it.
