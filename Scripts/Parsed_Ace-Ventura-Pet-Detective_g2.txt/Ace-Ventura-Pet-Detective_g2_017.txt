int. miami dolphin headquarters - later that day
the very imposing office of bobby riddle, owner of the miami dolphins. riddle, 70, is a 
take charge, doesn't take crap from anyone type of guy. he is yelling at roger podacter, 
an ex-linebacker in his early sixties, and melissa robinson, podacter's attractive assistant.
riddle
 i just want to know one thing; how
the hell do you lose a 500 pound
fish?!
melissa's about to speak but hesitates.
riddle (cont.)
 what?
melissa
 it's not a fish, sir. it's a
mammal.
an angry riddle stands up.
riddle
 oh, thank you very much, mrs.
jacque cousteau!
podacter
 bob, she didn't mean anything by
it.
riddle calms down a little, and sits.
riddle
(calmer)
 listen, personally, i don't give a
good god damn about a fish.
he looks at melissa. she doesn't dare say anything.
riddle (cont.)
 all i care about is winning this
super bowl! i want the players'
head in the right place. shit,
roger, you've been in this game
long enough, you know how
superstitious players are. our
quarterback's been putting his
socks on backwards since high
school. and i got a lineman who
hasn't washed his jock in two
years because he thinks flies are
lucky! i want that god damn fish
on the field super bowl sunday!
find the fish, or find new jobs!
