int. basement - night
ace enters. green peace "save the whales" posters abound. greg/woodstock, a laid 
back, ex-hippy with long gray hair, sits at a very impressive computer set up. ace and he have 
their own distinct banter.
a thud from above. ace looks up.
ace's pov
part of the ceiling is made of metal grating, so you can see the bottom of the dance floor. a guy's 
face gets smashed into the grate. we see that it is the burnout from the club.
ace
(to burnout)
 found him!
woodstock
 hey! st. francis! how's it goin?
ace
 super, and thank you for asking.
hope you're having a nice day.
woodstock
 do you?
ace
 don't i? and what are you up to?
woodstock
 just watching the fishies, man.
there is a blip on the computer screen.
woodstock
 alright, you're just in time for
the party. you see those blips?
ace
 i certainly do.
on the screen
a map with several ships on the ocean.
he quickly taps in some commands and the ships start sailing in all different directions.
woodstock
 that's a norwegian whaling fleet.
i'm sending them new directional
coordinates they'll find jimmy
hoffa before they find any
humpbacks.
ace
 gravy.
woodstock moves to a different screen.
woodstock
 check this out.
more computer graphics come up on the screen.
woodstock
 just changed the formula for
purina's puppy chow.
(turns to ace)
 too much filler, don't ya' think?
ace
(acting turned on)
 i'm very attracted to you right
now.
woodstock chuckles.
woodstock
 are you?
ace
 aren't i? can you still tap into
all the aquatic supply store in
the area?
woodstock
 of course i can. why?
ace
 i want to trace the sale of any
equipment for transporting or
housing a dolphin within the past
few months
woodstock
 c'mon, ace. i thought you might
have a challenge for me
woodstock starts hacking away.
ace
 okay then, try to remember the
sixties.
woodstock
 wow! god one! let's see
marine winch sling, feeder fish,
20,000 gallon tank
he waits. we hear a beep.
woodstock
 that's it. i found the culprit.
ace
 who is it?
woodstock
(dramatically)
 sea world.
ace
 bastard.
woodstock
 hang on, hang on
(he taps a couple keys)
 well, what do we have here?
that's a lot of equipment for a
civilian.
the printer spits out some data. woodstock rips off the page and hands it to ace.
ace
 ronald camp? the billionaire?
woodstock
 billionaire and rare fish
collector.
ace
 rrreheheally!
a picture of camp
comes up on the computer screen.
woodstock
 that, my friend, is the face of
the enemy.
he pages through his file on screen.
woodstock
 always tryin' to get his hands
on endangered species
newspaper articles fill the screen. one shows a picture of camp and some dolphin players.
ace
 hold on, this guy's connected with
the dolphins?
ace leans in.
woodstock
 camp donated the land the new
stadium's built on.
(re: article)
 oh, look at this, he's throwin'
another, "i'm the richest man in
the universe" party.
ace
(thinking)
 hmmm i wonder if i can find
myself a date.
