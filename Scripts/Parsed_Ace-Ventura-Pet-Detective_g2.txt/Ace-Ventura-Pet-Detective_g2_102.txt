ext. shady acres hospital - day
melissa walks with the doctor. patients are sitting around, doing outdoor therapy, etc.
doctor
 you're brother won't be the first
professional football player we've
treated.
melissa
 is that right?
doctor
 yes. we're very sensitive to the
emotional stress athletes have to
endure.
ace runs across the b.g. screaming "i'm open! i'm open!"
doctor
 we'll have to do some preliminary
evaluations, but i think your
brother will fit in nicely here.
melissa
 that's a relief, doctor.
ace takes a "snap" from a three-foot hedge and dives over it into the end zone. melissa and the 
doctor stop to watch him.
doctor
 he seems to have some difficulty
letting go of the game. has he
had a long history of mental
illness?
melissa
(truthfully)
 as long as i've known him.
ace does a wild touchdown dance with some of the other patients participating.
