ext. camp's mansion - night
ace and melissa climb an impressive stairway leading to camp's mansion.
melissa
 i'm really going out on a limb
here, ventura. camp's social
events are strictly a-list.
ace
(a la love connection)
 'well, chuck the date started
off good, but just before we got
to the party, she seemed to tense
up.'
melissa rolls her eyes, then taps a huge door knocker.
melissa
 i swear, if you do anything to
embarrass me in front of camp
ace
 you mean like this?
ace starts doing a spastic body convulsion. just then a bald-headed butler, who looks a little like 
gavin mccloud, opens the door. ace doesn't notice until melissa hits him with her purse.
ace
 owwwe!!!
he sees the butler.
ace
 oh, hi captain stubing.
melissa storms in, already pissed.
