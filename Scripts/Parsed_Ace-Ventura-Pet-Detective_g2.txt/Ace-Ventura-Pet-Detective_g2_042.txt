ext. camp's mansion - later
ace and melissa are exiting. camp stops in the doorway.
camp
(still confused)
 i'm very sorry, mr. ace. i'll
have the pluming checked
immediately.
ace
 be sure that you do. if i had
been drinking out of that toilet,
i might have been killed!
ace shakes camp's hand and notices his ring. he holds on to get a better look. it's a very distinct, 
commemorative ring.
camp wants his hand back but ace won't let go. melissa finally drags ace away.
melissa
 we'd better go.
camp looks on and shakes his head.
