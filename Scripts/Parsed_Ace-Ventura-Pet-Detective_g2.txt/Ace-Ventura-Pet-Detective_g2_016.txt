ext. second floor - day
ace is just putting the key in the door when the landlord steps up behind him. ace is startled by 
the dreaded 'shickadance rasp' (not unlike linda blair in the exorcist).
landlord
 venturaaaaa?
ace straightens up, but doesn't turn around.
ace
 yes, satan?
now ace turns around in mock surprise.
ace
 oh, i'm sorry, sir. you sounded
like someone else.
landlord
 never mind the wise cracks
venturaaa. you owe me rent!
ace
 mr. shickadance i told you,
you're my first priority! as soon
as i find the white pigeon,
you're paid!!
landlord
 i heard animals in there ventura!
i heard 'em again this morning,
scratchin' around.
ace
 i never bring my work home with
me, sir.
the landlord notices the bags of kibble.
landlord
 oh, yeah? what's all this pet
food for?
ace
(beat)
 fiber.
the landlord isn't buying it.
ace
 you wanna take a look for
yourself? go head.
ace rattles his keys in the door. then he swings it open and turns on the light. the house is clear. 
ace walks in as the landlord stands there snooping and sniffing the air.
ace
 well are you satisfied?
landlord
(still suspicious)
 yeah, but don't ever let me catch
you with an animal in there,
that's all!
ace
 okay then. take care now. 'bye
'bye.
the landlord walks away as ace closes the door.
ace
(quietly to himself)
 llooser.
he then turns to the room and gives a distinct whistle.
chaos ensues! animals jump out from every direction. lizards crawl out of drawers, birds fly 
through the air, all of them gravitating to ace.
ace
(to his flock)
 ooshhooboobooboodoodoo!
