ext. alley - cont'd
as the ups man/ace rounds the corner, his shirt opens up at his pot belly and the shiatsu's head 
sticks out. ace is gloating.
ace
(announcer's voice)
 that was a close one, ladies and
gentlemen. unfortunately, in
every contest, there must be...
a looser!
he jumps into an old beat-up chevy bel air, and lets the dog out onto the passenger seat.
ace (cont'd)
 looohoooserrrherrr!
he then pulls open the car's ashtray, and to the dog's delight, it's filled with puppy chow.
he tries to start the engine but it won't turn over. the dog shoots him a look.
ace
(to dog)
 no problem, it gets flooded.
we'll just wait a few seconds.
ace sits back. smash!!!
from ace's pov we see a baseball bat shatter the front windshield.
ace
 or, we could try it now.
ace frantically tries to start the car. his new friend continues around the car beating the living shit 
out of it.
ace
 oooh, boy.
ace's pov
we see the creep wailing on the car in ace's side view mirror.
ace
 warning! assholes are closer than
they appear!
the dog is barking insanely.
ace
(to dog)
 you think you can do better?!
the baseball bat is now pummeling the trunk.
ace
 wanna give me a push while you're
back there?
boom! the back window shatters. then the car's engine roars to life. ace rejoices.
ace
 farfegnugennnnn!!!
ace leaves the bad guy in a cloud of dust and gravel, screaming bloody murder.
