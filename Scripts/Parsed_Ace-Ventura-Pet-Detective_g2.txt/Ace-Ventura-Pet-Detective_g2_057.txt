carlson.
carlson
evening, ma'am. i wonder if you
could answer a few questions about
the deceased?
ace slips away, we follow him as he eavesdrops on conversations.
neighbor
(to a cop)
 i told you, i was across the hall
in my apartment, i heard a scream.
the door was locked, so i called
the manager
the manager reiterates her story to the cop. the manager is about 100 years old.
manager
 the place was empty, except for
the damn dog in the other room.
then i opened the balcony door,
looked over the railing,
and splat, bang, pancake time
ace, continuing his investigation notices
podacter's desk
in perfect order.
next, he notices police coming in and out of the balcony, closing the door behind them, shutting 
out the noise.
