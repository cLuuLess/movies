podacter
 i'll tell you who did it. it was
those goddamn animal rights nuts!

goddamn signs, animals were born
free, stop torturing snowflake!
that goddamn fish lives better than
they do!

animal rights people.

back about the dolphin yet?
martha
 no, but i wanted to tell you, when
i lost my cuddles, i hired a pet
detective.
podacter
 a what?
martha
 a pet detective.
melissa
 thanks martha, but we'd better
leave this to professionals.
martha

pet detection is a very involved,
highly scientific process.
