int. melissa's office - day
martha enters.
martha
 ah mr. ventura to see you.
melissa
 okay, send him in.
martha exits, ace enters.
melissa (cont'd)
 hi, i'm melissa robinson. did you
have any trouble getting in?
ace
 no, the guy with the rubber glove
was surprisingly gentle.
melissa
(apologetically)
 super bowl week. security's
tight. mr. ventura, i'll get
right to the point
she slips a tape in the vcr and gestures for ace to sit.
melissa
 our mascot was stolen from his
tank last night. are you familiar
with snowflake?
the tape shows snowflake doing a trick. the trainer, dressed like a quarterback, shouts out 
signals.
trainer (on tape)
blue! 42! blue! 42! hut! hut!
snowflake swims over, snatches the small football out of the trainer's hand, swims the length of 
the pool, does an end zone dance on his tail, then returns the ball to the trainer.
melissa (o.s.)
 we got snowflake from the miami
seaquarium. he's a rare bottle
nose dolphin. that's the new
trick he was going to do during
the half-time show.
while ace studies the tape, he chews sunflower seeds in a bird-like fashion, placing the shells in a 
neat little pile on her desk.
melissa
 would you like an ashtray?
ace
 no, i don't smoke.
he adds more shells to the pile.
melissa is already wondering if she has made a mistake.
melissa
 to be honest, mr. ventura.
i'm pretty skeptical. before
today, i didn't even know there
was such a thing as a pet
detective.
ace
 well, now that you do, you'll know
who to call if your schnauser ever
runs away.
melissa
 how did you know i have a
schnauser?
ace pulls a, invisible-to-the-naked-eye dog hair off here blouse and presents it to her.
ace
 he's young, about five pounds,
black coat, white speckles
(sniffs the hair)
 likes to chase cars.
melissa
 very impressive.
ace
 you should see what i can do with
a good stool sample.
melissa
 i can hardly wait. look, we've
got a problem. can you help me or
not?
ace
(coy)
 well, sea faring creatures aren't
really my expertise
melissa
 we'll give you three thousand
dollars on delivery.
ace immediately becomes the narrator of a nature show.
ace
 the dolphin is a social creature.
capable of complex communication.
traveling in large groups or
schools
