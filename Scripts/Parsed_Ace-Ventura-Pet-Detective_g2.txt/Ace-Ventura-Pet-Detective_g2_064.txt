ace and melissa look through finkle's file on a microfiche screen. newspaper articles, headshots 
flash before them
melissa
 'replacement kicker having great
year' 'ready for super bowl,
confident kicker boasts'.
ace
 'field goal sails wide, dolphins
lose super bowl'.
melissa
 the kick heard round the world.
that was finkle. the dolphins lost
by one point.
another headline hits the screen: finkle contract not renewed.
melissa
 poor guy.
ace
 poor guy with a motive, baby.

melissa
 last i heard, he went back to his
home town, collier county. he
used to work in a bar up there.
ace

melissa
 can you drop me off before you go?
ace
(shaking his head)
 no way. it may not be safe at
your apartment, and you shouldn't
be left alone.
