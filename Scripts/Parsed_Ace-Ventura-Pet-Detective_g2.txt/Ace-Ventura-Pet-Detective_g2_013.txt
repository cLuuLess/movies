ext. dolphin stadium playing field - night
the stadium is now completely empty. snowflake peacefully swims around his tank.
suddenly, the water is illuminated by the headlights of an n.d. panel truck.
the rear door slides open. two men jump out in wet suits.
they slip into the water while a third waits outside the tank.
snowflake surfaces to check out the action. one of the men holds out a fish. snowflake eagerly 
takes it, then shudders as a large syringe is stuck into his back. snowflake thrashes around.
quick cut of a hand with the blur of a ring slamming against the tank. but the needle has done its 
job. snowflake quickly goes limp.
snowflake is loaded into the back of the truck. move in on snowflake's face. his excited cackle 
has turned into a painful whimper.
the truck skids away passing the guard gate. the guard is hog tied and gagged, struggling to free 
himself.
