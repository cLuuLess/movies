ext. surfside apartment complex - day
ace enters the courtyard of a two story u-shaped apartment complex carrying his groceries. it's a 
crappy joint but he calls it home. inside an open apartment on the ground floor, the landlord, mr. 
shickadance, sits watching tv, stuffing his face with cheese doodles. ace sneaks past the 
door and up the stairs.
