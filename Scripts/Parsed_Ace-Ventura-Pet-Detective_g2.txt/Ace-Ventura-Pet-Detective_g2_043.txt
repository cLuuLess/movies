int. melissa's car - night
ace is thinking. melissa is pissed.
melissa
 y'know, i don't even want to
know why your pants are missing!
i don't care what happened! you
could have cost me my job.
ace
(on his own wavelength)
 i was wrong about camp. he's
breaking the law but he's not our
guy.
melissa
 it's a sure thing! it's
definitely him! just get me in
there! let me work my magic!
ace takes the stone out of his pocket and studies it intensely.
ace
 this is the key. right here!
melissa
 hiring you was the biggest mistake
i ever made!
ace
 so small! so unnoticeable! yet
an invaluable piece of our
twisted little jigsaw puzzle!
melissa stares at ace like he's gone crazy. there is a flash of headlights and a car horn. melissa 
swerves back into her own lane. ace drops the stone somewhere on the seat and begins to search 
for it frantically.
ace
 damn it!
(to melissa)
 try to keep it on the road.
