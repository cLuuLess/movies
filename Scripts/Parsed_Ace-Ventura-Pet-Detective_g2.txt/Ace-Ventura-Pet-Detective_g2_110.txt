int. ace's apartment - late night
close up: answering machine
wiggles' nose enters frame and hits the play button.
message #1
(shickadance rasp)
 venturaaaa? your time is up!
you're out! you hear me?! no
rent no roof!
we widen to find ace on the couch listening.
message #2
 ace, it's e. got something you
might find interesting. it's a
note from podacter to einhorn,
thanking her for a wonderful
saturday night. this is too
weird, man?
ace
 wiggles, rewind.
wiggles obediently hits another button and rewinds the phone tape. ace pops sunflower seeds, 
and holds some evidence aloft thinking. a bird eats seeds out of his naval.
ace
 what the hell does lois einhorn
have to do with ray finkle? come
on, think!
dissolve to:
later. ace is posed like rodin's "the thinker".
ace
 finkle and einhorn. in it
together. how? why?
a small monkey sits in the same position. mocking ace.
dissolve to:
later still. ace pacing, jumping up and down. trying to get his intuitive juices flowing. the 
monkey is likewise, jumping on the mantle.
ace
 alright! here we go! answer's
right there! just gotta get some
blood to the brain! finkle and
einhorn! finkle and einhorn!
finkle and einhorn! finkle and
einhorn!
the animals all watch him like he's crazy.
dissolve to:
daybreak. ace sits staring at a picture of finkle on the coffee table. he's totally spent and on the 
verge of tears.
ace
(whimpering)
 finkle and einhorn. einhorn and
finkle.
he turns to see the monkey crashed out in a heap on a sofa pillow.
ace
(to sleeping monkey)
 quitter.
wiggles jumps up onto the coffee table now. ace can't be bothered with him.
ace
 what do you want? huh?
wiggles whines at the tone of ace's voice.
ace (cont'd)
 what? i got no food for you. you
gotta have money to buy food. i
gotta find the dolphin to get the
money. i don't see any dolphins
around here, do you? face it,
it's hopeless your master is a
loser.
ace buries his face in his hands. his dog wiggles does the same. then ace looks up again.
ace
 loo hoo
suddenly he is silenced by something amazing.
wiggles' dark haired floppy ears are lying around finkle's picture like a wig. ace combs the hair 
over the head shot. the "make-over" is unmistakable. it's einhorn!!
ace
 oh, my god! that's it!
he jumps up, estatic.
ace
 einhorn is finkle! finkle is
einhorn! einhorn is a man!!!
ace's expression quickly turns sour.
ace
 oh my god!!! einhorn is a man!!!
music up: aerosmith's dud looks like a lady
ace makes a mad dash into the bathroom.
