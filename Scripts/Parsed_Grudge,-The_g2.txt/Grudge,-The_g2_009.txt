               ext. the house - porch - day
               emma sits on the back porch, staring vacantly. but her
               expression isn't simply blank - there's an odd sadness there.

          karen is washing the dirty sheets in a bucket and hanging
          them to dry. she finishes, turning to her charge.

                         okay, emma. let's try again: my
                         name is karen. do you remember?
                         i'm from the health center. i'm
                         substituting for yoko, just for
                         today.
          
               emma doesn't respond -- and there's no indication that she
               remembers karen introducing herself before.
          
               kneeling in front of emma, karen notices a band-aid around
               one of her fingers. blood has soaked through it.
          
                                   karen
                         looks like you need a new band-aid.
                         how'd this happen, emma?
                             (still no reaction)
                         would you like a bath? maybe that
                         will help you feel better.
          
               emma doesn't even turn towards her.
