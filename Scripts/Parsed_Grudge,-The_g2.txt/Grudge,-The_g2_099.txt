          115   ext. condo building - day                                 115
          
                the same building from the newspaper clipping.   monolithic
                against a cloudy, bleak sky.
          
                karen stands before it, staring up at it.
          
                then she walks to the intercom and looks at the directory,
                finds `m. kirk'. she activates the intercom and dials the
                number. it rings a few times, and then a voice picks up:
          
                                      maria (intercom, in japanese)
                          yes?
          
                                    karen
                          i'm looking for maria kirk?
          
                                    maria (intercom)
                          who is this?
          
                                    karen
                          my name is karen davies. i'm a
                          student at -- i'm sorry to bother
                          you, but i was wondering if i could
                          ask you a few questions.
          
                a long beat.   karen stares at the intercom.
          
                                      karen
                          ms. kirk?
          
                                    maria (intercom)
                          questions about what?

                          with you about your husband.
          
                when maria's voice comes back through the intercom, she
                sounds different, shaken:
          
                                    maria (intercom)
                          leave me alone.

                          please.
          
                karen stands there for a moment.   then, as she walks away --

          click.   the electronic door lock disengages behind her.

          116a   int. peter & maria's apartment - day                       116a
          
                 the front door opens. maria (early 30s) has changed from
                 when we first saw her -- she wears a revealing outfit, and
                 her natural beauty now smolders beneath the surface.
          
                 she regards karen warily.
          
                                     maria
                           i'm late for work.
          
                                     karen
                           i just need a couple minutes.
          
                 maria finally steps aside, letting karen in.
          
                 the apartment is small, and completely unkempt.    the kitchen
                 is a mess, clothes lie everywhere.
          
                                     maria
                               (sarcastic:)
                           make yourself at home.
          
                 karen looks for a place to sit.    she decides to stand.
          
                 maria sizes her up.   a beat.   then:
          
                                       maria
                           well?
          
                                     karen
                           your husband, peter.    three years
                           ago he...
          
                 she trails off, in delicate territory.
          
                                       maria
                           he what?
          
                                     karen
                           he killed himself.
          
                 maria eyes her blankly. then she turns to look at something
                 o.s. karen follows her gaze --
          
                 -- to the open door of the bedroom.     and the window beyond.

                              karen
                        (almost ashamed:)
                    i'm... sorry.
          
          maria turns back to her, sadness on her face.   then:
          
                                 maria
                    thank you.
          
          maria reaches for a pack of cigarettes.   lights one.   offers
          them to karen. she shakes her head.
          
                              maria
                    how did you know peter?
          
                                 karen
                    i didn't.
          
                              maria
                    then what are you doing here?
          
                              karen
                    i think there's a connection
                    between your husband's death and
                    something that happened to me.
          
                              maria
                    what happened to you?
          
                              karen
                    it's... hard to explain.
          
          maria takes a drag from her cigarette.    waiting.
          
                              karen
                    look, i know this sounds strange,
                    but... i don't think your husband
                    wanted to die.
          
                              maria
                        (even:)
                    then why would he throw himself out
                    a window?
          
          karen struggles to find the answer.
          
                              maria
                    let me guess: `hard to explain'?
          
          karen nods.   maria's brave face slips.   she turns away.

                              maria
                    i put all this behind me. i don't
                    want to open it back up again.
          
                              karen
                    if that's true, then why are you
                    still here in japan?
          
          maria turns back.   she only looks defensive for a moment.
          
                              maria
                    because i can't leave. i tried.
                    but i couldn't. not without...
          
          maria speaks softly, forming words she's never spoken aloud:
          
                              maria
                    he usually didn't wake up before
                    me. but that morning, he did. he
                    made coffee for us. then he sat
                    there and waited for me to wake up.
                    and when i did, he looked me right
                    in the eye. and then he jumped.
                    the night before we'd been talking
                    about having children together...
          
          she wipes away the tears in her eyes.
          
                              karen
                    did you know a woman named kayako?
          
                                 maria
                    no.
          
                                 karen
                    did peter?
          
                              maria
                    i don't think so.
          
          maria turns away, growing tense.
          
                              karen
                    maybe it was someone he worked
                    with?
          
                              maria
                    look. i've had the police up here,
                    i talked with detectives, i even
                    hired a p.i.--

                              maria (cont'd)
                    i don't know what you're going
                    through, or what you think you know
                    about my husband. but i don't have
                    any answers. i'm sorry.
          
          she turns back to karen -- to find the young woman sitting
          slumped on the edge of a sofa, tears in her eyes.
          
          maria softens as karen looks up at her, pleading:
          
                             karen
                    please. i don't know what else to
                    do. please help me.
