          68   ext. the house - night                                       68
          
               two police cars and an ambulance are parked out front.
          
               an unmarked car pulls up, and detective nakagawa (40s) exits
               the passenger side. he looks up at the house with dread.
          
               the driver, detective igarashi (30s), moves next to him.

                         i can handle this myself, you know.
                         it's just a routine call. i don't
                         know why you wanted to come.
          
               he turns to nakagawa, awaiting a response. he doesn't get
               one. nakagawa just stares up at the house.
