                 int. hospital hallway - day
                 karen paces down the hall towards a reception area.       doug
                 catches up with her, turning her towards him.
          
                                     doug
                           look, i'm sorry. i was just
                           worried about you, and -- i know
                           you, karen.
          
                 karen turns to him.   a sober look on her face.

                              karen
                    the same thing happened three years
                    ago, doug. to a japanese family,
                    who lived in that house. they were
                    all found dead.
          
          doug studies her for a moment.
          
                               doug
                    so you think the events are
                    connected?
          
                              karen
                    how would you explain it?
          
          she watches doug as he thinks.   carefully.
          
                              doug
                    okay. how about this: the
                    american family knew about what had
                    happened there before, and this
                    knowledge subconsciously caused
                    them to repeat the same events.
          
          karen gives doug a skeptical look.
          
                              doug
                    it's exactly how superstitions
                    survive: if you walk under a
                    ladder and think uh-oh, you're in
                    for some bad luck, sure enough,
                    what do you know? you trip over --
          
                              karen
                        (heard it before:)
                    -- trip over the curb and sprain
                    your ankle.
          
                              doug
                    makes sense, right?
          
          karen stops walking.   considering something.

                              karen
                    okay. then explain this: when i
                    went to that house, i didn't know
                    anything about its past. but yet i
                    still saw...
          
          she hesitates, realizing she's said too much.
          
                                doug
                    saw what?    karen?
          
                              karen
                    emma and i were alone in that room,
                    but -- there was something else
                    there. i'm sure of it.
          
                              doug
                    you watched a woman die, kat.
                    that's a horrible thing to
                    experience. i can't imagine how
                    you must feel. but sometimes the
                    mind tries to cope with terrible
                    things in a way that distorts what
                    actually occurred.
          
          karen's eyes never leave his.   softly, but firmly:
          
                              karen
                    you might be right, doug. but i
                    know what i saw.
                        (then, faltering:)
                    i think i know what i saw...
          
          after a moment, doug pulls her into a hug.
          
                              doug
                    you just need to rest. we'll get
                    you home, get a good night's sleep.
          
                                karen
                    yeah.
          
          but her eyes speak differently. she covers it well, stepping
          back and glancing over at the reception desk:
          
                              karen
                    you've got class, and i'm sure i
                    only have to fill out a few forms
                    or something --
          
                                doug
                    you sure?

                    i'm fine, doug. really.
          
          he kisses her, then exits. he pauses at the front doors to
          give her a little wave. she smiles... but the smile droops
          as soon as he's out of sight.
          
          after a moment, she turns and walks to the front desk.
