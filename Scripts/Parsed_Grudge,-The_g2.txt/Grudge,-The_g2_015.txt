               karen sits at the kitchen table, flattening and taping
               together the pieces of the photograph. she finishes.
          
               on the photo: a grinning japanese boy holds a cute black
               cat. his mother and father stand beside him. they're all
               beaming at the camera -- a perfect, happy family.
          
               but there's a piece missing.   the mother's face.
          
               karen walks back into the living room. she looks underneath
               the couch for the missing piece. can't see anything.
          
               she lays down and sticks her arm under the couch, feeling
               around. nothing.
          
               karen sticks her arm in deeper, to the shoulder, straining...
          
               she suddenly jerks her arm back, wincing.   she has a small
               cut on her finger.
          
               karen looks under the couch for what cut her --
          
               -- a small furniture nail sticks out underneath.
          
                                   karen
                         nice one, karen.
          
               she gets to her feet, folding up the incomplete picture and
               stuffing it into her pocket.
