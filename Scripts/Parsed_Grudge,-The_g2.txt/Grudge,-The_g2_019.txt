               int. the house - front room - dusk
               the sounds immediately stop as karen enters the master
               bedroom. it's dark, thick blinds covering the windows. a
               frosted window, overlooking the foyer, isn't helping much.
          
               she stands there for a moment, listening.   silence.
          
               then --
          
                                        revisions (blue) -- 1/26/04     12.
          
          
          
               scratch scratch. startled, she gasps and turns towards the
               closed closet doors. that's where the sound is coming from.
          
               and then she notices something strange about the closet door:
          
               it's been sealed shut with duct tape.
          
               the scratching quickens, as if sensing a presence nearby.
          
               and then there's a muffled meow.   there's a cat in there?
          
               karen pulls off the duct tape. she reaches for the door
               handle, slowly sliding it open a crack and peering inside --
          
               the closet seems empty, except for a large book on a shelf.
               karen reaches inside and picks it up.
          
               then she sees, in the darkened far corner of the closet, a
               small black cat. it's sitting on something, watching her.
          
               karen slides the door the rest of the way open --
          
               -- revealing a young japanese boy (age 7) sitting in the
               corner, staring at karen. the cat is curled up on his lap.
          
               startled, karen drops the book and falls backwards.
          
          20                                                                20
