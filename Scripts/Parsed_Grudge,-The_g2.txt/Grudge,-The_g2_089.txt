                 doug sits on the bed, next to a dressing curtain. karen's
                 silhouette is visible behind it, pulling on her clothes.
          
                 he watches the curtain for a beat, concerned.     then:
          
                                     doug
                           i got us a guidebook to kyoto. i
                           thought maybe we'd leave tomorrow --
          
                 the curtain suddenly slides back.    karen, dressed, stares at
                 him. she looks angry.
          
                                     karen
                           why didn't you tell me?
          
                                     doug
                           tell you what?
          
                                     karen
                           about the bodies they found in the
                           attic.
          
                                     doug
                           you were recovering from a shock.
                           i didn't want to --
          
                 karen turns away, picking up her backpack and slinging it.
                 she walks past him, disappointed, and leaves the room.
          
                                     doug
                           karen -- wait --
          
                 he quickly grabs his coat and bag.
