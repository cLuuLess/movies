               int. hospial - hallway - night
               in the hallway:   the men speak with hushed voices.
          
                                   igarashi (in japanese)
                         we checked the apartment of susan,
                         the sister. she wasn't there...
          
               he trails off, hesitating.
          
                                     nakagawa (in japanese)
                         yes?
          
                                   igarashi (in japanese)
                         the chain lock had been drawn from
                         the inside. and the deadbolt. but
                         we found no one in the apartment.
          
               nakagawa takes this in.
          
                                   nakagawa (in japanese)
                         get the surveillance tapes from the
                         office building.
          
               igarashi nods.    but doesn't move.   after a moment, quietly:
          
                                   igarashi (in japanese)
                         they were the first family to live
                         in that house since the incident
                         three years ago --
          
                                        revisions (blue) -- 1/26/04        56.
          
          
          
               nakagawa's harsh look silences him. then the detective
               turns, noticing karen watching them. he pulls the door shut.
