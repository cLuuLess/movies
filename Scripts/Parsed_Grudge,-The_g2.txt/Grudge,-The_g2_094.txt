                 nakagawa puts the two heavy objects by the front door and
                 closes it. now we can see what they are --
          
                 -- gasoline cans.    two gallons each.   full.
          
                 nakagawa catches his breath. then he reaches for the lid of
                 one of the cans, starting to unscrew it. his hands are
                 shaking, and the gasoline splashes around inside --
          
                 -- but then there's another splashing sound.     from nearby.
          
                 nakagawa freezes.    the splashing continues.    his eyes go to --
          
                 the bathroom door. it's closed. the splashing is coming
                 from inside, accompanied by a series of thuds. the sounds of
                 a small child, struggling...
          
                 nakagawa fearfully reaches for the door handle --
          
          106a                                                               106a
