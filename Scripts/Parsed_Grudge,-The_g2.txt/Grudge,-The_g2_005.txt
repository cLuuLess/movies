                ext. shopping district - day
                karen walks down the populated sidewalk, weaving through
                street vendors, and passing a large grocery store.
          
                she pauses, looking at the address on her card. she
                approaches a woman and her daughter (6) and speaks to them in
                japanese. the woman nods, pointing towards a small alley.
          
                karen gives the daughter a smile;   the girl hides behind her
                mother's leg.
