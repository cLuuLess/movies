               int. the house - second floor hallway - day
               reaching the top, jennifer catches a glimpse of a familiar
               boy running into the front room.
          
               she slowly walks towards the open door -- we can't see inside
               the room from the hallway. but she pauses as she hears --
          
               thud.   thud.   the same rhythmic thumping that karen heard.
          
               after a moment, jennifer steps inside the room, disappearing
               from our sight.
          
               we hear her suddenly draw a gasp.
          
               a beat. as we drift closer to the doorway, we notice
               something strange: the room appears to be growing darker.
               a sharp breathing can be heard from inside... quick, panicked
               gulps of air. growing faster.
          
               just as we reach the doorway, the harsh breathing stops.

          a moment of stillness.
          
          then the door is slammed shut from the inside.
