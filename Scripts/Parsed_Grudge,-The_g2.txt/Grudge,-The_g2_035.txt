          35   int. the house - front room - night                        35
          
               matthew stands in the doorway of the dark room.   he tries the
               light switch. nothing happens.
          
                                     matthew
                         dammit.
          
               he slowly enters, feeling his way through the room. we can
               barely make him out in the darkness... we see the shape of
               the bed by a window...
          
               matthew feels his way to a table next to the bed.   switches
               on a small lamp --
          
               -- jennifer is right next to him. lying in bed, staring wide-
               eyed at the ceiling. matthew, startled, falls backwards.
          
                                     matthew
                         jennifer?    what is it --
          
               matthew rushes to her, shaking her. she's unresponsive. the
               only sign she's alive is that her fearful eyes slowly fix on
               him. her mouth opens, as if she's trying to speak.
          
                                   matthew
                         what's wrong? what happened???
          
               she tries harder to form words, but can only produce a croak.
          
                                   matthew
                         i'll... i'll call an ambulance...
          
          36                                                              36
