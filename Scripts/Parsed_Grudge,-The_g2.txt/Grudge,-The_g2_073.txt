               int. attic - night
          
               a shaft of light from the flashlight through the open attic
               access cuts through the thick darkness.
          
               nakagawa appears, pulling himself up into the attic.     he
               swings his flashlight slowly around the room.
          
               igarashi comes up next to nakagawa just as the detective's
               flashlight stops on something.
          
               a beat as they exchange an uneasy look.
          
               then nakagawa and igarashi crawl through the darkness towards
               the far corner of the space.
          
               two bodies are tucked into the corner.    matthew and jennifer.

                         god!
          
               nakagawa sits in front of the bodies, examining them.
          
                                   igarashi (in japanese)
                         what the hell... what is going on?
          
               nakagawa sees the beeping cordless phone a few feet away.
          
               something next to it attracts nakagawa's interest. we can't
               see what it is, but there's some deep red in it, and
               something very white --
          
                                   igarashi (in japanese)
                         what is that?
          
               -- nakagawa's eyes widen as he realizes what he's looking at.
