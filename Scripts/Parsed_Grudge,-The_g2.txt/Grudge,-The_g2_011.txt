               karen supports emma's weight as she leads the old woman
               slowly down the hallway to the bathroom entrance --
          
               -- emma stops at the doorway.    eyes fixed on the tub.
          
                                   karen
                         it's okay, emma.
          
               she takes emma's hand and walks inside. but emma doesn't
               budge. her free hand tightly clutches the door frame.
          
               her eyes are wide.   staring at the bathtub.
