          17   int. the house - rear room - dusk                            17
          
               karen steps inside. moving boxes are stacked against the
               wall, next to a desk. it's an unfinished room.
          
               she listens.   no scratching.   nothing unusual here.   except --
          
               karen notices a lone object sitting on an otherwise empty
               shelf. it's a black ceramic cat. facing the wall. strange.
          
               and then karen hears the scratching sound again.
