               int. the house - kitchen - night
               karen is on her cell phone:
          
                                   karen (into phone)
                         yes, he was shut in a closet!

                         know, emma hasn't said a word to me
                         -- he's still upstairs -- yes, i'm

               karen hangs up, putting the phone down on the kitchen table.
               she leans against the counter, exasperated.

               karen can't resist.   she opens it.
          
               the book is a large journal, filled with elegant japanese
               writing. karen flips through it, stopping on --
