               ext. the house - night
               the police cars outside have attracted a small crowd.   the
               two bodies are being loaded into a police van.
          
               nakagawa stands with the coroner. the coroner's assistant,
               wearing a face mask and rubber gloves, approaches. he holds
               something small, wrapped in a bloody white sheet.
          
               the coroner slowly unfolds the sheet. we can't see what he's
               looking at -- but it elicits quite a reaction.
          
                                   coroner (in japanese)
                         who does this belong to?
          
                                   nakagawa   (in japanese)
                         we don't know.
          
               the coroner quickly re-covers the object.
          
                                   coroner (in japanese)
                         i can use the blood to help
                         identify the person.
          
               as the coroner and his assistant walk away:
          
                                   nakagawa (in japanese)
                         is it possible that someone could
                         live without... that?
          
               the coroner turns back, his face pale.

          i certainly hope not.

                nakagawa turns away to see igarashi approaching, talking into
                a cell phone. he looks disturbed. as he hangs up:
          
                                    igarashi (in japanese)
                          someone just reported another
                          death. it's not in our district...
                          but i think we should check it out.
          
                nakagawa realizes something's troubling his partner.
          
                                       nakagawa (in japanese)
                          why?
          
                                    igarashi (in japanese)
                          the cause of death is not clear...
                          but it is the man who sold them
                          this house.
