          27   ext. the house - morning                                       27
          
               the door opens and matthew walks outside, stopping to look at
               a familiar bicycle, leaning against the house near the door.
          
                                   matthew
                         is this yoko's bike?
          
                                   jennifer
                         i think so.
          
                                   matthew
                         it's been here all night.
          
               matthew rolls the bike from the porch to the gate, leaning it
               against the wall (where we saw it earlier).
          
               he turns back to jennifer, giving her a kiss.
          
                                   matthew
                         i'll probably be home late, maybe
                         around nine or so.
          
               jennifer gives him a look.
          
                                   jennifer
                         i knew you'd forget.
          
               matthew pauses, looks back blankly.    jennifer just smiles.
          
                                   jennifer
                         dinner, your sister?    at seven?
          
                                    matthew
                         oh yeah.   right.
          
                                   jennifer
                         you were going to cook.
                                   matthew
                         i have a big conference.    they
                         usually run long.
          
               jennifer rolls her eyes.

                                   jennifer
                         i'll do the shopping. just call me
                         if you're going to be late.
          
               she goes back inside, closes the door.
