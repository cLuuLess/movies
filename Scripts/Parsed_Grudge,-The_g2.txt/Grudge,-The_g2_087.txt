               nakagawa sits at the desk. exhausted, dark circles under his
               eyes, he's staring down at --
          
               the file on his desk.   as if he's afraid to even open it.
          
               but he does. he flips through the photos, pausing on that of
               toshio, but continuing on to the black and white photo of the
               house from three years ago (the one karen saw), with the
               three detectives.
          
               nakagawa turns to a framed picture on his desk -- it's
               younger nakagawa at a bar with three familiar detectives.
               they're off-duty, grinning at the camera. buddies.
          
               the two photographs share the same three detectives.

               as nakagawa looks at the crime scene photo, he realizes
               something. he slowly stands, in shock, trembling.
          
               the phone rings, startling him.
          
               nakagawa walks over, picks up the phone.

                         hello?
          
               he listens.
          
               his face goes blank.    he slowly lowers the phone.
