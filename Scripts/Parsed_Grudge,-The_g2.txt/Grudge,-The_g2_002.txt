          2   ext. street corner - day                                         2
          
              a blur of movement as hundreds of people stream up from a
              subway tunnel. most are japanese. we're not in kansas.

               standing in the middle of the rush-hour pedestrian traffic is
          
               karen (20s, american). she faces upstream, looking for
               someone. the flow threatens to carry her away in a
               heartbeat. she looks fragile, intimidated by the madness.
          
                                   doug (o.s.)
                         karen!
          
               she turns to see her boyfriend doug (20s, american)
               approaching. with a reassuring smile he takes her hand --
          
               -- and together, they force their way through the throng,
               trying to escape the flow. they're jostled and crushed by
               the crowd, and doug protectively pulls karen closer.
          
                                   karen
                         i'll never get used to this.
          
                                   doug
                         maybe we should find a different
                         train station.
          
               he abruptly stops, right in the middle of traffic, still
               holding karen's hand. she turns, wondering what's going on.
               she sees the smile on his lips a moment before --
          
               -- he sweeps karen into his arms and kisses her. as if the
               crowd of businessmen surging around them isn't there at all.
          
               it's tender and loving, and she responds... at first.   but
               then she pulls away, shy.
          
                                   karen
                         a public display of affection is
                         considered rude in japan.
          
               there's an opening ahead into a side street.   doug and karen
               deftly slip out of the traffic --
          
          
          2a                                                                 2a

               -- and walk hand-in-hand down the much quieter street, away
               from the crowded thoroughfare.
          
               doug smiles as they pass by two japanese high school couples,
               making out on the street corner. he turns to give karen a
               sarcastic look --

          -- but she didn't notice the school kids. she's looking in
          the other direction, at a trickle of smoke wafting up over a
          nearby fence.
          
                              karen
                    what's that?
          
          doug follows as she walks toward an old temple, nestled
          beneath a skyscraper. a collision of the ancient and modern.
          the fence surrounds a graveyard adjacent to the temple.
          
                              doug
                    we walk past this temple every day,
                    karen --
          
                              karen
                    yeah, but i've never seen this
                    before.
          
          a japanese man stands before an ornate headstone, lighting a
          bundle of incense and bowing before the grave.
          
                              karen
                    it's a buddhist ritual. the
                    incense smoke carries the prayers
                    to the spirits of his ancestors, to
                    help them remain at peace.
          
          clink. she turns as doug, grinning, lights a cigarette with
          his zippo, flicking it shut and pocketing it.
          
                              doug
                    it's amazing. you're like this
                    infinite storehouse of wisdom. or
                    trivia. i'm not sure which.
          
                              karen
                    it's not trivia. it's what they
                    believe. and it's far better, by
                    the way, than your little pollution
                    ritual.
          
          doug's grin softens to a smile. he doesn't respond... but
          the way he's looking at karen makes her curious:
          
                              karen
                    what?
          
          he turns away for a moment, almost shyly, dropping his
          cigarette and crushing it. finally:

                               doug
                    nothing. i just -- i like that
                    about you. you seem to be able to
                    remember everything that's really
                    important.
          
          she smiles.   a tender moment.   then... he checks his watch.
          
                              doug
                    except the time.
          
          karen checks her own watch, realizing --
          
                              karen
                    oh, crap --
          
          she grabs his hand and starts to walk quickly.
          
                              karen
                    c'mon, you're gonna be late.

                an international college in tokyo. the autumn chill doesn't
                deter the students from enjoying the beautiful day.
          
                karen and doug, still holding hands, enter the campus.

                karen and doug approach the doors of a nursing care center.
                she pulls him to the side just as he's stepping under a
                workman's ladder by the doors.
          
                                    karen
                          uh-uh. seven years of bad luck.
                              (before doug can respond:)
                          and i might have a vested interest
                          in those years.
          
                                    doug
                          is that right?
          
                                      karen
                          maybe.
          
                doug smiles, kissing her romantically.   then:
          
                                    doug
                          will i see you tonight?
          
                                    karen
                          i'll call you when i get home.
          
                with a flourish, doug swings himself back under the ladder.
          
                                      doug
                          fourteen.    i hate odd numbers.
