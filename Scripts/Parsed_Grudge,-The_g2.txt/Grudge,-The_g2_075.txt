                ext. tokyo street - day
                close on the spinning wheels of a bicycle.      a familiar one.
          
                the pedals are being pumped by a beautiful young japanese
                woman -- this is yoko (early 20s).
          
                yoko turns, riding down a small side street.      it ends, and
                she rounds a corner stopping in front of --
          
          
          77a   ext. the house - day                                         77a
          
                yoko opens the gate and walks her bike to the front door,
                leaning it against the wall nearby (exactly where we saw
                matthew bump into it earlier).
          
                she rings the door buzzer. waits. she seems to have
                expected this: she pulls a key from her pocket, with a
                plastic label on it.
