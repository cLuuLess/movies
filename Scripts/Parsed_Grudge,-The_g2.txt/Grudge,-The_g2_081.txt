          87   int. closet - day                                              87
          
               yoko slams the door shut, pulling herself up onto a raised
               shelf. breathing hard, looking down at --
          
               -- the crack under the door.   the light is beginning to dim.
          
               yoko presses back into the closet, trapped.
          
               the closet is starting to get dark.   quickly.
          
               yoko looks around desperately.   looking up, she sees --
          
               -- the attic panel above her is wide open.
          
               caught between a rock and a hard place.   yoko decides:
          
               she shakily stands on the shelf and reaches up to pull
               herself into the attic.
