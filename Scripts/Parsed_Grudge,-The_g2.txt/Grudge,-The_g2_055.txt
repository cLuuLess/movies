               susan tries to regain her composure as the elevator rises.
               she closes her eyes and leans against the wall --
          
               -- not noticing a familiar pale japanese boy looking at her
               through the window of every floor she passes --
          
               toshio. he's standing closer to the window with each floor.
               until finally, he's right next to the glass --
          
               the elevator stops at her floor:    no little boy this time.
