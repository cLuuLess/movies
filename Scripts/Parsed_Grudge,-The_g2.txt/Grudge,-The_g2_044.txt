               int. the house - living room - day
               suzuki opens the blinds, letting some light into the place.
               it's not helping much -- it's still pretty dreary.
          
                                   matthew
                         isn't the layout great? wait `till
                         you see the back room. it's
                         perfect for mom -- she won't have
                         to deal with the stairs.
          
               jennifer follows him through the room.   she doesn't look
               quite as enthusiastic.
          
               matthew slides open the door leading to the tatami room.
          
                                   matthew
                         her bed won't be here until next
                         week, but we can put the mattress
                         on the floor. what do you think?
          
               jennifer warms a bit.   the wooden room is beautiful.
          
               susan asks suzuki a question in japanese, and he responds.

                                    susan
                          he says no one has lived in this
                          house for three years.
          
                                     jennifer
                          why?
          
                susan asks suzuki in japanese.    he shrugs.
          
                                    suzuki
                              (trying his english:)
                          ex-pen-sive.
          
                matthew suddenly realizes:
          
                                    matthew
                          where's mom?
          
                we slowly crane up to the second floor hall, moving towards
                the rear room at the end. the door is ajar.
