          26   int. the house - kitchen - morning                          26
          
               jennifer watches the last drops of coffee fall into the pot.
               she pours herself a mug, takes a big sip. looks exhausted.
          
               matthew enters, surprised to see her.
          
                                       matthew
                          you're up?
          
                                       jennifer
                          mmmmmm.
          
               matthew glances into the back room through another sliding
               door -- the windows on this one are clear, not frosted like
               the living room.
          
               his pov:   emma is asleep on her mattress.
          
                                    matthew
                          i wonder if mom's okay. she's been
                          sleeping ever since we got here.
          
                                    jennifer
                          not at night.
          
               matthew turns to her, surprised.
          
                                    jennifer
                          i told you, matthew, you can sleep
                          through anything.
          
               matthew comes over, kisses her.
          
                                    matthew
                          i'm sorry, sweetheart. it was
                          probably just the move -- i'm sure
                          she'll get back on schedule.
          
               jennifer nods, not convinced.
          
                                    matthew
                          you seen my travel mug?
          
                                    jennifer
                          i didn't unpack it yet.
          
               matthew kneels down next to a pair of moving boxes in the
               corner -- `kitchen' written on the side. he explores it.

                              matthew
                    maybe you should say something to
                    the helper, what's her name?
          
                                 jennifer
                    yoko.
          
                              matthew
                    who knows? maybe there's something
                    she can suggest.
          
                                 jennifer
                    yeah.     maybe.
          
          he finds his travel mug, wrapped in the sports section of an
          american newspaper. matthew scans it as he fills his mug.
          
                              matthew
                    i miss seeing this every morning.
          no response from his wife. he turns to see jennifer looking
          down at emma through the window.
          
          matthew walks over, puts an arm around her.
          
                              matthew
                    hey, kiddo. you okay?
          
                              jennifer
                    i went for a walk yesterday. just
                    to explore. i got lost and
                    couldn't find anyone who could
                    speak english, who could help me.
                    i felt so... stupid.
          
                              matthew
                    this will get easier soon, for mom,
                    for all of us. i promise.
          
          she turns to him.
          
                                 jennifer
                    or else?
          
                              matthew
                    or else i'll tell the company it's
                    just not working out, and that
                    we're going back to the states with
                    or without my old job. they can
                    get someone else to crunch their
                    numbers.
          
          this makes jennifer feel better.

                         but until then -- promise me you'll
                         give it a good try, okay jen?
          
                                    jennifer
                         deal.
