                 karen is in the shower. she stands there, glassy-eyed, as
                 the water runs over her. she's looking at --
          
                 -- her reflection in the mirror. it fogs up, obscuring the
                 view. this snaps karen out of her trance.
          
                 she rinses her hair and squeezes some shampoo into her hand.
                 starts a nice lather.
          
                 from behind: karen works the shampoo into her scalp.   but,
                 as she does, we see something...
          
                 ... a pale hand buried under her hair, as if someone is
                 behind her, with a hand on her head.
          
                 karen's fingers brush the hand.   she cries out and turns --
          
                 -- there's no one there.   she's alone.
