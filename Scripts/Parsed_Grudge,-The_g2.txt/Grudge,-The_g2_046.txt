          45   int. the house - rear room - day                             45
          
               emma stands in the dead center of the empty bedroom.
          
               looking directly up at the ceiling.
          
               susan enters, placing the ceramic cat on the shelf where
               karen found it earlier. except susan faces it into the room.
          
                                   susan
                         c'mon, mom. you know what the
                         doctor said about stairs.
          
               she takes emma's hand, but the old woman doesn't move.
          
               matthew and jennifer enter, worried.
          
                                     matthew
                         she okay?
          
                                    susan
                         mom?   what is it?
          
               everyone follows her gaze to the ceiling.   only emma has the
               unmistakable look of dread on her face.
          
               a long beat.
          
          46                                                                46
