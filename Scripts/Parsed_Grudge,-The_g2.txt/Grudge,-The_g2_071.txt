               nakagawa and igarashi come upstairs, their men following
               close behind.
          
               they pause in the hallway for a moment. then nakagawa walks
               into the rear room (matthew's office). the beeping is close.
          
               he stands there, in the center of the room, listening.
          
               then he looks up, at the ceiling.    everyone follows suit.
          
               nakagawa turns to the closed closet doors.
