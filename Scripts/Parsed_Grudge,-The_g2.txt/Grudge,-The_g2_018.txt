               int. the house - second floor hallway - dusk
               karen steps into the hallway and listens.   there it is again,
               and this time there's no doubt --
          
               the sounds are coming from the room by the stairs.
          
               karen walks to the door. she pauses, disturbed by the eerie
               sounds from inside. then she reaches for the doorknob.
          
               thud. thud. karen hesitates. the strange rhythmic thudding
               continues, coming from beyond the door.
          
                                   karen
                             (nervous:)
                         hello?
          
               karen takes a breath.   and turns the doorknob.
          
          19                                                                19
