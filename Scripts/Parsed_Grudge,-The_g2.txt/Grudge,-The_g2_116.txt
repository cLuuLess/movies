                 ext. the house - day
                 it's the most beautiful we've ever seen it.   a lush
                 springtime bloom fills the trees and bushes around the place.
          
                 voices off-screen (japanese) are audible, getting closer --

          on karen, as she is surprised to see...
          
          kayako. beautiful and meek. she's smiling, walking hand-in-
          hand with takeo. a happy couple.
          
          as they reach the front door and go inside, kayako turns back
          to the front gate. she smiles and gestures, "come on".
          
          and then toshio walks forward, through the gate.   his
          attention is on a tiny black kitten in his arms.
          
          at the door, toshio turns to look back over his shoulder --
          
          -- directly at karen. they hold each other's gaze for a
          moment, as if he somehow sees her in the ambulance.
          
          then kayako gestures to toshio, and he turns away, entering
          the house and closing the door.
