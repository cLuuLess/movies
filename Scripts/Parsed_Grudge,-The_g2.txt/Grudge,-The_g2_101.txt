          119   int. college - peter's office - day (three years ago)       119
          
                the same group photo is in a frame on peter's desk.
          
                peter stands behind the desk, using a small mirror to knot
                his tie. his open door reads: `department of english'.
          
                a co-worker (20s, japanese) enters with a stack of mail.
          
                                    peter
                          happy monday.
          
                                    co-worker
                          yeah, right. here's your mail.
          
                he hands it to peter. on the top is a small blue envelope.
                the name in the return address is `kayako'.
          
                                          revisions (blue) -- 1/26/04       79.
          
          
          
                                     co-worker
                           another one, huh?
          
                 peter shakes his head, looking distastefully at the letter.
          
                                     peter
                           i don't even know her. she says i
                           used to tutor her, but i don't know
                           who the hell she is.
          
                 the co-worker shrugs and leaves.    disturbed, peter fingers
                 the blue envelope.
          
                 his eyes go to one of his desk drawers.    he slides it open.
          
                 more blue envelopes are inside.    all from `kayako'.
          
                 peter's face darkens.   he dumps the letters into a trash can.
