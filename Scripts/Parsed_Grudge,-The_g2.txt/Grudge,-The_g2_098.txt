          114   int. karen's apartment - living area - day                 114
          
                there's the sound of the front door unlocking and doug
                enters, carrying a bag. he closes the door behind him and
                walks in, turning the corner --
          
                -- finding karen, looking a bit dazed, standing right there.
                he's startled, but quickly recovers:
          
                                    doug
                          i come bearing gifts.
          
                karen smiles weakly. she takes the bag and enters the
                kitchen. he watches her go, worried. then he notices --
          
                her desk. doug walks over, looking at the printouts she's
                taped to the wall. and the photo of the house in the center.
          
                bewildered, he sits down, leaning forward and taking a good
                look. his eyes stop on the picture of toshio.
          
                doug turns to see karen staring at him from the kitchen.
                it's an awkward moment: he's concerned, but doesn't know
                what to say. and neither does karen.
          
                finally she approaches, looking at toshio's picture:

                               karen
                     that's the boy who was there
                     yesterday. in that house. but
                     this boy, he's --
          
          her voice trembles, her fear showing through.
          
                               karen
                     -- he's supposed to be dead.
          
          a beat.   karen's eyes plead with doug.
          
                               karen
                     i saw him, doug. i talked to him.
                     he told me his name. a boy who was
                     killed by his father three years
                     ago told me his name.
          
          doug looks away, shaking his head.
          
                               karen
                     you don't believe me.
          
                               doug
                     how can i believe you, karen?
          
          karen's face darkens.   before she can retort --
          
          -- the phone rings. as karen walks across the room to answer
          it, doug starts reading the newspaper article.
          
                               karen (into phone)
                     hello?
          
          she listens.   her face slowly drops.
          
                               karen
                         (almost a whisper:)
                     what?
          
          she numbly lowers the phone.   doug turns to her, seeing that
          something's very wrong.
          
          snapping to life, karen walks to the desk, picking up the
          photo of peter and maria's condo and a map of tokyo.
          
          doug puts a hand on her shoulder.    she finally looks at him.
          
                               karen
                     alex and yoko are dead.
          
          doug, surprised, doesn't know what to say.   karen doesn't
          give him a chance to figure it out:

                              karen
                        (intense:)
                    there's something wrong with that
                    house, doug. something really bad.
                        (re: peter's photo)
                    the boy in that house, he had a
                    photo of this man. he died on that
                    same day three years ago. i need
                    to talk to his wife... widow. if i
                    can find out what happened, or
                    if... maybe --
          
                              doug
                    maybe, what?
          
          karen pulls away, making for the door.   doug follows.
          
                              doug
                    i'm concerned about you going out
                    while you're so upset --
          
                              karen
                    you don't understand.   i have to,
                    doug.
          
                              doug
                    why?
          
                              karen
                    because i've been inside that
                    house, doug. don't you get it?
                    i've been inside!

          a beat. we see the resolve come over karen's face.   she
          reaches out and touches doug tenderly.
          
                              karen
                    i love you. but i have to go.
          
          she leaves.
          
          doug, troubled, turns back to the desk.
          
          he looks up at the wall, tracing a finger over the photo of
          the house. beneath it, is the address...
