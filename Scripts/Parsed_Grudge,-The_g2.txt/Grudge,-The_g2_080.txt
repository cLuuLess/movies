               yoko stumbles back into the room.   her eyes fixed on --
          
               -- the doorway: the creeping darkness is now coming in
               around all sides, not just the bottom.
          
               yoko backs up to the bed, still clutching the cordless phone.
          
               she looks back at the door, suddenly crying out --
          
                                        revisions (blue) -- 1/26/04         50.
          
          
          
               -- a black cat sits in the doorway. tail wrapped around
               itself, sitting perfectly still, like a statue. staring at
               yoko with its yellow eyes. something unnatural about it.
          
               yoko backs away towards the closet.   nowhere to go.
          
               the cat suddenly hisses at her --
          
               -- and that's all yoko can take.    in a panic, she opens the
               closet door, ducks inside.
