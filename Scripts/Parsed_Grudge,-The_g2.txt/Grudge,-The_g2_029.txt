               int. the house - living room - day
               close on the same package, a microwaveable soup bowl, now
               open with a spoon sticking out of it. resting, with a glass
               of water, atop the kotatsu table.
          
               pan to reveal a pair of feet on the lip of a moving box next
               to the table. it's jennifer, asleep on the couch.
          
               a clattering sound wakes her, followed by the sound of
               footsteps running away. we pull back as jennifer sees her
               bowl, and the glass next to it, have been knocked over.
          
               she sits up, looking into the tatami room. emma sits on the
               edge of her mattress, staring blankly at her.
          
               jennifer gets up, sternly walks over.
          
                                   jennifer
                         if you need something, all you have
                         to do is say so --
          
               she stops short as she sees...
          
               footprints. formed from the broth, and noodles, of her
               spilled soup. they're the footprints of a child.
          
               and they lead away from the back room, down the main hallway.

               jennifer looks back up to see emma watching her.
