                ext. the house - night
                nakagawa stands at the front door.    gathering his courage.
          
                                           revisions (blue) -- 1/26/04       66.
          
          
          
                 he opens the door.   nothing but yawning darkness inside.
          
                 nakagawa picks up two heavy objects, one in each hand, and,
                 ducking under the police tape, enters the house.
