                 int. the house - bathroom - night
                 nakagawa's eyes widen as the door swings open.     he sees --
          
                 a young boy kneeling by the edge of the tub, overflowing with
                 water. his head hangs below the surface.
          
                 nakagawa immediately drops to the boy, lifting his lifeless
                 head from the water. it's toshio. he's dead. drowned.
          
                 before nakagawa can understand what's happening, the boy's
                 eyes suddenly open, fixing on nakagawa --
          
                 -- and then a pale hand grabs nakagawa's head from behind and
                 roughly pushes it into the water, holding him under.
          
                 nakagawa's legs flail and kick as he struggles, his screaming
                 muffled by the water. but finally, his legs become still.
