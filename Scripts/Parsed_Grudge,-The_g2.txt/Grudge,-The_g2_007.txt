               karen pokes her head inside the genkan (entry hall).
          
                                    karen
                         hello?   mrs. williams?
          
               nothing. she tentatively steps inside, and the door closes
               behind her. it's dark and musty -- the blinds are drawn.
          
                                   karen
                         is anyone here?
          
               she turns and locks the front door.
