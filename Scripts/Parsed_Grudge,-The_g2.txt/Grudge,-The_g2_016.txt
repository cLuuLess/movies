               int. the house - entrance - dusk
               karen steps into the foyer with the vacuum cleaner. she
               looks up at a railing overhead. some trash is visible
               sticking over the edge. karen shakes her head:
          
                                   karen
                         how did you get up there?

               she gathers up the vacuum and heads up to the second floor
               hallway. there's a nearby door, closed (the front room), and
               an open door at the end (the rear room).
          
               as she looks for an outlet, she hears a scratching sound.
          
               karen stands there for a moment, listening.    silence.
          
               then she walks towards the open door at the end of the hall.
