               ext. the house - day
               it's an overcast afternoon.  swollen clouds hang low over
               the house. it looks a bit more imposing than usual.
          
               the mailbox is adorned with the japanese equivalent of a "for
               sale" sign -- weather-worn, and looks like it's been there
               for years.
          
               suzuki (30s, japanese), a real estate agent, waits by the
               gate. then he notices something. waves, and smiles.
          
               it's susan, approaching with matthew, jennifer and emma.
          
               susan shakes suzuki's hand and they exchange a greeting in
               japanese. she turns to her brother.
          
                                   susan
                         this is suzuki-san, he's the real
                         estate broker.
          
               suzuki bows at matthew and jennifer, says something.
          
                                   matthew
                         what did he say?
          
                                   susan
                         he said: "welcome to tokyo". and
                         that you must be very important to
                         your company for them to rent this
                         place for you.

               matthew grins.   susan rolls her eyes.
