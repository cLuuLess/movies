                susan comes up the stairs, worried.
          
                                     susan
                          mom?   where are you?

                susan looks inside -- emma isn't there. she's about to leave
                when something catches her attention. she walks to
          
                the closet. the door is open. susan kneels down, looking at
                something inside it. she picks it up --
          
                -- it's the ceramic cat karen found earlier. as susan
                examines it, she notices something on the wall of the closet
                (which we don't see). her face softens, and she smiles.
          
                                    matthew (o.s.)
                          did you get her?
          
                                    susan
                              (under her breath:)
                          take a pill, will ya?
          
                susan stands and walks out of the room. but we stay in the
                closet, panning to reveal the closet wall. it's covered with
                black crayon, low to the ground, the work of a child. the
                images are dozens of black cats.
