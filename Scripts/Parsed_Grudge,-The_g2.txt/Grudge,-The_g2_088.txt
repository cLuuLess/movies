          99   int. morgue - day                                            99
          
               the coroner sits on a stool, staring at the floor. two
               bodies lie under bloody white sheets on two steel tables.
               between them is a small cart -- a bloody cloth on top.
          
               nakagawa and igarashi enter. the coroner stands, nervous.
               he walks to one of the tables and pulls back the sheet.
          
                                   nakagawa (in japanese)
                         have you determined a cause of
                         death?
          
                                   coroner (in japanese)
                         not yet. the blood on his body --
                         isn't his. it belongs to her.
          
               he points to the other table.    but doesn't look at it.

                                 nakagawa (in japanese)
                       i don't understand. he killed
                       yoko, before he died?
          
          the coroner shakes his head. nakagawa looks to igarashi,
          then walks up to the second body, pulling back the sheet.
          
          it's yoko.    still missing her jawbone.
          
          nakagawa and igarashi stare down at her in disbelief.
          
          the coroner walks to the small table, removing the cloth.
          yoko's jawbone is underneath it.
          
                                 coroner (in japanese)
                       the jawbone you found in the attic
                       yesterday with the american couple
                       belongs to this girl. i estimate
                       it was -- removed -- from her body
                       two or three days ago.
          
                                 igarashi (in japanese)
                       but i thought you said her body was
                       found with this man, tonight.
          the coroner nods.    eyes on his shoes.
          
                                 nakagawa (in japanese)
                       then how did she get from the house
                       to the health center?                                
          
          the coroner, lost in his imagination, answers quietly:
          
                                 coroner (in japanese)
                       i have no idea.
          
          a beat.   nakagawa walks to the jawbone.   stares at it.
          
                                 nakagawa (in japanese)
                       she survived for two days without
                       this?
          
                                 coroner (in japanese)
                       it would seem so.
          
                                 nakagawa (in japanese)
                       how is that possible?
          
          the coroner looks up at him, his face pale.
          
                                 coroner (in japanese)
                       i don't believe it is.
