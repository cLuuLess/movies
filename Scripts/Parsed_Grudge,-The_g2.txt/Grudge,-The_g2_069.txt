               igarashi stands by the answering machine.    the message
               counter reads `1'. he presses play.
          
               susan's message replays, and he listens carefully. as it
               ends, he turns to see nakagawa standing in the doorway.
          
                                   igarashi (in japanese)
                         that's matthew's sister.
          
               he shows nakagawa a photo of matthew and susan, brother and
               sister, grinning at the camera.

                         this must be her.
          
               the look on nakagawa's face is grave.
          
                                   nakagawa (in japanese)
                         call her at work, then at home. if
                         no one answers, send someone to --
          
               he trails off, looking down at --
          
               -- the phone base.   the cordless phone is missing.
          
               nakagawa reaches down, pressing the `locate' button.
          
               a distant beeping sound can be heard.
          
               everyone in the room stops what they're doing.    they listen.
