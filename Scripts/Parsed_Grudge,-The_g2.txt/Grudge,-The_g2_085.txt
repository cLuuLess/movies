          91   int. hospital room - night                                      91
          
               nakagawa's stern voice is muffled by the closed door.    karen
               sits back in bed, disturbed.
          
               then her attention turns to the file on the table.
          
               she considers.   then reaches for it.   opens it.
          
               it's a police report, in japanese.
          
               karen scans it, and turns the page.     she draws a breath --
          
               -- it's a photo of the house. cordoned off with police tape.
               an ambulance out front. like the scene she just left...
          
               ...only the picture is dated three years ago.
          
               three detectives are visible beyond the open front door,
               conferring in the entryway.
          
               the photo of the house is attached to a police report, with
               three pictures. a stern-looking japanese man (takeo), a
               somber woman (kayako), and a young boy we know very well --
          
               karen makes the connection. she picks up the taped-up photo
               and compares it to the file... the boy and his father are the
               same as in the newspaper.
          
               karen gently touches the "missing" face of kayako -- then her
               eyes move to the picture of the boy.
          
               her eyes widen as she reads the japanese text under his face:
          
                                     karen
                         toshio...
          
          92                                                                   92
