               jennifer follows the damp footprints. they're getting
               lighter, and cease altogether in the foyer.
          
               she stands there for a moment, bewildered. then she tenses,
               as if sensing she's being watched. she slowly turns to see --
          
               -- a black cat. sitting on the first landing of the stairs.
               staring at her with bright yellow eyes.
          
               as jennifer takes a step towards it --
          
               two child's hands reach around the corner, and pick up the
               cat, pulling it out of view.
          
               jennifer freezes.
          
                                    jennifer
                          who's -- who's there?
          
               no response. she walks up the stairs and looks around the
               corner. nothing there.
          
               she takes a deep breath, and starts to climb.
          
          31                                                                  31
