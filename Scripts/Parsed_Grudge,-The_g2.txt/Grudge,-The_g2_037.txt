          37   int. the house - living room - night                         37
          
               a stack of books sit on the very top of a tall bookshelf.
               scissors and a roll of duct tape rest atop them.
          
               matthew pushes everything aside to get at a japanese/english
               dictionary underneath. the duct tape falls to the floor.
          
               he tears across the room to the phone base -- but the
               cordless phone is missing.
