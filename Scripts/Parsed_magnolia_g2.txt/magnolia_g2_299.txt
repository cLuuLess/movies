     int. earl's house - that moment

     frank lifts his head and watches the frogs fall outside the house. 
     earl looks to frank....he musters something...frank notices....

     all sound drops out except for the breathing of frank and earl.

                                earl 
                      you are not what you think you are. 

     frank breaks down. 

                                                                cut to:
