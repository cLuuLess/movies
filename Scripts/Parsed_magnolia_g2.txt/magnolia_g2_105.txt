     int. hotel suite - moments later

     frank is getting his mic put on, gwenovier has a small video crew
     with her.  they both get touched up for the interview, frank's
     talking away; 

                                frank 
                      i swear to fucking-god, i do one-a-my
                      seminars, i'm superaman! i'm batman! 
                      i'm like a fucking action hero the way 
                      i feel afterwards, like i could walk out 
                      this door, down the street, pick up any fuckin'
                      pootie i see that has even one second to stop -- 

     gwenovier gives a little snap and finger gesture to her cameraman
     to start rolling; 

                                gwenovier 
                      all it takes is one second?

                                frank 
                      just one look, one hesitation, 
                      one subtle gesture for me to know --
                      and bing-bam-boom i'm away on a 
                      tangent -- i get so fuckin' amped 
                      at these seminars and lemme tell you
                      why: because i am what i believe.
                      i am what i teach, i do as i say, 
                      i live by these rules as religiously
                      as i preach them: and you wanna know 
                      what? i'm gettin' pussy left, right,
                      up, down, center and sideways. 

                                gwenovier 
                      i'm gonna start rolling -- 

                                frank 
                      -- go, go, go.  i'm givin' pearls here.
                      and i'ii tell you samethin' else: 
                      i'm not succeding in the bush because
                      i'm frank tj mackey.  if anything, 
                      there are women out there that want 
                      to destroy me -- it makes it twice as
                      hard for me, i run into some little 
                      muffin, knows who i am, knows my schemes
                      and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna 
                      fuck around, prove to her friends, say,
                      "yaddda-yadda-yadda, i saw that guy, he 
                      wasn't anything, didn't get me."  so me?
                      i'm runnin' on full throttle the whole 
                      fuckin' time.  dodging bullets left and
                      right from terrorist blonde beauties.
                      but i'ii tell you this: the battle of 
                      the bush is being fought and won by team
                      mackey.  can i have a cigarette? 

                                gwenovier
                      ok.  so, lemme just ask you a couple
                      questions to start --

     captain muffy hands frank a cigarette, lights it for him.

     video camera's pov - it's zooms in to close up of frank.  he exhales;

                                frank 
                      what do you want to know?

                                                                cut to:
