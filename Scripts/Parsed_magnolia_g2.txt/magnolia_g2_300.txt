     int. lamplighter - that moment

     stanley and worm.  camera holds as all around...through the glass 
     windows...it rains frogs....smashing to the ground.....hitting a couple
     odd parked cars...they sit, watching, stunned...in a sort of daze.
     stanley seems almost happy.  worm shocked, scarred; 

                                worm
                      what is that?

                                stanley 
                      it's frogs.  it's raining frogs. 

                                worm 
                      ...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs? 

                                stanley 
                      it's raining frogs from the sky. 

                                worm 
                      ....what the fuck, what the fuck....

                                stanley 
                      this happens....this is something that happens. 

                                worm 
                      what the fuck is goin' on, what the
                      fuck is going on? 

     cu - stanley.  hold on his face extremely tight.

     in the reflection of his eye, we see the frogs falling....
     past the neon sign that reads "fresh coffee."

     angle, dixon.  he comes running into the lamplighter and over to worm
     and stanley....he's scarred shitless and frantic -- 

                                dixon 
                      daddy! dad! dad what the hell is goin' on?

                                worm 
                      stay quiet...stay quiet, son -- 

                                dixon
                      let's go, let's go, let's get his money
                      and go -- did you get his money? did
                      you get it?  did you get his money, dad?

                                worm 
                      no, son...be quiet...be quiet now... 

                                dixon 
                      c'mon, dad.  we gotta just get his 
                      money and go, let's go. let's get the money -- 

                                worm 
                      we're not gonna do that now.  we're 
                      not gonna do that now and that's over. 

                                dixon 
                      bullshit. bullshit, dad we need
                      to get his money and go.

     dixon takes out a large police issued revolver, aims at stanley's face.

                                dixon 
                      give us your money man.

                                worm
                      son, don't -- 

                                dixon 
                      bullshit, bullshit dad we gotta get
                      his money -- 

                                worm
                      -- no.

                                dixon 
                             (to stanley)
                      give us your money. 

                                worm 
                      put the gun down, please, boy. 

                                dixon 
                      give us your money, kid.

                                worm 
                      son, please, now....

                                dixon 
                      dad -- 

                                worm 
                      please, boy, put it down and it's ok.

     dixon starts to get nervous and well with tears...he shakes a
     little....

                                worm
                      it's ok -- 

                                dixon 
                      we gotta get his money so we can get
                      outta here -- we gotta --

                                worm 
                      that idea is over now. 
                      we're not gonna do that now. 

     dixon starts crying and shaking and backing away -- 

                                dixon 
                      daddy, fuck, daddy, don't get mad at me.
                      don't get mad at me --
                                (to stanley)
                      just gimme your money. 

                                worm 
                      i'm not mad, son, i will not be mad 
                      at you and it's ok and please put it

                                dixon
                      dad. 

     dixon starts to lower the gun a bit, crying and shaking....he lowers
     the gun and hands it over to his father....dixon is sort of 
     flinching....the possibility that his father may strike him... 

     ...stanley is frozen...dixon is hyperventilating....

                                dixon
                      i - just - thought - that - i - didn't
