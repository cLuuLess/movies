     int. claudia's apartment - that moment. **

     claudia finishes throwing her drugs into a dirty t-shirt and throwing
     that dirty t-shirt into her laundry basket.  jim kurring bangs away at
     the door. 

                                jim kurring (oc)
                      open the door. 

                                claudia
                      i'm coming!

     she runs towards the door, takes a small fall on the way, recovers,
     opens up; 

                                clauida
                      yeah. hi. hello. 

     reverse, close up - jim kurring - 40fps. 
     camera pushes in on him a little bit at his first sight of claudia. 

                                jim kurring
                      ...yeah... 

                                claudia 
                      i'm sorry, i had to get dressed. 

     wider angle reveals jim kurring, in a bit of a daze, standing with 
     his billy club removed and at the ready.  he stands back...they have
     shout above the music;

                                jim kurring 
                      -- you the resident here? 

                                clauida
                      yes. 

                                jim kurring
                      you alone in there? 

                                claudia
                      yes. 

                                jim kurring 
                      no one else in there with you? 

                                clauida
                      no, what's wrong? 

                                jim kurring 
                      you mind if i come in, check things? 

                                claudia
                      for what? 

                                jim kurring 
                      ok. for one thing, we're gonna 
                      need to turn that music down so
                      we can talk, ok? 

                                claudia
                      i'm sorry. 

     she turns and jim kurring moves to replace his billy club, but misses
     the holster and it falls straight to the floor, slides down the steps. 

     claudia turns the music down, turns back and sees that he is gone.

     jim kurring grabs his billy club from the bottom of the steps and
     bounces back up and into the apartment as if nothing happend; 

                                jim kurring
                      you live alone? 

                                clauida
                      yes. 

                                jim kurring
                      what's your name?

                                clauida
                      claudia. 

                                jim kurring
                      claudia what?

                                claudia
                      wilson. 

                                jim kurring 
                      ok.  claudia wilson: you tryin' to go deaf? 

                                claudia
                      what? 

                                jim kurring 
                      did you hear what i said? 

                                claudia 
                      yeah, but i don't know -- 

                                jim kurring 
                      -- listenin' to that music so loud:
                      you tryin' to damage your ears?

                                claudia
                      no. 

                                jim kurring 
                      well if you keep listenin' to the
                      music that loud you're not only
                      gonna damage your ears but your
                      neighbors ears.

                                claudia 
                      i didn't realize it was that loud. 

                                jim kurring 
                      and that could be the sign of a damaged
                      ear drum, you understand? 

                                claudia
                      yeah. 

                                jim kurring 
                      you got the tv on too, keep those
                      on at that same time usually? 

                                caludia 
                      i don't know -- i mean.  what is this? 

                                jim kurring 
                      have you been drinkin' today,
                      doin' some drugs? 

                                claudia
                      no.

                                jim kurring 
                      i got a call of a disturbance, screaming
                      and yelling, loud music.  has there been
                      some screaming and yelling? 

                                claudia 
                      yes.  i had someone come to my door, 
                      someone i didn't want here and i told them
                      to leave -- so -- it's no big deal.
                      they left.  i'm sorry. 

                                jim kurring
                      was it a boyfriend of yours?

                                claudia 
                      no. 

                                jim kurring 
                      you don't have a boyfriend? 

                                claudia
                      no.

                                jim kurring
                      who was it? 

                                claudia
                      i was...he's gone...i mean it's not.
                      it's over, y'know -- 

     jim kurring snoops a bit, she rubs her nose, nervous.  jim kurring
     heads closer to bedroom --

                                jim kurring
                      you mind if i check things back here? 

                                claudia
                      it's fine. 

     jim kurring heads into the bedroom, looks around, stands by the 
     laundry basket --

                                claudia 
                      what are you lookin' for?

                                jim kurring 
                      claudia: why don't you let me 
                      handle the questions and you handle
                      the answers, ok? 

                                claudia
                      ok. 

                                jim kurring
                      you just move in here? 

                                claudia 
                      about two years ago.

                                jim kurring
                      bit messy.

                                jim kurring 
                      i'm a bit of a slob myself. 

                                claudia
                      yeah. 

                                jim kurring 
                      you and your boyfriend have a party
                      last night? 

                                claudia 
                      i don't have a boyfriend.
