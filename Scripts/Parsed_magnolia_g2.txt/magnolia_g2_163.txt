                                linda
                      i don't want him to die, i didn't love him 
                      when we met, and i've done so many bad things
                      to him that he doesn't know, things i want 
                      to confess to him, but now i do: i love him.
                      i love him so much and i can't stand -- he's going. 

                                kligman 
                      what kind of medication are 
                      you on right now, linda that's -- 

                                linda 
                      this is not any fucking medication 
                      talking, this isn't -- i don't know. 
                      i don't know -- can you give me nothing? 
                      you have power of attorney, can you see him, 
                      can you, in this final fucking moment, go see
                      him and make sure --- change the fucking 
                      will -- i don't want any money, i couldn't
                      live with myself, this thing i've done --
                      i've fucking done so many bad things -- 
                      i fucked around.  i fucked around on him, 
                      i fucking cheated on him, alan. you're his lawyer,
                      our laywer, there, i'm his wife, we are married.
                      i broke the conract of marriage, i fucking
                      cheated on him, many times over, i sucked 
                      other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - 
                           ....fuck....
                      other things i've done..

                                kligman 
                      adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something
                      that can be used in a court to discredit
                      the will or -- linda. linda. calm down. 

                                linda
                      i can't. 

                                kligman 
                      you don't have to change the will, 
                      if what you want to do is get nothing
                      you can renounce the will when it's time.

                                linda 
                      where will the money go? 

                                kligman 
                      well.  considering that there's no one 
                      else mentioned in the will...we'd
                      have to go to the laws of intestacy, 
                      which is -- as if someone died without a will -- 

                                linda
                      what does that mean? 

                                kligman 
                      the money would go to frank.  the court 
                      would put the money in the hands of a relative -- 

                                linda 
                      -- that can't happen.  earl doesn't
                      want him to have the money, the things.

                                kligman 
                      -- unless frank is specifically ommitted 
                      as a beneficiary that's what will happen. 

                                linda 
                      this is so over-the-top and fucked-up
                      i can hardly stand it.

                                kligman
                      linda, you just have to take a moment
                      and breath and one thing at a time -- 

                                linda 
                      shut the fuck up. 

                                kligman
                      i'm trying to help, linda -- 

                                linda 
                      shut the fuck up. shut the fuck up. 

                                kligman 
                      you need to sober up. 

                                linda 
                      now you must really shut the fuck up, please. 
                      shut the fuck up. 

                                kligman
                      linda -- 

                                linda
                      i have to go. 

     she heads for the door. 

                                kligman 
                      let me call you a car, linda. 

                                linda 
                      shut the fuck up. 

     she's out the door.

                                                                cut to:
