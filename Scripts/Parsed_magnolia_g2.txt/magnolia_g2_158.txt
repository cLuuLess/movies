     int. game show set - that moment

     jimmy asks questions.  stanley is visibly uncomfortable; 

                                jimmy
                      kids, adults, i'd like you to put
                      yourself at a picnic.  place yourself
                      there with your family and friends
                      if you'd like -- you'll hear three
                      musical notes and you are to tell me
                      what it might represent that you'd
                      find at a picnic -- the first three notes:

     oc we hear three musical notes.  the "adults" panel lights up,
     todd answers;

                                todd
                      well, jimmy, i know this, i have perfect
                      pitch, you see -- and that would be a-d-e.
                      and that would represent lemonade.

                                jimmy
                      for 250.  next notes, please:

     oc musical notes: e-g-g.

                                todd (buzzes)
                      got it.  that's e-g-g which would be ~egg."

     richard and julia glance at stanley, like "why the fuck aren't you
     answering these questions?" he looks straight ahead. 

                                jimmy
                      for 500 and the third set of notes:

     oc musical notes: b-e-e.

                                todd (buzzes)
                      b-e-e -- and don't get stung.

     the "adults" are now within 200 points of the "kids," on the scoreboard.

                                                                cut to:
