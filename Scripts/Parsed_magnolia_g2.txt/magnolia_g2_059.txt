     camera (steadicam) follows behind jim kurring.  he walks through 
     a courtyard, past some young mexican and black kids playing,
     up a staircase and arrives at a door that is half open;

                                jim kurring
                      hello? 

     he knocks, pushes the door open a bit, steps in:  a very, very large
     black woman, marcie (4os) appears, coming at him, ranting and raving; 

                                marcie 
                      what? what? what now? 

                                jim kurring 
                      quietly, slow down, whoa -- 

                                marcie 
                      you can't just come in here.

                                jim kurring

                                jim kurring

                                jim kurring

                      you one more time: are you alone in here? 

                                marcie 
                      what does it look like? 

                                jim kurring
                      no one else in here? 

                                marcie

                      besides me and besides you in this house? 

                                marcie
                      no.  i said that. 

                                jim kurring
                      are you lyin' to me? 

                                marcie
                      i live alone.

                                jim kurring 
                      maybe so, but i'm gonna ask you one 
                      more time: is anyone else in this house
                      right now? 

                                marcie
                      no i said. 

                                jim kurring
                      ok. what's your name? 

                                marcie
                      marcie. 

                                jim kurring 
                      ok. marice why don't you take
                      a seat for me? 

                                marcie 
                      i preffer to stand. 

                                jim kurring 
                      i'm not askin', marcie. 

     marcie sits down. 

                                marcie 
                      i didn't do anything.

                                jim kurring 
                      maybe you didn't, but i'm here 
                      to find out about a disturbance.
                      some neighbors called said they 
                      heard screaming and a loud crash.

                                marcie
                      i don't know a loud crash.

                                jim kurring 
                      and what about screaming? 

                                marcie 
                      i said: i don't know.  you can't just 
                      come in here and start pokin' around -- 

                                jim kurring 
                      what's this, how did this happen?

     insert, ecu. the floor.
     an ashtray has fallen on the floor, cigarette butts all around.

                                marcie 
                      an ashtray fell, i don't know, maybe
                      last night, i just woke up. 

                                jim kurring 
                      you just woke up.  and what'd you have
                      a party last night, the way this place
                      looks? 

                                marcie 
                      i went out last night. 

                                jim kurring 
                      ok. marcie. starting now i want you 
                      to have a new attitude with me.  the more 
                      you play games, the more suspicious i'm gonna
                      become that you've been up to something.

                                marcie 
                      it's a free country, you can
                      think anything you want.

                                jim kurring 
                      yes i can, marcie.  and until you
                      start givin' me some straight 
                      answers: i'm gonna assume that some
                      mischief has been goin' on here. 

                                marcie 
                      mischief?  what the fuck you talkin'
                      about, mischief? 

                                jim kurring 
                      bad and illegal behavior. that's what i mean.
                      ok?  mischief.  now have you been
                      doin' some drugs today? 

                                marcie
                      no. 

                                jim kurring 
                      you on any medication? 

                                marcie
                      no.

                                jim kurring
                      been drinkin' today? 

                                marcie 
                      it's ten o'clock in the morning -- 

     there's a small thump noise oc. jim turns his head quick and
     looks and marcie freezes. 

                                jim kurring
                      --- what was that? 

                                marcie 
                      i didn't hear anything.

     marcie stands up.

                                jim kurring 
                      no. no. stay down, marcie, sit 
                      back down on that couch -- 

                                marcie 
                      i don't have to do a god damn thing. 

     kurring gets his handcuffs out and handcuffs her wrist to the
     couch, she goes crazy, screaming and yelling the whole time;

                                marcie 
                      what's this? what's this? god damn 
                      bullshit. bullshit. don't put those -- 

                                jim kurring 
                      marcie - calm down. calm down 
                      and don't do this. i want you to stay -- 

     continue with that until he's got her cuffed to the couch. 
     he removes his revolver from his holster and starts to move
     slowly down the hall to the back bedroom -- 

                                marcie 
                      what the fuck is this bullshit? 
                      what the fuck are you doing, motherfucker?
                      mother-god-damn fucker.  where are you goin'?
                      don't go in my god damn bedroom. 

     kurring keeps moving slowly, gun drawn, camera behind him;

                                jim kurring 
                      this is the lapd. if anyone is 
                      back here i want you to come out
                      and i want you to show yourself 
                      to me with your hands in the air -- 

                                marcie 
                      there's no one in there. stay out
                      of my motherfuckin bedroom.

     kurring moves into the bedroom now and sees that the closet is
     closed and probably the only place for someone to be hiding;

                                jim kurring 
                      this is the lapd, if anyone is in
                      the closet i want you to come out 
                      and show yourself to me, slowly and
                      with your hands up -- 

                                marcie (oc) 
                      there's no one in there!

                                jim kurring 
                      marcie - quiet down! now if anyone
                      is in the closet, come out now -- 

                                marcie (oc) 
                      there's no one in my motherfuckin 
                      closet and stay out of my bedroom,
                      stay out of my god damn bedroom.

                                jim kurring 
                      -- do not do this -- my gun is drawn
                      and if i have to open that closet 
                      you will get shot -- step out now. 

     jim inches towards the closet, flips it open real quick and
     stands back, ready for something to jump out -- nothing. 

                                marcie 
                      i told you there was no one in there! 

     jim looks down the hall at marcie who has physically dragged
     the large couch handcuffed behind her; 

                                jim kurring 
                      marcie - do not drag that couch any further! 

     jim's pov, camera dollies in slowly towards the closet. 
     he pushes some sheets aside and burries around to reveal: 

     a dead skinny white man (50s) curled up in a ball on the 
     floor of the closet.  he'd dead and he's been covered in dirty
     laundry.  he has a gag around his mouth.

     hold on jim for a moment, he panics a little and swings his revolver
     towards marcie:

                                jim kurring 
                      what the hell is this marcie? 

                                marcie
                      that's not mine. 

     jim swings the aim of his gun back at the dead body.

                                                                cut to:
