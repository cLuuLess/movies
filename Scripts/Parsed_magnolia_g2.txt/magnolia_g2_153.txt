                                thurston
                      brad, dear?

     brad turns and looks:

                                thurston 
                      who was it that said: "a man of genius 
                      has seldom been ruined but by himself."

                                donnie 
                              (to himself)
                      -- samuel johnson.

                                brad
                      i don't know. 

     donnie looks up at brad.  brad smiles with his braces, donnie looks
     away quick --

                                thurston 
                      it was the lovely samuel johnson who 
                      also spoke of a fella "who was not only 
                      dull but a cause of dullness in others." 

                                donnie 
                      "the" cause of dullness in others -- 

                                thurston
                      picky, picky. 

                                donnie 
                      -- and lemme tell you this: samuel johnson
                      never had his life shit on and taken from
                      him and his money stolen -- who took his
                      life and his money?  his parents? 
                      his mommy and daddy?  make him live this life
                      like this -- "a man of genius" gets shit on
                      as a child and that scars and it hurts and 
                      have you ever been hit by lighting? it hurts
                      and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an 
                      electrical charge that finds it's way across
                      the universe and lands in your body and your
                      head -- and as for "ruined but by himself,"
                      not if his parents take his friggin' life and 
                      his money and tell you to do this and do that and
                      if you don't? well, what -- 

                                patron #1 
                      you're parents took your money you won
                      on that game show? 

                                donnie
                      yes they did. 
                           (turns quick to thurston) 
                      what does that mean, "spoke in the wheel?" 

                                thurston 
                      things go round 'n round, don't they? 

                                donnie 
                      yes they do, they do, but i'll make 
                      my dreams come true, you see?  i will.

                                thurston 
                      this sounds sad as a weeping willow. 

                                donnie 
                      i used to be smart but now i'm just stupid. 

                                thurston 
                      shall we drink to that?

     donnie looks to the television for a moment, starts to tear up, 
     camera pushes in slow to an extreme close up.  he repeats line's from
     his days on "what do kids know?" and does his best jimmy immitation; 

                                donnie 
                      "if a brick weighs one pound plus one 
                      half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?"
                      "well if subtracting the half of brick from
                      the whole brick you got one half of brick,
                      equals one pound so therefore the brick 
                      equals two pounds --" "a little more than 
                      kin and less than kind," is hamlet to claudius.
