     int. apartment #638 - that moment

     an elderly couple (early 60s) are savagely fighting and 
     throwing things. the older man is backing away from the older woman
     who is coming at him with a shotgun. 

                                narrator 
                      -- and it was not uncommon for them 
                      to threaten each other with a shotgun 
                      or one of the many handguns kept in the
                      house -- 

                                older man 
                      put it down, put that fuckin' thing
                      down fay --

                                older woman 
                      -- i'ii fucking tell you. i'll shoot you
                      in the face and end this argument and
                      we see who's right -- 

                                narrator 
                      and when the shotgun accidentaly went off,
                      sydney just happend to pass -- 

     the older woman stumbles a bit on some furniture and the shotgun
     goes off -- fires past the older man's head -- and smashes the 
     window behind him -- sydney falls past and gets shot in the stomach,
     then falls out of frame -- (they're oblivious to this) 

                                older man 
                      you crazy fuckin' bitch what are you doing? 

                                older woman
                      shut the fuck up.

     freeze frame on the two of them yelling and screaming:
