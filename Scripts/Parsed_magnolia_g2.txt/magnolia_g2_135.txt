     int. earl's house/van nuys office space - that moment

     continue w/intercut between phil and chad on the phone.  beat, then: 

                                chad 
                      why don't they have the same last name?
                      they don't have the same last name. 

                                phil 
                      i know -- and i can't really explain that,
                      but i have a feeling there's something, 
                      some situation between them, like they don't 
                      really know each other much or well, something
                      like they don't talk much anymore -- 

                                chad
                      uh-huh. 

                                phil 
                      does this sound weird? 

                                chad 
                      well i'm not sure why you're calling me. 

                                phil 
                      there's no number for frank in any 
                      of earl's stuff and he's pretty out
                      of it -- i mean, like i said, he's
                      dying, y'know.  dying of cancer. 

                                chad 
                      what kind of cancer? 

                                phil
                      brain and lung.

                                chad 
                      my mother had breast cancer. 

                                phil 
                      it's rough.  i'm sorry, did she make it? 

                                chad
                      oh, she's fine. 

                                phil
                      oh that's good.

                                chad 
                      it was scary though. 

                                phil 
                      it's a helluva disease. 

                                chad
                      sure is.  so why call me?

     camera pushes in on earl, asleep in the bed, breathing becomes
     a bit irregular. hold on him. 30fps. 

                                phil 
                      i know this all seems silly. 
                      i know that maybe i sound ridiculous,
                      like maybe this is the scene of the 
                      movie where the guy is trying to get
                      ahold of the long-lost son, but this 
                      is that scene.  y'know?  i think they 
                      have those scenes in movies because they're
                      true, because they really happen. 
                      and you gotta believe me: this is really
                      happening.  i mean, i can give you my
                      phone number and you can call me back 
                      if you wanna check with whoever you can check 
                      this with, but don't leave me hanging on this --
                      please -- please.  see: see: 
                      see this is the scene of the movie where
                      you help me out -- 

                                                                cut to:
