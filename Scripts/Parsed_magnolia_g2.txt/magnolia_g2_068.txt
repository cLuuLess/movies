     int. girl's house - another night
 
     camera (hand held) follows behind the girl as she walks from the kitchen
     to the front door, shaking her head, huffing and puffing....

                                frank (vo) 
                      you wait until about nine o'clock
                      and you ring the doorbell.

     she opens the door and sees frank, crying and hysterical. 

                                frank (vo) 
                      she opens it up, pissed as hell, but
                      finds you sobbing your eyes out -- 

     frank looks up at her and says: 

                                frank
                      ...i can't believe what happened... 

     frank and the girl sit down on the couch together. 

                                frank (vo) 
                      you explain between sobs that you hit
                      a dog on the way over to pick her up
                      and you had to rush it to the animal 
                      hospital but by the time you got there -- 

                                frank 
                      ...and it's paw was sticking out... 
                      and it was too late.  it was too late. 

     she moves in and hugs him. 

                                girl 
                      ohhh, shhhh...shhh...frank...

                                                                cut to:
