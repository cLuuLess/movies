     ext. apartment/la river embankment - that moment

     it's flooding with rain....jim kurring is without gun and he's 
     scared shitless....and he can't see...and he's running for cover
     in some bushes....camera is hand held and wild, following and 
     falling with him....mud and rain and shit everywhere......

     his pov...across a bridge...he sees the slight figure as it flees....
     (could be the black male, but hard to tell in a quick glimpse) he then
     sees another smaller figure scuttle away...

     he doesn't run.....he stays...holds....

                                                                cut to:
