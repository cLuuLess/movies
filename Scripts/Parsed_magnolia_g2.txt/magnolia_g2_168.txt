     int. claudia's apartment - that moment

     camera pushes in real quick on claudia snorting coke from her
     hand in the bedroom -- she rushes back into the kitchen area --

                                claudia
                      ok, ok. i'm back.

                      this is, for not a fresh cup, a great
                      cup of coffee, claudia -- 

                                claudia
                      thank you.

     she sits down, ready to talk, lights a cigarette. 

                                claudia 
                      what do you wanna talk about? 

                                                                cut to:
