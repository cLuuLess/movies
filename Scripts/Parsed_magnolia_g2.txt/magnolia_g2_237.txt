     int. claudia's apartment - that moment/night

     she looks at the coke in front of her.  she hesitates.  her stereo is
     playing a song....it plays softly, then gets a bit louder....

     she leans down and snorts the fat line of coke.  hold on her....she
     starts to sing along with the song....

                                claudia 
                      "..it's not what you thought when you 
                      first began it...you got what you want....
                      now you can hardly stand it though by now 
                      you know, it's not going to stop....."

     the song continues.  the following has each of the principles 
     half singing along with the song, who's lead vocal will stay
     constant throughout. 

                                                                cut to:
