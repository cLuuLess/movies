     int. earl's house - that moment

     frank and phil stand in the foyer.  they're quiet a moment, then: 

                                frank 
                      so....phil....um...i think i'm gonna
                      step in and try and see him and say 
                      something if he can...talk...i mean: 

                                phil
                      ...ok... 

                                frank 
                      can you stand...back...maybe, i mean...
                      just a little bit...in the room is
                      ok, but back from us a little... 

                                phil 
                      yeah.

     frank walks slowly into the living room and over to earl's
     bedside.  he's holding back his tears.  he sits.  earl
     is eyes closed, breathing a bit irregular....hold.

                                frank 
                      ...dad...dad...hey...earl? 

     he tries to wake him a bit, but earl is not moving. 

                                frank 
                      ...hey...dad...dad can you wake up
                      a minute dad?

     he turns to phil, crying now, says: 

                                frank 
                      he's not waking up.

                                                                cut to:
