     int. billingsley's - that moment

     in a secluded table in this dark steak place.  jim kurring and
     claudia.  camera does a slow push in on a 2-shot. 

                                claudia 
                      did you ever go out with someone
                      and just....lie....question after
                      question, maybe you're trying to 
                      make yourself look cool or better 
                      than you are or whatever, or smarter 
                      or cooler and you just -- not really
                      lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --

                                jim kurring
                      well, that's a natural thing, two people
                      go out on a date, something.  they want
                      to impress people, the other person...or
                      they're scared maybe what they say will
                      make the other person not like them -- 

                                claudia 
                      so you've done it -- 

                                jim kurring 
                      well i don't go out very much. 

                                claudia
                      why not? 

                                jim kurring
                      i've never found someone really that
                      i think i would like to go out with. 

                                claudia 
                      and i bet you say that to all the girls -- 

                                jim kurring
                      no, no. 

                                claudia 
                      you wanna make a deal with me? 

                                jim kurring
                      ok.

                      afraid to say things....no guts to 
                      say the things that they...that are real
                      or something... 

                                jim kurring
                      ...yeah... 

                                claudia 
                      to not do that.  to not do that that
                      we've maybe done -- before --
