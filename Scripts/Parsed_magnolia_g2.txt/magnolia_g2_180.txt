     int. smiling peanut bar - that moment 

     the television above the bar holds this moment where stanley won't 
     move.  donnie is seriously fucked up now and the camera pushes in 
     on him.  he glances around, up the television, sees stanley.  beat.

     thurston and the other folks around chat away, etc;

                                donnie
                      ...i'm sick....i'm sick here now.....

     they continue to chat, trying to ignore him now;

                                donnie 
                      i confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....

                                thurston 
                      mmm.hmm. 

                                donnie
                      you see? 

                                thurston 
                      why don't you run along now friend,
                      your dessert is getting cold. 

                                donnie
                      i'm sick. 

                                thurston
                      stay that way. 

                                donnie 
                      i'm sick and i'm in love. 

                                thurston 
                      you seem the sort of person who confuses the two. 

                                donnie 
                      that's right.  that's the first time
                      you're right.  i confuse the two
                      and i don't care. 

     donnie looks to brad, then: 

                                donnie
                      hey.  hey. 

     brad looks.  donnie stands up, backs away from the bar as he talks;

                                donnie 
                      i love you.  i love you and i'm sick.
                                (beat) 
                      i'ii talk to you....i'll talk to you 
                      tommorrow.  i'm getting corrective oral 
                      surgery tomorrow.  for my teeth.  for my 
                      teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. 
                      you have braces.  me too.  me too.  i'm getting
                      braces, too.  for you.  for you, dear brad. 
                      and i don't have any money.  and i don't have
                      any money now but i'ii get it...i will for 
                      you, brad.  i love you, brad.  brad the bartender.
                                (beat, crying now) 
                      you wanna love me back?  love me back and i'll
                      be good to you.  i'ii be god damn good for you. 
                      and i won't be mad if you don't know who said what.
                      i won't punish you if you get the answer wrong.
                      i can teach and tell you: samuel johnson. 

                                thurston 
                      brad, honey, you have a special
                      secret crush over here i think, don't
                      take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --

                                donnie
                      you mind your own bussines.

                                thurston
                      gently, son --

                                donnie
                      brad, i know you don't love me now -- 

                                thurston
                      "it's a dangerous thing to confuse
                      chidlren with angels..." 

                                donnie 
                      -- and you wanna know the common element for
                      the entire group, like he asks...i'll tell you
                      the answer: i'll tell you, 'cause i had that
                      question.  i had that same question....carbon. 
                      in pencil led, it's in the form of graphite
                      and in coal, it's all mixed up with other 
                      impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.
                                (jimmy impersonation)
                      "well...all we were asking was the common
                      element, donnie...but thank you for all that
                      unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, kids!  full of
                      useless thoughts, eh?"  thank you. thank you.
                                (beat) 
                      and the book says: "we may be through with
                      the past but the past is not through with us."
                                (to thurston) 
                      and no it's not dangerous to do that.

     donnie has backed away, close to the bathroom.  he heaves a bit,
     cries, turns and runs for the bathroom -- 

                                                                cut to:
