     int. lamplighter - that moment

     stanley finishes his cookie.  worm, sitting across from 
     him starts to cry a little, very quietly.  he hides it best he can. 

     stanley looks up here and there from his books.  they make another
     moment of eye contact then: 

                                worm
                      hi. 

                                stanley
                      hi. 

                                worm
                      ..sorry... 

                                stanley
                      it's ok. 

     beat. 

                                stanley
                      are you alright? 

     worm looks up. 

                                                                cut to:
