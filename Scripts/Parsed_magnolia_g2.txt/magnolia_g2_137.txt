                      go to break and the lucky team is -- 

     jimmy opens an envelope and reads:

                                jimmy gator 
                      kids in the lead and they get a chance 
                      to pull further and farther ahead -- with
                      the following secret bonus musical question:
                      i will read you a line from an opera
                      and you are to give me the same line
                      in the language in which the opera 
                      was originaly written and for a bonus
                      25 you can sing it.  here's the line: 
                      "love is a rebellious bird that nobody 
                       can tame, and it's all in vain to call it,
                       if it chooses to refuse."

     camera pans and dollies over to the kids and moves in close on stanley;

                                stanely
                      well that was..uh..in french...and that
                      was in the opera, "carmen." and that
                      goes...um... 
                                (sings) 
                      l'amour est un oiseau rebelle
                      que nul ne peut apprivoiser, 
                      et c'est bien en vain qu'on l'appelle,
                      s'il lui convient de refuser.

     the audience applauds and the "carmen," que carries over the
     following scene; 

                                                                cut to:
