     ext. street/ambulance - that moment

     a wide angle where we see the frogs falling onto the moving,
     swerving ambulance....one frog lands so hard on top of the
     red lights on the ambulance that it cracks....

     ...the frogs in the middle of the road start to act as a
     lubricant on the already wet/damp street and the ambulance
     starts to skid sideways....

     ...it falls on it's side. 

                                                                cut to:
