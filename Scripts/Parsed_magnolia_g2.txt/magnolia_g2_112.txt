     int. smiling peanut bar - that moment.

     donnie sits in his booth after two tequila's.  he's slightly fucked up. 
     he gets up, stumbles over to the bar and takes a seat uncomfortably 
     close to thurston, who's now holding court among three or four other
     patrons.  brad the bartender is washing glasses, keeps half an eye on
     things...donnie to thurston; 

                                donnie 
                      you look like you've got money
                      in your pocket.

                                thurston 
                      maybe i'm just happy to see my
                      friend, brad there. 

     the patrons laugh a bit, brad nods, donnie doesn't laugh or look
     anywhere but thurston; 

                                donnie
                      just throw some money around.
                      money, money, money. 

                                thurston
                      this sounds threatening.

                                donnie 
                      do you have love in your heart? 

                                thurston
                      i have love all over.  i even have
                      love for you, friend.

                                donnie 
                      is it real love?

                                thurston
                      well -- 

                                donnie
                      -- the kind of love that makes you feel
                      that intagible joy.  pit of your stomach.
                      like a bucket of acid and nerves running
                      around and making you hurt and happy and
                      all over you're head over heels....? 

                                thurston
                      well you lost me with the last couple
                      of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but 
                      i believe it's that sort of love.
                      sounds nice to me.

                                donnie
                      i have love. 

                                thurston 
                      a very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.

                                donnie 
                      no.  i mean, i'm telling you: 
                      i'm telling you that i have love. 

                                thurston
                      and i'm listening avidly, fellow.
