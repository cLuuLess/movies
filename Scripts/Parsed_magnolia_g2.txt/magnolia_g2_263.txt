     ext. empty parking lot - that moment

     the ambulance arrives at linda's mercedes and the paramedics
     hop out, open the doors, call direction and try to speak with
     her and revive, etc.  camera is hand held and moving frantically
     with them;

                                paramedics (various) 
                      hello, hello, can you hear us, huh? 
                      stay with us, can you hear me...etc. etc. 

     angle, across the parking lot.
     dixon is hiding way across the way in the shadowed, hidden
     parked car, watching the paramedics.  all the while he counts
     the money from linda's wallet. 

                                                                cut to:
