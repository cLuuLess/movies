     int. claudia's apartment - that moment

     claudia and jim kurring talking.  she's rubbing her jaw, blabbing 
     away and he's listening with a grin; 

                                claudia 
                      --- yeah, yeah, i get in it in my ear. 
                      it's tmj is what it's called technically. 

                                jim kurring 
                      what's that stand for? 

                                claudia
                      tempural-something-mandibular,
                      thing with something, i dunno.
                      but it affects my ear, i don't even
                      know if i have tmj exactly but just 
                      very tight, like - it's like a muscle 
                      spasm and it's just gets so clenched -- 

     she's interupted by the call on his radio.  he takes the call.
     (director's note: technical blah-blah-blah,etc.) 

                                jim kurring
                      this is my job. 

                                claudia 
                      we were just gettin' warmed up.
                      we were just getting started. 

                                jim kurring 
                      well if you listen' to that music 
                      too loud again and that fella returns 
                      maybe we'll share another cup of coffee -- 

                                claudia 
                      if you're not here for a 422 -- 

                                jim kurring 
                      no. no.  don't joke about that. 
                      that's not funny, claudia.  please, now.
