     int. earl's house - that moment

     the camera holds on earl and frank.  frank has his head buried 
     in earl's bed holding his hand, crying....it's very quiet....

     cu - phil.  he's crying a bit standing off to the side.
     he looks out the window's and the glass doors and sees the frogs
     come raining down.  his mouth drops and he can't speak.

     frank doesn't notice.  the frogs fall in the backyard and into the pool. 

                                phil
                      there are frogs falling from the sky.

                                                                cut to:
