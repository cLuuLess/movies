     camera moves around his throat and through his body, looking at 
     his blood stream and watching, like a medical film, the cancer as
     it eats away at his body...as we see it at work we hear a whisper
     that is earl's voice: 

                                earl's whisper voice 
                      ...fuckin regret, move through this life....
                      ..and we do these things...get that back... 
                      ...forget, forget....fuck....fuck......
                      ...make it right....and we do these things....
