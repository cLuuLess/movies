     int. earl's house - living room - day

     earl in bed, pretty out of it, but once in a while a couple clear
     moments.  phil sits next to the bed, paper and coffee nearby. 

                                earl 
                      ...n'i dowanna do this...sit here,

                      i reach out for it -- no -- 

     he mimes the action, gets nowhere near the pen. 

                                earl 
                      ...no...no goddamn use.

                                earl

                                phil

                      he's here, in town, y'know, but i

                                phil
                      no.

                      get a girlfriend.

                                phil 
                      she went out.  she said she went 
                      out to run some errands.  she'll be back. 

                                earl 
                      she's a good girl.  she's a little 
                      nuts, but she's a good girl i think.
                      she's a little daffy. 

                                phil
                      she loves you.

                      ...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...

                      to your son?

                                earl

                                phil 
                      there's no asshole like you. 

                                earl
                      ...cocksucker....

                                phil
                      how come every word you say is either 
                      "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?" 

                                earl
                      do me a personal favor --

                                earl
                      you got it. 

     earl gets hit with something and starts to moan a bit.  sharp
     pain hitting him and he touches his hand to his face....

                                earl 
                      ...i can't hold onto this anymore... 

                                phil 
                      i'll get you another pain pill.
                      another morphine pill -- 

                                earl
                      ...gimme that fuckin' phone... 

                                phil

                      do you know? 

                                phil
                      who? 

                                earl
                      jack. 

                                phil
                      is jack your son?

     earl doesn't answer.  he's drifting a bit more now.

                                phil 
                      you wanna call him on the phone?
                      we can call him, i can dial the 
                      phone if you can remember the number -- 

                                earl 
                      -- it's not him. it's not him.
                      he's the fuckin' asshole...phil..c'mere... 

     phil leans in closer to earl. 

                                earl 
                      this is so boring...so goddamn...
                      and dying wish and all that, old 
                      man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing: 

                                phil
                      it's ok. 

     earl hallucinates a bit, cries a little, tries to form the sentences; 

                                earl
                      ...find him on the...frank. his name's
                      frank mackey -- 

                                phil 
                      frank mackey.  that's your son? 

                                earl 
                      that'snotmy name...find lily, gimmme that,
                      give it -- 

     earl tries to grab something near phil's head that is not there.
     he's hallucinating more now, falls asleep a bit, mumbling; 

                                earl 
                      ifyougimmethat....overonthe....fuck....
                      i can't hold ontothis anymore... 

     he gives phil make an imaginary object and falls asleep.  beat. 
     stay with phil a moment as he turns his head, looking around the
     house a moment, looks back to earl. 

                                                                cut to:
