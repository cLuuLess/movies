     int. holiday inn/banquet room - that moment

     captain muffy, doc and gwenovier enter and head tor some seats, 
     camera swings a 180 and moves down the aisle, towards the stage
     as frank speaks -- 

                                frank 
                      number one: get a calendar.  i cannot
                      stress this enough.  this is a simple 
                      item guys.  it's 99 cents at your corner 
                      store: go and get one.  fuck it, if you
                      reach into your packet, you'll see i've
                      been nice enough to include one, 'cause
                      that's the kind of prick i am -- 
                      you're gonna need this calendar and i know
                      it sounds like a small thing, but having it
                      makes all the difference in the world:
                      if you meet a girl and you're 
                      gonna work an a-3 interuption -- 
                      let's say an eight day waiting period before 
                      the next call -- how you gonna know when those
                      eight days are up?  buy a calendar.
                      next move?  mark the calendar. 
                      yeah, yeah, yeah.  what did i pay my eight 
                      hundred dollars for?  to hear frank tell me
                      to buy a calendar and mark it?  just stick 
                      with me and stick by the calendar.  mark it
                      up -- use it to set goals -- if you wanna 
                      make that "friend" something else -- you gotta
                      be hard on yourself, set goals:
                                (beat, to audience) 
                      you, there: and what's your name?

                                                                cut to:
