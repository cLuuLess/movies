     int. earl's house - day

     camera pushes in real fast on the front door as phil parma (20s) enters. 
     he has a flat top, flip shade sunglasses that he flips up and he's
     carrying 7-11 coffee and a donut....camera whips lft to reveal;

     in this nice house in encino, a medical bed has been planted in the 
     middle of the living room.  in the bed is earl partridge (70s) he is
     very thin and bald and he is on his last legs, dying from cancer.

     there are four or five mutt dogs that sleep on his lap and around
     the bed and at the sound of the door they are up and barking.

     a young mexican nurse sits next to earl, motions to phil and his post
     is relieved.  phil moves in next to the bed, pets earl's head; 

                                phil 
                      how's today then? 

                                earl 
                      fuckin' bullshit is what this is. 

                                phil 
                      fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it? 

     camera moves into a close up on earl, moves into his throat, quick
     dissolve into:
