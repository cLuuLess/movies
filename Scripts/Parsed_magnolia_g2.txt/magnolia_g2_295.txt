     ext. sky/int. house - that moment

     camera above jimmy's house, looking straight down and moving
     towards a skylight above the kitchen...a frog enters frame,
     falling straight towards this skylight --

     inside the house,
     jimmy about to pull the trigger...sound drops out.

     the falling frog comes straight through the skylight, smashing
     through....

     ...falls straight down onto jimmy's head....the gun goes off 
     wildly.....smashes the television.......

     jimmy falls to the ground....glass falls from the broken skylight....

     ...more frogs continue to fall through it and into the kitchen
     and around jimmy.....

     ...the bullet into television has sparked something and the socket 
     it's plugged into catches fire.....

     cu - inside the wall, near the socket.
     camera moves in and sees some spark and flash and fire started....

                                                                cut to:
