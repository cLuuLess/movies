     frog falls past, through the tree outside on it's way down.....

     another frog falls...she looks...she walks to the window....

     .....a dozen frogs fall in very quick succesion.....

     over a lamp, which smashes to the floor.....her apartment 
     goes dark....except for street light...more frogs fall and 
     we hear the sound and see them through the window in glimpses.....
