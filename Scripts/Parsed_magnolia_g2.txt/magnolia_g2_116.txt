     int. parent's green room - that moment

     camera pushes in on the parents;

                                rick 
                      -- you cannot do that. you have to 
                      tone it.  don't be real agressive, just
                      subtely abusive.  you must say, "no.
                      you are not leaving this house until
                      that room is cleaned."

                                julia's mom 
                      julia's room is the same way. 

                                julia's dad 
                      like a pig sty.  but it's the outfits 
                      that we're getting into now --

                                julia's mom 
                      you should have seen what she had
                      on walking out the door -- 

                                julia's dad
                      -- all dolled up.

                                julia's mom
                      i said: "no. no. no.  we are not
                      going to a fashion show.  you are
                      going to school."

                                richard's mom
                      -- it's not a fashion show, it's school.

                                julia's mom
                      it is not a fashion show. 

     camera lands over on rick, who's flipping through a brocheure
     for a new mercedes.

                                rick 
                      let's make some fuckin' money, folks.

     they all look to the monitor.

                                                               whip to:
