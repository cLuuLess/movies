     ext. school - moments later

     camera pulls back from the parked car in a new location as stanley gets
     out of the car with his backpacks, rick watches from the driver's seat; 

                                rick 
                      be ready at two -- 

                                stanley 
                      should be one-thirty. 

                                rick 
                      i got an audition, i won't make it 
                      here 'till two, c'mon, i'll see you
                      later. love you. 

                                stanley
                      love you too. 

     rick drives off real quick.  stanley looks around at his backpacks.

                                                                cut to:
