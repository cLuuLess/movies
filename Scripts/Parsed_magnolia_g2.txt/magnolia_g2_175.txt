     int. claudia's apartment - that moment

     claudia hears the radio go off and stands back a bit from her
     door...hold a moment...then there's a knock...she opens up: 

     camera dollies in a little on jim kurring.

                                jim kurring
                      i'm sorry, claudia. 

                                claudia 
                      what is it?  did you forget something? 

                                jim kurring 
                      no, no.  i was wondering...man oh man. 
                      i think i feel like a bit of a scum-bucket
                      doing this, considering that i came here 
                      as an officer of the law and the situation
                      and all this but i think i'd be a fool
                      if i didn't do something i really want 
                      to do which is to ask you on a date. 

                                claudia 
                      you wanna go on a date with me? 

                                jim kurring
                      please, yes. 

                                claudia 
                      well...is that illegal? 

                                jim kurring
                      no. 

                                claudia 
                      then...i'd like to go...what do you want to do? 

                                jim kurring 
                      i don't know.  i haven't thought about
                      it -- you know what -- that's not 
                      true -- i have thought about it.  i've
                      thought about going on a date with you
                      since you opened the door. 

                                claudia 
                      really?

                                jim kurring
                      yeah.

                                claudia 
                      i thought you were flirting with me
                      a little.

     he laughs and she laughs and then: 

                                claudia 
                      do you wanna go tonight?  i mean,

                      and the course is lit up at night -- 

                                claudia

     she closes the door.
