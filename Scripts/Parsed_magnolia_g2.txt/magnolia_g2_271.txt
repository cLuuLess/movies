                      i won't say, no, wait, claudia -- 

     ecu - the two of them. tight, tight 2-shot. she gets up and walks out,
     he follows -- grabs her arm and she whispers, forcefully: 

                                claudia 
                      let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please. 

                                jim kurring 
                      please, what is it, please -- 

                                claudia 
                      just let me walk out, ok? 

     she leaves in tears.  he watches her walk.

                                                                cut to:
