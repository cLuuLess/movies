     int. jimmy's house - that moment

     jimmy, without a real trace of coordination walks from the 
     living room and into

     the kitchen 

     he moves to a drawer and removes a revolver.  his hand is shaking 
     and his hand/eye coordination makes it very hard to grasp
     hold, but he finally does....he's shaking and tearing....

                                                                cut to:
