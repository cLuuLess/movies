     int. claudia's bedroom - that moment

     claudia is asleep. jimmy enters, stands near the edge of the bed.
     after a moment, claudia's eyes open, look over and see jimmy.

                                claudia
                      ...what the fuck is this...? 

                                jimmy 
                      it's me.  claudia.  it's me. 

     she sits up a bit, covers herself, looks past him and sees the
     middle aged guy, sitting in his underwear in the living room,
     watching them.  she looks back to jimmy; 

                                claudia 
                      what do you want? why are you here? 

                                jimmy
                      i'd like to talk to you.  your boyfriend
                      let me in, i just knocked on the door -- 

                                claudia 
                      he's not my boyfriend.

     jimmy hesitates a beat, then:

                                claudia 
                      wanna call me a slut now, something?

                                jimmy
                      no.  no. 

     she starts to move towards tears, nervousness;

                                claudia 
                      what the fuck do you want?

                                jimmy 
                      i want to sit.  i want to talk to you. 

                                claudia
                      don't sit down. 

                                jimmy 
                      ...i want to....i want so many things, claudia.
                      maybe we can just talk to straighten
                      our things out....there are so many
                      things that i want to tell you -- 

                                claudia 
                      i don't wanna talk to you.

                                jimmy 
                      please.  it doesn't have to be now. 
                      maybe we can make a date to sit down, 
                      i didn't mean to walk in on you like this -- 

                                claudia 
                      why are you here, why are you doing this?
                      coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore? 

                                jimmy 
                      i don't want you to think that i'm that
                      way to you -- i'm not gonna call you
                      a slut or something -- 

                                claudia 
                      yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are 
                      doing?  what the fuck are you doing in my house? 

                                jimmy 
                      don't yell, honey.  please don't go crazy -- 

                                claudia

                      the one who's wrong.  you're the one --

                      i have cancer and i'm dying, soon.

                                jimmy 
                      i'm not lying to you, i'm not -- 

                                claudia

                                jimmy
                      baby, please, please -- 

                                claudia

                      i'm not your fuckin' baby -- 

     she moves up in the bed, exposes a bit of her breast, tries to
     cover herself --

                                jimmy 
                      please put your clothes on, please -- 

                                claudia

                      and you deserve it -- you get the fuck out.

                                jimmy
                      honey. 

                                claudia
                      get out. 

     beat.  he stands a moment. 

                                jimmy 
                      your mother wants to hear from you -- 

                                claudia 
                      get the fuck out of here.

     he walks out of the bedroom, past the middle aged guy, who's
     sitting on the couch. 

                                jimmy
                      i'm sorry. 

                                middle aged guy
                      it's alright. 

     jimmy exits.  claudia is shaking and crying and holding herself
     in the covers of the bed. 

     the middle aged guy snorts a line of coke, looks into her; 

                                claudia 
                      can you get your shit and leave, please? 

                                                                cut to:
