                      you things...then you're a lawyer, right? 
                      you can't say things, you can't tell anyone,
                      it's like the privelage, right? 
                      attornery-client, you understand? 

                                kligman 
                      not exactly, linda. i'm not sure where
                      you're going with this -- 

                                linda
                      like a shrink, like if i go to see
                      a shrink, i'm protected, i can say 
                      things -- fuck -- i don't know what i'm doing -- 

                                kligman 
                      linda, you're safe.  ok. it's alright.
                      you're my friend.  you and earl are my clients
                      and what you need to talk about won't leave

                                kligman
                      you can't change his will.  only 
                      earl can change his will.

                                linda 
                      no, no....no, you see...i never loved him.
                      i never loved him, earl.  when i started,
                      when i met him, i met him and i fucked
                      him and i married him because i wanted
                      his money, do you understand? 
                                (beat)
                      i'm telling you this now...this i've never 
                      told anyone...i didn't love him.
                      and now....i know i'm in that will,
                      i know, i was there with him, we were
                      all there together when we made that
                      fucking thing and all the money i'ii 
                      get -- i don't want it -- because i love
                      him so much now...i've fallen in love 
                      with him now, for real, as he's dying, 
                      and i look at him and he's about to
                      go, alan, he's dead...he's moments... 
                                (beat) 
                      i took care of him through this, alan.
                      and what now then?
