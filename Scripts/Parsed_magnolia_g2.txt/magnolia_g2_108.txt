     int. television studio/hallways - that moment

     camera leads/follows the kids from the show; stanley, richard
     (overweight, 12) and julia (child-star-type 11).  they're led by
     cynthia, down the corridors towards the main set --

                                julia 
                      do you still have to do homework? 

                                richard 
                      not as much as i used to.  ever since
                      we started, i haven't really gone in to 
                      school that much because i've been getting
                      more and more auditions -- 

                                stanley 
                      i don't have regular classes anymore. 

                                richard
                      what do you do? 

                                stanley 
                      they just let me have my own study-time,
                      my own reading time in the library. 

                                richard 
                      that's pretty cool. 

                                julia 
                      do you have an agent, stanley? 

                                stanley
                      no. 

                                julia 
                      you should get one, i'm serious, 
                      you could get a lot of stuff out of this -- 

                                stanley
                      like what? 

                                richard 
                      what do you mean, "like what?" 
                      -- you could get endorsments and shit -- 

                                cynthia
                      -- richard. 

                                richard 
                      bite it, cynthia.  you could get free 
                      things from people that want you to
                      endorse their products.

                                julia
                      commercials, a sitcom, an mow or something. 

                                stanley
                      what's mow? 

                                julia
                      movie of the week.  i went up for
                      one this morning with alan thicke 
                      and corey haim --

                                richard
                      was it a call back?

                                julia
                      no.  but i probably will get a call back.

                                richard 
                      if we beat the record, you might get
                      a call back -- 

                                julia 
                      i'll get it because i'm a good actress, richard. 

                                richard
                      saucy-saucy. 

                                cynthia
                      c'mon guys, settle down -- 

                                stanley
                      cynthia? 

                                cynthia
                      what? 

                                stanley 
                      how much time do we have? 

                                cynthia 
                      not enough, what do you want? 

                                stanley 
                      i should maybe go to the bathroom. 

                                cynthia
                      can you hold it? 

                                stanley
                      i don't know. 

                                cynthia
                      just hold it, you'll be fine. 

     they arrive and enter onto the stage -- camera swings around, branches
     away from them and booms up to reveal the set; 

     there is a live studio audience that's being settled into their seats.

     it's a three-camera set up with a floor director roaming around,
     shouting orders, etc.

     there's a spot for the announcer, an old-pro named dick jennings (60s)
     dick is in the middle of doing bad-comedy warm up for the studio
     audience.  he's had a few drinks, etc. 

     the stage itself is a cross between jeapordy/newleywed game/price is
     right.  there's a podium for jimmy gator.  one panel holds "the kids,"
     and one panel holds, "the adults."  there are chaser-lights all around
     and some of the design feels left over from the early days of the show.

     camera hangs out with the kids as they are ushered into their panel,
     which at this moment faces away from the audience and is behind a
     curtain.  julia turns her head, sees something:

                                julia 
                      here they come -- 

     the adult challengers are brought out by an assistant type and loaded
     into their panel.  the adult challengers are:

     black woman named mim macneal(40s) 
     white guy with glasses todd geronimo (20s)
     puerto rican guy named luis guzman (40s) 

     the adults give a couple small glares over to the kids. 

                                richard (sotto) 
                      yeah, yeah, yeah, keep lookin'
                      tough-old folks. 

                                stanley 
                      they look pretty smart, i think. 

                                julia
                      no they don't -- 

                                richard 
                      what are they gonna do -- beat us? 

                                stanley
                      maybe.

                                julia 
                      we're not going out two days before 
                      we set the record, it's not gonna happen. 

                                richard
                      when they want us done, they'll call 
                      in the harvard s.w.a.t team or some shit. 

     camera lands in cu on stanley.  hold. beat. then: 

                                                                cut to:
