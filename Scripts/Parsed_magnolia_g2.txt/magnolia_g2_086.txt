     int. apartment complex/north hollywood - that moment

     camera hangs inside bedroom w/detectives and investigators and 
     county coroner folks as we go through in a series of quick shots.
     (director's note: very technical here. snapshots, ecu's on body,
     procedure, etc.) * see county coroner videotape. 

     in the living room

     camera pushes in past detectives and officers who are exchanging
     information...camera moves towards jim kurring, standing off a bit 
     now, usless to the investigation as far as everyone else is concerned,
     but listening carefully to what they say: 

                                officer
                      identified as porter parker, aged 59.
                      better known as the dead guy in the closet.
                      so says the building guy, this is her
                      husband -- 

                                detective #2
                      -- he's doesn't live here, but he comes
                      around, raises shit, screaming, yelling,
                      something or other --

                                officer
                      there's a son, apparently.  and a kid.

                                detective #1
                      her son?
 
                                officer
                      her son, that's right...and the kid.
                      and they were here and around and
                      from late last night and through the
                      morning, it's screaming and yelling --

                                detective #1
                      and where are they?

                                detective
                      -- they are not to be found.

                                coroner woman
                      -- she's got six hundred dollars and
                      a large box of condoms next to the bed --

                                officer #1
                      and three wedding rings.

                                detective #1
                      ok.

                                coroner woman 
                      -- guys come in, out and around all day,
                      this is the building guy talking --

                                officer 
                      the building guy says the son and the
                      closet guy are always goin' at it --

                                coroner woman
                      that's right. 

                                detective #1 
                      and what is she saying? 

                                officer 
                      not a god damn thing.

     camera lands cu on jim kurring.

     angle, courtyard area - that moment
     another set of detectives/officers/investigators are standing
     over marcie, who sits handcuffed.  she has her best, "i'm not
     saying anything" face on.  again, they're oc througout;

                                officer #2
                      why did you kill him, marcie?

                                detective #3
                      did you kill him? 

                                officer #2 
                      did he hurt you, did he do something? 

                                detective #4
                      how long's he been in there?

                                detective #3
                      you're hurting yourself, marcie. 

                                officer #3 
                      you have the dead body of your husband 
                      in the closet of your apartment, marcie. 

                                officer #2
                      that is not good. 

                                detective #3 
                      you hit him with the ashtray,
                      you strangled him --

                                detective #4 
                      -- tell us he fell and hit his head,
                      but tell us something, marcie. 

                                officer #2 
                      why did you kill him? 

     the main detective from previous steps into frame, says:

                                detective #1 
                      -- marcie: where's your son?  marcie? 
                      marcie?  marcie tell us where your son is now.
                      marcie tell us where your son is. 

     camera arrives cu on marcie. 

                                marcie 
                      i wanna talk to my motherfuckin' lawyer.

     angle, street outside apartment complex - later
     the investigation is wrapping up now and camera (steadicam)
     moves with jim kurring as he heads towards his squad car, 
     talking into his walkie talkie. (dir. note: technical info re:
     disturbance at adress/jim takes call/etc.)

                      10-4.

     out of the group of neighborhood lookie-lo's comes a little black
     kid who starts walking alongside jim kurring as they head away 
     from the scene -- this is dixon, age 10.  he's very small for his age
     and he carries one of those boxes filled with candy bars he's trying
     to sell.  they walk/talk;

                                dixon 
                      how much you pay me for my help? 

                                jim kurring 
                      i think it's more complicated
                      than that little man. 

                                dixon 
                      put me on the payroll, find out,
                      find out wassup -- 

                                jim kurring 
                      you don't just sign up to be a police
                      officer -- it's about three years of
                      training -- ok?

                                dixon 
                      i'm trained, i'm ready to go, you wanna
                      buy some candy to help underprivelaged
                      youth in the -- 

                                jim kurring
                      sorry, little man. 

                                dixon 
                      you wanna take my statement, i'll 
                      perform for you, gotta get paid though,
                      gotta get paid. 

                                jim kurring 
                      why the hell aren't you in school?

                                dixon 
                      no school today.  my teacher got sick. 

                                jim kurring 
                      they don't have substitute teachers
                      where you go to school?

                                dixon 
                      nope.  so what'd they find out in there? 

                                jim kurring 
                      that's confidential information, little man. 

                                dixon 
                      tell me what you know, i'll tell you 
                      what i know --

                                jim kurring
                      no can do.

                                dixon 
                      leave this one to the detectives, 
                      they ain't gonna solve shit, i can

                      give you the gift that i flow -- think 
                      fast -- you wanna know who killed that guy? 

     jim kurring stops at his squad car, turns to dixon;

                      ok. listen. you: c'mere.

                      i can tell you who did it. 

                                jim kurring 
                      are you a joker? huh? tellin' jokes?

                                dixon 
                      not yet -- "give you the clue for 
                      the bust if you show me some trust --"

                                jim kurring 
                      have you ever been to juvenille hall?

                      did you listen to me?
