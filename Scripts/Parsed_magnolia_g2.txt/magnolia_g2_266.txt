     donnie finishes taking the money from the safe....

     ...donnie walks back one of the corridors and heads through
     a door...(again using the key and code)....

     ...donnie enters into the warehouse area and heads for
     the door to outside....

     ...he puts the key into the lock and opens the door....but he
     takes a small stumble back and the key chain that's attached to
     his belt gets stuck, causing him to fall back, down and to the
     ground...with the key snapping off in the lock....

     ..the door is about to shut on him but he stops it with his
     foot....he gets up, grabs the money...leaves with the
     broken key still left in the lock... 

                                                                cut to:
