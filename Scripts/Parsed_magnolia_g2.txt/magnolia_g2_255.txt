     int. jimmy's house - living room - that moment

     jimmy and rose.  they're on the couch.  lights dim.  sitting, talking. 
     she hands him a pill from a bottle with a drink.

                                jimmy
                      i don't think i want that. 

                                rose
                      it'll take the pain away. 

                                jimmy 
                      it's not really pain. 

     she sets it on the coffee table.  drinks a drink herself.

                                jimmy 
                      i gotta ask you for a cigarette, 'cause
                      i don't wanna spend six hours tryin'
                      to get it to my mouth -- 

     she lights a cigarette, puts it in his hand and he struggles
     a bit with his hand/eye coordination....beat, then; 

                                jimmy 
                      how do we do this, then? 

                                rose 
                      we just do it...we do it and we figure it
                      out and we do as we do, i guess... 

                                jimmy 
                      do you love me, rose? 

     she smiles and moves closer to him. 

                                rose 
                      you're my handsome man. 

                                jimmy 
                      i'm a bad person. 

                                rose
                      no.  no. 

                                jimmy 
                      no, i mean:  i'm telling you this, now.
                      you see?  you see i want to make
                      everything clear and clean...and 
                      apologize for me....for all the stupid 
                      things i've done....that will eat me up....

                                rose 
                      you feel like you want to be forgiven
                      for your sins?  honey, you're not on 
                      your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's
                      gonna get you in trouble -- 

                                jimmy 
                      --- don't.  don't.  please.  just...
                      listen to me...honey....
                                (beat) 
                      ...i've done...i've cheated on you.

     rose doesn't move much.  hold.

                                jimmy
                      i've cheated on you and it kills me
                      and the guilt of what i've done...i don't
                      want you to think...maybe you knew,
                      i think that maybe you've known...
                      so i hope that i'm not saying this for 
                      me...for me to make myself feel better
                      about what i've done...but for making 
                      you not feel like you're sitting there 
                      like a jerk...you've been the good one... 
                      you understand...i'm so sorry for all i've done
                      wrong...and this is pathetic...what? 
                      "dying man, confess the sins" something?
                      is it selfish for me to say this?  to 
                      say what i've done...i feel better already.
                      i do...do you hate me? 

     rose takes a long moment, then: 

                                rose 
                      ...no...i don't hate you.
                                (beat) 
                      do you want talk...do you really 
                      want to talk to me and say things 
                      and get things figured out, jimmy? 

                                jimmy
                      yeah. 

                                rose 
                      the question isn't wether or not 
                      you cheated on me, the question is 
                      how many times have you cheated on me? 

                                jimmy
                      will that help? 

                                rose
                      yeah. 

                                                                cut to:
