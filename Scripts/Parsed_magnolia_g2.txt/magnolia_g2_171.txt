     rick walks away with cynthia...

     ...dick jennings has sobered up a bit and is doing bad, "calm
     down/comedy/everything's cool" stuff for the audience....

     ...jimmy and burt and mary stand up and a make up person runs over
     with some water and cleans him up a bit.  burt moves away --

                                floor director

                      back on and go through it -- 

     the floor director starts throwing directions in his headset and
     to the camera people, etc. 

                                                                cut to:
