     ext. ventura blvd. - that moment

     camera moves with the cab a bit....it makes a right hand turn and
     the camera pans and dollies away, over towards a jaguar stopped
     at the intersection....it's making a left turn at the intersection,
     going the same way as the cab did....we push in close and land to 
     see rose behind the wheel....she's in tears....

     light turns from red to green.

                                                                cut to:
