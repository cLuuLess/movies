     int. spector house - day

     camera is hand held and moving around a small apartment, watching a 
     ten year old kid stanley spector (dressed in a suit) as he dumps dog
     food into two bowls for two dogs yapping around his legs while 
     he simultaneously tries to gather his backpacks -- his father enters:
     rick spector (late 30s) starts barking directions; 

                                rick 
                      let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda
                      done that ten minutes ago -- 

                                stanley 
                      we need more dog food -- 

                                rick 
                      -- talk in the car, talk in the car,
                      moves your ass, c'mon -- 

     stanley grabs two backpacks and puts them over each arm.  rick grabs
     another bag....heads for the door....stanley is about to fall over with 
     these two full packs, but reaches for another bag on the floor...
