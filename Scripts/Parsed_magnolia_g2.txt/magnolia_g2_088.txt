     camera (steadicam) follows behind stanley as he heads, with all his
     backpacks, towards rick, who's waiting in the car --

                                rick
                      c'mon, man.

     following stanley's face....he sits in the car....oc we hear rick 
     getting in the driver's seat and starting the enqine...little droplets 
     of rain start to fall on the windshield....
