                      you don't do that, you don't call him,
                      you don't know to get involved in the
                      bussiness of his, of his of my family.

                      understand?  you understand? no one else.
                      there is no one else.  that man, his son
                      does not exist.  he is dead.  he is dead
                      and who told you to do that?

                      he asked that. there is no one but me
                      and him.
