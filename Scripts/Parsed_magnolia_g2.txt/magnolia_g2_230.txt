     int. school library - that moment/evening

     stanley breaks a window.  stanley reaches in and unlocks a lock.
     stanley rummages around the dark school library.  he's soaking
     wet...he accumulates a bunch of books and starts to search for 
     stuff....cu - dissolve images, optical, etc. (child performers,etc) 

                                earl's voice 
                      ....use that regret for you any way 
                      you want...you can use that ok....
                      someone says not to regret or think about 
                      the past, something, mistakes we make.....bullshit.
