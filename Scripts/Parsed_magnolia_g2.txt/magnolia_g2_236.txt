     int. earl's house - that moment/night

     camera cu on the bottle of liquid morphine.  phil's hand comes 
     into frame and takes it....tilt up to his face.

     phil is in tears....he dips the baby dropper in the bottle.....

     earl is out of breath, painfully....phil hesitates, then: 

     cu - the liquid morhphine is dropped into earl's mouth. 

                                                                cut to:
