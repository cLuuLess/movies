     ext. 7-11/parking lot - north hollywood - day

     camera pushes in towards donnie as he pulls into the parking lot
     in his little honda accord.  he's smiling and singing along to 
     a song* as he pulls into a parking space....

     ...but he's going just a bit too fast...and in a flash, he's
     over the parking stopper and up on the curb and taps the glass 
     store front just enough to have glass fall and shatter and displays
     fall over onto the hood of the car....

     camera pushes in on donnie and some people running over to see
     what's happend....

                                donnie
