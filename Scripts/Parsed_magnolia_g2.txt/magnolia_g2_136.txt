     int. holiday inn suite - that moment

     frank and gwenovier doing the interview, camera dollies in slow on each: 

                                gwenovier
                      -- see, i thought you grew up here
                      in the valley --

                                frank 
                      like i said, yeah -- 

                                gwen 
                      and you went to van nuys high, right? 

                                frank 
                      i don't how much i went -- but i was
                      enrolled.  i was such a loser back then. 
                      i was -- misguided, pathetic -- i was very fat.
                      not even close to what i am today. 
                      not the frank tj mackey you're eager to talk
                      to because i was swimming in what was as
                      opposed to i wanted. 

                                gwen 
                      where does that name come from? 

                                frank 
                      what name?  my name? 

                                gwen 
                      it's not your given name, right? 

                                frank 
                      my mother's name, actually. 
                      good question.  you've done you're research. 

                                gwen
                      and "frank?"

                                frank 
                      "frank" was my mother's father. 

                                gwen 
                      ok.  that's why.  i had trouble locating
                      your school records at berkely and ucla.
                      your name change -- they had no official
                      enrollment -- 

                                frank 
                      oh, yeah.  no, no, no.  they wouldn't -- 

                                gwen
                      they wouldn't?

                                frank 
                      no, no, no.  certainly not.  i wasn't
                      officialy enrolled, that's right.
                      was that unclear? 

                                gwen
                      kind of.

                                frank
                      i wouldn't want that to be misunderstood:
                      my enrollment was totally unoffical because
                      i was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up 
                      there.  but there were three wonderful men
                      who were kind enough to let me sit in on
                      their classes, and they're names are: 
                      macready, horn and langtree among others.
                      i was completely independent financially,
                      and like i said: one sad sack a shit. 
                      so what we're looking at here is a true
                      rags to riches story and i think that's 
                      what most people respond to in "seduce,"
                      and at the end of the day? hey -- it may not 
                      even be about picking up chicks and sticking your
                      cock in it -- it's about finding what you can be
                      in this world.  defining it.  controling it and 
                      saying: i will take what is mine.  you just happen 
                      to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck-
                      why-not?  he.he.he.

                                                                cut to:
