     camera (steadicam) follows behind stanley and rick as they run
     in from the rain, through some sliding glass doors, past a security
     gaurd who buzzes them into another set of doors -- 

     they enter a hallway with a bunch of production offices, walking
     swiftly, shaking their wet clothes....the contestant coordinator
     comes walking towards them: cynthia (30s)

                                cynthia
                      there you are, there you are.

                                stanley 
                      where's richard and julia?

                      they're here, they're fine.
                      in the dressing room.
                                (to rick)
                      see you later -- 

     rick gives stanley a pat on the head; 

                                rick 
                      go to it, handsome. 

                                stanley 
                      see you.

     camera holds with rick, does a 180 around him, he turns his
     back to us now, walks a bit, enters a door, into -- 

     the parents green room

     rick greets the other two kids parents: richard's mom (overhweiqht, 50s)
     and richard dad (same) julia's dad and julia's mom (50s) 

                                rick 
                      who's ready to beat the record? 

                                richard's mom
                      jesus you scared us!

                      that was close. 

                                rick

     camera picks up with a young production kid who drops some coffee 
     off for julia's mom...follow him back out into the hallway -- camera
     branches off from him -- moves down another corridor and picks back
     up with stanley and cynthia as they walk and talk;

                      where's the news department at this studio?

                      have in-house instruments?
