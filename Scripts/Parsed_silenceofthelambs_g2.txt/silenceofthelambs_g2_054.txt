               int. air national guard hanger - memphis, tennessee - day

               close on dr. lecter. behind his mask, the alert, searching 
               eyes.

                                     crawford (v.o.)
                         he will...

               officers pembry and boyle

               two sturdy, well-armed, veteran prison guards - are checking 
               dr. lecter's restraints with clever, careful fingers.

                                     boyle
                         welcome to memphis, dr. lecter. i'm 
                         officer boyle, this is officer pembry. 
                         we aim to treat you just as nice as 
                         you treat us. act like a gentlemen, 
                         you'll get three hots and a cot.

                                     pembry
                         but we ain't pussy-footin' with you, 
                         buddy ruff. you get cute, try to 
                         bite somebody? - we'll tie your 
                         asshole in a knot. you savvy?

                                     dr. lecter
                         oh yes, officer pembry. i certainly 
                         do.

               the officers turn away, boyle signing a clipboarded form.

                                     pembry
                              (under his breath)
                         shit, he's just an ol' broke-dick. 
                         won't be no trouble as all if he 
                         don't flip out.

                                     boyle
                         dr. chilton...?

               new angle - wider

               as we see that we're in a vast, dusty hangar. parked to one 
               side: an ems ambulance and four highway patrol cruisers; a 
               dozen troopers stand quietly chatting and smoking over there. 
               prentiss is pacing impatiently, casting anxious glances 
               towards the open hanger doorway.

                                     boyle
                         if you'll please sign right here, 
                         sir, we'll have us a legal transfer.

               chilton instinctively pats his shirt pocket for his gold 
               pen; it's gone. he searches other pockets, with growing 
               unhappiness.

                                     boyle
                         use mine.

                                     pembry
                         here they come.

               two black stretch limousines

               glide smoothly into the hangar, stop. secret service agents 
               pour out of the lead car, form a cordon. a driver opens the 
               rear door of the second car, and krendler steps out, followed 
               by the senator's assistant, with a briefcase, followed, as 
               last, by the senator herself. barely glancing around, she 
               strides towards lecter.

               new angle - dr. lecter and sen. martin

               as she stops, struck by the bizarre spectacle of his 
               restraints. the others instinctively keep a distance, but 
               chilton, with theatrical relish, unstraps and removes dr. 
               lecter's mask.

                                     chilton
                         senator martin, meet dr. hannibal 
                         lecter.

               they stare at one another for a long moment: the senator 
               tense, almost haggard, the madman with his unearthly poise.

                                     sen. martin
                         dr. lecter, i've brought an affidavit 
                         guaranteeing your new rights... you'll 
                         want to read it before i sign.

               he assistant unsnaps his briefcase, reaches for the form.

                                     dr. lecter
                         i won't waste your time and 
                         catherine's time bargaining for petty 
                         privileges. clarice starling and 
                         that awful jack crawford have wasted 
                         far too much already. i only pray 
                         they haven't doomed the poor girl... 
                         let me help you now, and i'll trust 
                         you when it's all over.

                                     sen. martin
                         you have my word. paul?

               krendler raises a pad, poised to take notes.

                                     dr. lecter
                         buffalo bill's real name is william 
                         rubin. i met him just once. he was 
                         referred to me in april or may, 1980, 
                         by my patient benjamin raspail. they 
                         were lovers, but raspail had become 
                         very frightened. apparently rubin 
                         had murdered a transient, and - done 
                         things with the skin. he thought if 
                         i could cure billy, then billy'd be 
                         safe from the police, and he's be 
                         safe from billy... obviously, he was 
                         wrong.

                                     krendler
                         we need his address, a physical descr-

                                     dr. lecter
                         did you nurse catherine?

                                     sen. martin
                              (pause; startled)
                         what...?

                                     dr. lecter
                         did you breast-feed her?

               he flicks his tongue obscenely.

                                     krendler
                         you son-of-a -

               the senator stills him with a hand. she is trembling.

                                     sen. martin
                         yes... i did.

                                     dr. lecter
                         toughened your nipples, didn't it...?
                              (a beat; then rapidly, 
                              bored)
                         six foot one, strongly built, about 
                         190 pounds. hair brown, eyes pale 
                         blue. he'd be about 35 now. he said 
                         he lived in philadelphia, but may 
                         have lied. that's really all i can 
                         remember, senator - but if i think 
                         of any more, i'll let you know.

                                     sen. martin
                              (to the others)
                         let's go with it.

               they start towards the car, but he calls out, stopping her.

                                     dr. lecter
                         senator martin...! you can't trust 
                         jack crawford or clarice starling. 
                         it's such a game with these people. 
                         they're determined to get the arrest 
                         for themselves. the "collar," i think 
                         they say.

                                     sen. martin
                         thank you, doctor. i'll keep it in 
                         mind.

                                     dr. lecter
                         oh, and senator...? love you suit.

                                                               dissolve to:
