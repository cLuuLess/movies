               int. a booklined study

               in a swivel chair, amidst the wreckage of his papers and 
               books, is the writhing figure of dr. frederick chilton. the 
               extreme intricacy of his bindings recalls dr. lecter's own 
               former restraints. his screams are muffled by the tape over 
               his mouth; he stares at dr. lecter like a rabbit trapped in 
               headlights.

               dr. lecter

               considers him for a genial moment, then raises the little 
               pen-knife. his eyes are twinkling.

                                     dr. lecter
                         well, dr. chilton. shall we begin?
