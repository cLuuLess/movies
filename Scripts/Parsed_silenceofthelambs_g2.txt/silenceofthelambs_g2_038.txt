               close on an live, enormous, rhinoceros beetle, as it weaves 
               its clumsy way among the men on a chessboard, before finally 
               stepping off the edge, onto a lettuce leaf.

                                     roden (v.o.)
                         time, pilch! my move.

                                     pilcher (v.o.)
                         no fair! you lured him with produce.

               wider angle

               shows two entomologists, both 30ish, hunched over the board. 
               roden is a pudgy redhead; pilcher is lean, quite handsome.

                                     roden
                         tough noogies! it's still my turn.

                                     clarice (o.s.)
                         if the beetle moves one of your men, 
                         does that count?

               they look up, delighted to see clarice in the doorway. both 
               men are hopelessly smitten by her.

                                     roden
                         of course it counts. how do you play?

                                     pilcher
                              (grins)
                         officer starling. welcome back.
