               int. grubby hotel corridor - day (dimly lit)

               a woman's face backs into shot, her head resting against 
               grimy wallpaper. she is tense, sweaty, wide-eyed with 
               concentration. this is clarice starling, mid-20's, trim, 
               very pretty. she wears kevlar body armor over a navy 
               windbreaker, khaki pants. her thick hair is piled under a

               a guest room door, with a small, wired pack attached to its 
               knob. suddenly, wish a sharp crack!, the knob explodes, and 
               the door bursts open.

               with clarice - moving shot

               as she runs around a corner, through a cloud of smoke. she 
               shoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside, gun at 
               the ready in both hands...

                                                                    cut to:
