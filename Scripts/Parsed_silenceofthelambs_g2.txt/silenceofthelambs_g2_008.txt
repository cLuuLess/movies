               ext. the hospital - parking lot - day

               the grim gothic pile of the asylum looms overhead as clarice 
               rushes out the front doors. she is badly shaken, almost 
               stumbling, as she rubs at her face. she looks around for, 
               and finally, with some relief, spots -

               her car

               an old pinto, parked nearby. this image begins to blur...

               close on

               her face, fighting tears, as the camera begins to whirl around 
               her, almost dizzily. she is seeing, in her mind's eye -

               in flashback

               a screen door banging open, on a wooden porch, and a 10-year 
               old girl - the young clarice - rushing outside, down the 
               front steps, and running joyfully across her front yard to -

               moving angle - the girl's pov

               a car - late 60's vintage - parked in the dirt road. a man, 
               clarice's father, is just climbing out. he's tall, handsome, 
               and has a marshal's badge pinned on his dark suit. he grins, 
               seeing her, and spreads his arms wide as...

               the young clarice

               rushes into them, and he sweeps her up in a hug, spinning 
               her around, the camera spinning with them, and capturing 
               both their laughing faces, before we abruptly return to -

               the adult clarice

               alone in the parking lot, sagging against her car. her face 
               is buried in her arms, she shoulders shaking. sound upcut - 
               a steady, rapid series of gunshots, as we

                                                                    cut to:
