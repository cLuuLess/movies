               ext. parking lot - the apartment complex - night

               catherine straightens, with her bag of groceries, shutting 
               her car's back door. she sees, a short distance away -

               a man

               standing at the open rear door of a brown panel truck. his 
               right forearm is in a cast and sling; he is struggling, 
               unsuccessfully, to hoist an armchair into the truck. parked 
               nearby, other cars, rvs, a boat on a trailer. a thin, breast-
               high fog fills the lot; arc lights make yellow pools. 

               catherine hesitates, then crosses towards the man.

                                     catherine
                         help you with that?

                                     man
                         would you? thanks.

               his voice is odd, strained, very soft. a fog lamp, set on 
               end on the ground, distorts his features from below. we can't 
               get a good glimpse of his face, but his body is plump, above 
               average height; he's in his mid 30's. she sets down the bag, 
               then together they easily lift the chair into the truck.

                                     man (o.s.)
                         let's slide it up, you mind?

                                                                    cut to:
