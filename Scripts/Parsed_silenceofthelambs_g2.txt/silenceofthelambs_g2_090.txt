               ext. sidewalk outside fbi building - day

               clarice and crawford walk out slowly, stand there a moment, 
               not knowing what to say, not wanting to face each other.

                                     clarice
                         all his victims are women... his 
                         obsession is women, he lives to hunt 
                         women. but not one women is hunting 
                         him - except me. i can walk in a 
                         woman's room and know three times as 
                         much about her as a man would.
                              (beat)
                         i have to go to belvedere.

                                     crawford
                         you heard them. i don't have that 
                         authority anymore.

                                     clarice
                         you do until six p.m.

               he stares at her sadly. he looks, for the first time, 
               defeated, old beyond his years.

                                     crawford
                         ohio is cold ground. picked over, 
                         ten months ago. our people worked 
                         it, so did the locals.

                                     clarice
                         but not from this angle. not thinking 
                         he knew her. you've got to send me!

                                     crawford
                         i'm bureau for 28 years, starling. i 
                         won't disobey orders, not even now.

                                     clarice
                         but i just became a private citizen. 
                         i can go anywhere i want to.

                                     crawford
                         with id and a gun...? impersonating 
                         a federal agent is a felony.

                                     clarice
                         he's going to kill her, mr. crawford. 
                         this morning, or maybe at noon, but 
                         today, and belvedere's our last 
                         chance. i'm flying there, right now, 
                         unless you stop me. you want my id? 
                         here - take it...

               he stares at her, a long moment. catherine's life. clarice's 
               passion, and future. his loyalty to the bureau. call it.

                                     crawford
                              (pulls out his wallet)
                         there's about $300 here... and a 
                         hotline code number. they'll patch 
                         you through to me, wherever i am.

               she raises her hand to him. she wants to touch him face, or 
               his neck, but can't. finally she takes his money and card.

                                     clarice
                         thank you.

               he watches, frightened for both of them, as she backs away, 
               smiles, then turns, racing towards the surveillance van.

               sound upcut - the scratchy recording of fats waller singing, 
               as we...

                                                                    cut to:
