               close on a large video screen, where a blurry image gradually 
               sharpens, resolving into two separate pieces of fabric.

                         electron microscopy reveals fiber 
                         "signatures" that are nearly as 
                         distinct as fingerprints...

               clarice sits at a long table, with other trainees. ardelia 
               is beside her. other tables and students in the background. 
               each trainee has his own microscope. clarice is tired, but 
               straightens, hearing -

                         both of these blouses were worn by 
                         victims of buffalo bill. they were 
                         found in two different states, and 
                         four months apart. he always slits 
                         them up the back, like a funeral 
                         suit...

               on the screen

               successively closer views of the cut fabric edges, until we 
               are seeing individual threads, big as tree limbs. the cuts 
               match.

                         the bunching you see - this 
                         compression - is characteristic of 
                         scissor cuts, rather than a single 
                         blade. and, as you see - bill always 
                         uses the same pair...
