               int. brigham's jeep cherokee - day (driving)

               brigham steers as they pass hangars, parked planes, an 
               airstrip. clarice holds a big fingerprint kit and a weekend 
               bag.

                                     brigham
                         jack's pretty tough on you, isn't 
                         he? impatient...

                                     clarice
                         sometimes.

                                     brigham
                         he's got a lot on his mind besides 
                         buffalo bill... his wife, bella, is 
                         real sick. comatose... i'm tellin' 
                         you about it now, 'cause he may never.

               clarice absorbs this in silence as they stop near an ancient, 
               rather dilapidated beechcraft. its door is open, the twin 
               props and beacons already turning. brigham turns to her, 
               holding out his small canvas bag.

                                     brigham
                         you're goin' in the field, so you 
                         gotta have full kit. take this - 
                         it's my own...

               clarice opens the bag, stares at the big blue gun nestled in 
               its shoulder holster. she looks up at him, touched.

                                     brigham
                         wear it, don't ever leave it in your 
                         purse. dry fire it whenever you get 
                         the chance. and do your exercises.

                                     clarice
                         i will... i promise.

                                     brigham
                         listen, i hope you never need a thing 
                         i've taught you. but you've got 
                         something... jack sees it, i do too. 
                         if you ever need to, you can shoot.

               she nods, climbs out. then she looks back in at him. they're 
               both moved by this rite of passage, but a little embarrassed.

                                     brigham
                         bless you, starling...

                                                                    cut to:
