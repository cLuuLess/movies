               int. historical society room - night (brightly lit)

               angle on the door, from inside, its lettering reversed on 
               the frosted glass. the bach is very loud.

               after a moment the door is shouldered open, hard enough for 
               the glass to shatter, tate following his gun inside, moving 
               low, then other cops appearing behind him in the doorframe. 
               they all freeze, staring in utter horror.

                         oh no... no...

               their pov

               is a brief snapshot from hell. the two uniformed bodies, one 
               sprawled on its back near the door, the other still in the 
               cell, have been savaged by a knife. blood and gore everywhere. 
               the faces are unrecognizable.

               sgt. tate

               struggles for control, as the other cops move grimly around 
               him, into the room. he pulls his walkie-talkie from his belt.

                              (a beat; clears his 
                              throat)
                         two officers down. prisoner is 
                         missing. repeat, lecter is missing... 
                         he's stripped the bed, might be making 
                         a rope, check all windows. where the 
                         fuck is my ambulance?

               in the cell

               a cop angrily punches off the music. jacobs kneels with his 
               fingers on boyle's neck.

                                     jacobs
                         boyle is dead, sarge. his gun's 
                         gone...

               at the other body

               a cop gently removes a revolver from the bloody fist. murray, 
               the young patrolman, brings his ear reluctantly close to the 
               gory face. a bloody bubble appears there; the wreckage groans, 
               very softly.

                                     murray
                         this one's alive!

               tate crosses, kneels to see for himself. murray looks green.

                                     sgt. tate
                         take ahold of him where he can feel 
                         your hands, son. talk to him.

                                     murray
                         what's his name, sarge?

                                     sgt. tate
                         it's pembry, now talk to him, god 
                         dammit.
                              (into radio, looking 
                              around)
                         boyle's dead, pembry's read bad. 
                         lecter is missing and armed - he 
                         took boyle's gun...

               the other cop, checking the cylinder of pembry's gun, holds 
               up one finger to tate.

                         pembry got off one round - there's a 
                         chance lecter was hit. we heard a 
                         total of three shots fired, so he's 
                         got four left... he's got a knife, 
                         too.

                                                                    cut to:
