               int. baltimore state hosp. for the criminally insane - day

               chilton approaches, walking briskly down a corridor in the 
               administration wing. he looks quite agitated.

                                     crawford (v.o.)
                         we can't trust frederick chilton, 
                         either. he's greedy and ambitious. 
                         if he knew about lecter's link to 
                         bill, he's go straight to the 
                         newspapers...

               chilton falls into step beside clarice, who has her briefcase. 
               he points his gold pen at her accusingly.

                                     chilton
                         what you're doing, miss starling, is 
                         coming into my hospital to conduct 
                         an interview, and refusing to share 
                         information with me. for the third 
                         time!

                                     clarice
                         dr. chilton, i told you - this is 
                         just routine follow-up on the raspail 
                         case.

                                     chilton
                         he's my patient! i have rights!
                              (grabs her arm, 
                              stopping her)
                         i'm not just some turnkey, miss 
                         starling. i shouldn't even be here 
                         this afternoon. i had a ticket to 
                         holiday on ice.

               she stares at him, with pity and distaste, till he lets go.

                                     clarice
                         i'm acting on instruction, dr. 
                         chilton.
                              (handing him a card)
                         this is the u.s. attorney's number. 
                         now please - either discuss this 
                         with him, or let me do my job.

               she walks away, leaving him speechless with frustration and 
               hostility. he clicks his pen, watching her go.

                                                                    cut to:
