               int. crawford's house - study - night

               crawford, in a cardigan, sits in a wing chair in the book- 
               lined study of his suburban home. he turns the pages of 
               clarice's memo as they talk. his tone is sharp.

                                     crawford
                         i've read your interim memo on lecter. 
                         you sure you've left nothing out?

               intercutting

                                     clarice
                         it's all there, sir, practically 
                         verbatim.

                                     crawford
                         every word, starling? every gesture?

                                     clarice
                              (a bit heatedly)
                         right down to the kleenex i used.
                              (he is silent)
                         sir, why? is something wrong?

                                     crawford
                         he mentioned a name, at the very 
                         end. "mofet..." any followup on her?

                                     clarice
                         i spent all evening on the mainframe. 
                         lecter altered or destroyed most of 
                         his patient histories, prior to 
                         capture. no record of anyone named 
                         mofet. but "split city" sounded like 
                         it might have have something to do 
                         with divorce. i tracked it down in 
                         the library's catalogue of national 
                         yellow pages.
                              (glancing at her notes)
                         it's a mini-storage facility outside 
                         baltimore, where lecter had his 
                         practice.

               she pauses, expecting some soft of approval for her 
               cleverness.

                                     crawford
                         well? why aren't you there right 
                         now?

                                     clarice
                         sir, that's a field job. it's outside 
                         the scope of my assignment. and i've
                         got a test tomorrow on -

                                     crawford
                         do you recall my instructions to 
                         you, starling? what were they?

                                     clarice
                         to complete and file my report by 
                         0800 wednesday. but sir -

                                     crawford
                         then do that, starling. do just 
                         exactly that.

                                     clarice
                         sir, what is it? there's something 
                         you're not telling me.

                                     crawford
                              (beat)
                         miggs has been murdered.

                                     clarice
                              (startled, upset)
                         murdered...? how?

                                     crawford
                         the orderly heard lecter whispering 
                         to him, all afternoon, and miggs 
                         crying. they found him at bed check. 
                         he'd swallowed his own tongue... 
                         chilton is scared stiff the family 
                         will file a civil rights lawsuit, 
                         and he's trying to blame it on you. 
                         i told the little prick your conduct 
                         was flawless.
                              (beat)
                         starling...?

                                     clarice
                         i'm here, sir, i just - i don't know 
                         how to feel about it.

                                     crawford
                         you don't have to feel any way about 
                         it. lecter did it to amuse himself. 
                         why not, what can they do? take away 
                         his books for awhile, and no jello...
                              (a bit softer)
                         i know it got ugly today. but this 
                         is your report, starling - take it 
                         as far as you can. on your own time, 
                         outside of class. now carry on.

               angle on clarice

               as we hear the loud click of crawford hanging up. she stares 
               at her receiver, stung by his abruptness.

                                     clarice
                         well god damn it! you old creep. 
                         creepo son of a bitch. let miggs 
                         squirt you and see how you like it.

               she slams her receiver into its cradle.

               angle on crawford

               as he flips aside her memo, then rises, wearily. he leaves 
               his study, flicking off the lamp, and pads away in his 
               slippers.

                                                                    cut to:
