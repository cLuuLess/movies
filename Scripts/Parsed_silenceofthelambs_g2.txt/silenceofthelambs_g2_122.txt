               int. oubliette chamber - day (dimly lit)

               clarice moves in, hugging the wall, gun swivelling...

               her pov - moving

               the open top of the pit... beyond it, the other two doorways, 
               opening onto this room - jesus, he could come through either 
               one of them, or come up behind her... she moves to the pit, 
               looks down, very briefly, sees catherine screaming, 
               hysterical, and a little white dog barking...

               clarice

               kneels, staring up from one door to another, she can't cover 
               them all, she's totally exposed - and what's a dog doing 
               there?

                                     clarice
                         fbi, catherine, you're safe.

                                     catherine
                         safe, shit, he's got a gun! getmeout.
                         get me out!

                                     clarice
                         you're all right! where is he?

                                     catherine
                         get me out!

                                     clarice
                         i'll get you out! just be quiet so i 
                         can hear. shut that dog up.
                              (still swivelling)
                         is there a ladder? is there a rope?

                                     catherine
                         i don't know! get me out!!

                                     clarice
                         catherine. listen to me. i have to 
                         find a rope. i have to leave this
                         room, just for a minute, but -

                                     catherine
                         nooooo! you fucking bitch don't you 
                         leave me down here, don't you - you 

                                     clarice
                         shut up!
                              (then, louder)
                         the other officers will be here any 
                         minute! you're perfectly safe now!

               ignoring catherine, whose shouts turn to sobs, she backs 
               away, turns, picks one of the other doorways, moves into it 
               quickly.

                                                                    cut to:
