               ext. street in front of courthouse - night

               various angles on a floodlit scene of barely controlled 
               pandemonium. flashing red lights, men shouting commands, 
               sirens in the distance. swat members, in full gear, leap 
               from a black van... fan out... swarm up the steps... ems 
               orderlies unload a gurney from an ambulance... cops kneel 
               for cover behind cars, aiming guns and rifles up at the 
               windows...

                                                                    cut to:
