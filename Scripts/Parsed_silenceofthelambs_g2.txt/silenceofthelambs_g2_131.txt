               int. academy dorm - rec room - that night

               a loud party is underway - food, beer, dancing - as the new 
               grads celebrate ferociously. ardelia weaves her way through 
               the crowded room, reaches clarice, who is flanked by her 
               special guests - pilcher and roden, the two ardent scientists. 
               ardelia has to shout at clarice over the din.

                                     ardelia
                         agent starling! telephone!

                                     clarice
                              (surprised)
                         agent mapp! thank you!

               she nods to pilcher, leaves them. roden, who is quite happily 
               drunk, grabs the startled ardelia around the waist.

                                     roden
                         hel-lo, gorgeous! let's get down.

               ardelia looks at pilcher, confused.

                                     pilcher
                         just ignore him. he's not a ph.d.

                                                                    cut to:
