               int. historical society room - 5th floor

               pembry, at a desk by the door, looks up from examining the 
               unrolled pile of dr. lecter's drawings.

                                     pembry
                         you know the rules, ma'am?

                                     clarice
                         yes, officer pembry. i've questioned 
                         him before.

               he waves her on her way, but retains the drawings for now.

               moving angle - with clarice

               as she crosses the big, spare, white octagonal room. a 
               massive, temporary iron cage has been installed; officer 
               boyle sits facing its barred door. he rises, nods, moving 
               away to allow her privacy.

               inside the cage

               a cot and a small table, each bolted to the floor, and a 
               flimsy paper screen, hiding a toilet. dr. lecter sits at the 
               table, his back to her, studying the buffalo bill case file. 
               he now wears a green prison jumpsuit. a small cassette player 
               is chained to the steel table.

                                     dr. lecter
                              (without turning)
                         good afternoon, clarice.

               she stops at a striped police barricade, before his bars.

                                     clarice
                         i thought you might want your drawings 
                         back... just until you get your view.

                                     dr. lecter
                         how very thoughtful... or did crawford
                         send you here for one last wheedle - 
                         before you're both booted off the 
                         case?

                                     clarice
                         nobody sent me. i came on my own.

               he spins in his swivel chair, stops neatly. a coy smile.

                                     dr. lecter
                         people will say we're in love.
                              (beat)
                         pity you tried to fool me, isn't it? 
                         pity for poor catherine. tick-tock...

               he spins again in his chair, playfully.

               moving angle - favoring clarice

               as she circles the cage, trying to keep his face in sight.

                                     clarice
                         dr. lecter, you find out everything. 
                         you couldn't have talked with this 
                         "william rubin", even once, and come 
                         out knowing so little about him... 
                         you made him up, didn't you?

                                     dr. lecter
                         clarice... you're hardly in a position 
                         to accuse me of lying.

                                     clarice
                         i think you were telling me the truth 
                         in baltimore - or starting to. tell 
                         me the rest now.

                                     dr. lecter
                         i've studied the case file, have 
                         you...? everything you need to find 
                         him is right in these pages. whatever 
                         his name is.

                                     clarice
                         then tell me how.

                                     dr. lecter
                         first principles, clarice. simplicity. 
                         read marcus aurelius. of each 
                         particular thing, ask: what is it, 
                         in itself, what is its nature...? 
                         what does he do, this man you seek?

                         no! that's incidental.

               close angle - two shot as he rises, pained by her ignorance, 
               and crosses to the bars.

                                     dr. lecter
                         what is the first and principal thing

                         and how do we begin to covet, clarice? 
                         do we seek out things to covet? make 
                         an effort to answer.

                         no. precisely. we begin by coveting 
                         what we see every day. don't you 
                         feel eyes moving over your body, 
                         clarice? i hardly see how you 
                         couldn't. and don't your eyes move 
                         over the things you want?

                         no. it's your turn to tell me, 
                         clarice. you don't have any more 
                         vacations to sell, on anthrax island. 
                         why did you run away from that ranch?

                                     clarice
                         dr. lecter, when there's time i'll -

                         we don't reckon time the same way, 
                         clarice. this is all the time you'll

                         later, listen, i'll -

                         i'll listen now. after your father's 
                         murder, you were orphaned. you were 
                         ten years old. you went to live with 
                         cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch 
                         in montana. and - ?

                                     clarice
                         and - one morning i just - ran away...

               she turns from him. he presses closer, gripping the bars.

                                     dr. lecter
                         not "just," clarice. what set you 
                         off? you started what time?

                                     clarice
                         early. still dark.

                                     dr. lecter
                         then something woke you. what? did 
                         you dream...? what was it?

               in flashback

               the 10-year old clarice sits up abruptly in her bed, 
               frightened. she is in a montana ranch house; it almost dawn. 
               strange, fearful shadows on her ceiling and walls... a window, 
               partly fogged by the cold; eerie brightness outside.

                                     clarice (v.o.)
                         i heard a strange sound...

                                     dr. lecter (v.o.)
                         what was it?

               the child rises

               crosses to the window in her nightgown, rubs the glass.

                                     clarice (v.o.)
                         i didn't know. i went to look...

               high angles (2nd story) - the child's pov

               shadowy men, ranch hands, are moving in and out of a nearby 
               barn, carrying mysterious bundles. the mens' breath is 
               steaming... a refrigerated truck idles nearby, its engine 
               adding more steam. a strange, almost surrealistic scene...

                                     clarice (v.o.)
                         screaming! some kind of - screaming. 
                         like a child's voice...

               the little girl

               is terrified; she covers her ears.

                                     dr. lecter (v.o.)
                         what did you do?

                                     clarice (v.o.)
                         got dressed without turning on the 
                         light. i went downstairs... outside...

               the little girl

               in her winter coat, slips noiselessly towards the open barn 
               door. she ducks into the shadows to avoid a ranch hand, who 
               passes her with a squirming bundle of some kind. he goes 
               into the barn, and she edges after him reluctantly.

                                     clarice (v.o.)
                         i crept up to the barn... i was so 
                         scared to look inside - but i had 
                         to...

               the little girl's pov

               as the open doorway looms closer... bright lights inside, 
               straw bales, the edges of stalls, then moving figures...

                                     dr. lecter (v.o.)
                         and what did you see, clarice?

               a squirming lamb

               is held down on a table by two ranch hands.

                                     clarice (v.o.)
                         lambs. the lambs were screaming...

               a third cowboy stretches out the lamb's neck, raises a bloody 
               knife. just as he's about to slice its throat -

               back to the adult clarice

               staring into the distance, shaken, still trembling from the 
               child's shock. we see dr. lecter, over her shoulder, studying 
               her intently.

                                     dr. lecter
                         they were slaughtering the spring 
                         lambs?

                                     clarice
                         yes...! they were screaming.

                                     dr. lecter
                         so you ran away...

                                     clarice
                         no. first i tried to free them... i 
                         opened the gate of their pen - but 
                         they wouldn't run. they just stood 
                         there, confused. they wouldn't run...

                                     dr. lecter
                         but you could. you did.

                                     clarice
                         i took one lamb. and i ran away, as 
                         fast as i could...

               in flashback

               a vast montana plain, and crossing this, a tiny figure - the 
               little clarice, holding a lamb in her arms.

                                     dr. lecter (v.o.)
                         where were you going?

                                     clarice (v.o.)
                         i don't know. i had no food or water. 
                         it was very cold. i thought - if i 
                         can even save just one... but he got 
                         so heavy. so heavy...

               the tiny figure stops, and after a few moments sinks to the 
               ground, hunched over in dispair.

                                     clarice (v.o.)
                         i didn't get more than a few miles 
                         before the sheriff's car found me. 
                         the rancher was so angry he sent me 
                         to live at the lutheran orphanage in 
                         bozeman. i never saw the ranch 
                         again...

                                     dr. lecter (v.o.)
                         but what became of your lamb?
                              (no response)
                         clarice...?

               back to scene

               as the adult clarice turns, staring into his feverish eyes. 
               she shakes her head, unwilling - or unable - to say more.

                                     dr. lecter
                         you still wake up sometimes, don't 
                         you? wake up in the dark, with the 
                         lambs screaming?

                                     clarice
                         yes...

                                     dr. lecter
                         do you think if you saved catherine, 
                         you could make them stop...? do you 
                         think, if catherine lives, you won't 
                         wake up in the dark, ever again, to 
                         the screaming of the lambs? do you...?

                                     clarice
                         yes! i don't know...! i don't know.

                                     dr. lecter
                              (a pause; then, oddly 
                              at peace)
                         thank you, clarice.

                                     clarice
                              (a whisper)
                         tell me his name, dr. lecter.

                                     dr. lecter
                         dr. chilton... i believe you know 
                         each other?

               new angle

               as clarice turns, startled, and the fuming chilton seizes 
               her elbow. pembry and boyle are beside him, looking grim.

                                     chilton
                         out. let's go.

                                     pembry
                         sorry, ma'a m - we've got orders to 
                         have you put on a place.

               clarice struggles, pulling free of them for a moment.

                                     dr. lecter
                         brave clarice. will you let me know 
                         if ever the lambs stop screaming?

                                     clarice
                              (moving closer to the 
                              bars)
                         yes. i'll tell you.

                                     dr. lecter
                         promise...?
                              (she nods. he smiles)
                         then why not take your case file? i 
                         won't be needing it anymore.

               he holds out the file, arm extended between the bars. she 
               hesitates, then reaches to take it.

               very close angle - slow motion

               as the exchange is made, his index finger touches her hand, 
               and lingers there, just for a moment.

               dr. lecter's eyes

               widen, crackling at this touch, like sparks in a cave.

                                     dr. lecter
                         good-bye, clarice.

               clarice

               hugging the case file to her chest, stares back at him as 
               the men crowd in on her, pushing her away.

               her pov - moving

               as dr. lecter, head cocked in a smile, slowly recedes...

                                                               dissolve to:
