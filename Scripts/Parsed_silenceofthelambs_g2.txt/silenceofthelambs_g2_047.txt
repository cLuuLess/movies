               int. dr. lecter's cell - day

               chilton lounges on dr. lecter's cot, casually reading his 
               large stack of private correspondence, and making notations 
               with his gold pen on a little pad. another orderly mops the 
               floor.

                                     chilton
                         perhaps you should have been less 
                         specific about what kind.
                              (to barney)
                         stand him by the toilet. then leave 
                         us.

               barney props the hand truck into position, then both orderlies 
               go. chilton finishes another letter, sighs happily.

                                     chilton
                         such a lot of correspondence! i can 
                         hardly wait to analyze it in more 
                         detail... but first things first.

               tossing letters onto the cot, he rises, crosses out into the 
               corridor, and bends to remove a small tape recorder from 
               underneath clarice's desk. he waggles it triumphantly at dr. 
               lecter.

                                     chilton
                         i thought she might be looking for a 
                         civil rights violation in migg's 
                         death, so i bugged you... not a word 
                         to me in all these years, hannibal. 
                         then crawford sends his bit of fluff 
                         over here, and you just turn to jelly. 
                         it's too pathetic.

               side angle - two shot

               as chilton, back in the cell, leans tauntingly close to the 
               front of dr. lecter's mask.

                                     chilton
                         you still think you're going to walk 
                         on some beach, and see the birdies? 
                         i don't think so, hannibal... i called 
                         senator ruth martin, and she never 
                         heard of any deal with you. she never 
                         heard of clarice starling, either. 
                         they scammed you, hannibal...

               close on dr. lecter's glittering eyes, behind their slits.

                                     chilton
                         when crawford gets through milking 
                         you, he's giving you to baltimore 
                         homicide for the raspail murder. and 
                         they're preparing some special 
                         surprises for you right now, in my 
                         electroshock room.

               dr. lecter's pov (framed by eye-slits)

               first looking at chilton's moving lips... then lowering to 
               his soft, white, inviting throat...

                                     chilton
                         the starling bitch wants you to rot 
                         here, in this little box, till your 
                         teeth fall out and you're soiling 
                         diapers. you've seen the old ones, 
                         hannibal. they weep when their stewed 
                         peaches get cold. that'll be you, 
                         too. unless - you trade with me.

               favoring chilton

               as he sits chummily on the table.

                                     chilton
                         there never was a deal with senator 
                         martin - but there is now. i've been 
                         on the phone for hours, hannibal, on 
                         your behalf. here's what you get: if 
                         you identify buffalo bill, and the 
                         girl is found in time, senator martin 
                         will have you transferred to brushy 
                         mountain state prison, in tennessee...

               close again on dr. lecter's eyes

               as they shift restlessly, away from chilton - then suddenly 
               lock onto something. they widen with interest.

                                     chilton (o.s.)
                         the governor has already agreed. you 
                         get books, a view of the woods, and 
                         plenty of exercise time...

               dr. lecter's pov - extreme closeup

               on the cot, carelessly left there, lying half-hidden under 
               the letters and the rumpled sheet... is chilton's gold pen.

                                     chilton (o.s.)
                         and best of all, you'd be out of 
                         jack crawford's reach, forever. the 
                         senator will verify these terms on 
                         the phone, and guarantee them in 
                         writing...

               back on dr. lecter

               as he stares a moment longer at the pen, then shifts his 
               eyes towards chilton. we can almost hear his brain clicking.

                                     chilton (o.s.)
                         in exchange, i get your full 
                         cooperation in publishing a 
                         professional account of this - my 
                         successful interviews with you. you 
                         publish nothing. and i get exclusive 
                         access to any material from catherine 
                         martin... so. do you accept my 
                         demands?
                              (pause)
                         answer me, hannibal.

               a beat. dr. lecter is silent. chilton sticks his face into 
               shot, almost intimately close to the mask. he is agitated.

                                     chilton
                         you'll answer me now, or by god, 
                         you'll answer to baltimore homicide. 
                         who is buffalo bill?

                                     dr. lecter
                              (pause; then softly)
                         i'll tell the senator herself. but 
                         only in tennessee...

                                                                    cut to:
