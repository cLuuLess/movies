               int. dr. lecter's corridor - day

               moving angle - close on dr. lecter's slippered feet, which 
               rest on the shelf of a rolling hand truck. rising along his 
               tilted form, we see that his ankles are linked by steel 
               restraints... his legs, waist, upper torso, and arms are 
               bound by heavy canvas webbing... beneath the webbing is a 
               strait-jacket... and over his face is a hockey mask.

               wider angle

               shows that dr. lecter, on the handtruck, is being pushed 
               down his corridor by barney, and back into his open cell.
