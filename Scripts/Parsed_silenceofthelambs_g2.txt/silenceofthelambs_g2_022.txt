               int. the panel truck - night

               he climbs inside the truck, ducking under a small hand winch, 
               and grabs the chair. she hesitates again, but climbs in after 
               him; together they slide the chair forward, behind the seats.

                                     man
                         are you about a size 14?

                              (surprised)
                         what?

               suddenly, in the shadowy dark, he clubs her over the back of 
               her head with his cast. she moans, slumps unconscious, sliding 
               off the armchair to lie on her stomach. he pulls off his 
               cast and sling, tosses them aside, then hops out of the truck, 
               grabs his lamp, climbs back inside, and pulls the door shut. 
               he bends over her face with the lamp.

               we hear her shallow breathing.

                                     man
                         good.

               he peels back the collar of her blouse, reading the size 
               tag.

                                     man
                         good.

               he carefully slits her blouse up the back, with a pair of 
               bandage scissors, peeling apart the two halves. there's no 
               bra strap. he strokes her bare skin delicately, very happily.

                                     man

                                                                    cut to:
