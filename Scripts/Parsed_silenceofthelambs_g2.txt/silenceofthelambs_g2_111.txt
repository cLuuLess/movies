               int. mr. gumb's front door - day

               the door opens, on a chain, and clarice peers in, smiling.

                                     clarice
                         good afternoon... i wonder if you 
                         could help me. i'm looking for mrs. 
                         lippman's family?

               mr. gumb frowns out at clarice. for the first time ever, we 
               get a well-lit view of his bland, pale-eyed moon of a face.

                                     mr. gumb
                         they don't live here anymore.

                                                                    cut to:
