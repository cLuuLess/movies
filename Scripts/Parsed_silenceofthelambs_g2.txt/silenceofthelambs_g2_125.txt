               int. skinning room - day (dimly lit)

               clarice moves past the mannequins, all of them naked now... 
               then quickly past the huge chinese armoire, ready to shoot 
               into it. its doors yawn open; it is empty except for several 
               padded hangers... she moves on, past the big sink, with its 
               dripping faucet... the counter, with its gleaming knives... 
               the rows of chemical jars. at the end of this room is

               a closed door

               clarice starts to open it, then hesitates. looking around, 
               she seizes a wooden chair, wedges it under the door know, 
               sealing off this section of the cellar. with her back thus 
               defended, she turns, softly retracing her steps.

                                                                    cut to:
