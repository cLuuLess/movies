               int. mr. gumb's kitchen - day

               clarice hurries inside, moving low, swivelling her gun.

               her pov - moving

               the kitchen is empty. to one side, a door still shuddering 
               on its hinges...

               clarice

               rushes to this - pauses - then elbows the door aside, aiming 
               her gun down -

               an empty stairwell

               brightly lit, leading to the cellar. two doors facing the 
               bottom, both open. no sign of mr. gumb.

               clarice

               hates this, hates this, which door, it's a trap, what to do: 
               she is very scared, but suddenly hears -

               the distant scream of catherine martin, somewhere down there 
               in that killing maze.

               clarice

               rushes through the doorway, and down the stairs.

               behind her, on the kitchen counter there's an empty space; 
               the colt python is gone.

                                                                    cut to:
