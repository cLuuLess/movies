               int. embalming room - day

               crawford, in one corner of the room, has set up a litton 
               policefax fingerprint transmitter. sound of many men's low 
               voices, in background. he is on the phone, and has to speak 
               loudly.

                                     crawford
                         i need a six-way linkup! chicago, 
                         detroit, cleveland, st. louis, 
                         atlanta, and dallas... what?... can 
                         you hear me...?

               he looks around, frustrated by the noisy circus atmosphere.

               clarice

               is pulling on a pair of surgical gloves. she raises her voice, 
               turning up her natural accent by several notches.

                                     clarice
                         gentlemen. you officers and gentlemen! 
                         listen here a minute, please. there's 
                         things i need to do for her...

               wider angle

               as we see that the small room is very crowded with deputies 
               and troopers. they gradually fall silent, looking at her.

                                     clarice (o.s.)
                         y'all brought her this far, and i 
                         know her folks would thank you if 
                         they could. now please - go on out 
                         and let me take care of her... go 
                         on, now.

               the men look at one another, a little bashfully, then begin 
               to to file out, whispering among themselves. as they go, a 
               bright green body bag is revealed, tightly zipped, lying on 
               a porcelain embalming table. it is almost the only modern 
               object in this victorian room, with its glass-paned cabinets 
               and faded wallpaper, decorated with cabbage roses.

               favoring crawford

               as he looks at clarice with a new degree of respect. men 
               brush by him, till finally only two are left: dr. akin, a 
               family g.p., and lamar, a lean, whiskey-reddened mortician. 
               sound of the door closing. lamar dabs around his nostrils 
               with vicks vaporub.

                                     crawford
                              (on phone)
                         we're starting. tell everybody to 
                         stand by for fingerprint transmission.

               clarice

               at a side counter, has turned back to her open fingerprint 
               kit. she is lifting out a camera when she hears the zipper 
               of the body bag being slowly opened, behind her...

               one gloved hand flies to her mouth as she reacts, 
               involuntarily, to the sudden smell. she blinks at her 
               reflection in the cabinet glass, then steels herself to turn, 
               look at the corpse.

                                     clarice
                              (pause; softly)
                         bill...

               she steadies herself by raising her camera, takes a flash 
               photo.

               low angle - looking up, from beneath table

               as dr. akin gently lifts aside one of the dead girl's arms. 
               a piece of fishing line, with multiple hooks, is still snagged 
               around it, dangling. crawford leans in for a closer look.

                                     dr. akin
                         wrongful death... she'll have to go 
                         to the state pathologist at claxton 
                         when you're done.
                              (crawford nods)
                         i better - get on back for the rest 
                         of that service. lamar'll help you.
                              (shaken)
                         lord almighty...

               he leaves, and clarice leans into shot, taking another photo.

                                     crawford
                         what do you see, starling?

                                     clarice
                         well, she's not local. her ears are 
                         pierced three times each, and she's 
                         wearing green glitter nail polish. 
                         looks like town to me...

               close angle

               on the calf of one of the girl's legs, as clarice trails the 
               inside of her bare wrist along the skin.

                                     clarice (o.s.)
                         she waxed her legs, i think... a big 
                         girl, just like the others - but she 
                         was careful about her appearance...

               upward angle again

               as lamar joins them for a closer look.

                                     clarice
                         two of the fingernails are broken 
                         off, and there's - dirt or grit under 
                         the others. she tried to claw her 
                         way through something... i'll scrape 
                         out samples after i've printed her.

               she takes another flash, then quickly reloads film.

                                     lamar
                         them fishhooks are set too close 
                         together. no wonder the franklin 
                         boys was scared to say they found 
                         her.

                                     clarice
                         think they were runnin' a trotline?

               crawford and lamar both look at her curiously.

                                     clarice
                              (to crawford)
                         it's a fish and game violation. like 
                         poaching. there's a big fine.

                                     lamar
                         right... are you from around here?

                                     clarice
                         they do it lots of places.

                                     crawford
                         get photos of her teeth. then we'll 
                         fax her fingerprints to washington, 
                         try to trace her through missing 
                         persons.

               side angle - close on the dead girl's face

               staring blue eyes, short reddish hair. clarice sets the 
               polaroid, with its special attachments, against the face, 
               while lamar gently retracts the lips. each time the camera 
               flashes, there's a bright glow inside the cheeks.

               new angle - chest high

               as clarice examines a developing print.

                                     clarice
                         she's got something in her throat.

               she hands the print to crawford; he and lamar look at it, as 
               she searches in her kit.

                                     lamar
                         when a body comes out of the water, 
                         alots of times there's like, leaves 
                         and things in the mouth.

               clarice holds up a pair of forceps. she glances at crawford, 
               who nods. she bends over, partially out of shot, and after a 
               few moments reappears, holding up a small, brown cylindrical 
               object. she turns this in the air, as they all stare.

                                     crawford
                         what is it - some kind of seed pod?

                                     lamar
                         nawsir, that's a bug cocoon. but how 
                         come that to get way down in there? 
                         'less somebody shoved it in...

               clarice and crawford exchange a glance.

                                     crawford
                         she'll be easier to print if we turn 
                         her over. lamar, will you give me a 
                         hand?

                                     lamar
                         yessir, i will. clarice takes a jar 
                         from her kit, carefully drops the 
                         cocoon inside.

               sound of the men's heavy efforts as they turn over the body, 
               off screen. she seals the jar, staring into it at the cocoon.

                                     crawford (o.s.)
                         starling - what do you make of these?

               she turns to look.

               her pov

               low on the corpse's back, over the shoulders, two neat, 
               triangular patches of skin are missing.

               new angle - two shot

               as clarice looks at crawford.

                                     clarice
                         i don't know. i didn't see those on 
                         any of the other girls...

                                     crawford
                         they weren't there. get close-ups.

               clarice raises her camera, leans in for another flash.

                                                                    cut to:
