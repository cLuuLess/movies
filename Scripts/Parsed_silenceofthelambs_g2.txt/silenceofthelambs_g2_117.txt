               int. mr. gumb's front hallway - day

               mr. gumb glances briefly over his shoulder, towards his 
               kitchen, then turns back to clarice with a smile.

                                     mr. gumb
                         mrs. lippman had a son, maybe he 
                         could help you. i have his card 
                         somewhere. do you mind stepping 
                         inside, while i looks for it?

                                     clarice
                         thanks.

               doorway. through this doorway, we watch as mr. gumb, at the 
               end of his front hall, slips the chain. clarice enters, 
               closing the door behind her.
