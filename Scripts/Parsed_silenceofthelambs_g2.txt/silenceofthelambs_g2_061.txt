               int. bedroom

               close on an open, multi-tiered jewelry box, resting atop a 
               bureau, as clarice's fingers pick through costume jewelry.

               clarice closes the box, and is just turning away when a figure 
               suddenly looms into shot, giving her a bad start; she cries 
               out softly.

               senator martin is revealed, staring at her suspiciously.

                                     sen. martin
                         who are you, please? i thought the 
                         police were through in here.

                                     clarice
                         i'm clarice starling, senator. fbi.

                                     sen. martin
                              (softly, very angry)
                         clarice starling...
                              (calls out)
                         paul? would you come in here, 
                         please...?

               krendler enters from the hallway, looks at clarice.

                                     sen. martin
                         miss starling, you may know the deputy 
                         attorney general, mr. krendler. paul, 
                         this is the trainee that jack crawford 
                         sent to lecter... she lied to him, 
                         pretending to have my authority, and 
                         thus jeopardized this entire 
                         investigation. now she has the further 
                         gall to invade my daughter's privacy, 
                         again without permission. if her 
                         little games have killed my baby...

               overcome, she hurries from the room. krendler shuts the door 
               behind her, points sternly at clarice.

                                     krendler
                         you're out of line, starling, and 
                         you're off this case. back to 
                         quantico.

                                     clarice
                         sir, mr. crawford instructed me -

                                     krendler
                         your instructions are what i'm giving 
                         you now. jack crawford answers to 
                         the director, and the director answers 
                         to me. my god, crawford's losing 
                         it...! he shouldn't even be on this, 
                         with his wife sick as she is... how 
                         the hell did you get in here, anyway? 
                         he gave you - what? some kind of 
                         special id? let's have it.

                                     clarice
                              (stubbornly)
                         i need the id to fly with my gun. 
                         the gun belongs in quantico.

                                     krendler
                         gun. jesus. turn in the id as soon 
                         as you get back. the gun, too. be on 
                         the next plane, starling, there's 
                         one in 90 minutes.

               clarice, burning, starts for the door, then turns back.

                                     clarice
                         mr. krendler... dr. lecter trusts 
                         me. or at least, he used to. if i 
                         could just -

                                     krendler
                         lecter has already named buffalo 
                         bill.

               clarice reacts, surprised. krendler takes a folded computer 
               sheet from his pocket, shoves it at her. she takes it, reads.

                                     krendler
                         he gave us a perfectly good 
                         description, and we're on it now, so 
                         we won't be needing your little 
                         novelty act any longer - or his, 
                         either. he's under close guard at 
                         the courthouse, pending a prison 
                         transfer. the next plane, officer.

                                     clarice
                         sir, doesn't this "william rubin" 
                         strike you as - i don't know - kind 
                         of vague?

               krendler moves in very close to her, pale with anger.

                                     krendler
                         do you need a police escort, starling? 
                         or do you think you can find the 
                         airport by yourself?

                                     clarice
                         yes sir. i can find it by myself.

                                                                    cut to:
