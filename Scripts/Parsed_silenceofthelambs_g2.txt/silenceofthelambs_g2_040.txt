               int. laboratory - day

               very close (magnification) on the sliced cocoon, as roden 
               uses tweezers and a dental probe to ease out the sodden 
               chrysalis.

                                     roden (o.s.)
                         the whole trick is to remove the 
                         chrysalis without destroying it... 
                         the wings are just like wet tissue 
                         paper...

               the two men

               are hunched over a formica table, peering through square 
               magnifiers into stainless trays. clarice watches curiously. 
               of their two specimens, pilcher's moth is in much better 
               condition - a big brown creature, its wings outspread on 
               towel paper.

                                     pilcher
                              (without looking up)
                         what do you do when you're not 
                         detecting, officer starling?

                                     clarice
                         i try to be a student, dr. pilcher.

                                     pilcher
                         ever get out for cheeseburgers and 
                         beer? the amusing house wine...?

                                     clarice
                              (smiles)
                         not lately. but maybe someday.

               he looks up at her, shyly. a little moment passes between 
               them, before roden straightens, exultant.

                                     roden
                         positive match!

                                     clarice
                         you're sure?

                                     roden
                              (points with his dental 
                              probe)
                         west virginia... baltimore. officer 
                         starling, meet mister acherontia 
                         styx.

               he moves aside for clarice to get a closer look at pilcher's 
               specimen. she leans forward, intently.

               her pov (magnification)

               the wide, furry, brown back of the moth. and there, right 
               between the wing bases - wonderful and terrible to see - is 
               nature's perfect reproduction of a ghostly human skull.

                                     roden (o.s.)
                         better known to his friends as the 
                         death's-head moth...

                                     pilcher (o.s.)
                         the latin name comes from two rivers 
                         in hell. your man - he drops these 
                         girls into rivers, every time. didn't 
                         i read that?

               favoring clarice

               as she looks up at him, awed, excited, almost trembling.

                                     clarice
                         and there's no way - no natural way - 
                         these could've wound up in the bodies?

                                     pilcher
                              (shakes his head)
                         they live in malaysia. in this 
                         country, they'd have to be specially 
                         raised, from imported eggs.

                              (pause, then softly)
                         dr. lecter...

               as the two men stare at her, puzzled, we hear a sound upcut - 
               the wail of police sirens - and...

                                                                    cut to:
