               int. fbi building - office of the director - day

               clarice and crawford are seated in front of director burke, 
               who's at his desk. another chair is empty, because krendler 
               is pacing. all four are nearing their boiling points.

                                     clarice
                         maybe he lives in this, this 
                         belvedere, ohio, too! maybe he saw 
                         her every day, and killed her sort 
                         of spontaneously. maybe he just meant 
                         to... give her a 7-up and talk about 
                         the choir. but then -

                                     krendler
                         starling -

                                     clarice
                         but then he had to cover up, make 
                         her seem just like all the rest of 
                         them. that's what lecter was hinting!

                                     krendler
                         the market in lecter hints is way 
                         down, today, okay? i've got two good 
                         men dead in memphis, and three
                         civilians. i've got -

                                     crawford
                         who the hell's fault is -

                                     krendler
                         - a u.s. senator who's half out of 
                         her head because her daughter's going 
                         to be murdered today! and all because 
                         of your mind games with fucking 
                         lecter!

                                     crawford
                         if you hadn't interfered, he'd still 
                         be in custody in baltimore!

                                     burke
                         jack -

                                     krendler
                         you sent in a green recruit, with a
                         phony goddamn offer -

                                     crawford
                         you're just trying to cover your ass 
                         for letting him escape!

                                     burke
                         that's enough! all of you...

               a long silence, as they all struggle to regain composure. 
               crawford, who was at the point of striking krendler, finally 
               retakes his seat. burke looks sadly at crawford and clarice.

                                     burke
                              (very reluctantly)
                         starling, i'm afraid i have no choice. 
                         you're suspended from the academy.
                              (crawford starts to 
                              interrupt)
                         not another word!
                              (to clarice)
                         this is pending a reevaluation of 
                         your fitness for the service. i 
                         promise you'll get a fair hearing.
                              (pause)
                         jack... you're ordered to take 
                         compassionate leave. you'll spend 
                         the rest of the day briefing the 
                         ag's office, then transfer command 
                         of the task force, effective by 1800 
                         hours.
                              (beat)
                         i'm sorry, jack... go home. take 
                         care of bella.

               clarice and crawford stare back at him, drained. a long and 
               very painful silence. not even krendler looks happy.

                                                                    cut to:
