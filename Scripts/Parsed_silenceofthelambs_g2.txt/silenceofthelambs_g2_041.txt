               ext. u.s. route 95 - day (aerial shot)

               an awesome armada of police vehicles swings through an 
               intersection, while normal traffic is held back by highway 
               patrol cruisers.

               the lead cars turn off, hit the entrance ramp to the freeway - 
               sirens going, tires squealing, red flashers...

               on a speeding surveillance van, with long antennas and a 
               small satellite dish, near the head of the motorcade.

                         maybe we can trace how he buys the 
                         bugs, starting with u.s. customs...
