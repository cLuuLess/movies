               int. ground floor lobby - night

               a small army of cops is now covering the elevator doorway, 
               from both sides. tate crouches next to the swat commander.

                                     swat commander
                              (into radio mike)
                         we're coming into the car, we're 
                         opening the hatch. watch his hands. 
                         any fire will come from us. affirm?

                                     peterson's voice
                         got it.

               the swat commander hands his radio to another cop, then looks 
               at tate. a long, tense moment. then he waves a signal.

               moving angle

               as we follow a picked team of four swat cops, in full body 
               armor, rushing into the elevator car. two men move to the 
               corners, aim assault rifles at the ceiling. a third man sets 
               a stepladder in place, and the fourth man, armed with a big 
               colt, hurries up the ladder and unclips the hatch.

               close on

               ...the service hatch, as the hinged cover drops open, and a 
               body tumbles through, dangling head first, until it's caught 
               at the waist. we see the back of the head.

               sgt. tate

               shoulders through the swat cops for a closer look. he turns 
               towards the swat commander, astonished.

                                     sgt. tate
                         that's pembry!

                                                                    cut to:
