               int. laundry room - academy dorm - night (very late)

               clarice has spread out the case file across two washing 
               machines. ardelia, cross-legged on a dryer, studies another 
               pile of forms. nearby is their laundry basket, detergent 
               box.

                                     ardelia
                              (surprised)
                         hey, is this lecter's handwriting? 
                         she holds up the map, with its 
                         location markings for the kidnapping 
                         and body dump sites. clarice takes 
                         it, looks.

               insert - the map

               with newly inked words in dr. lecter's precise, elegant hand.

                                     dr. lecter (v.o.)
                         clarice, doesn't this random 
                         scattering of sites seem overdone to 
                         you? doesn't it seem desperately 
                         random - like the elaborations of a 
                         bad liar? ta... hannibal lecter.

               new angle - two shot

               as clarice looks up at ardelia, puzzled but excited.

                                     clarice
                         "desperately random." what does he 
                         mean?

                                     ardelia
                         not random at all, maybe. like there's 
                         some pattern here...?

                                     clarice
                         but there is no pattern. there's no 
                         connection at all among these places, 
                         or the computers would've nailed it! 
                         they're even found in random order.

                                     ardelia
                         well, except for the one girl.

                                     clarice
                              (beat)
                         what girl?

                                     ardelia
                         the one that was weighted down. where 
                         is she...? fred something.

               they search among the inserts. clarice finds the graduation 
               photo.

                                     clarice
                         fredrica bimmel, from belvedere, 
                         ohio. the first girl taken, but the 
                         third body found... why?

                                     ardelia
                         'cause she didn't drift. he weighted 
                         her down.

                                     clarice
                         but why? he didn't weight the others.

               clarice moves, on fire, unable to keep still.

                                     clarice
                         the first, what the hell did lecter 
                         say about... "first principles," he 
                         said. simplicity... what does this 
                         guy do, he "covets." how do we first 
                         start to covet? "we covet what we 
                         see -"

               she stops, turns. she grabs the photo of fredrica from 
               ardelia, stares at it. she looks up, trembling.

                                     clarice
                         "- every day."

                                     ardelia
                              (softly)
                         hot damn, clarice.

                                     clarice (v.o.)
                         he knew her...!

                                                                    cut to:
