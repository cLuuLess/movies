               int. historical society room - night

               a trio of ems orderlies work fast over the body, already 
               strapped on its gurney. they bandage a big plastic airway 
               into place, over the butchered face, checking for a pulse at 
               the neck. young murray crouches, sickened, gripping a bloody 
               fist.

                         downstairs - let's go!

               quickly the gurney is elevated, wheeled out of the room, 
               with cops rushing forward to open the doors, help push, swat 
               men are running by in the hall, automatic rifles at the 
               ready...

                                                                    cut to:
