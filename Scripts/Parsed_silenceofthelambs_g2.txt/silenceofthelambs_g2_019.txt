               int. dr. lecter's cell and corridor - night (dim light)

               on a noiseless tv screen, an evangelist rants, waving his 
               arms. behind him, a swaying choir in gaudy robes.

                                     clarice (o.s.)
                         it's an anagram, isn't it, doctor?

               pan to clarice, with her wet hair plastered flat, sitting on 
               the corridor floor to one side of this tv, which has been 
               stationed so that dr. lecter cannot avoid seeing it.

                                     clarice
                         hester mofet... "the rest of me." 
                         miss the-rest-of-me... meaning, you 
                         rented that place.

               her pov

               he's lost in shadows; we can't see him. he doesn't respond.

               cutting between them

               clarice and the darkened call - as she tries again.

                                     clarice
                         you put those - things in there. 
                         paid for it in advance, ten years 
                         ago... why, dr. lecter?

               the food carrier suddenly swishes out of the cell, making 
               her jump up. in its tray is a clean, folded white towel. she 
               hesitates, then crosses, takes this.

                                     clarice
                         thank you.

               she sits again, rubbing her wet hair. when he finally speaks, 
               he's on the floor, too - a deeper, hunching darkness in the 
               shadows, occasionally striped by the flickering tv light.

                                     dr. lecter
                         your bleeding has stopped.

                                     clarice
                         how did -
                              (she stops herself)
                         it's nothing. a scratch.

                                     dr. lecter
                         why don't you ask me about buffalo 
                         bill?

                                     clarice
                              (surprised, a beat)
                         why? do you know something about 
                         him?

                                     dr. lecter
                         i might if i saw the case file. you 
                         could get that for me.

                                     clarice
                         why don't you tell me about "miss 
                         mofet?" you wanted me to find him. 
                         or do i have to wait for the lab?

                                     dr. lecter
                              (sighs)
                         his real name is benjamin raspail. a 
                         former patient of mine, whose romantic 
                         attachments ran to, shall we say, 
                         the exotic...? i didn't kill him, 
                         merely tucked him away. very much as 
                         i found him, in that ridiculous car, 
                         in his own garage, after he's missed 
                         three appointments. you'd have him 
                         under "missing person" - which, in 
                         poor raspail's case, could hardly be 
                         more true.

                                     clarice
                         if you didn't kill him, then who 
                         did?

                                     dr. lecter
                         who can say...? best thing for him, 
                         really. his therapy was going nowhere.

                                     clarice
                         wouldn't it have been easier to just 
                         leave him for the police to find?

                                     dr. lecter
                         and have them clomping about in my 
                         life? oh dear, no... at that time i 
                         still had certain private amusements 
                         of my own.
                              (beat)
                         how did you feel when you saw him, 
                         clarice? may i call you clarice?

                                     clarice
                         scared, at first. then - exhilarated.

                                     dr. lecter
                         ahhh... why?

                                     clarice
                         because you weren't wasting my time.

                                     dr. lecter
                         do you have something you use, when 
                         you need to get up your courage? 
                         memories, tableaux... scenes from 
                         your early life?

                                     clarice
                         i don't know. next time i'll have to 
                         check.

                                     dr. lecter
                         jack crawford is helping your career, 
                         isn't he? apparently he likes you. 
                         and you like him, too.

                                     clarice
                         i never thought about it.

                                     dr. lecter
                         your first lie to me, clarice. how 
                         sad. tell me - do you think crawford 
                         wants you, sexually? true, he's much 
                         older, but - do you think he 
                         visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? 
                         fucking you?

                                     clarice
                         that doesn't interest me, doctor. 
                         and it's the sort of thing miggs 
                         would ask.

                                     dr. lecter
                         not anymore.
                              (beat)
                         surely the odd confluence of events 
                         hasn't escaped you, clarice. crawford 
                         dangles you before me. then i give 
                         you a bit of help. do you think it's 
                         because i like to look at you, and 
                         imagine how good you would taste...?

                                     clarice
                         i don't know. is it?

                                     dr. lecter
                         or doesn't this all begin to suggest 
                         to you a kind of... negotiation? 
                         there's something crawford can give 
                         me, and i want to trade for it. i 
                         even wrote to him, offering my help. 
                         but he hates me, so he won't deal 
                         directly.

               dr. lecter slowly turns up the rheostat in his cell. as his 
               lights rise, we see that the cell's been stripped bare. gone 
               are his books, drawings, mattress - even his toilet seat. 
               she stands, too, startled. they face each other.

                                     dr. lecter
                         punishment, you see. for miggs. just 
                         like that gospel program. when you 
                         leave, they'll turn the volume way 
                         up. chilton does enjoy his petty 
                         torments.

                                     clarice
                         who killed raspail, doctor...? you 
                         know, don't you?

                                     dr. lecter
                         i've been in this room for eight 
                         years, clarice. i know they will 
                         never, ever let me out while i'm 
                         alive. what i want is a view. i want 
                         a window where i can see a tree, or 
                         even water. i want to be in a federal 
                         institution, away from chilton - and 
                         i want a view. i'll give good value 
                         for it. crawford could do that for 
                         me, but he won't. you persuade him.

                                     clarice
                              (almost a whisper)
                         who killed your patient?

                                     dr. lecter
                         oh, a very naughty boy. someone you 
                         and jack crawford are most anxious 
                         to meet.

                                     clarice
                         buffalo bill...?
                              (incredulous)
                         bill killed him, all those years 
                         ago...? that's impossible.

               but dr. lecter only smiles, enigmatically.

                                     dr. lecter
                         who is he stalking right now, clarice? 
                         i wonder, don't you? how many more 
                         young women will have to die, before 
                         you trade with me...?

               as clarice stares at him, unsure how to respond -

                                                               dissolve to:
