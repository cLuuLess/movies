               moving angle on clarice and crawford, as they walk along a 
               sidewalk, sipping from paper cups. the surveillance van trails 
               them slowly, radios crackling.

                                     clarice
                         are you in trouble over this, mr. 
                         crawford? can senator martin do 
                         something to you?

                                     crawford
                         i'm 53, starling. if i found jimmy 
                         hoffa on national tv, i'd still have 
                         to retire in two years. it's not a 
                         consideration. but you are...
                              (beat)
                         you've done enough. if i keep you 
                         out of school any longer, you'll be 
                         recycled. cost you six months, at 
                         least. i can guarantee you readmission 
                         here, but that's about it.
                              (he stops, looks at 
                              her)
                         now's your chance, starling. go back 
                         to class. leave bill to me.

                                     clarice
                         if you didn't want me chasing him, 
                         you shouldn't have taken me to that 
                         funeral home.

               he looks at her steadily, then nods. they walk on.

                                     clarice
                         lecter is still the key, i know he 
                         is. whatever he told me about bill 
                         is just as good now as it was before.

                                     crawford
                         or just as worthless. but i want you 
                         in memphis, close to him. maybe when 
                         he gets tired of toying with senator 
                         martin, he'll talk to you again. 
                         there's a plane waiting for you now 
                         at the airstrip.

               she smiles at this acknowledgment; he never thought she's 
               quit.

                                     clarice
                         i lied to lecter. i'll need some 
                         kind of peace offering... can i get 
                         the drawings from his cell?

                                     crawford
                         good idea. meantime, try to get a 
                         feel for catherine martin. her 
                         apartment, her friends... how he 
                         might've stalked her. i'm going to 
                         the other two clinics, minnesota and 
                         ohio.
                              (he crumples his cup, 
                              tosses it)
                         now's the hardest part, starling. 
                         use your anger, don't let it keep 
                         you from thinking. just keep your 
                         eyes on catherine. we've got less 
                         than 30 hours.

                              (hesitates)
                         mr. crawford... can those cops down 
                         there handle dr. lecter?

                                     crawford
                              (grimly)
                         they'll use their best men. but they 
                         better be paying attention...

                                                                    cut to:
