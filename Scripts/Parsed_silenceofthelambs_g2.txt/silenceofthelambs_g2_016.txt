               clarice pulls her head back out again, reaching to take her 
               camera from him. she hands him a card, trying to appear 
               nonchalant.

                         mr. yow, if this door should fall
                         down -ha ha! - or anything else - 
                         would you be kind enough to call 
                         this number? it's our baltimore field 
                         office. they know you're here with 
                         me... do you understand?

                                     mr. yow
                         might i suggest tucking your pants 
                         into your socks? to prevent mouse 
                         intrusion.
