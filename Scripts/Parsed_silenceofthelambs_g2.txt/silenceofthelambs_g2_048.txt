               int. johns hopkins - gender identity clinic - day

               moving angle - as the very impatient crawford, clutching a 
               folder, strides down a hall beside dr. danielson - early 
               50's, severe, in a lab coat. nurses, doctors, glance as they 
               pass.

                                     dr. danielson
                         i'm not having a witch hunt here, 
                         mr. crawford! our patients are decent, 
                         non-violent people with a real 
                         problem.

                                     crawford
                         dr. danielson, the man we want was 
                         never your patient. it would be 
                         someone you refused because he tries 
                         to conceal a record of criminal 
                         violence. please, doctor - time is 
                         eating us up. just show me the ones 
                         you've turned away.

               danielson enters a cramped, stainless steel nurse's gallery, 
               with crawford following, and pours himself a cup of coffee.

                                     dr. danielson
                              (adamantly)
                         examination and interview materials 
                         are confidential. we've never violated 
                         an applicant's trust, and we never 
                         will.

                                     crawford
                         you want to see a violation? this is 
                         a violation...

               he takes a black & white photo from his folder, slaps it 
               down in front of danielson. from our angle, we can't see it 
               clearly.

                                     crawford
                         her name is kimberly jane emberg, 
                         she was just id'd. i met her on a 
                         slab in west virginia. and sometime 
                         tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's 
                         going to do the same thing to 
                         catherine martin.

                                     dr. danielson
                         that's a childish, bullying stunt, 
                         mr. crawford. i was a battlefield 
                         surgeon, so you can put away your 
                         picture.

               burroughs sticks his head in, looking for crawford.

                                     burroughs
                         phone, jack. director burke.

                                     crawford
                              (snaps)
                         in a minute!

               burroughs hurriedly retreats. crawford strains for patience.

                                     crawford
                         look... search your own records, if 
                         you prefer. you can do it a lot faster 
                         than us, anyway. if we find buffalo 
                         bill through your information, i'll 
                         suppress it. nobody has to know this 
                         hospital cooperated.

                                     dr. danielson
                         i doubt very much that the fbi or 
                         any other government agency can keep 
                         a secret, mr. crawford. truth will 
                         out... and then what? will you give 
                         johns hopkins a new identity? put a 
                         big pair of sunglasses on this 
                         building, and a funny nose?

                                     crawford
                         oh, that's clever, dr. danielson. 
                         very humorous. you like the truth? 
                         try this.
                              (right in his face, 
                              enraged)
                         he kidnaps young women and kills 
                         them and rips their skin off. we 
                         don't want him to do that anymore. 
                         if you don't help me, just as fast 
                         as you can, then the justice 
                         department is going to ask publicly 
                         for a court order, we'll ask twice a 
                         day, just in time for the morning 
                         and evening news. and each one of 
                         our press conferences will focus on 
                         dr. danielson, over at johns hopkins, 
                         and how we're still hoping for his 
                         cooperation. and every time there's 
                         any news on the case - when catherine 
                         martin floats, when the next one 
                         floats, and the next one - why, we'll 
                         just issue another press release 
                         about good ol' dr. danielson, over 
                         at johns hopkins - complete with all 
                         his humorous fucking remarks.

                                     dr. danielson
                              (pause; stiffly)
                         it may be that - i could confer with 
                         my colleagues on this. and get back 
                         to you.

                                     crawford
                         would you, doctor? that would be so 
                         kind.

                                                                    cut to:
