               int. fbi turbojet - flying - day

               crawford sits at a communications console, with burroughs, 
               in headphones, by his side. this forward section of the cabin 
               is crammed with hi-tech equipment, all lit up and whirring. 
               through a window we see clouds, part of the jet's wing.

                         calumet city, edge of chicago. i'll 
                         be on the ground in 45 minutes with 
                         the hostage rescue team. i'm back in 
                         charge, starling. he's mine.

               as clarice reacts; her happiness for crawford is tinged with 
               disappointment at being so suddenly out of the hunt.

                              (on phone)
                         sir, that's great news. but how -

                         johns hopkins finally came up with a 
                         name for us. we fed him into known 
                         offenders, and he came up cherries.

                         subject's name is "jamie gumb," aka 
                         "john grant." lecter's description 
                         was accurate, he just lied about the 
                         name.

               twelve-man hrt. they're seated in full gear, hardshell armor, 
               quietly checking and rechecking their bulging cases of weapons -

                         take a bow. customs had some paper 
                         on his alias. they stopped a carton 
                         two years ago at lax - live 
                         caterpillars from surinam. the

                         power & light's given us two possible

                         chicago's only about 400 miles from
                         here. i could be there in -

                         no, starling, there isn't time. and 
                         you've still got crucial work to do 
                         in ohio. we want him for murder, not 
                         kidnapping. i'm counting on you to 
                         link him to the bimmel girl, before 
                         he's indicted.

               clarice tries hard to swallow her disappointment.

                         starling - you've earned back your 
                         place in the academy. we never 
                         would've found him without you, and 
                         nobody's ever going to forget that. 
                         least of all me.

               switches off, feeling bad for her. on the console near him, 
               the fax machine starts to chatter. he turns, looks.
