               ext. sidewalk of the funeral home - potter, west va. - day

               sound of organ music, as clarice, carrying her fingerprint 
               kit, mounts some steps to the sidewalk. she stops, seeing -

               country people

               in their somber best, filing into the mortuary for a service. 
               the music - "shall we gather at the river?" - is issuing 
               from the open double doors. several of the mourners glance 
               over at her curiously.

               angle on clarice

               staring back at the mourners, hearing the music, as a sense 
               memory is triggered in her...

               in flashback - low angle, moving

               as we approach, down the aisle of a country chapel, an open 
               wooden coffin. sad country faces turn, looking at us from 
               the flanking pews. the b.g. organ hymn is "shall we 
               gather...?"

               the sad, 10 year-old clarice

               in her best dress, is reluctantly approaching the casket. 
               her hands are held by the plump hands of unseen matrons.

               child's pov

               on the looming coffin... closer and closer... until finally 
               she can see, lying inside it... her dead father, arms folded, 
               his marshal's badge still pinned to his lapel.

                                     crawford (v.o.)
                         starling...?

               new angle (present day)

               as the grownup clarice turns towards the impatient crawford. 
               like her, he carries a large case.

                                     crawford
                         we're around back.

                                                                    cut to:
