               ext. a clear night sky

               very beautiful, glittering with countless stars.

                         where i have a view, clarice...

               moving down

               we see a rolling lawn, a curving bay. boats ride at anchor, 
               lights shimmering...

                                     dr. lecter (o.s.)
                         orion is looking splendid tonight, 
                         and arcturus, the herdsman, with his 
                         flock...

               dr. lecter

               smiles into his mobile phone. he is stretched out on a 
               lounger, on a tiled patio, languidly paring an orange with a 
               penknife. his appearance is quite altered - a beard, glasses, 
               lighter hair. he's has some cosmetic surgery, as well.

                                     dr. lecter
                              (into phone)
                         your lambs are still for now, clarice, 
                         but not forever... you'll have to 
                         earn it again and again, this blessed 
                         silence. because it's the plight 
                         that drives you, and the plight will 
                         never end.

                                     clarice
                         dr. lecter -

                                     dr. lecter
                         i have no plans to call on you, 
                         clarice, the world being more 
                         interesting with you in it. be sure 
                         you extend me the same courtesy.

                                     clarice (v.o.)
                         you know i can't make that promise.

                                     dr. lecter
                         goodbye, clarice...
                              (and then, softly)
                         you looked - so very lovely today, 
                         in your blue suit.

                                                                    cut to:
