               int. mr. gumb's cellar - day (dim light)

               close on the needle of the victrola, on the spinning record, 
               as mr. gumb's fingers lift away. music continues in 
               background.

                                     mr. gumb (o.s.)
                              (calling out)
                         preeeeecious...!

               close on the moth cage, as mr. gumb's fingers search through 
               the humus, and find a plump new cocoon, lifting it out. the 
               door of the cage is left open, and one or two of the adult 
               moths flutter out.

                                     mr. gumb (o.s.)
                         precious, come on precious! busy 
                         busy day today...

               close on a clean towel, beside the sink. the cocoon is gently 
               placed in readiness alongside four shiny skinning knives.

                                     mr. gumb (o.s.)
                         momma's gonna be sooo beautiful!

               close on a stainless steel colt python, with a six-inch 
               barrel, as the cylinder is spun, and the hammer gets a 
               practice cock. the metallic click is deep and loud. a note 
               of alarm has entered mr. gumb's voice.

                                     mr. gumb (o.s.)
                         you come here this minute, you little 
                         scamp!

               low angle on mr. gumb, wearing the kimono, as he walks through 
               his sewing workroom. his back is to us; he is looking 
               anxiously under the furniture. he stops, straightens. 
               genuinely scared.

                                     mr. gumb
                         precious...?

               low angle - over the pit opening

               towards mr. gumb, as he stops at one of the doorways of the 
               oubliette chamber. he stares inside; his face in shadows.

                                     mr. gumb
                         sweetheart...?

               from the distant bottom of the pit, we hear catherine's voice.

                                     catherine (o.s.)
                         she'd down here you sack of shit.

               mr. gumb's fist flies to his mouth, and he sags against the 
               doorframe. a little groan escaped him; the dog answers with 
               a series of yips.

               upward angle, from the pit bottom

               as mr. gumb's dark shape leans cautiously over the edge.

                                     mr. gumb
                         precious, are you all right?

               reverse angle on catherine

               crouched to one side, clutching the dog to her chest. seeing 
               mr. gumb, the dog squirms frantically, barking.

                                     catherine
                         get me a telephone. lower it down to 
                         me. do it now, mister! i don't want 
                         to have to hurt this little dog.

               upward angle

               on mr. gumb, as, with a cry of fury, he whips the colt from 
               inside his kimono. the muzzle gleams as he takes aim.

               catherine yanks the dog up, into his line of fire, screaming 
               at him.

                                     catherine
                         you shoot motherfucker you better 
                         kill me quick or i'll break her 
                         fucking neck, i swear to god!

                                     mr. gumb (o.s.)
                              (wails)
                         nooooooo!

               tucking the dog under one arm, she grabs its muzzle, twisting 
               the head. the dog whines piteously.

                                     catherine
                         back off, you son of a bitch! back 
                         off!

               upward angle

               as mr. gumb cries out again - a terrible, inarticulate scream 
               of rage and anguish. but then he slowly lowers his gun.

               reverse angle

               on catherine, as she maintains her grip.

                                     catherine
                         that's better... now get me a live 
                         telephone. get a long extension and 
                         lower is down here... and you better 
                         do it fast, too, 'cause i think her 
                         leg's broken. she's in pain, mister, 
                         she needs a vet.

               mr. gumb

               stares down at her, a long beat, breathing heavily.

                                     mr. gumb
                         you think she's in pain? you don't 
                         know what pain is. but you're going 
                         to find out...

               and abruptly he vanishes. sound of his footsteps, rushing 
               off.

               catherine

               begins shaking, hands and arms twitching uncontrollably. she 
               hugs the little dog tight to her chest, buries her face in 
               its fur, sobbing...

                                                               dissolve to:
