               int. the surveillance van - day (driving)

               the van is crammed with an impressive array of hi-tech 
               equipment, all clicking and humming. burroughs is talking 
               quietly on a scrambler phone, while another agent works a 
               computer.

                                     crawford (o.s.)
                         maybe we can locate some of raspail's 
                         old lovers. maybe, someday...

               clarice and crawford

               sit in swivel seats at the rear, by a big window. clarice 
               can't resit an occasional peak at the trailing motorcade, 
               awed and a bit thrilled to be the center of so much attention.

                                     crawford
                         but for catherine martin, it all 
                         comes down to you and lecter. you're 
                         the one he talks to.

                                     clarice
                         he's already offered to help... what 
                         would happen if we just showed our 
                         cards - asked him for bill?

                                     crawford
                         he offered to help, starling, not to 
                         snitch. that wouldn't give him enough 
                         chance to show off. remember, lecter 
                         looks mainly for fun. never forget 
                         fun.

                                     clarice
                         but if he knew we have so little 
                         time -

                                     crawford
                         if we act too anxious, he'll make us 
                         wait. he'll let the senator keep 
                         hoping, day after day, until catherine 
                         finally washes up. that'd be the 
                         most fun of all.

                                     clarice
                         i think he means it, this time. i 
                         think he'll deal.

                                     crawford
                         what would it take?

                                     clarice
                         transfer to a new prison. with a 
                         view of trees, he said, or even 
                         water... can we swing that?

                                     crawford
                              (shakes his head)
                         state to federal jurisdiction... we 
                         can do it - eventually - but we'll 
                         never get all the clearances in time. 
                         can you convince him a deal's already 
                         in place?

                                     clarice
                         you'll back me up with some paperwork?
                              (he nods)
                         then i'll try. but wouldn't this 
                         have more weight coming from the 
                         senator herself?

                                     crawford
                              (hesitates)
                         she doesn't know what we're up to. 
                         and we can't afford to let her find 
                         out.

               clarice looks at him, surprised.

                                     crawford
                         she's the mother, starling. she can't 
                         possibly comprehend what lecter is. 
                         she'd make the mistake of pleading 
                         with him. begging him... he'd feast 
                         on her pain till the last second of 
                         that girl's life...

                                                                    cut to:
