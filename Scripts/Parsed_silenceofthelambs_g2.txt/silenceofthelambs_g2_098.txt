               ext. bimmel back yard - day

               clarice walks slowly across the yard, absorbing all this 
               news, before suddenly leaping into the air and pumping her 
               fist in triumph, with a happy yelp. then she sees -

               mr. bimmel

               staring at her in surprise. he sits by his coops, smoking.

               clarice

               somewhat embarrassed, crosses over to him.

                                     clarice
