	int. eye in the sky room - continuous

	forty video monitors show every inch of the hotel.  a man
	stands in front of the two-way mirror looking down at the
	casino, the reflection off the glass obscuring his features.

	lee has the tape around his mouth and his hands tied behind
	his back as he's led into the room by hu li.

		imagine a business where people hand you
		money.  and you hand them back
		absolutely nothing.

	ricky tan - alive and well, turns around and stares at lee. 
	isabella is standing next to him.  lee is shocked at the
	sight of ricky tan alive.

				ricky tan (cont'd)
		now that's a true american dream. 
		thanks to a few pieces of metal and a
		very greed driven us customs agent.

	ricky tan walks toward lee, starts to smile.

				ricky tan (cont'd)
		look at you, you're ridiculous.  you
		know it didn't have to be like this. 
		but it's too bad!  like father, like
		son.

	lee stares at isabella for a beat.  hu li motions to one of
	the monitors.

				hu li
			(in chinese)
		he's going for the plates.

	ricky tan looks at one of the monitors, sees steven reign
	walking down a hallway, about to walk into the penthouse
	suite.

				ricky tan
		look at this old fool, what does he
		think he's doing?

	ricky tan shifts his attention back to lee.

				ricky tan (cont'd)
		it's almost impossible to find a partner
		that's trustworthy and loyal.  wouldn't
		you agree, lee?

	on another screen

	we see carter at the craps table having the time of his life. 
	ricky tan turns to walk out of the room, motioning to
	isabella as he goes.

				ricky tan (cont'd)
		well, at least you will die with honor. 
		but choy gien.
