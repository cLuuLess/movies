	int. captain diel's office - lapd headquarters - day

	captain diel sits behind his desk talking on the phone.

				captain diel
		is it true, carter?  are you in hong
		kong right now?

				carter
		hong kong?  i'm not in hong kong.  i'm
		in hollywood -- right at sunset and
		vine, two minutes from the station.  how
		about i pick you up right now and take
		you to dinner?

				captain diel
		it's nine-thirty in the morning.

				carter
		did i say dinner?  i meant diner. 
		biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.

				captain diel
		do you know what happened yesterday,
		carter?  i was officially nominated for
		the commissioner's post for the lapd. 
		there was a dinner last night, two
		hundred lapd officers were there.

				carter
		two hundred cops?  was mario sanchez
		there?  he owes me money.

				captain diel
		i've waited my whole life for this job,
		but i don't have a shot in hell of
		getting it.  do you know why?

				carter
		is it because of the hookers, sir?  you
		tell them there's no crime in being
		lonely.

				captain diel
		no, carter.  the reason i'm screwed is
		because the entire department is about
		to find out the stolen credit cards we
		impounded were used to buy two first
		class upgrades to hong kong.  and what
		the hell is heaven on earth?

				carter
		sir, i'm working on a big case over here
		-- and by the time i get back they're
		gonna make you governor.  captain, you
		there?  hello?  shit!

	as carter walks out the door, he brushes past hu li, who is
	standing in the hallway disguised as a fed ex delivery
	person.  carter checks her out as he exits.
