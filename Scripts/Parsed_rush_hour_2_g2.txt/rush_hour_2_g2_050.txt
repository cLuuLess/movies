	int. cheap hotel room - downtown la - night

	cartons of chinese food are all over the sleazy, run down
	hotel room.  the lights low, the curtains open a crack.

	binoculars p.o.v. - the reign hotel

	traveling up the side of the reign hotel.  stopping at the
	penthouse floor - where we see isabella talking with steven
	reign in a hotel room.  after a beat, reign walks to the
	door.

	carter flips the binoculars to lee, who starts watching.

				carter
		yeah, that's definitely the woman from
		ricky tan's boat, and she's staying in
		his suite at his hotel, i told you this
		would work out.  they still just
		talking?

				lee
		he just left.  kissed her on the cheek.

				carter
		he'll be back soon.

				lee
		how do you know?

				carter
		look at her.  now, wake me in an hour,
		i'll take over.

	lee lowers the binoculars, turns to carter, who is trying to
	sleep on the bed.

				lee
		carter, there's something i have to tell
		you.  you were right about what you said
		in hong kong.  all i do is work.  never
		take a day off.  it's all i have right
		now.

				carter
		hey, i didn't mean to call you pathetic.

				lee
		the truth is, i haven't had any mu-shu
		in six months.

				carter
		you pull a muscle or something?

				lee
		my fiancee left me over the summer -- a
		month before our wedding.

				carter
		i'm sorry, lee.  why did she leave you?

				lee
		it's a long story.

				carter
		let me guess, she couldn't handle the
		cop thing -- never knowing if you were
		dead or alive.  i've seen it a million
		times.

				lee
		no.  it was my singing.

				carter
		excuse me?

				lee
		she hated my voice.  said it drove her
		crazy.  i sang to her all the time - in
		bed - in the shower - i thought she
		liked it.  she finally told me it was
		driving her crazy.

	carter stares at lee for a long beat.

				carter
		lee, maybe it's best if we don't discuss
		our personal lives.  let's die curious.

	lee lifts the binoculars - turns back to the building.

				carter (cont'd)
		what's she doing?

	binoculars p.o.v. - on isabella

	she walks to the bedroom, where we see her through sheer
	curtains.  slowly taking off her coat.

				carter (cont'd)
		lee?  you okay?

	lee's eyes go wide as isabella drops her coat and starts to
	unbutton her blouse.

				lee
		she's just standing around -- not doing
		much.

				carter
		just don't fall asleep.  sooner or later
		something's gonna happen.

				lee
		i'll try to stay awake.  it's so boring.

	isabella starts to remove her blouse.  lee starting to sweat
	as he watches her undress.

				lee (cont'd)
		slow down, baby.

				carter
		what did you say?

				lee
		nothing.  i said nothing.

	lee lowers his binoculars, steps away from the window.

				lee (cont'd)
		is it hot in here?

				carter
		hot?  i'm freezing my ass off.

				lee
		i'm gonna go in the hall and get a
		bucket of ice.  you want some ice?

				carter
		what's going on?  

	lee stares at carter, looks dazed.

				lee
		she's getting undressed.

				carter
		gimme the binoculars.

				lee
		no.  it's not right.

				carter
		gimme the binoculars or i will shoot
		you.

	lee hands carter the binoculars, then turns his back as
	carter watches to the window.

				lee
		what's she doing?

				carter
		oh, sweet glory hallelujah...

				lee
		i don't want to hear this.

				carter
		skirt just came off.  she's in black bra
		and panties -- victoria secret spring
		catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec -
		there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it
		looks like snoopy.

				lee
		snoopy?  i love snoopy.

				carter
		she just took her hair down.  now she's
		going for the bra -- the clasp is in
		front -- she's using both hands.
			(to lee)
		you better get that ice.

	lee steps in front of carter, blocking his view.

				lee
		that's enough.  we shouldn't be doing
		this!

	isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the
	living room to pick up the phone.  we see her clearly now in
	bra and panties.

				carter
		this is our job.  we took an oath as
		police officers.  if we don't do this,
		who will?  firemen?

	lee backs off, and carter steps back to the window.  he sees
	isabella hang up the phone.

				carter (cont'd)
		wait a sec - what the hell is that
		between her legs?

				lee
		what?

				carter
		she's reaching into her panties --
		something is strapped to her leg.  oh,
		god...please don't let it be a dick.

				lee
		what is it?

				carter
		no, i don't believe this shit -- it's a
		microphone.  lee, she's wired...

	close on isabella

	as she turns to the window.  a tape recorder in hand.  she
	puts the recording device away, walks back into the bedroom
	and puts on a robe.

				lee
		i don't understand?

				carter
		she's walking back towards the door.

	binoculars p.o.v.

	we see isabella wearing a robe - standing at the door of her
	hotel room talking with someone.

				carter (cont'd)
		she opened the door.  someone is
		delivering a package.

	binoculars p.o.v.

	inside the hotel room we see hu li handing her a package.

				carter (cont'd)
		lee...it's the girl who delivered the
		package to your office.  it's a bomb!

	lee and carter bolt on the move - sprinting out of the room.
