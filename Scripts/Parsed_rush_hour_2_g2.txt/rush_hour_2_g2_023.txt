	int. lee's office - day

	the shades are down as lee frantically gets dressed, putting
	on a suit and fixing his tie. 
	carter finishes putting on a black chinese style suit from
	lee's closet, then moves for the door.

				lee
		where are you going?

				carter
		back to heaven on earth.  i need my damn
		passport back.  i'm going home.

				lee
		fine.  go home.  who needs you.

				carter
		why you mad at me?  you needed back-up,
		so i backed you up.  i was about to take
		out ricky tan and those bodyguards.

				lee
		stop!  i'm sick of your bullshit!

				carter
		my bullshit?  i'm not the one who goes
		to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! 
		i'm not the one who goes to massage
		parlors to bust crime lords!

				lee
		it's my job!

				carter
		you're pathetic, man.  when's the last
		time you had some fun?  when's the last
		time you took a night off, had a date?

				lee
		i have plenty of dates.

				carter
		really?  when's the last time you had
		some mu-shu  let's hear it, lee, when
		was it?  year of the rat?

				lee
		you would never understand my life. 
		you're not chinese.

				carter
		and you ain't black!

	the two men look at each other for a long beat.  lee quickly
	walks out, slamming the door behind him, leaving carter half
	dressed.
