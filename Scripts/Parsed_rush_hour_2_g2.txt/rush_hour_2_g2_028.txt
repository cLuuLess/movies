	int. hong kong police station - bullpen/lee's office - day

	lee walks out of the captain's office, heads for his own
	office - but never gets there.

	an explosion rips through the second floor of the station. 
	lee diving for safety as glass and debris shoot over his
	head.  sheer pandemonium as lee quickly looks up at his
	destroyed office, tries to get to his feet.

	stunned police officers and detectives are crowded around
	lee's office, looking at the rubble.  lee pushes through the
	crowd -- it's all smoke and fire.  now way anyone held back
	by the heat.
