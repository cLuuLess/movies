	int. raven club - night

	a dark, upscale club that is packed with gangsters, beautiful
	girls and civilians.  lee and carter walk in.  lee is trying
	to keep a low profile as carter stares up at the stage, where
	a man sings karaoke -- the most painful rendition of michael
	jackson's "don't stop 'till you get enough."

				lee
		i'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. 
		they don't like tourists in here, so try
		to blend in.

				carter
		blend in?  i'm two feet taller than
		everyone here.  where you going?

				lee
		bathroom.

	lee walks off, trying not to be seen as carter steps up to
	the bar, takes a seat next to two chinese thugs.

				carter
		how you boys doing tonight?

	the thugs ignore carter as he motions to the stage, where the
	old man continues to sing.

				carter (cont'd)
		that is the worst singing i've ever
		heard.  that sounds like something you'd
		hear in prison after lights out.

	the thugs continue to ignore carter.
