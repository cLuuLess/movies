		lee, this is special agent sterling from
		the united states secret service.

				lee
		the secret service?  why?

				sterling
		what i'm about to tell you cannot leave
		this room.  the men who were killed
		yesterday were not american translators. 
		they were undercover u.s. customs agents
		trying to break a triad smuggling ring. 
		we don't know what they're transporting
		out of hong kong, but whatever it is, it
		got the agents killed.

				lee
		how can we help?

				sterling
		stay the hell out of our way.

				lee
		i can get to ricky tan.

				sterling
		we know all about tan.  that's why we're
		leaving him out there as bait.  we think
		this is a lot bigger than just ricky tan
		and his fu-cang-long triads.
