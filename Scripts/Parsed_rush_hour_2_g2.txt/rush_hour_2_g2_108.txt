	ext. building - night

	lee and carter dive out the window, grab a cable just as the
	penthouse blows!

	the fireball shoots out as they start to slide down the side
	of the hotel.

	they scream as the cable breaks.

	lee and carter swing toward a huge "grand opening" banner. 
	they flip under it, do a loop before they slam against the
	sign.

	it's knocked loose and they fall with it toward vegas blvd.

	lee and carter hang on as they drop to the street.  a huge
	truck speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives. 
	the entire strip speeding toward them.

				lee
		i can't believe i flew ten-thousand
		miles for this shit!!

	they lift their feet just as the truck passes.  the sign dips
	and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a large
	stretch limo.
