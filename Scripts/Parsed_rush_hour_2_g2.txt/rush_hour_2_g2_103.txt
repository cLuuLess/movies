	int. penthouse suite - continuous

	steven reign is closing the safe.  there are stacks of
	hundred dollar bills on his desk, which he's putting in a
	black bag along with the plates.  as he turns around, he
	comes face-to-face with ricky tan.

				ricky tan
		american's love to gamble.  don't they,
		mr. reign?

				steven reign

		leaving.

				ricky tan
		and my plates?

				steven reign
		they stay with me.  i'm sure you won't
		have a problem with that.

	reign shows tan the gun in his belt.  grabs the bag and
	starts to walk toward the door.

				ricky tan
		i enjoyed that little story you told
		about the dragon and the treasure.  my
		mother used to tell it to me all the
		time.  do you know the moral of that
		story, mr. reign?

				steven reign
		greed will imprison us all.

	tan grabs reign from behind and stabs him with a knife.

				ricky tan
		i hate that fortune cookie shit.

	lee bursts through the suite door - watches as reign falls
	dead to the floor.  ricky takes the black bag off the desk.

				lee
		put the plates down.

	ricky tan looks down at the gun in reign's belt.
