	ext./int. lee's car - continuous

	the passenger window rolls down and we see carter, styling in
	a chinese-cut suit.  he's holding a chinese-english
	dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me"
	look to two girls in a convertible.

				carter
			(int chinese)
		deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu.

	the horrified girls speed off, and carter turns to lee, who
	is driving and singing to his radio.

				lee
			(singing)
		...wish they all could be california...
		wish they all could be california
		girls...

	carter ejects the beach boys cd from the stereo and tosses it
	out of the sunroof.

				carter
		i warned you about playing that shit
		when i'm in the car.

				lee
		that was my cd.  don't you ever touch a
		chinese man's cd.

				carter
		did you see the way those girls drove
		off?  i did you a favor.

				lee
		those girls drove off because of you.

				carter
		all i did was invite them for a drink.

				lee
		you invited them to get naked and
		sacrifice a small goat.

				carter
			(checking chinese-english
			 dictionary)
		i said that?  which word was "goat?"

	lee picks up his cd case.

				lee
		you owe me a copy of the beach boys
		greatest hits, volume two.

				carter
		don't be giving me attitude, lee.  i've
		been here three days and we haven't done
		shit.  we haven't been to a club,
		haven't even talked to a girl.  i'm on
		vacation, and i want some mu-shu.

				lee
		mu-shu?  you're hungry?

				carter
		not mu-shu.  mu-shu.  i want to see some
		women.  now stop playing dumb and show
		me the shu!

	carter flips through the dictionary.  a call comes in over
	lee's cell phone.
