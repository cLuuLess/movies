	int. yacht - night

	a huge party, a live band plays for a crowd of business men,
	politicians and beautiful women - a who's who of hong kong.

	carter walks up to the front of the boat -- two doormen
	holding clipboards immediately stop him.

				doorman #1
		invitation, please.

				carter
		i'm with the band.  i'm the lead singer.

				doorman #1
		the band has been playing over an hour.

				carter
		i got held up at a wedding in tai koo. 
		ricky here yet, i need to get his
		requests.

	as carter walks past the doorman -- 

				doorman #1
		wait.

				carter
		last party all he wanted was sting --
		not one person danced.  tonight i'm
		doing superfreak, i don't care what he
		says.  where is he?

				doorman #1
		mr. tan is not to be disturbed by the
		help.

	carter turns back to the doorman, grabs him by the collar.

				carter
		help?  i'm not the help, man -- i'm the
		star.  that's my band up there -- i
		control the mood, the groove, the
		atmosphere.

	carter cuts a smoking dance move.

				carter (cont'd)
		can you do that?
			(man shakes head "no")
		that's why you're down here and i'm up
		there.  now this is my party -- don't
		forget it!

	carter walks onto the ship, starts singing to himself.
