	ext. hong kong street - night

	the far end of the street is blocked by market stalls.  the
	gangsters look around frantically.  an apartment building is
	under construction, massive bamboo scaffolding top to bottom. 
	their only way out is up.

	lee and carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters
	swarming up the scaffolding.  lee wastes no time going after
	them.  with a running start, he jams a foot on the wall and
	vaults to the bottom rung, grabs hold and swings up.

				carter
		hang on, lee.  i'm coming.

	carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding.  not even
	close.  he backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!

	above - lee reaches 4 gangsters.  they all tear off the
	lengths of bamboo and square off.  the clatter of wood
	against wood as they beat at each other.  wrestling over his
	pole, lee flings two of the gangsters over the edge.

	below, carter has hold of the bottom rung, straining mightily
	to pull himself up.  just as he gets his chin above the
	bar... snap!  it breaks and he drops.  then...

	wham!  wham!  the two gangsters crash land on either side of
	carter.  he takes one look at their pain.

				carter (cont'd)
		forget this...

	he dashes into the stairwell.  above, the last two gangsters
	come at lee.  he stomps down, levering up floor boards, which
	see-saws them off-balance.  with the advantage, he batters
	them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off.  he climbs
	after the gangster leader.

	on hu li and the gangsters

	coming over the crest of the hill, seeing carter climbing up
	the hill.
