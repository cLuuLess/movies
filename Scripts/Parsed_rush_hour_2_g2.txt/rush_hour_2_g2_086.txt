	int. casino - night

	as steven reign makes his way through the casino, carter
	steps right in front of him, giving him a big hug.

				carter
		stevie, how's it going my man?  somebody
		get a picture, we can use it for a mug
		shot.

				steven reign
		detective carter, you always seem to
		show up where you don't belong.

				carter
		lemme ask you something, steven.  and i
		want the truth.  is there any way i can
		date your daughter?  just dinner and a
		movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...

				steven reign
		vegas has been my town for 30 years.  i
		crawled out from under the first rock. 
		do you really think you can intimidate
		me here?

				carter
		you're right, you're a smart guy.  most
		counterfeiters only get ten cents on the
		dollar.  but this is an even swap.  pure
		genius.

				steven reign
		you play games with me, detective, and
		you'll lose every time.  don't forget. 
		the odds are always in favor of the
		house.

	reign walks off with his men.  carter watches him leave.
