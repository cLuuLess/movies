	ext. hong kong street - day

	carter walks down the street holding a cage with a live red
	bird inside.  he stops a man who is sweeping in front of his
	store.

				carter
		how you doing?  i'm looking for heaven
		on earth.

	the man stares at carter, watches as he pulls out his:

	english/chinese dictionary

				carter (cont'd)
		shan-shui cao guo-jiu, pao gai niu tao
		zi.

				man
		you wish to spank my sister with a ping
		pong paddle?

				carter
		no man, i was just asking...

				man
		wait here.  i'll go see if she's awake.

	as the man walks into his store, carter runs off.

	pause.

	carter strolls back into frame, peering into the store to see
	if it's worth staying...
