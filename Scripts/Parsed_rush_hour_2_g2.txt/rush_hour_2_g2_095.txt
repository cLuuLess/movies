	carter has two racks of chips in front of him, a huge crowd
	surrounding him.

				carter
		i'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. 
		that's a ferrari.  do they sell those
		here in the gift shop?  somebody cash me
		out!

	several triad soldiers dressed like security guards approach
	carter's table.

				pit boss
		sir, we'd like to escort you to the
		cashier.

				carter
		that would be great.  don't want any of
		these rich white people to jump me.

	as they walk toward the door marked "vip room", carter
	glances at the men, knows he's in deep shit.
