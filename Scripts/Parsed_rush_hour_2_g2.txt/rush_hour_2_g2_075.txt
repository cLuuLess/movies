	int. 18-wheeler - truck bed - continuous

	carter works at opening one of the crates.  lee steps up,
	takes a deep breath, searches the crate looking for the sweet
	spot, and punches a hole in one of the thick boards.  they
	start prying the crate open.

				carter
		very nice.

				lee
		it's focus.  every opponent has a weak
		spot.  you ignore everything around you,
		and put all your energy into one perfect
		strike.

				carter
		i'll remember that next time i'm
		fighting a box.

	carter opens the crate -- it's filled with superbills, about
	$1,000,000 worth.  he tosses a stack to lee.

				carter (cont'd)
		hello, benjamin.

				lee
		who's benjamin?

				carter
		benjamin franklin, he discovered
		electricity.

				lee
		a chinese man discovered electricity.

				carter
		no chinese man discovered electricity.

				lee
		yes he did.  he also invented the
		bicycle.

				carter
		now that i believe.

	carter pockets two stacks of superbills.  lee looks at him.

				carter (cont'd)
		you never know.  besides, i always
		wanted to die rich.

	the truck lurches.

				lee
		we're slowing down.  this must be it.

				carter
		end of the line.

				lee
		you've been a good friend, james carter.

				carter
		oh no you don't.  don't you be getting
		corny on me, lee.  i'll kick your ass
		from here to compton.

				lee
		you could never kick my ass.  you mama's
		boy.

				carter
		don't you talk about my mama.
			(winks at lee)
		that's more like it.
