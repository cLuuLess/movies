	ext. american consulate - hong kong - day

	the american embassy - u.s. and chinese flags side by side. 

	hu li, dark glasses, exits and slowly moves toward a street
	vendor across the street.

	she pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first
	bite we see:

	the explosion behind her

	two offices on the sixth floor blown out - a huge fireball
	erupting over one side of the embassy.

	people panic and run.  hu li doesn't even flinch.  she takes
	a bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned
	street vendor.
