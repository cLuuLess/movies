	carter walks up to a craps table, everyone turning to stare.

				craps dealer
		sir, you're aware that we require a
		fifty-thousand dollar buy in to gamble
		here this weekend?

	carter throws a hundred thousand in $100 bills onto the
	table.

				carter
		i saw the sign, i can read.  now gimme a
		hundred-thousand in chips.  and a diet
		coke and some wash-n-dries.  let's move,
		people, i came to play.

	the dealer pushes 100k worth of chips in front of carter.

				carter (cont'd)
		what the hell is that?

				craps dealer
		those are five hundred dollar chips.

				carter
		did you give me five-hundred dollar
		chips because i'm black?

				craps dealer
		no, i just assumed...

				carter
		you assumed a brother coming in here can
		only afford five-hundred dollars a roll,
		is that right?  are you a racist?

				craps dealer
		no, sir.

				carter
			(starting to scream)
		everyone else at the table has thousand
		dollar chips, but the black man gets the
		nickel, is that it?  did my people
		survive two-hundred years of slavery so
		you could send us back to the cotton
		fields with five-hundred dollar chips? 
		do i look like chicken george to you?

	the pit boss gets on his walkie-talkie.
