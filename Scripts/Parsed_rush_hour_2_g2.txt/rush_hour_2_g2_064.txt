	int. kitchen - continuous

	kenny leads carter and lee in, closes the door.

				kenny
		hear you got your ass kicked in hong
		kong, james.

				carter
		what??  where'd you hear that?

				kenny
		i got my sources.

				carter
		and i got mine, meaning you.  nice how
		that works out.
			(beat)
		i'm serious this time, i'm closing this
		place down.

				kenny
		james, you see my kids back there?  you
		know how much i'm paying for private
		school?  how can you come in here with
		this attitude, you being little chang's
		godfather?

				carter
		little chang is gonna have to go visit
		his daddy in jail if you don't
		cooperate.

				kenny
		jail!?  james, you better back off. 
		badge or no badge, i'll kick your ass.

				carter
		i'd like to see you try.

	kenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial
	arts move.  lee gets in front of carter to protect him --
	countering kenny's move.

				kenny
			(to lee)
		we're on, then.

	kenny throws out another precision martial arts sequence --
	lee blocks -- kenny ends in an advanced fighting stance.

				lee
			(impressed)
		that's a good twisting tiger -- where
		did you learn that?

	they switch to chinese.

				kenny
		master ching taught me.

				lee
		the praying mantis school, in bejing?

				kenny
		no.  freddy ching's, in crenshaw.

	lee smiles, carter looks back and forth from lee to kenny.

				kenny (cont'd)
		what are you doing hanging out with baby
		duck?

				lee
		baby duck?

				kenny
		that's what we all used to call him when
		he was a kid -- cause he was always
		quacking.  never shut up.

				carter
		i heard that.

	lee and kenny laugh.

				carter (cont'd)
		look, i need some info and i don't have
		time to play around.

				kenny
		is this about the funny money?

				carter
		how'd you know?

				kenny
		you've been asking loud questions in all
		the wrong places all morning.  how come
		you always save me for last, james? 
		when are you gonna learn.  shit don't
		happen i don't know about.

				carter
		so tell me what you know.

				kenny
		i know teddy wu is cranking out a pretty
		good double sawbuck -- but you knew that
		too, didn't you?

				carter
		yeah.  we already been there.  this is
		big, kenny.  benjamins.  secret service
		calls 'em superbills.  banks can't even
		tell the difference.

	kenny considers this for a moment.

				carter (cont'd)
		what?

				kenny
		one of my regulars lost fifty thousand
		dollars at the table here last week.  i
		was about to send my boys down to tune
		his ass up, when the guy comes in and
		pays off the whole thing.  including the
		vig -- brand new sequential hundred
		dollar bills.  i knew something was
		wrong.  cause this guy's got a regular
		job, no way he comes up with fifty grand
		in cash. 
		but i tested the bills, infrared.  the
		whole thing.  and they checked out. 
		100%.

				lee
		do you still have the bills?

				kenny
		i still have my lunch money from third
		grade.

				carter
		lemme see 'em.

	kenny pushes a chinese painting aside to reveal a wall safe. 
	he opens the safe and hands carter a $100 bill.  carter
	checks it out.

				kenny
		see.  it's perfect.

	carter takes out a lighter and holds the flame to it.

				kenny (cont'd)
		whoa, what are you doing?

	kenny's question is answered as the bill burns bright red.

				kenny (cont'd)
			(pissed off)
		i knew it.  the guy's name is zing.  he
		works at the kitchen at reign plaza.

				carter
		all right, kenny.  thanks.  you're off
		the hook.  for now.

	carter and lee move for the door.

				kenny
		you sure you guys don't want to stay and
		have a bite?  my wife's got the best mu
		shu this side of compton.

	carter and lee exchange a look as we cut to:
