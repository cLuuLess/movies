	int. las vegas airport - night

	lee is talking with a bandaged isabella, who is standing with
	sterling and several other secret service agents.  lee and
	isabella hug goodbye.  as she walks off to board her plane,
	lee slowly walks back to carter who is smiling.

				carter
		i saw that.  she kissed you, didn't she? 
		you played it cool, though.  walking
		away, never looking back.

				lee
		she's going home to new york.  i need
		some ice.

	lee and carter watch as she gets on the plane.

				carter
		that your gate down there?

				lee
		yes.

				carter
		i'm this way.  i guess this is goodbye.

				lee
		i guess so.  thank you, carter.

				carter
		you take care of yourself, lee.

	carter steps back, bows to lee.  lee shakes carter's hand
	like a brother.  the two men smile.  turn to walk away.

				lee
		carter, wait.  there's something i want
		you to have.

	lee pulls a badge from his pocket.  hands it to carter.

				carter
		your father's badge?  no way, man.  i
		can't take this.

				lee
		it's okay.  i can finally let it go.

	carter takes the badge.  smiles.

				carter
		in that case, i got something for you. 
		i picked it up at the hotel.

	carter pulls out a wad of cash.

				lee
		what is this?

				carter
		about fifty grand.  i won it at the
		tables.

				lee
		no, carter.  i can't take this.

				carter
		it's okay, i got lots more.

	carter pulls out another wad of cash.

				carter (cont'd)
		they owe us, man.  that's the least they
		can do.

				lee
		this money is evidence.

				carter
		come on, lee.  stop being a cop for five
		minutes and live it up.  there must be
		something you want.

	lee looks back toward isabella.

				lee
		i always wanted to go to madison square
		garden.  see the knicks play.

				carter
		new york city?

				lee
		first class.

				carter
		the plaza hotel?

				lee
		a little mu-shu.

				carter
		some kung-pao?

	they look at each other, smile.

				carter (cont'd)
		i could use a little vacation.

				lee
		amen to that, brother.

	as lee and carter start to walk away together, the music
	swells.  "war" starts to play.  they dance their way through
	a crowd of people, their arms raised as the two friends make
	their way through the airport.
