	two security guards lead carter away from the table when:

	crash!

	an airborne lee rockets through the eye in the sky window. 
	in a rain of glass, he lands hard on the casino floor.

	the noise grabs everyone's attention, including:

				carter
		lee!!

	the guards restrain him.

				carter (cont'd)
		lemme ask you something.  any of you
		ever felt $500,000 before?

	he slams the rack of chips across their faces -- chips flying
	as the guards hit the floor.

				carter (cont'd)
		doesn't feel so good, does it?
