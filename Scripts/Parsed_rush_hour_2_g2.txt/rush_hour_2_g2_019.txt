	int. quiet room massage parlor - day

	twenty men in silk robes lie in reclining chairs, women
	massaging their feet and hands.  there are big screen tv's
	showing nature films, relaxation music playing in the
	background. 

	lee and carter sit in the quiet room dressed in matching
	purple robes.  lee wears slippers, carter wears his high
	tops.  carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same
	time.  a woman walks over and hands them each a drink.

				carter
		now i'm on vacation.  i knew you'd come
		through, lee.

	lee doesn't respond.  lee is staring at someone on the far
	side of the room.  a man who radiates a unique blend of
	sophistication and brutality.

				carter (cont'd)
		what's wrong?

				lee
		over there -- that's ricky tan.

				carter
		that's ricky tan?  he's four feet tall. 
		i'll go over with you right now, shake
		him down.

				lee
		this is a very dangerous man.

				carter
		i'm a dangerous man.  you're not gonna
		ruin my massage because of some midget
		in a house coat.

				lee
		i'm calling for back up!

	lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits.

	carter looks at ricky tan -- sitting quietly in his chair
	with his laptop computer on his knees.  carter makes a
	decision, gets up and walks towards him.

				carter
		ricky tan, i've been looking all over
		for you.  get up.

	tan looks up for a moment, a smile.

				ricky tan
		i'm busy at the moment.

				carter
		i said get on your feet!

				ricky tan
		i know you, detective carter, right? 
		you're lee's american friend.  enjoying
		your visit?

				carter
		i'm lee's new muscle, his right arm --
		and don't let the robe fool you.  this
		is the only color they had left.  now
		get up!

	tan laughs, goes back to his laptop.  carter grabs the laptop
	from ricky and throws it across the room - shattering it
	against the wall.  ricky glances at his men who are seated
	around the room waiting to move.

				carter (cont'd)
		i told you to get on your feet!

	having heard the commotion, lee arrives by carter's side,
	breathless, as tan looks up, surprised.

				ricky tan
		lee, i've missed you, brother.
			(getting up, giving lee a hug)
		i heard about the two americans, i'm so
		sorry, you must be under great pressure.

				lee
		you must come with me for questioning.

				carter
		let's go.  i've got girls and chicken
		and hot oil waiting for me.

				ricky tan
		i don't think so...

	a nod of ricky tan's head, and ten large men in robes and
	towels spring out of reclining chairs -- menacingly facing
	lee and carter.  a beat...

				carter
		i'd like to pay you for that laptop.

				ricky tan
		it's no problem.  but i must excuse
		myself, inspector.

				carter
		that's chief inspector, he got promoted.

	tan bows to lee and carter.

				ricky tan
		congratulations.  and good day.

	as tan starts to exit, lee and carter move to intercept him. 
	but they are blocked by tan's men.

	lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off.  the man
	covers his naked body.  lee is grabbed by one of the other
	henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the
	towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms --
	blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all
	the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel,
	his robe, or some other found object.

	carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men
	flying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them.

				carter
			(ref: his privates)
		damn!  no wonder you're pissed off.

	carter uses the towel like lee did to block and trap one of
	the men's punches.

	in the middle of fighting, lee is suddenly exposed -- he
	flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind. 
	momentarily stunned, he's lifted from behind -- two men
	throwing him out the front door.

	carter is also overpowered by two men, who lift him over
	their shoulders.
