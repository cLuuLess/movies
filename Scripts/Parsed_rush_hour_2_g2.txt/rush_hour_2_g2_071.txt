	int. eighteen wheeler - truck bed - day

	lee and carter are in the back with crates filled with money.

	they're both in pain, trying to recover from the head blows. 
	carter is flexing his battered body.

				lee
		are you okay?

				carter
		what's the first thing i told you --
		never trust nobody.  how could you fall
		for that shit?  i knew she was dirty.

				lee
		she saved our lives.

				carter
		for how long?  face it, lee, she's
		playing both sides.

	lee looks disappointed.

				carter (cont'd)
		look, man i'm sorry.  i know you got a
		thing for her.

				lee
		shhh, my head hurts.

				carter
		i'm about to be killed and you "shhh"
		me!  this wasn't my case, lee.  ricky
		tan didn't kill my father, the fu-cang
		long are not in south central.  i didn't
		have to help you.

				lee
		why did you help me?

				carter
		it doesn't matter.

	lee thinks about this for a beat.

				lee
		i'm not used to having a partner.

				carter
		we are not partners.  between your
		daddy, my daddy, and the beating i just
		took, as far as i can tell all partners
		get you is dead.

				lee
		well we're not friends.

				carter
		you got that right.  and we ain't
		brothers.  maybe we should just end this
		right here.

				lee
		fine with me.

				carter
		i won't talk to you, you don't talk to
		me.  we'll die in peace.

				lee
		see you in the next world.

	a beat of silence

				carter
		i don't believe in reincarnation.  so i
		won't see you in the next world.

				lee
		fine. 

				carter
		i believe in heaven.  you people believe
		in heaven?

				lee
		yes.  we have heaven.

				carter
		is it the same heaven, or is it a
		chinese heaven?

				lee
		what's a chinese heaven?

				carter
		i thought it might be like those five
		foot and under basketball leagues.  they
		don't let everybody in.

				lee
		i think we should stop talking.

				carter
		fine by me.

	another beat of silence

				carter (cont'd)
		you thinking about that girl that dumped
		you?

				lee
		no.

				carter
		if she was the right girl, you'd be
		thinking about her.

				lee
		mind your own business.

				carter
		how was the sex?

				lee
		there was no sex.  she was very
		traditional.  we were waiting until we
		were married.

				carter
		you're kidding.  no sex?  nothing?  no
		mu-shu?

				lee
		no mu-shu.

				carter
		what about a little king pao chicken?

				lee
		no kung pao chicken.  never.

				carter
		steamed dumplings?

				lee
		once in a while, steamed dumplings.  but
		only when she was drunk.

				carter
		that's rough, man.  if i don't get
		steamed dumplings once a week, i go
		crazy.

				lee
		tell me the truth, carter.  do you think
		i have a good voice?

				carter
		are you serious?

				lee
		forget it.  it doesn't matter.

	lee turns away from carter.

				carter
		as long as you're asking...i think you
		have a pretty good voice.

				lee
		i knew it.  what does she know.  you
		want me to sing something?

				carter
		that depends.  how do the fu-cang-long
		usually kill their victims?

				lee
		they'll probably torture us first, shock
		our privates, then put two bullets in
		our eyes and one in the back of the
		head.

				carter
		go ahead.  sing your ass off.

	lee clears his voice.

				lee
		did you happen to see the most beautiful
		girl in the world...and if you did, was
		she crying, crying...hey!
