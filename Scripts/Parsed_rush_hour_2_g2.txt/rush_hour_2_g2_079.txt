			ext. red dragon hotel and casino - night

	fire balls blow out over the strip as lee and carter look up
	at the red dragon.  the huge neon sign reads: grand opening -
	everybody's a winner!

	lee and carter come out of the sewer.

				lee
		red dragon.

				carter
		that was the name of ricky tan's boat.

	lee and carter watch as limos pull up to the front of the
	hotel -- it's like a hollywood premiere.  the richest of the
	rich are making their way inside.

				lee
		let's go.

				carter
		wait a second.  we can't go in like
		this.  look at this place, we gotta look
		fly.  we gotta mac out.

				lee
		what is mac out?

				carter
		follow me my asian brother.

	carter and lee start to walk away.

				carter (cont'd)
		just stay down wind, because i think you
		stepped in some serious rat shit down
		there.
