	carter and lee are getting comfortable among all the other
	passengers, preparing to take off.  lee has a moment of
	doubt.

				lee
		i should go back.  ricky tan mentioned a
		boat in hong kong harbor...

				carter
		lee, let me introduce you to the carter
		theory of criminal investigation: follow
		the rich white man.

				lee
		follow the rich white man?

				carter
		almost, but you've got to say "rich
		white man" all run together like it's
		one word.

				lee
		follow the richwhiteman...

				carter
		not bad.  now every crime, somewhere,
		has a rich white man taking his cut. 
		every single one.  now in our case, we
		know the rich white man is steven reign.

				lee
		who?

				carter
		big hotel billionaire.  he was on ricky
		tan's boat ordering hu li around just
		before ricky got smoked.

				lee
		how do you know he's our man?

				carter
		because when the shooting started he was
		way too cool.  see most white people,
		when there's shooting, they either hide
		in a toilet or start screaming high
		pitched like "aaaahhh!!! aaaahh!!!!

				lee
		you sound like that all the time.

				carter
		black people keep their cool when the
		shit goes down.

				lee
		maybe.  but not like asians.  we never
		panic.

				carter
		yeah, what about when godzilla was
		coming?  you people were screaming your
		asses off.

				lee
		just tell me where i can find this
		steven reign.

				carter
		the same place you find all
		richwhitemen.

		gefilte fish.  lox and bagel.  i love
		this stuff.  here, try it with a smear.
