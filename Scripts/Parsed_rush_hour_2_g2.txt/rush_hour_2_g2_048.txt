	ext. dock - night

	the yacht is anchored.  a few triads led away in handcuffs. 
	thrown into patrol cars that have surrounded the docks.

	sterling, chin, lee and carter on the dock.

				special agent sterling
		quite a night, inspector.  ricky tan was
		our only bait, and now he's gone.  you
		finally got your revenge - at the
		expense of a u.s. government
		investigation.

				carter
		what "revenge" is he talking about?

				special agent sterling
		i don't know if the fu-cang-long paid
		you to get rid of tan, or whether it was
		a pure vendetta killing -- but you're
		off this case.  i don't ever want to see
		you again, you got that?

				carter
		hey, you, secret service man, what are
		you --

				special agent sterling
		stay out of it, carter.  you're going
		back to l.a.

				carter
		fine with me.

	sterling walks away disgusted.

				superindendent chin
		i'm sorry lee, but my orders are to
		fully cooperate with the secret service.

	lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment.  chin
	motions for two uniformed hong kong police officers to
	approach.

				superindendent chin (cont'd)
			(to police officers)
		escort detective carter to the airport --

				lee
		i'll take him.

				carter
		hell no.

	the hong kong police officers produce handcuffs.  beat.

				carter (cont'd)
			(to lee)
		fine.  but don't expect me to talk to
		you.

	carter stalks off.

				lee
		don't push me, carter.  i'm in no mood
		for your bullshit.

	carter gets in lee's face.  the two men look like they're
	about to come to blows.

				carter
		what are you gonna do about it,
		grasshopper?

				lee
		i'll bitch slap you into bangkok.

				carter
		give me your best shot, you flat assed
		mama's boy.

				lee
		don't be talking about my mama.  or my
		ass!

				carter
		i heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.

				lee
		no.  she's a school teacher.

				carter
		you're not very good at this, are you?

				lee
		good at what?   

				carter
		forget it.

	a long beat while lee considers what to say.

				lee
		five years ago, my father was chief
		inspector working a big international
		smuggling case.

				carter
		ask me if i give a shit.

	lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell.

				lee
		ricky tan killed my father.

	carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to lee.

				lee (cont'd)
		he found out his partner, tan, had been
		working for the triads all along.
			(beat)
		before my father could prove it, he was
		killed in the line of duty.

				carter
		how the hell did tan get away with it?

				lee
		all the evidence against him
		disappeared, the smuggling case was
		unsolved.  tan resigned and went over to
		the triads openly.

				carter
			(pause)
		this is about your daddy's death?  hell,
		lee, you know my father died on the job. 
		you could have told me...
			(realizing)
		this is about more than all that, isn't
		it?  this is about your daddy's last
		case, right?

	lee's caught, fibs badly.

				lee
		no, no, that would be crazy --

				carter
		you thought the "customs agents get
		blown up" and "smuggling" and "ricky
		tan" and you put it all together and
		came up with a five year old case. 
		that's why you didn't tell me what we
		were doing...

				lee
		i thought you'd think it was crazy.

				carter
		it is crazy!

				lee
		i know.  i know.  i am sorry.

	lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his
	car.  carter watches him.  finally he rolls his eyes and
	yells.

				carter
		so are you getting on the plane or not?!

				lee
		what?

				carter
		come on, we still got time to order the
		kosher meal.  always get the kosher
		meal, they bring it first.

				lee
		i cannot go to la...

	carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the
	cop beneath the attitude.

				carter
		it sounds impossible --

				lee
		you said --

				carter
		-- but if somebody gave me the chance to
		square up my father's death, i'd go to
		hell to do it.

	carter turns, walks away without looking back.

				carter (cont'd)
		you want to figure out why they killed
		your daddy, get on the plane.

				lee
		why la?

				carter
			(still not turning)
		i guess you're going to have to trust me
		on this one.
