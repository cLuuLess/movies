	lee is walking toward ricky tan, the two men circling reign's
	body.

				ricky tan
		you're just like your father, lee.  all
		these years hiding behind his badge.  i
		wanted to help him, to share with him,
		but he was too afraid of change.  when
		you think about it, i didn't really kill
		him.  i just put him out of his misery.

				lee
		put the plates down.  it's over.

				ricky tan
		i don't think it's over.  there are
		casinos all over this country.  let me
		make you a rich man, lee.  don't make
		the same mistake he did.

	ricky glances at the gun in reign's belt.

				lee
		if you reach for that gun, i'm going to
		kill you.

				ricky tan
		don't you remember?  i'm already dead.

	ricky makes a play for the gun, but lee is much too fast,
	taking the gun and pushing ricky against the wall just as
	carter bursts in the room.

				carter
		hey, ricky, how's it going man?  what's
		up, lee?

	lee has the gun pressed to tan's head.  we've never seen him
	like this before.

				ricky tan
		would you like me to tell you how your
		father died?

				carter
		lee, you okay?

	lee doesn't respond.  he keeps an eye on ricky.

				ricky tan
		he never begged for his life.  or tried
		to make a deal.  all that he asked me,
		just seconds before i pulled the
		trigger, was that i promise not to kill
		you.

	lee's finger is on the trigger -- he wants to pull the
	trigger but can't.

				carter
		lee, wait a second.  it's not worth it,
		man.  he's making you do this.

				lee
		it's worth it to me.

				ricky tan
		do you have it in you, lee?  or are you
		gonna spend the rest of your life hiding
		like your father?

				carter
		c'mon, lee.  he's going to jail.  you
		won, now just put the gun down.

	lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.

				ricky tan
		that's what i thought.

	tan takes the black bag and swings it toward lee -- the
	plates hit him across the face and knock him down.

	the gun is loose

	tan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when:

	lee and carter come flying at him together.  both kicking him
	square in the chest.

	tan falls back, smashing through the window.  lee tries to
	grab tan's hand, their fingers touch for a split second.

	but tan pulls his hand away and falls 20 stories to the
	street below.
