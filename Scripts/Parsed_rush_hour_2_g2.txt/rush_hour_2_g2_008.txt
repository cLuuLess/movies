	int. raven club - continuous

	a room full of chinese sitting with their mouths open,
	watching carter on the karaoke stage doing a dead-on michael
	jackson, singing his heart out.  dancing and making eyes at a
	few of the smitten women who are watching him.

				lee
			(whispering from side of stage)
		carter, get off that stage!

				carter
		are you kidding, they love me.  i'm a
		star, lee.  a god to these people!

	carter resumes singing, really getting down.  moonwalking to
	the edge of the state where lee pulls him off.

				lee
		this is a gangster bar, we're here
		undercover.

				carter
		i knew you were lying.

				lee
		i'm sorry.

				carter
		damn it, why are you ruining my night? 
		i'm just starting to have fun.
			(beat)
		well fine then, go ahead, pull your
		badge and do your thing.

				lee
		no, we're here for information, to find
		out where a man named ricky tan is.  we
		must tread softly and keep our ears
		open.

				carter
		tread softly?  who taught you how to
		roost a bar?

				lee
		carter, you don't understand.  these men
		are fu-cang-long triads.  part of the
		most deadly gang in china.

				carter
		man, are you crazy?  you think that
		scares me?  i'm from  l.a.  we invented
		gangs.  we were having gang wars before
		anybody even thought about it.  we get
		royalties from other gangs.  now gimme
		your badge and gun and i'll show you how
		it's done.

				lee
		no.  you are a civilian.  in china, i am
		michael jackson, and you are toto.

				carter
		you mean tito.  we had  toto for dinner
		last night.

	before lee can react, carter has lifted lee's badge and gun. 
	carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and
	fires three shots into the ceiling, silencing the bar.

				carter (cont'd)
			(chinese)
		deng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang
		lui.

	nobody moves.  strange looks from the crowd.  carter turns to
	lee.

				carter (cont'd)
			(whispering)
		what'd i say?

				lee
		you just said you're their worst
		nightmare - and to line their mothers up
		for a milking.

				carter
		shit.  c'mon, get up here and help me
		out.

	reluctantly, lee gets on stage.  more looks from the chinese
	as carter speaks, lee translating.

				carter (cont'd)
		okay, all the triads and ugly women go
		to that side, all fine ass women on this
		side.

	nobody moves.  carter fires two more shots in the ceiling.

				carter (cont'd)
		let's try this again.  who here knows
		ricky tan, raise your hand.

	nobody moves.

				carter (cont'd)
		who here is named lee?  raise your hand.

	nobody moves.

				carter (cont'd)
		now i know you're lying.  

	the crowd still hasn't moved.  except in the back, where lee
	spots several gangsters leaving.  as lee runs off stage --

				carter (cont'd)
			(as they run out)
		i come back and catch y'all singing
		michael jackson and you're all going to
		jail.
