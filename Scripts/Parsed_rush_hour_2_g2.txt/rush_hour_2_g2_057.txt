	ext. reign towers hotel - roof - night

	lee and carter burst through the roof door - carter trying to
	hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible. 
	he looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets
	are filled with people and cars.

				lee
		wait!  there's people down there!

				carter
		there's people up here!

				lee
		get it out of here!

				carter
		take it!

	lee takes the bomb, quickly rolls it across the roof -- lee
	and carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides
	to the center of the roof - coming to a stop right in front
	of isabella.  she's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed
	off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package.

				isabella
		get on your feet.

	lee and carter stand and face isabella - watch as isabella
	begins to open the package.

				carter
		i wouldn't do that!!!

				lee
		it's a bomb.

	isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a hundred
	dollar bills.

				isabella
		you see, no bomb.  now stay away before
		i throw you both in jail for
		obstruction.

				carter
		throw us in jail?  i'm about to bust you
		right now.

				isabella
		i'm an undercover agent for the united
		states secret service.

				carter
		how do we know you're not lying?  let me
		see your badge.

	isabella opens her bathrobe -- we see a small badge pinned to
	her bra.

				carter (cont'd)
		let me see it again?

				lee
		we can help you.  i'm a detective in
		hong kong.

				isabella
		i know who you are, inspector lee.

				lee
		then you know i'm not walking away from
		this case.

				carter
		yeah, that's right.

				isabella
		we need to get out of sight.  come down
		to my suite.
