	ext. yacht - harbor - night

	a 190-foot yacht is anchored in victoria harbor.  ricky tan
	walks along the top deck with hu li, disappearing into a
	crowd of people who are partying on the ship.

	carter steps out of the cab.

				carter
		stay here.  i'll be right back.  you
		understand?

				cab driver
		yes.  i understand.

	carter steps out of the cab, which immediately drives off,
	leaving him alone on the docks.

	carter looks around the dock -- a pull up valet station
	parking fancy cars, rich people getting on the boat as their
	names are checked off a list by two doormen.
