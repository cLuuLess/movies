            int. pearl's parlor - continuous

            we float around the members of pearl's circle.  see objects
            on the table flickering in the candlelight.

                                pearl
                      the spirit world is all around us right
                      this minute.  and the departed are
                      pressing in around us.

            still singing, they all glance about them in darkness as if
            they can make out the spirits around them.

            over the low bass of their hymn-singing, her voice cuts in. 
            uncoiling and rising like smoke in the air: it's a beautiful
            voice and it does seem to open a window in the air.
