            cinnabar is crying, pearl holding her.

                                pearl
                      it's alright, baby.

                      who was he, momma?  he tried to kill us.

                                pearl
                      if he was trying to kill you, you'd be
                      dead.

                                cinnabar
                      who?  who is he?  what is he?

                                pearl
                      your father.  he was your father.
