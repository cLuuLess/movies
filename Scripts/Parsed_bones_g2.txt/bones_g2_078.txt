            int. bones' pad - night

            patrick and cinnabar sipping a little remy in his room. 
            alone at last.  awkward.  intimate.  he refills her glass.

                                cinnabar
                      she doesn't want me here.  with you.  in
                      this house.

                                patrick
                      believe me, my old man'd rupture his
                      spleen if he knew we was down here.  all
                      he talks about is the medal he deserves
                      for building us a life as far from this
                      'hood as possible.

                                cinnabar
                      he probably thinks he's saving you from
                      something.  i'm sure that's what my
                      mother thinks.

                                patrick
                      i'm sure i can make your mother like me. 
                      but then do i gotta worry 'bout your
                      father?

            suddenly their banter is dead.  her face looks stung, like
            he'd slapped her.

                                cinnabar
                      i don't know anything about my father.  i
                      never met him.  momma won't talk about
                      him, either.

            he puts his arms around her, and she melts into him.
