            int. first floor - continuous

            bill looks skeptical, maurice outraged.  patrick firm.

                                bill
                      you want us to move in here?

                                patrick
                      that's the only way we'll get the place
                      fixed up in time.

                                maurice
                      yeah right, and which ever of us is still
                      alive at the end of the week inherits all
                      vincent price's cash.

                                patrick
                      look, you guys want to play college
                      radio, high school reunions, and some
                      fool's club once a week for the rest of
                      your lives, that's cool.  but i think we
                      can do better.

                                bill
                      you soundin' like the old man now.

                                patrick
                      i believe in you guys.  you are the real
                      shit.  and you know it.  now i'm putting
                      everything i got into this cuz i think we
                      can make it happen, but you gotta put a
                      little in too.  now all i"m asking is
                      that everybody do their part.  we'll move
                      some shit in, and take shifts, or all
                      crash together here --

                                bill
                      pat's right.  it'll be fun.

                                maurice
                      yeah, fine.  but mars needs women.  if i
                      gotta sleep in a spookhouse, surround me
                      with chicks who are more scared than me. 
                      speaking of which...

            tia's coming down the stairs.  maurice watching her legs
            appreciatively as she descends.

                                bill
                          (rips maurice's skull)
                      tia ain't a chick.  she's family.  and
                      don't forget it.

                                patrick
                      let's get going.  go home, pick up what
                      we need, then crash here.

                                tia
                      look who i found.

            she comes in with the dog padding silently behind her.

                                maurice
                      damn, that's the nastiest dog i ever
                      seen.  nothin' but skin and bones.

                                tia
                      yeah, call his skinny ass "bones."

            "bones" grins, all teeth with its tongue hanging out.  they
            walk out the front door, the dog slipping out with them.
