            ext. blackstone - day

            patrick pulls up to the abandoned lot next to bones'
            building.  in broad daylight the building looks even
            stranger.  the lines don't matchup.  weeds and broken glass,
            rusted autoparts, and empty abandoned shopping carts in
            tangled heaps like ruins in the lot beside the building.

                                bill
                      looks like a damn graveyard round here.

                                patrick
                      i'm telling you, this neighborhood is
                      coming back.

                                maurice
                      yeah.  but just where the hell has it
                      been?

            they step up to the front of the building.

                                bill
                      damn.  that is the ugliest building i
                      have ever seen.

                                patrick
                      naw.  i think it's... i dunno.  something
                      about it just buzzes me.

                                maurice
                      that would be the after effects of that
                      reticular inseminoid encounter you had.

            patrick opens the door and steps inside.

                                patrick
                      welcome to the ill zone.
