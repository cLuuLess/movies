            int. peet house - continuous

            patrick runs in with cinnabar and pearl, past a startled
            nancy.

                                patrick
                      where's dad?

                                nancy
                      his study.  who're your friends?

            but they run right past.  though pearl gives a kind of half
            wave 'hi-hello.'

            patrick runs down the hall to his father's study.  the door's
            locked.  from the inside, he pounds on it.

                                patrick
                      dad?  open up.  dad??

            bill and tia stick their heads out to see what all the racket
            is.

                                patrick (cont'd)
                      c'mon.  we got to get in there.

            bill and patrick slam against the door.  finally it gives way
            and they both tumble through the broken door into the room.
