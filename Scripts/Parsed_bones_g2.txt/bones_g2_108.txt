            int. hallway - continuous

            patrick opens the remaining bedroom door on a nightmare
            tableaux.  maurice lies in a pool of blood.  his body shakes
            and shudders spasmodically as the dog feasts on his liver.

            patrick starts for maurice but the dog growls to keep him
            back away from its precious food.  patrick backs up a step. 
            almost out of his mind with terror.  he really loses it when
            the dog, in slo-mo, looks up and directly at him.  it seems
            to be wearing maurice's face and speaks with a twisted
            version of his (maurice's) voice:

                                dog/maurice
                      the gangsta of love don't eat no fried
                      chicken...

            and before patrick can even freak, the dog has returned to
            it's normal dog face, and it lunges at patrick, taking a
            sizeable bite out of his arm.

            patrick leaps back out the door, with only a fast glance back
            at the thing in the room --

            the dog is not following him.  it's standing.  over maurice's
            remains.  growling low, it begins to shudder uncontrollably
            to bulge and ooze.

            the gore covered dog quivers and swells and bulges and
            finally explodes into a shower of pulsating maggots, flying
            all over the room and all over patrick's eyes and in his
            mouth.
