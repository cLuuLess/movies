            int. pearl's storefront - night

            cinnabar pours some bourbon into a coke for her mother.  but
            pearl just grabs the bottle and takes a straight hit.

                                pearl
                      he'll kill them.  he'll kill every last
                      one of them.

                                cinnabar
                      who?

                                pearl
                      eddie mack, that cop.  and jeremiah.  and
                      even when he's done, who knows.  he won't
                      be satisfied.  just like that demon dog. 
                      feed it, and it just grows hungrier. 
                      feed his hunger for revenge - he just
                      wants more.  who knows where it'll stop. 
                      that kind of hunger ain't never
                      satisfied. 

                                cinnabar
                      aren't you gonna do something about it?

                                pearl
                      like what?  i got a little power, sure. 
                      a touch of the shining, a little of the
                      sight.  but no more than you do.  we're
                      not witches.  i can't wiggle my nose or
                      say a magic word and make him go away. 
                      besides, maybe they deserve it.  maybe we
                      all do.

                                cinnabar
                      i don't.  patrick doesn't.  and his
                      brother and sister don't.  and they're in
                      the house with him.

                                pearl
                          (long beat)
                      fine.  maybe i got nothing to lose. 
                      'cept you.
