            the three still climbing handhold by handhold, knocking loose
            dirt in each others' eyes.  bill is just now reaching the
            first floor level, trying to force open the outer doors.

            suddenly, an ominous sound: the chain/mechanism of the
            elevator as they see it starting to descend towards them. 
            panicking, bill tries with all his might.

            as the elevator inches closer and closer --

            until bill finally manages to get the doors open.  they all
            scramble to safety just as the elevator slides by them.

            new angle

            after they catch their breath, they look up and around to
            find themselves --
