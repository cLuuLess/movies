            cinnabar struggles with something in the bed, the covers
            pulled tight against her face, she can't scream.  she twists
            and wrenches herself about, finally striking behind her with
            a flailing fist, twists her face free and screams:

                                cinnabar
                      patrick!  stop!!

            across the room the door suddenly opens -- it's patrick.

                                patrick
                      what's wrong?

            angle - at patrick's feet

            the black silhouette of the dog slips out the door.

                                patrick (cont'd)
                      are you alright?

            cinnabar looks wildly around the room -- she's alone in the
            big bed.  no one attacking her.  and she sees patrick in the
            doorway.  but then who - or what - was in the bed?

            suddenly, her mother yells from below.

                                pearl (o.s.)
                      cinnabar!!!

            cinnabar lurches out of the bed over to the window.  down
            below, her mother's going nuts at the entrance, pounding on
            the door and practically running over bill who's opening the
            door.

                                pearl (cont'd)
                      outta my way, boy.  cinnabar?  i'm
                      coming!

                                bill
                      why don't you hang on and i'll see if
                      she's here.

                                pearl
                      i know damn well she's there.
