            int. building - day

            ladders, drop-cloths and the beginnings of new paint on the
            old torn walls.  they're all eating take out burgers.

                                patrick
                      i thought you were bringing the colonel?

                      the gangster of love don't eat no fried
                      chicken.

                                patrick
                      why not?  he eats everything else.

                                maurice
                      just what army do you think the colonel
                      was in?
                          (whistles dixie)
                      everybody knows the whole chicken
                      distribution network is owned by the
                      klan.  "special recipe".  i'm telling
                      you.  there's something in the batter. 
                      say it makes a black man sterile.

                                bill and tia
                      bull.  shit.

                                maurice
                      word.  i saw it on sixty minutes.

                                patrick
                      maurice, even if it was true, what are
                      you worried about?  last time i checked,
                      you weren't black.  i'm not sure what the
                      hell you are.  but i know you aren't a
                      black man.

                                maurice
                      i am the future.  i am all colors.  all
                      races.  all creeds.  i am the melting
                      pot.  i am the tossed salad.  i am post
                      racial.

                                patrick
                      post-toasted's more like it.
