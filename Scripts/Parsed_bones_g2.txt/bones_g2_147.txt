            int. bones' building/necropolis version - eternal night

            it is bones' old bedroom.  the necropolois version.  the
            floor, the walls, the furniture, everything in it -- formed
            out of the wracked and twisted shapes of dead souls.

            this is that same version of the room we've glimpsed before. 
            and it remains, even when the real room has burnt away.
