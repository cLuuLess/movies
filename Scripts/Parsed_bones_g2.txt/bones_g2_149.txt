            ext. lake shore drive - night

            pearl, cinnabar, bill and patrick speed south by car.

                                pearl
                      ... see there ain't just two parts to a
                      person.  there's three.  body-soul and
                      spirit.  the spirit lives in the blood. 
                      it's the wanting that holds body and soul
                      together, and sometimes, the wanting
                      lives on.  jimmy's blood must still be in
                      the house.

                                patrick
                      but the place burned to the ground.

                                pearl
                      the blood is still there.  we just gotta
                      figure out where.

                                cinnabar
                      in his grave there was a cloth or a dress
                      or something.  covered with blood.

                                pearl
                      my god.  my dress.  we have to find it. 
                      and burn it.  and shut the door.

            bill and patrick look at pearl like she might be crazy.  then
            they see cinnabar next to her, glaring back at them.
