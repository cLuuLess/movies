            int. bones' building - continuous

            cinnabar races down the stairs with patrick, bewildered at
            her heels.

            cinnabar runs out the door and straight into her mother's
            arms, burying her face in the protective bosom of her mom.

            pearl wraps her frightened daughter in her arms and turns her
            to home.  pearl looks up at the boys standing stunned in the
            doorway.

                                pearl
                      you might as well just dig down six feet
                      of muddy earth and sleep in your own
                      grave than stay another night in that
                      house.

            she turns back towards her place, still holding the sobbing
            cinnabar.  bill and patrick stand stunned in the doorway.

                                bill
                      you sure got a way with women, bro.  what
                      happened up there?

                                patrick
                      damned if i know.
