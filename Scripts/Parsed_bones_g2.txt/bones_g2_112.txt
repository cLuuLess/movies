            int. basement - continuous

            at the top of the stairs, leading up out of the sub basement,
            bones smashes the bulb of the hanging light.  then flips the
            light switch -- the spark ignites the gas behind him.  it
            causes a fiery explosion in the lower basement.

            the fire's light seems the very glow of hellfire behind bones
            as he marches up the stairs, razor in his hand.
