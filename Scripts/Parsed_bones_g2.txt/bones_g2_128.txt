            int. black cat pool club - night

            the lights are low and only the glow of the jukebox and the
            sounds of harold melvin and the bluenotes as mack and his
            manicurist get down on the pooltable, beside an ornate mirror
            laden with two gold '45s and an ounce of cocaine.  which they
            are both doing to excess.

            mack's wearing nothing but a black hat and black satin briefs
            (not a pretty sight).  working now on her blouse.

                                mack
                      bones, my ass.
                          (sings while unbuttoning the
                           manicurist's blouse)
                      "...if you don't believe he's laid to
                      rest/you count the holes in his
                      motherfucking chest..."

            she laughs and gets up.

                                coke whore
                      that tickles.  i want to hear that again.

            he watches her sashay to the other room where the juke box
            is.  then bends over the mirror to do a new line.

            from the other room, the song changes.  a deep menacing
            rolling funk number.

                                mack
                      that's it, baby.  gimme the rolling bass
                      and i'll tickle your tweeter all night
                      long...
