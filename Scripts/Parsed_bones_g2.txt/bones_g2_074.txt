            int. storm cellar stairs - continuous

            as they go, the temperature drops.  a cold, damp sheen
            appears on their skin.  then comes a thick glutinous buzzing
            sound.

                                tia
                      what is that?

            flies.  the stairway walls are thick with furry black flies.

                                maurice
                          (stopping)
                      ugh.  muchos moscos, man.  this is too
                      much.

                                bill
                      just some flies.

                                maurice
                      some flies?  i think this qualifies as
                      way more than "some."

                                cinnabar
                      what a smell. 

                                maurice
                      hey, what you expect?  where there's
                      smoke there's fire.  and where there's
                      flies, there's shit.

            the stairs end in a dark, damp dirt cellar and the remnants
            of the terminus of the old elevator shaft.

                                maurice (cont'd)
                      oh yeah, i guess this would be that space
                      that was so perfect for a recording
                      studio.

                                bill
                      maurice, man, shut the fuck up.

                                patrick
                      yeah, well, maurice is right.  it's gonna
                      take more work than i thought.  but we
                      can still do it.  we'll lay a real floor
                      in here.  put damping on the walls. 
                      totally controlled sound.  be perfect. 
                      no one could hear shit up on the street.

            behind them the dog is digging in the dirt.  furiously.

                                maurice
                      yeah, perfect.  really excellent.  we can
                      make our first record where no one can
                      hear us scream.  be afraid.

            they're not paying any attention to the dog's incessant
            digging.  only cinnabar is.  she's staring at it.

                                cinnabar
                      oh god...

            and she sees, in the deepening muddy hole at the dog's paws,
            at first glimpses and then the full view, a rotted human
            corpse.  really just a skeleton.  with something sticking out
            of its chest.  cinnabar shrieks, while the guys try very hard
            to act real cool.

                                bill
                      hello.  who're you?

            maurice bends and pulls out the now blood rusted razor.

                                maurice
                      boys and girls, moms and dads.  children
                      of all ages, i'd like you to meet...
                      jimmy bones.

                                bill
                      what the hell you talking about?

                                maurice
                          (singing)
                      "this is the story of jimmy bones/black
                      as night and hard as stones/gold plated
                      deuce, like the king of siam/got his
                      switchblade loose, and a diamond on his
                      hand..." there's the switchblade and
                      there's the diamond.  don't know where
                      the deuce is parked.

            he points to one of the bony hands.  the left one.  on the
            third finger is jimmy's big diamond ring.

                                bill
                      you think that's really him?

                                maurice
                      damn.  it's so...fresh.

            and he's right.  oddly for an old skeleton, there are strands
            and bands of wet, raw flesh.  maurice lifts the hand wearing
            the ring.  he starts top pull it loose from the finger.

                                tia
                      boy, put that thing down.  you can't take
                      that.  might be evidence.

                                patrick
                      evidence of what?

                                tia
                      somehow i don't think he stabbed himself
                      in the chest, then buried himself too.

            cinnabar sees something.  bright color beneath the body. 
            bends down to a piece of cloth poking out from beneath the
            bones.

            the dog growls viciously as she reaches down to the scrap of
            color poking up.  tia restrains the hound the best she can.

                                patrick
                      get your damn dog, girl!

            the cloth is the corner of a dress...the dog suddenly lunges
            for cinnabar's hands, ripping at them.  she pulls back.

                                patrick (cont'd)
                      shit!  damn dog.  we gonna have to do
                      something about you.

                                tia
                      what we have to do is call the police.

                                maurice
                      right.  call the police.  we'll have no
                      problem getting our permits then.

                                tia
                      we can't just leave it here.

                                patrick
                      yeah, we can.  least till after this
                      weekend.  he ain't going nowhere.  we'll
                      deal with it then.

                                bill
                      whatever, let's just get the hellout of
                      here.

            they all start to leave except maurice and cinnabar.  he's
            loitering by the body, eyeing the ring.  she's staring into
            the dark corner of the sub-basement.

            her pov in the dim light

            she sees something wavering, a shadow-mirage, bones.

                                patrick (o.s.)
                      cinn?

                                cinnabar
                      what?  oh yeah.  coming.

            she follows the others upstairs.  bones watches her form as
            she climbs the steps, and --

            -- for a second from bones pov we see her mother, when she
            was young.

            bones looks now at maurice.  who checks to see if the others
            are gone.  then maurice hurriedly bends down, and while
            holding his face back away from the stench attempts to pull
            bones' ring off his finger.  but it's stuck.

            he tugs again, harder, and rips the corpse's finger off.

                                maurice
                      oh fuck.

            oh fuck is right.  bones' shadow rears as it sees this
            desecration.  maurice slips the ring off the finger stump.

                                maurice (cont'd)
                          (to the corpse)
                      sorry, but you wont' be needing this.

            he places the finger back by the hand.  and pockets the ring.

                                maurice (cont'd)
                      or this.
