            int. basement - continuous

            the body is now done.  it looks whole again.  even strong and
            young.  if still gray and cold until bones lies down, curls
            up into the body filling the rejuvenated corpse with the
            vital life force of his vengeful rage.

            bones/the body opens his eyes, stands up not tottering as
            before but filled with strength.  he looks as good as new,
            except for the tattered clothes.

            on the dance floor - continuous

            the dancers can't hear patrick screaming or running down the
            stairs.  they're just groovin' along to ill bill and the
            funk.

            until the maggots start oozing and pouring through the
            ceiling onto their hair and faces and clothes, into their
            drinks at the bar and onto their pizza slices.

            then patrick comes into the room screaming and all hell
            breaks loose as the sight of him, plus the maggots, sends
            everyone tearing for the exits.

            seeing his brother in terror, bill slams the tone arm
            screeching the needle across the record, leaving only the
            psycho drum and bass playing on the other channels of the
            mix.
