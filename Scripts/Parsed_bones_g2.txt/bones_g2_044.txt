            int. hallway - continuous

            patrick and bill still talking in front of the bedroom, down
            the hall from the bathroom.

                                patrick
                      ...we just been in the damn suburbs too
                      long.

            their conversation interrupted by screams from down the
            hall... from the bathroom!
