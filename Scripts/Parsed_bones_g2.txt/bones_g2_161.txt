            int. the sub-basement - continuous

            patrick, bill and cinnabar have managed now to pry open the
            elevators outer doors.  they step inside on the soft ashen
            ground and look up:

            their pov

            the shaft goes all the way into eternity.  but along the
            tacked walls, they see hand and footholds put there for
            workers.

                                patrick
                      we can climb out.

                                bill
                      climb out to where?

                                patrick
                      anywhere but here.

            one by one they start to climb, bill first.  as they climb,
            they become aware of light on the first floor level just
            ahead.

            back in bones' crib

            pearl steps into the frame to look at herself in a floor
            length mirror on bones' closest door.

            pearl's pov - in the mirror

            not only the dress, but she too looks exactly as she was 22
            years ago, skin smooth as cocoa butter, eyes free from worry
            and pain.  

            roberta flack's "killing me softly" as jimmy takes her in his
            arms and starts to slow dance her in the midst of all those
            candles.

                                pearl
                      where are we, baby?

                                bones
                      where we'll always be...

                                pearl
                      but.

                                bones
                      hush, baby.

            pulls her closer, closer, until her last misgivings are gone. 
            whatever purpose she came with lost in the power of having
            the impossible.
