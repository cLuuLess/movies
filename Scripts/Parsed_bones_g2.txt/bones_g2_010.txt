            int. jimmy bones' old pad - continuous

            the rotted remains of what was once jimmy bones' master
            bedroom.  the room he was betrayed and slaughtered in.

            downstairs

            the cop begins to head up the stairs.  visible behind him,
            down through the open front door, is the plain wrap car.  the
            older cop inside, mouth fulla sammich, loudly says:

                                fat older cop
                      forget it!  no way they're in there. 
                      trust me.  i've been working down here
                      twenty years.  no one goes in there.

            from the fat older cop's pov

            we watch as the younger cop returns to the car, giving up. 
            and when he climbs in, we reverse and reveal who the older
            cop is: lupovich, the cop who helped kill bones.

            but he's decayed and expanded into a hank quinlan-like
            mountain of corrupt cop flesh.  too many pork chop
            sandwiches.

                                lupovich
                      let's get the hell outta here.
