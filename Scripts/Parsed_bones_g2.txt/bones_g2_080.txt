            int. bones' building - night - upstairs

            in bones' old room, the temperature between cinn and patrick
            goes from pg to r.

            the two kiss passionately, deeply -- cinnabar loses herself
            for a long beat -- then as if swimming up from the bottom of
            a deep pool, she pulls herself back.

                                cinnabar
                      i can't.  not yet.

                                patrick
                      it's alright.  if you want to go home...

                                cinnabar
                      no, i want to stay with you guys.  but i
                      can't.  i mean i'm not ready.

                                patrick
                      don't worry about it.  i'll stay with the
                      boys.
