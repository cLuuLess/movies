            int. pearl's parlor - continuous

            suddenly, the curtains fly open.  and pearl's voice suddenly
            stops... and the flame on the candle shoots up, scorching the
            ceiling before returning to normal.

                                pearl
                      someone's with us.  who's joined the
                      circle?

                                old man
                      lordy...what's that smell?

                                old woman
                      look.  the flowers.

            the flowers whither.  they retch from some smell.

                                pearl
                      knock once for yes.  and twice for no. 
                      is there someone who wishes to send a
                      message?

            table rocks once.

                                pearl (cont'd)
                      a message for one of us in the circle?

            table rocks once.

                                pearl (cont'd)
                      is it for miss lillian?

            table rocks twice -- "no."

                                pearl (cont'd)
                      is it a message for mr. abernathy?

            table rocks twice -- "no" again.  she goes around the room,
            inquiring for each of them.  each time the table says "no." 
            until there is only her left.  an eerie pause.

                                pearl (cont'd)
                      is the message for me?

            the table starts bucking wildly.  and suddenly pearl's neck
            snaps back like it's been caught in a whip.

            her mouth opens and a low moan escapes.  but sounds nothing
            like her voice.  a deep wind through an organ tube with
            swarming bees and squealing hogs mixed in.

            everyone around the table just stares at her in alarm.

            as her eyes widen.  go super close on her eyes and we see a
            reflection in her pupil, not of the room she is in, but the
            jimmy's building twenty years ago.
