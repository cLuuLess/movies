            maurice slips into the darkness of the room and closes the
            door behind him.

                                maurice
                      hey, baby.  time for a little meat beat
                      manifesto.

            in the darkness he can't see where she is.  just hear a deep
            breathing, almost panting.

                                maurice (cont'd)
                      ahhh, tantric breathing.  i'm in love.

            he can't see her.  or anything in the dark room.  finally his
            eyes adapt to the dark and he sees a dark shape by the bed.

                                maurice (cont'd)
                      that's it, honey.  don't need to speak. 
                      jesuis le gangsta de l'amour.  el gaucho
                      della cosmos.  we will speak zee
                      international language of love...

            he pulls out a lighter to light his joint (and see where she
            is) but when he does it's not her beautiful dark features he
            sees, but:

            for the blink of an eye, it's totally blank face, except for
            a huge mouth with liver lips, pink gums and wolfen teeth. 
            when it exhales, out comes a noxious cloud of tiny insects. 
            and then in the blink it's the raging black dog leaping open
            jawed at his face.

            maurice screams and drops his light in fright.  he starts
            crawling towards the door and the overhead light switch. 
            while trying to fend himself from the wailing teeth and claws
            of the canine creature...
