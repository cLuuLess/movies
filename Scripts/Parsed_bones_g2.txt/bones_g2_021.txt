            int. the building - continuous

            the darkness broken only by sunlight streaming through grimy
            windows reveals the decaying interior of the building.

            we can see now nothing's been moved since the late '70's. 
            old furniture, carpets, pictures - late '70's gothic.

                                tia
                      damn it's cold in here!

                                bill
                      it's eighty degrees outside.  and it's
                      gotta be barely fifty in here.

                                maurice
                      and damp, too.  let's not forget damp.

                                patrick
                      whattaya think?  can you picture it? 
                      over there the bar, and in here -- the
                      dance floor.

                                bill
                      possible...maybe...could be.

            patrick leads them to the stairwell going up and down around
            the old elevator cage/shaft.

                                patrick
                      i got a great deal on it.  they couldn't
                      give this place away.  just dead meat
                      stanking up their books for twenty years.

            they come to the elevator shaft, no elevator in sight.

                                patrick (cont'd)
                      the last owner on the lease before the
                      bank was back in '79.  some dude named
                      jimmy bones.  empty ever since.

            maurice looks down the elevator shaft and gets immediately
            dizzy, almost plunging to his doom - pulled back by bill.

                                maurice
                      jimmy bones?

                                patrick
                      yeah, you heard of him?

                                maurice
                      you haven't?

                                patrick
                      not that i remember.

                                maurice
                      he was a local legend back in the '70's. 
                      there was a song, stagolee kinda deal:
                      "this is the ballad of jimmy bones/black
                      as night and hard as stone..."

                                patrick
                      i was born near here.  my dad's from
                      here.  he never mentioned it.

                                bill
                      bones!  how baddass is zat?  this is the
                      place for us.  patrick, you get platinum
                      props, man.  platinum.

                                maurice
                      yeah, in the land of the blind the one
                      eye'd are king.

                                bill
                      what's your problem with crippled dick?

                                maurice
                      look around, this place is a dump!  naw,
                      it'd have to work to be a dump.

                                patrick
                      you gotta use your imagination.

                                maurice
                      "this is patrick..." 
                          (makes the sound of egg
                           cracking, the sizzling as it
                           lands in the skillet)
                      "...and this is patrick on crack." 
                      imagination, my butt.  even the space
                      cowboy can't...

                                patrick
                          (interrupting)
                      why don't y'all check out the rest?  i'm
                      going downstairs and see if i can get the
                      furnace fired up.  warm this place up,
                      you'll see.  it has serious potential.

                                maurice
                      potential toxic dump site.
