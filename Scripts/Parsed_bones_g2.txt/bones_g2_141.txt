            ext. main gate - continuous

            a car drives up to the gate.  but no guard comes out to check
            it out.  the driver of the car honks.  but no response.

            just the aimless squawk of the radio in the booth.  can't
            really see into the tooth.  the windows are splattered and
            obscured by deep red stains.
