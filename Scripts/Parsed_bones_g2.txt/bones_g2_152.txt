            ext. bones neighborhood - night

            suddenly, as they round a corner onto blackstone, they see
            tendrils of an eerie greenish fog.  it seems to be emanating
            from the still smoking remains of bones' house.  or perhaps
            it is just the smoke, tinged only by the gaseous street
            lights.

                                pearl
                      we've got to hurry.  we've got to shut
                      the door.  they're getting out.

            then there's a shape and a thump!  the real terror of
            thinking your car just hit a human being.

            then a face appears in the car window.  just a homeless guy
            shaking an angry fist at them.  quickly, he's gone in the
            fog.

            straining to see, patrick stops, grabbing a flashlight from
            his glove box.  they all get out.  making their way through
            the fog, glimpsing in darkened doorways, eerie shapes,
            perhaps more of the dead out of necropolis.
