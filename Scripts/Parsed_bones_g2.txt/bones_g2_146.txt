            int. peet house - continuous

            they're in shock. 

                                bill
                      we can't go back there.  are you crazy? 
                      you saw --

                                pearl
                      it's the only way.  it's possible your
                      father may not be dead yet.

            they look around at the mess in the room.  over turned chair. 
            signs of struggle.  spatters of blood.

                                pearl (cont'd)
                      your father was his best friend.  he
                      loved jeremiah.  so he must hate him the
                      most of all now.  he'll take his time. 
                      but even if it is too late.  if your
                      father is dead.  it's not over.  the door
                      has to be closed.

                                bill
                      well, close the fucking door by all
                      means.  but don't expect me to go down
                      there and do it.

                                pearl
                      i don't.

            she gets up to go.  cinnabar stands too.

                                patrick
                      you ain't going down there.  not alone. 
                      i'll go.

                                bill
                      fine.  but i'm bringing a couple of
                      friends.

            he steps out of the room and comes back with a gun and a
            knife in a sheath on his belt.

                                pearl
                      they won't do you no good.

            bill with a defiant "well, it can't hurt" look.  nancy
            appears in the doorway as they hurry out, seeing bill with
            the gun in his hand.

                                nancy
                      what are you doing?  i've just called the
                      police and 911.

                                patrick
                      then we need to get out of here.  we
                      can't try to explain this to them.  we'll
                      be back.  hopefully with dad.

            nancy clings to tia as the rest of them hurry down the hall.
