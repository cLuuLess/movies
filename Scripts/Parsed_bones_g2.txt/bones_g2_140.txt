            int. jeremiah's study - continuous

            jeremiah locks the door to his study.  then he pulls out the
            stack he hid on his desk.  a dusty manila envelope.  inside
            photos: the old days.  his first wife.  his first life.  back
            in the old neighborhood.  him and his best friend jimmy bones
            as children, teenagers and as adults.

                                bones (o.s.)
                      hey, brotha!  what it is?

            and bones stands right behind him.  severed heads hanging
            from his belt.

                                bones (cont'd)
                      what it will be.

                                jeremiah
                      how did you get in here?

                                bones
                      time like this, is that what you really
                      want to know?  how i got the fuck in
                      here?
