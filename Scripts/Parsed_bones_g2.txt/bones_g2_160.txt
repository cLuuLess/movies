            int. bones' pad - continuous

            down to the last detail, exactly as it was 22 years ago, the
            night bones died.  music playing (the delfonics "didn't i
            blow your mind this time...")  the only new detail are the
            dozens of candles romantically burning everywhere.

                                bones (o.s.)
                      hey, baby.

            pearl feels a soft touch on the back of her neck and spins,
            finds jimmy right behind, almost nuzzling her.  his face
            hidden, though, in darkness.  holding something in his hand,
            behind his back.

                                pearl 
                          (still with her back to him)
                      jimmy, you've got --

                                bones
                      i've got what i want.  turn around baby,
                      look at me.  look at your man.

            she turns slowly, and we don't know what to expect. 
            something horrible or something beautiful.

            finally, she's face to face, and it's jimmy just as he was,
            22 years ago.  all traces of the demonic are gone.  pearl
            melts as the delfonics swell, jimmy holding her close.

                                bones (cont'd)
                      i want you to do something for me, baby.

                                pearl
                      what?

            we see what he's holding: the dress.  rotted and blood
            clotted and ruined.

                                bones
                      i always loved you in this dress.

            he holds it up for pearl to see and from:

            her pov

            the dress is brand new and beautiful.  she's finally
            entranced.
