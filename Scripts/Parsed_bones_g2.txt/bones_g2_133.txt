            ext. southwest side - night

            bright, loud summer night.  blues coming from inside a blues
            bar, the guy playing "killin' floor".

            lupovich heads toward the armor building.  from a distance,
            he sees a young runner emerge from a passage on the farside 
            of the building then set off to meet his mark.  lupovich
            heads for the passage, the music following him.

            lupovich looks around to make sure no one is watching.  then
            slips into a passageway leading to the old slaughterhouse.

            a scary walk through inky darkness, scattered with broken
            glass and scurrying rats and lit only by the eerie red light
            spilling like blood out of the open door into the old
            slaughterhouse at the end of the way.

            lupovich reaches the back, right next to the old loading dock
            where the still-livestock were unloaded.  he enters the door,
            disappearing into the red darkness.
