	ext. pearl's storefront - day

            they stop in front of a storefront - same old palm reading
            sign.  but the name is different.  now it's "sister pearl -
            reader and advisor."  pearl enters the building while a
            lingering cinnabar catches a look on patrick's face.

                                cinnabar
                      guess it's not rossmore park.  thanks for
                      the help.

                                patrick
                      anytime.  be seeing you.

            patrick is still checking her out.  and we can see from a
            window, pearl is still checking him out.  while maurice is
            checking out the wacky window design.

                                maurice
                      yeah, well if she got psychic powers, how
                      come she's working here on desolation
                      row?
