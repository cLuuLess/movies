            ext. club - later

            a line out front.

                                patrick
                      be cool.  everybody's gonna get in.

            patrick alternates between tending the crowd and throwing
            anxious glances down the block towards cinnabar's home.

            torn between exhilaration at seeing his dream come true and
            disappointment that cinnabar's not there to share it.

            people chomping to get in.  across the street shotgun watches
            with dismay.

            patrick hears voices down the street.  looks up to see
            cinnabar walking towards the club.  his smile freezes when he
            sees pearl right behind her.  trying to stop cinn.

                                pearl
                      ...i've seen things.  in there.  last
                      night.  you did too.  don't tell me you
                      didn't.  you were crying like a baby.

                                cinnabar
                      you said the vision, the images.  they're
                      just that.  just pictures.  they can't
                      hurt you.  that's what you always said.

                                pearl
                      i lied.

                                cinnabar
                      all the more reason i should be here.

                                pearl
                      please.  it's for your own good.

                                cinnabar
                      you said bad things hurt places.  so
                      maybe good things heal them.  good things
                      are happening here.  maybe for the first
                      time ever.  and maybe that's all it
                      takes.

            pearl sees she can't stop cinn.  any more than her mother
            could have stopped pearl when she was her age.

                                pearl
                      i hope so, child.  i really hope so.

            she can only watch as cinnabar gives patrick a big hug and
            follows him and the rest of the crowd into the club.
