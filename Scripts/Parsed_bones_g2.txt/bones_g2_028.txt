            int. black cat club - continuous

            inside, the lights are dim and clouds of cigarettes and cigar
            smoke float over worn out old pool tables.

            most of the tables are empty.  an older man wearing
            sunglasses lines up a careful shot on a corner table.  it's
            eddie mack.  20 years after doing bones, he rules the hood. 
            what's left of it, anyway.

            before he can shoot, stank and weaze breeze in, stank holding
            some car keys up in his hand.

                                stank
                      say eddie.

            distracted, eddie hits the eightball and scratches.  he snaps
            the pool cue over his knee.

                                mack
