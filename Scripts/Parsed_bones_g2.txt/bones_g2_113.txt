            int. dance floor - continuous

            patrick, trying to stay low, crawls his way to where his
            sister and cinnabar are trapped.

            fire begins to burn through from the kitchen and up through
            the floor.  the room is filling with smoke.

            bill's helping those trampled in the rush to get out.  bill
            himself bleeds badly from his neck.

            patrick runs with cinnabar and tia toward the door.  and as
            the smoke fills the room, through the haze we see:

            bones step into the room.  his arm raised with the razor. 
            and he flings it out, like a boomerang, the razor flies
            around the room.

            it swoops down through the smoke at the remaining kids,
            hacking at them through the smoke, like some savage bird,
            though it doesn't seem intent on slaughtering them, but
            rather herding them out.  bill and patrick pull cinnabar and
            tia out the door -- they're the last in the room.

            suddenly the razor stops, freezes in mid-air and zips back
            into bones' waiting fist - just like a boomerang.

            razor held high, bones advances on them, steadily, cool as
            ice amidst the now fully burning house.
