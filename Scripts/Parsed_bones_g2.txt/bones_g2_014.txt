            int. buick electra - day

            behind the fur-covered steering wheel: shotgun, a broke-nosed
            bodyguard for the man in the back seat:

            jimmy bones - 28.  his street.  his world.  cool, handsome,
            respected.  dressed very fly, but not excessive.  long black
            coat, black silk shirt, and matching wide-brimmed hat.

            his left hand sports a big diamond ring while his right hand
            toys with a long silver razor, polished and oiled to
            perfection so that the long glinting blade can swing back and
            forth, or lock into position.
