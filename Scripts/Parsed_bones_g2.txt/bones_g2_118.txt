			int. car - later that night

            jeremiah drives his still shocked and silent brood back to
            safety behind the gates of rossmore park.

                                jeremiah
                      i don't want any of you ever back down
                      there again.  you hear me?  and this time
                      you'll listen to me.  or i'll let them
                      throw your asses in jail.  i mean it.
