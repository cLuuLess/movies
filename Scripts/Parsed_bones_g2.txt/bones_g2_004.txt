            he scan/aims out his window across the street to the now
            desolate building where bones once lived.  finger on the
            trigger, eyes scanning the shadows for the dog.  mumbling
            quotations from the bible about canines, some of which are
            handwritten and taped up on his walls and mirrors:

                                shotgun
                      "thou shalt not bring a dog into the
                      house of the lord thy god, for they are
                      an abomination."  deuteronomy.

            from within, almost subliminally we see a weirder, demonic,

            just the buzzing light from the vapor lamps?

                      "they return at evening: snarling like
                      dogs and prowling the city..." psalms 59,
                      vs. 6...
