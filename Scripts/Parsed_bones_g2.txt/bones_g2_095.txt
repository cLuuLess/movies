            int. bones' building - continuous

            follow bones into the lobby with people waiting to see him
            for favors, etc.  rooms on either side, doors open allowing
            us to glimpse his crew, taking orders over the phones.

            an old fashioned metal cage elevator, with an equally old
            fashioned operator waits to take mr. jimmy up to his pad.  we
            ride up with him, the king in his castle.
