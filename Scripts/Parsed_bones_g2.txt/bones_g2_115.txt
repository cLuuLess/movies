            int. bones' house - continuous

            in the burning room, we see bones, oblivious to the flames,
            climbing the stairs.

            into his hold room where

            he comes to what's left of maurice.  finds his hand bloodied
            and barely attached to the wrist, and on it -- bones' ring.

                                bones
                      you won't be needing this.

            bones slips it onto his stump of a finger.
