            int. jeremiah's office - continuous

            but the minute they are in his office, jeremiah's friendly
            demeanor drops like a mask.

                                jeremiah
                      what the hell do you want?

                                lupovich
                      just a visit with my old pal, jay-bird.

                                jeremiah
                      don't call me that.

            lupovich looks around the expansive office and paws the
            photos and knicknacks on jeremiah's desk.

                                lupovich
                      you certainly traded up.
                          (picks up a wedding picture
                           nearby)
                      ...the trophy wife.  nice lookin'.

                                jeremiah
                      keep your hands to yourself, willya?

                                lupovich
                      i been watching you.  you done good. 
                      invested wisely.  respectable businessman
                      now.  just like you always wanted.

                                jeremiah
                      and you?  still a pig.  just a much
                      fatter one.

                                lupovich
                      no reason to get nasty.  yeah, i've
                      stayed in the organization.  but then
                      again i never got the percentage you did.

                                jeremiah
                      or you didn't know what to do with it.

                                lupovich
                      maybe so.  maybe so.  but that ain't why
                      i came to see you.  you sold the
                      building.

                                jeremiah
                      what building?

                                lupovich
                      don't shit a shitter.  our building. 
                      what did you call it?  his 'tomb'?  we
                      had an agreement.  you were supposed to
                      sit on it.  not sell it --

                                jeremiah
                      i didn't sell it.

                                lupovich
                      well, somebody bought it.  that's what i
                      heard.

            jeremiah buzzes.

                                jeremiah
                      claire?  could you come in here.

            an assistant manager, claire, enters.

                                jeremiah (cont'd)
                      did we sell any properties on...
                      blackstone recently?

                                cla
                      matter of fact, we did.  5606.

                                jeremiah
                      to who?

                                cla
                      i only met with the broker.  the
                      structure was listed almost worthless and
                      had never even had a bid, i thought you'd
                      be pleased to see it sold to someone who
                      wants to improve the neighborhood. 
                      anything wrong?

                                jeremiah
                      no, of course not.  good work.  thanks a
                      lot.

            she leaves.  lupovich is still holding the picture of
            jeremiah's wife.

                                jeremiah (cont'd)
                      you're right.  one of my associates sold
                      the building last month.

                                lupovich
                      that's a bozo no-no.  jay-bird.

                                jeremiah
                      look, even if anyone found anything
                      there, it's twenty years ago.  they could
                      never connect it to us.

                                lupovich
                      you better hope not.  cause it's like
                      they say, four can keep a secret, if
                      three are dead.

            he puts down the photo with a wink.

                                lupovich (cont'd)
                      nice rack.  how old is --

                                jeremiah
                      that's it.  get out.  now!

            jeremiah advancing on lupovich, who chuckles and walks out.


                                bill
                      hey, that's...

            he's stopped by a kick under the table from patrick.

                                jeremiah
                      that's what?

                                bill
                      that's some terrible shit.

                                jeremiah
                      clean your mouth, or i will.  those boys
                      had no business messing down there.  go
                      places you're not meant to be -- that's
                      what you get.

                                bill
                      but that's your old hood, pops.

                                jeremiah
                      yeah, and it took some doing to get out
                      of there.  just be glad i did and you can
                      start life from here instead of down
                      there.

                                patrick
                      but maybe we're the ones who should be
                      down there.  doing something.  making it
                      better.

                                jeremiah
                      can't be done.  that place already died
                      and gone to hell.
