int. bruce's car - continuous
the prisoners drive off laughing.
                    prisoner #1
          ha, nice wheels, huh?
bruce sits up in the back seat.
                    bruce
          thou shalt not steal.
the prisoners jump.
                    bruce
          car, show them the way out.
instantly, the car doors fly open and the seats tilt sideways
dumping the prisoners.
                     bruce
          what is wrong with the world?
