int. bruce's car

bruce jumps in, turns the key, the car turns over but doesn't
start.
                    bruce
          i'm having a breakdown. that's
          what it is. just a normal,
          everyday psychotic episode, brought
          on by tumor or brain lesion...
we hear the car wind down to nothing. bruce releases the key
pounds the steering wheel in frustration.
                    bruce
              (to the car)
          come on, starti
the car instantly starts.
                     bruce
               (denial)
          well, that was lucky.
bruce backs up, peels out.
music up: "he's got the whole world in his hands"
