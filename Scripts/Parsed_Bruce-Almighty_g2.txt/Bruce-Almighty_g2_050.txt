int. grocery store - day

grace and debbie stand at the check-out stand. grace flips
through a celeb magazine, as debbie places the last few items
from the cart to the conveyor belt.
in the background, throughout, debbie's daughter, zoe is
grabbing random items off the shelves and placing them on the
belt.
                       grace
                (re: magazine)
           gosh, this girl is so talented and
           all they ever talk about is her
           hair.

                                                       46.



                    debbie
          yeah, she should marry somebody
          famous, take the focus off.
grace checks her cell phone screen.
                    debbie
          we would have heard it ring.
                    grace
          i know. it's just that he usually
          calls during the day.
                    debbie
          he just needs to blow off some
          steam, he'll be fine.
                    grace

                    debbie
          wow, you lashed? you never lash.
          i'm impressed.
                    grace
          i feel bad for him.   he's wanted
          anchor for so long.
zoe begins pulling groups of items onto the belt.
                    debbie
          well, i've been praying to win the
          lottery for fifteen years, but it's
          not going to happen. you know,
          it's not all about money.
the clerk finishes ringing the last item.
                    clerk
          that'll be four hundred and twenty-
          seven, eighty.-
                       debbie
          what?!
debbie looks in a bag, pulls out a handful of various counter
items. zoe giggles and proudly holds up one of the hundred
or so tic-tac mint containers.
                      debbie
          zoe.

                     grace

          to be there for him.
