evan is packing his things at his desk, still looking much
worse for the wear. bruce walks up to him.
                    evan
          you're probably here to gloat over
          the anchor position. go ahead, i'm
          sure i deserve it.
                    bruce
          you know, evan.    i've been a real
          prick.
evan stops, looks up at bruce, confused.
                    bruce
          you were born to anchor. i'm not
          taking the position. oh, and i
          never really congratulated you on
          getting the job in the first place.
          congratulations, evan.
bruce offers his hand, evan takes it. when their hands meet,
there is a kind of electrical charge that passes between
them. bruce walks off, evan is confused when he catches his
reflection in the mirror. he's back to normal!
