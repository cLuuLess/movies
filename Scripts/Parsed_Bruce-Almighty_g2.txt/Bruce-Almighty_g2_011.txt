int. staff meeting room - day

on the monitor:

                     evan
          is something killing your kids?
          find out tonight at eleven.
bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
continues on.

                                                        13.



in the room
the morning meeting is well in progress. leading the group
is the station manager and bruce's boss, jack keller, 50's, a
constant furrow in his brow.
also in the room: bruce's fellow field reporter and rival
evan baxter, 30' s , a walking statement. impeccable posture,
perfect speech, perfect everything and he knows it.
fred donohue, the ever jovial sports reporter; always tanned,
vain weatherman, dallas coleman and segment producer ally
loman.

                    jack
          okay, promos are approved, let's--
                    ally
          ah, isn't that last one a little
          misleading? i mean, the story's
          about flu shots. do we have to
          scare people to death?
                    evan
          no, just into watching. or i could
          change it to: "slow news day, come
          yawn with us. at eleven."
                    fred
          sniffles at eleven is nice.
                    dallas
          attack of the killer sniffles?
                    ally
              (to dallas)
          the tanning booth is starting to
          zap your brain, you know that?
                    dallas
          i don't use a tanning booth.
a beat and they all crack up.
                    fred                                        *
          come on. you're turning orange.                       *
                    evan                                        *
          he looks florida ripe to me.         .                *
more laughs.                                                    *

                                                     14.



                    jack
          i would have swore i already said
          this, but promos are approved. now                  *
          can we move on?                                     *
                    ally
          jack, shouldn't the promos be                       *
          focusing on pete's retirement.
          this is his last week.
                    evan
              (leading)
          yeah, yeah. any word on the open
          anchor position, jack?
                     jack
          evan, you'11 know something when i
          know something.
bruce bursts into the room. the meeting stops. jack doesn't
need to say anything, he just looks at his watch.
                    bruce
          sorry, jack. it wasn't my fault.
          the traffic was -- you guys already
          played the spots?
                    jack
          nice story, bruce, but we're going
          with evan's piece on the sex
          scandal at the mayor's office for
          sweeps.
this hits bruce hard. a beat of silence.
                    evan
          and that's the way the cookie
          crumbles.
the others chuckle. only ally remains sympathetic.
                    evan
          i'm just messin' with you, bruce.
          see you've got to remember that the
          news room is like a cookie...
more laughs.
                    bruce
               (re: evan's perfect
                posture)
          that's great evan.
                      (more)

                                                          15.

                    bruce (cont'd)
          is you're posture naturally that
          good, or do you have to shove a
          stick up there?
                    jack
          okay, knock it off... bruce we're
          holding your story in reserve.
          now, can we get back to the board
          so we have something to air today?
jack continues with assignments. evan sits smugly, as bruce
slides down into his chair, deflated.
