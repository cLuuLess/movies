bruce drives, whistling the tune, catches himself,
immediately stops whistling.
                     bruce
          okay, just relax here. i did not
          meet god and i do not have his
          powers.
               (laughs)
          if that was god, then i'm mario
          andretti.
instantly, bruce's car peels out, races through traffic,
dodging and passing cars right and left.
                     bruce
          aaahhhhhhhh!j!

                                                            41.


suddenly there is a guy in a red pit crew suit standing
before bruce waving a red flag. bruce swerves to avoid the
man and screeches into a pit stop. several other red-suited
italian men engulf the car. bruce watches in amazement as the
professional racing team jacks up his car, slaps on huge mag
tires, gases him up, etc. paul newman leans into the
driver's window.
                    paul newman
          hey mario, did you get that box of
          dressing i sent you?
bruce responds against his will in perfect italian --
                    bruce
              (in perfect italian)
          si, dovete venire sopra per il
          pranzo un certo tempo.
              (subtitles: yes, you must
               come over for dinner some
               time.)
bruce reacts shocked.   the crew backs off and urges him on in
italian.
                     pit crew
          vete l ve tel
bruce's car peels out on it's own, he struggles to control
the wheel, finally pulling over to a curb. his car door
won't open so he has to crawl out of the driver's window.

he rushes onto the sidewalk, backing away from his normal
looking tauras. not knowing what to do, he slips into a
diner.
