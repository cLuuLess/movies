int. hallway - moments later

jack is at bobby's cart, paying for a sandwich. bruce
catches up .to him.
                    bruce
          jack, jack, hey.     can i talk to you
          for a second?
                    jack
          sure, bruce. what do you need?
                    bruce
          sweeps.
jack takes his sandwich and leaves. bobby leans to bruce.
                    bobby
          don't worry about it.    i called my
          aunt, we're on.
bruce looks at bobby, continues after and catches jack.
                     bruce
          look, jack. hear me out, i'm
          getting desperate man, i am pushing
          forty and what have i got to show
          for it? the point is, i've hit
          some kind of a ceiling here. some
          kind of anti-bruce barrieri and
          evan is just lovin' it, by the way.
          he gets the good stories, he gets
          on sweeps. maybe i have to be more
          like evan.

                    jack
          you don't want to be like evan.
          evan's an asshole.
                    bruce
          i can be an asshole.

                                                          16.



                          jack
             no, bruce.     you can't.
bruce thinks, then flips jack's sandwich plate over. it
scatters on the floor. jack and bruce stare at each other
for a beat.
                       jack
             are you going to pick that up?
                       bruce
             yeah, i'm sorry.
bruce bends down, starts picking up jack's food.
                       bruce
             it's just- this anchor position
             looming, it's gotten me nuts...
he hands the plate to jack, as sexy anchorwoman susan ortega
saunters by.
               jack                               bruce
hi, susan.                           hi, susan.
                          susan ortega
             hi, jack.
bruce blanches at this obvious snubbing.
                       jack
             look, bruce. you're a good
             reporter. you make people laugh.
             god knows today we can use it.
bruce slumps, he's heard this a thousand times before.              *
                        jack                                    *
                 (beat)
             alright, tell you what. it's the                   *
             23rd anniversary of the maid of the
             mist. i want you at niagara falls
             in an hour.
                       bruce
             maid of the mist. that's always
             live.
                          jack
             yep.
                       bruce
             evan gets the live feeds.

                                                          17.



                    jack
          well now you and evan get the live
          feeds.
                    bruce
          i'm going live. in sweeps.
                    jack
          yes, but watch yourself, bruce.
          i've seen your outtakes.
bruce hugs jack, pressing the sandwich against his chest.
                     bruce
          yes 1 you will not regret this,
          jack.
               (releases jack)
          i will not forget you when i go
          national.
bruce takes off, jack looks down, peels the sandwich off his
chest. we hear children's joyous shrieks...
