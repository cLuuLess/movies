grace is talking with one of the other teachers. the kids,
playing dodgeball in the background, laugh and scream louder
and louder. grace turns and sees...
bruce getting pelted by multiple balls.
                      bruce
           okay, surrender, surrender.
he walks over to grace.
                      bruce
           hi.

                                                         99.



                       grace
          hi..
                    bruce
          i, ah, have my first anchor
          tonight.
                    grace
          that's great. i hope it goes well
          for you.
he's hit in the head by a ball.    grace can't help but smiles
bruce leaps at the opportunity.
                    bruce
          i miss you.
              (off her silence)
          i just took the first step, shot
          myself out on the ledge, awaiting
          vulnerably your response.
                      grace
          . . . i don't know what to say.
                    bruce
          how about you love me and you'll
          take me back.
                       grace
          no, bruce.
                    bruce
          come on, what about all the signs?
                    grace
          what? how do you know about that?
          did you talk to debbie?
                      bruce
               (beat)
          would it help if i told you i acted
          like an ass?
martin is standing nearby.
                    martin
          hey, you said ass.
                    bruce
          it's okay as long as you mean a
          donkey. i didn't add "hole." it's
          only bad when you say "ass-ho--

                                                        100.


                      grace
           alright, inside, martin.
                (to the others)
           okay everyone, inside.
the kids race in. grace starts to follow.
                     bruce
           grace, please. none of this seems                    *
           right without you.                                   *
               (off her reaction)                               *
           is that a glimmer of hope i see?                     *
                     grace
           i have to go...                                      *
she starts off. . .
                      bruce
           wait.
bruce dramatically raises a hand toward grace, like putting a
love spell on her.
                     bruce
           now how do you feel?
she looks at him, oddly.
                      grace
           ...are you out of your mind? have
           you been drinking?
                       bruce
           drin kin g? sur e. i'm dru nk wit h
           power.
bruce raises both hands in full hexing fashion...
                     bruce
           ...love me1!!
                      grace
                (a beat)
           you need help.
she heads back inside. bruce throws his hands in the air,
frustrated.
