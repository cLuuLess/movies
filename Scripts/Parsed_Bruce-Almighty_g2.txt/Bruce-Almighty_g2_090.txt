ext. alleyway - night - continuous
he bursts out the kitchen exit into the alley. unclasps his
ears, but no relief. the whispers are now loud voices. we
start to make out fragments of words "please," "help me,"
etc.
overwhelmed and scared, he slides down the alley wall,
covering his face, then total silence --
bruce lowers his hands and finds himself sitting atop a high
mountain peak.
                     god (o.s.)
          really something isn't it?
god sits down next to bruce.
                    bruce
          is this heaven?
god laughs at this one.
                     god
          it's everest. you should try
          flipping on the discovery channel
          every now and then. well, i guess
          you can't now, being dead and all.
                       bruce
          i'm dead?i
god laughs.

                                                         76.



                    god
          no, i'm just messing with you.
                    bruce
          those voices...
                    god
          they're prayers, bruce. you keep
          ignoring them and they're going to
          build up on. you like that. you
          didn't think being god was going to
          be all fun and games did you?
                    bruce
          prayers? those are prayers? why
          can't i understand them?
god forms a snowball in his hands as he talks.
                    god
          you aren't listening, son. let's
          see, you've had my powers for over
          a week now and how many people have
          you helped?
                     bruce
          okay, so maybe i've righted a
          couple of the wrongs in my own
          life. i was going to get around to
          others. i can do both. i can help
          the world.
                    god
          the world? that wasn't the world,
          bruce. that was just buffalo,
          between commonwealth and 57th.
          didn't want to start you out with
          more than you can handle. now how
          you doing otherwise? personal life
          in good shape?
                    bruce
          yeah. everything is great.
a doorway opens like a crack in space. grace steps out, sees
bruce.
                     grace
          bruce? what are you doing out
          here?
with that, the terrain transforms back into the alley where
grace has been standing all along. she can not see .god.

                                               77,



                     bruce
          oh, ah,
               (to god)
          she can't...
               (god shakes his head, back
                to grace)
          i just, ah, needed a little fresh
          air.
bruce fakes a couple big breaths.
                    grace
          bruce, what is going on? the
          second i want to talk about us you
          run out on me.
                     god
               (to bruce)
          everything's great, huh?
                    bruce
          i wasn't running out on you...
                    grace
          you know, i actually had the crazy
          idea that you were going to ask me
          to marry you tonight.
                    god
          now it's heating up.
                     bruce
               (to god)
          you are not helping.
              (back to grace)
          ...me at all here, grace.
                     god
               (sarcastic)
          nice recovery.
bruce looks to god to shut up.
                    grace
          not helping you what?
                    bruce
              (to grace)
          look hun, i want to talk about
          this. this just isn't a good time.
          okay?

                                                               78.


                    grace
          when is it a good time? it's never
          a good time.
                        god
              she's got a point.
                        bruce
                  (to god)
              stay out of this.
grace looks at him like he's nuts.
                                                           *

                    grace
          who are you talking to?!
just then, the whispers start in again.        bruce reacts.
                        bruce
              oh, not now.
bruce puts his hands to his ears.       grace takes this as him
not wanting to listen to her.
                        god
          you're going to have to answer
          those things, y'know.
                        grace
          fin e. yo u kn ow wh at? i 'm go in g t o
          go home and if by some miracle it                          *
          suddenly becomes a 'good time', you                        *
          know where to find me.                                     *
               (starts out, then)                                    *
          and speaking of time, you're                               *
          running out of it.                                         *
grace heads back into the restaurant. bruce stands
completely frustrated.
                     bruce
              (to god)
          thank you.
                     god
          you want some friendly advice?
                        bruce
          no.
god smiles.

                                                               79.



                         god
               you wanted the job, bruce.     i                        *
               suggest you get to it.                                  *
