          you back, bruce. i want to tell

          you go. when the big guy gives the
          order, i gotta...
                    bruce
          no harm no foul, jack. i needed
          some time off to reassess my goals
          and get in touch with my true self.
                    jack
          you did that in a day?
                    bruce
          imagine what i can do with seven.
jack pauses for an awkward beat.       his face grows serious.
                     jack
          i haven't been the best father in
          the world.
                    bruce

jack gives bruce a big hug.
                       jack
          look,    it's not in my power to give
          you a   nchor, but as far as field
          repor   ting goes, if you're looking
          for a    bump.
                    bruce
          jack, don't worry about that. just
          give me a camera and a crew and
          i'll give you the news.
bruce exits.    jack likes the new bruce.
