ext. city streets - morning
bruce sits in bumper to bumper traffic. a man's car is
broken down in the middle of the street causing the
bottleneck.
bruce sees the sign guy by the side of the road.   his sign
reads: all for won.
bruce looks out at the other drivers honking and shouting at
the frustrated man.
cut to - the stalled car is now rolling to the shoulder and
we reveal that bruce is doing the pushing.
