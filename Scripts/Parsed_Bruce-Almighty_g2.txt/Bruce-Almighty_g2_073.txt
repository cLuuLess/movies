ext. fair grounds - day
bruce is bored off his ass, interviewing some blue haired old
ladies at the mark twain chili cook off.
                    blue haired lady
              (talks so slow you want to
               kill yourself)
          my secret is i let the jalapeno's
          marinade in a spicy sauce for over
          24 hours before i--
we see bruce's pained face, realizing what horrible news this
is, when he gets an idea and schwwwwwaaaaaam!11 an asteroid
crashes to earth behind them.
                     bruce
          hold that thought, hazel!
               (bruce walks back toward
                the explosion)
          it seems some type of meteor or
          asteroid has, by chance, hit the
          earth right behind the mark twain
          chili cook off. . .
