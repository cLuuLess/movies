ext. debbie house - night
bruce stands in front of the house with flowers, another
special creation. he looks at the lavish bouquet, then sets
them down, picks a single, normal daisy from the garden.
better.
he heads for the door when he hears crying. it's grace. he
looks up, sees a light on in the upstairs guest room.
he climbs the fire escape and looks in the window.
grace is sitting on the bed crying. as bruce watches her
cry, feeling her emotion, it starts to lightly rain.
                    grace
          please god. please...

                                                          11 6.



through her tears she is praying.     bruce looks at her with
total love.
                       grace
             please god. i still love him...
bruce smiles, thankful.
                       grace
             ...but i don't want to love him
             anymore. please god. help me to
             forget.
                  (cries)
             i don't want to hurt anymore. i
             want to forget.
bruce just stands there, stunned. he gets it. he raises a
hand, and with a simple wave, he performs an excruciatingly
selfless act. he lets grace go.
on grace
her face changes.     she wipes her eyes.   the pain is lifted.
and it is bruce now who feels that pain. he looks at grace.
a sad smile.
