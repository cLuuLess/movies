ext. police training center - day

a police dog, hank, performs some standard take downs by
"attacking" a "criminal" (trainer) on the run. phil, a
reporter from a rival station is wrapping up his story.
                     phil
          i certainly wouldn't want to be a
          fugitive on the run with hank,
          buffalo's number one police dog, on
          the job. this is phil sidleman
          reporting from the police canine
          training center.
              (beat)
          and cut it. let's go, guys.
the crew start to wrap up.
angle - bruce
watching the action from the side, holding his own home video
camera. phil spots him.
                    phil
          hey, channel seven, right? you're
          the guy that went crazy.
                    bruce
          yeah, i had a bad day. but things
          are lookin' up.
                    phil
          what are you doin' here?
                    bruce
          just lookin' for a story.
                    phil
              (waving the video tape)
          well, this pond's fished out.
          pretty standard stuff anyway.

                                                          58.


                    bruce
          i don't know. my instinct tells me
          there's something more.
                    phil
          well, go with that. it's served
          you well in the past, right?
phil and a couple of his crew laugh, as they load the last of
their equipment into the van and shut the doors.

                     trainer (o.s.)
          hey, hank found something1

phil turns back, bruce and he exchange a glance.

hank is digging furiously, making a big hole. the policeman
jogs over, joins the trainer. they watch as two dress shoes
are uncovere d in the di rt. hank barks.

          we got a bodyi

                    phil
              (to his crew)
          shit. get the camera, now!

extreme close on - the van's door lock

it locks automatically.   the cameraman yanks at the door.

                     cameraman
           it's locked and the keys are
           inside i
bruce casually turns his camera on, gives phil a "tough
break" look, heads for the scene, as phil and his crew
scramble around the van.
                                          cut to:

          the body of jimmy hoffa was
          uncovered in a field today outside
          of a canine training center in
          buffalo new york. local buffalo
          freelance field reporter bruce
          nolan was the first on the scene...

                                                         59.


we cut to the pre-taped story. bruce stands with hank and
his trainer before camera, the body being exhumed from the
ground behind him.
                    bruce
          since the disapearence of teamster
          president jimmy hoffa in the
          nineteen sixties, his whereabouts
          have remained one of this country's
          great unsolved mysteries. that is
          until just moments ago, when during
          a routine training session, a
          police dog named hank sniffed his
          way right into the history books.
          as you can see behind us, the body
          is being carefully exhumed and will
          be transported to a hospital
          facility where dna testing will
          confirm the identity. that, of
          course, only a formality as in a
          bizarre twist, the body was found
          buried with a birth certificate and
          complete set of dental records.
               (rubs hank's neck)
          sort of a two-in-one for hank
          today, as moments later, he busted
          a local news camera crew with four
          kilo's of marijuana.
we see footage of phil and his news crew, being cuffed on the
ground, as large stacks of marijuana plants are being pulled
from the van.
                     phil
          i've never seen it before, i swear i
