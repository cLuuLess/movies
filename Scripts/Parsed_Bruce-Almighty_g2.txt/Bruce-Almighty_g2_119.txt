bruce stands there, sees god as he originally found him,
mopping. god looks up at bruce, not surprised to see him.
                     bruce
           they're all out of control. i
           don't know what to do.
                     god
           you mind giving me a hand with this
           floor first?
off bruce's look. . .
                                           dissolve to:
later
bruce's sleeves rolled up, mopping next to god.
                        god                                      *
           "poor man wanna be rich, rich man                     *
           wanna be king, king's disatisfied                     *
           'cause he rules everything..."                        *

                                                       107.

                    god (cont'd)
              (to bruce)                                        *
          springsteen. i like a little boss                     *
          in my head while i'm workin'...                       *
they finish up.   god looks back at the sparkling floor,
satisfied.
                    god
          there we go. wonderful thing. no
          matter how filthy something gets,
          it can always be cleaned right up.
god collects bruce's mop.
                    bruce
          what happened? i gave everyone
          what they wanted.
god sets the mops down.
                    god
          since when does anyone have a clue
          about what they want?
god holds up a remote and clicks, changing the room into the
diner where bruce first parted his soup. (note: whenever the
room "changes" we're actually still in the room, but seeing a
full projection of an environment on the walls and columns)
the older waitress, ginnie, clears some dishes...
                    god
          remember ginnie?
ginnie bends down behind the counter and when she comes back
up she is a hot 21 year old.
                    god
          ginnie thought she lost her beauty
          when she got older. i'm trying to
          convince her otherwise.
ginnie bends down again, and when she comes back up, she is
her older self again.
god clicks the remote, changing the environment into a school
yard. we see the grade school where filbert davis, the boy
bruce helped up the rope, is in a fight.
                    god
          ah yes, filbert. brilliant young
          man. he was going to be a great
          poet.

                                                         108.

                     god (cont'd)
          the soul of his work would have
          been built out of his hardships.
          he would have touched millions.
               (feigns cheery)
          but now he's headed for a career as
          a professional wrestler.
god clicks, changing the environment into a condo. we see a
lonely woman (who found the cash in her purse) sitting
depressed, rocking in a chair.
                     god
          ester maha. i love ester. ester
          was bankrupt. she was going to
          have to eat her pride and call her
          sister. would've got the two of
          them together again. instead, she
          bought a condo in florida.
                                                                    *
god clicks the remote again...

          they're the one's holding the
          power.
god claps the bright ceiling light on, walks over to the
latter.
                    bruce
          wait. where are you going?
                    god

          learned a lot. i think you should
          be able to handle things now.
god climbs, ascending into the light.
                    bruce
          what if i have a question? what if
          i need you?
god stops, looks down to bruce.

          see bruce, that's your problem.
          that's everybody's problem. you
          keep looking up. . .
he smiles and disappears into the light, leaves bruce
thinking.
