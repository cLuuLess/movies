a big blood drive in progre   ss. everyone is there, grace,
sam, debbie and zoe, ginnie   and jack, the kowolski brothers,
momma kowolski, evan, susan   , dallas, fred. bobby serves
various food items from his   cart.
                    bobby
          you know, french toast was invented
          by tavern owner, joseph french, who
          had a poor knowledge of grammar,
          and did not know how to use the
          possessive apostrophe, so he called
          it french toast instead of french's
          toast...
pull back to reveal bruce, crutch under one arm, cast on his
leg, mic in hand, reporting. he's now talking in his own
voice, much more himself.
                    bruce
          this is bruce nolan at buffalo's
          first annual "be the miracle" blood
          drive. remember, the life you save
          may be mine, so hurry down. i had
          a close call and, well, can you
          imagine what life would have been
          like without me?
laughs in the background, from the people that know bruce.
bruce walks over to the kowolski brothers.

                                                         121.



                    bruce
          in honor of this event, the
          kowolski brothers have baked a one-
          of-a-kind, creation.
the brothers proudly unveil the special cookie and we see
that it's a huge syringe shaped chocolate chip cookie.
                    bruce
          sure, a little creepy and a
          shameless plug, but we love 'em.
              (bruce breaks off a little
               piece, takes a bite)
          mmm, good needle. remember, that's
          kowolski's bakery. the bakery that
          gets more air time than a high
          speed chase.
everyone laughs.   the kowolski brothers beam.
bruce takes a seat as a volunteer nurse pulls up his sleeve,
revealing the prayer beads worn around his wrist. she ties
off his arm, starts to probe for a vein.
                       Â·
                    bruce
          to be honest, i've never been a big
          fan of shots. . .
the volunteer now is swabbing bruce's arm and bruce is
starting to sweat.
                    bruce
              (nervous)
          okay, we're good to go...they just
          stick it into my arm. breaking
          through the skin, of course...
the volunteer pulls out the needle and bruce passes out cold.
gasps, the nurse leans close, total silence, then:
                      bruce
          blllaaaa!

bruce jolts awake making the nurse and several people jump.
they all laugh.

                    bruce
          had you going, didn't iiiiii1

he reacts to the nurse poking the needle in. everyone laughs
more.

                                                          122.


                      bruce
           no, this is nothing. in fact, this
           is the second time i've given blood
           this week. for those of you who
           haven't heard, i ' d like you to meet
           the soon to be mrs. exclusive.
he throws a look to grace who smiles in return.    the crowd
applauds.
                     bruce
           this is bruce nolan reporting for
           eyewitness news.
the camera cuts.   bruce lowers his mic, turns to grace.
                      bruce
           so, what'd you think?
                      grace                                      *
           i don't know, i thought it was very                   *
           pleasurable.                                          *
bruce smiles, they kiss...
as the blood drive continues, we push through the crowd,
heading somewhere. bodies clear frame and we see the
homeless man sitting on a park bench. his sign reads:
thee end
the homeless man smiles into camera. we continue forward and
in a slow, mysterious, subtle fashion his face slowly
transforms into the very pleased, face of god, who winks and
w. . .
