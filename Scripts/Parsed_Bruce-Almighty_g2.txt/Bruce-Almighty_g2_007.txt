ext. small wonders day care - morning
bruce pulls up in his ford tauras to a cluster of cars
unloading kids. a 2003 mercedes srl passes by.
                    grace
          wow, nice car, huh?
                     bruce
          yeah, if you want to rub your
          success in people's faces.
then bruce notices a big medical van in front of the school
with a blood drive sign.
                     bruce
          what's with the hubbub?
                     grace
          we're having a blood drive.
                    bruce
          creepy. needles, yech...
                     grace
          oh, that's a nice response.

                                                       9.



                     bruce
          i mean, it's just s o . . .
                    grace
          helpful and life saving?
                    bruce
          c'mon, that's your...blood. it's
          in your body and i don't think it's
          supposed to come out. besides,
          they stockpile that stuff. they
          have an endless supply frozen in a
          warehouse somewhere then tell
          everyone there's a shortage.

                    grace
          they do not. now stop it. i'm                        *
          giving. i have a very rare blood                     *
          type, ab positive.
                    bruce
          well, i'm ib positive. ib positive
          they aint touchin' me with no
          needle.
grace sighs in exasperation, starts out when...
                      grace
                (suddenly remembers
                 something)
          o. . .
          h
she places a string of prayer beads on the rearview mirror.
                    bruce
          what's that?
                    grace
          prayer beads. the kids made 'em.
          keep you safe.
                      bruce
          well, i hope they work, cause it's
          going take a miracle to get me to
          work on time.
