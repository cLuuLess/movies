int. newsroom - day
bruce rushes through the newsroom, rounds a corner and runs
right into bobby, the endlessly yammering pastry cart guy.

                                                         1.
                                                         1

                     bobby
          bruce the goose! morning, buddy.
          don't even move, i got somethin'
          special today. my mom made it just
          for you.
                     bruce
          well, that's- bobby, i gotta go-
          i'm late...
                     bobby
               (bending down)
          you like quiche?
he comes back up, proudly presents a slice of quiche.
                     bobby
          you know, contrary to popular
          belief the quiche was actually
          invented by the mayans, then stolen
          by the french. they shoulda said,
          "hey, that quiche ain't yours, it's
          mayan!"
bobby belts out a laugh.
                    bruce
          bobby, i can't, i--
                     bobby
          just taste it, taste it...
bobby shoves a bite into bruce's mouth. bruce feigns liking
it with exasperation.
                     bruce
          mmm, delicious, i really gotta go.
                     bobby
          that's a buck seventy-five.
                     bruce
          can you get kelly- ahh...
bruce tosses the thought, digs into his pocket, fishing for
cash.
                     bobby
               (excited)
          oh, two o'clock, two o'clock, two-o-
          five, two-ten...

                                                       12.



bruce glances over, annoyed but freezes at the sight of sexy
anchorwoman, susan ortega across the room.
                    bobby
          way out of our league, huh?
bruce offers his money to bobby.
                     bobby
          you know, i saw them editing your
          cookie piece.

                     bruce
          really?

                    bobby
          they must have gotten high or
          something, cause they was orderin'
          everything, i had. hey, how long
          have you been interested in pastry?
          'cause i've got an aunt who makes
          baklava twenty layers deep.

                     bruce
               (holding money out)
          bobby.
                     bobby
               (gets a brilliant idea)
          maybe you could do a story on her!
bruce tosses the money on the cart, heads off.
                    bruce
          keep the change.
                     bobby
               (calling after)
          i'll give her a call, we'll talk
          about it later!
