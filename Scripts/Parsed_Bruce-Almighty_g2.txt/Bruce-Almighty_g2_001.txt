int. kowolski's bakery - kitchen - day

a news crew shuttles around a gigantic cookie. standing by
are the kowolski brothers, gustov and vol, two short, stocky,
men, along with mother kowolski and other bakery family
employees. a "30 year anniversary" sign hangs in the
background.
bruce nolan looks into a make-up mirror, desperately trying
to place a large segment of wayward hair.
                     bruce
          oh, god, no! the hair's wrong.
          this is a bad sign.
               (calling out)
          we really need to get a make-up
          person?!
the segment producer, ally loman, steps over.
                     ally
          not in the budget. and not to                         *
                                                                *
          worry, you're going to look great
          in this.
she holds out a hair net.
                     bruce
          a hair net? i'm not wearing a hair
          net. i just did the hair.
                     ally
               (matter of fact)
          health code. in the kitchen or
          around the cookie, you gotta have
          it.
                     bruce
               (to crew: re hair net)
          you guy's should tell me this
          before hand, this is like a huge
          waste of...moose.
bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up
looking ridiculous and very disgruntled.
                     bruce
          remind me to swing by an elementary                   *
          school after this and serve lunch.
ally laughs.

                                                       2.



                     ally
          you're a thing of beauty.     in
          three, two, one. . .
bruce snaps from pissed to instant charismatic tv newsman.
(note: whenever bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his
"reporter's voice" - that recognizable, too-smooth delivery
that all news reporters seem to have. in mathematical terms
bruce's version is to the 7th power.)
                    bruce
          for three decades the kowolski
          family bakery has been a mainstay
          in downtown buffalo. known for
          their sinfully rich, cream filled,
          deep fried polski pierogis. and
          the occasional sugar induced coma
          that follows. today, in honor of
          their 30 year anniversary, momma
          kowolski and her sons gustov and
          vol, decided to do something, a
          little bit different. tell me
          guys, how did this idea come about?

                       gustov
          well,    vol said to me, 'gustov, why
          don't    we make the biggest chocolate
          chip    cookie in buffalo?' and i
          said,    'yeah, sure.'
                    bruce
          wow. fascinating.
bruce steps up to the huge cookie.
                    bruce
          the previous buffalo cookie record
          was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by
          gladys pelsnick. but this behemoth
          cookie clearly proving that gustov
          and vol have much more free time.
the kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background,
toasting with big mugs of milk. bruce steps forward, looks
dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.
                       bruce (cont'd)
          as we witness the ceremonial
          toasting with milk it makes one
          pause and think. what are we
          really looking at here?
                       (more)

                                                        3.

                    bruce (cont'd)
          is it just a big cookie or does
          this cookie represent the pride of
          buffalo? our dedicated and hard
          working citizens the key
          ingredient, with a few nuts thrown
          in.
              (motions his eyes to the
               kowolski twins)
          and finally, the love of our
          families which provides the warm
          chewy center making our beloved
          buffalo the sweetest place to live.

camera is in close as bruce signs-off.
                    bruce (cont'd)
          and that's the way the cookie
          crumbles. i'm bruce nolan,
          eyewitness news.
bruce's hair net slips up, puffing his hair into a bun on the
top of his head. the kowolskis and bystanders all laugh.
the frame freezes.
we pull back from the tv and find bruce holding the remote,
watching the recorded spot on tv. we are now...
