bruce takes off walking, the camera follows.
                       bruce
          now, lets speak to the owner. come
          on in here, bill.
bill shakes his head "no" as bruce pulls him into frame.
                    bruce
          bill, you.'ve been running the maid
          of the mist for 23 years. tell me,
          why do you think i didn't get the
          anchor job?
                    bill
          hey, man, i don't want any--
                     bruce
          do you think it's my hair?
               (bruce messes his hair
                like crazy)
          maybe my teeth aren't white enough?
          or like the great falls, is the
          bedrock of my life slowly erroding
          underneath me.
               (moving closer to camera,
                to an inch away)
          erroding. erroooding.
          errodiiiing...
