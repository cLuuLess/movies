int. jack's office - later
on tv

evan is manning the anchor desk and looking good doing it.
jack is relieved.
                      evan baxter
          in the financial world, things are
          settling back to normal in what
          analysts are calling a fluke market
          fluctuation...
bruce enters.
                     bruce
          you made the right choice, jack.

                                                                 113.



                           jack
                so what about you? what will you
                do?
                          bruce
                with your permission, i think i'll
                go out there and make the people
                laugh. to quote a friend, "god
                knows we could use it."
jack smiles.
                          jack
                permission granted.
bruce turns to go, then turns back.
                          bruce
                oh, are you hungry? i know a place
                that makes a mean tomato soup.
