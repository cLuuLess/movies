ext. niagara falls - maid of the mist boat - day

ally hustles bruce toward the bow of the boat, as he places
his ear piece.
                    ally
          they want you close to the falls.
                    bruce
          what for? i'll get soaked.
                    ally
          that's the point.    they want you to
          hold up this.
she hands bruce a very stupid looking, blue "falls" shaped
umbrella with the maid of the mist insignia.
                    ally
          part of the condition of us getting
          the exclusive.
bruce takes the umbrella.
'     '               bruce
          lovely.    glad i wore my tap shoes.
                     ally
          remember, this is their 23rd
          anniversary. capacity is 59. they
          cater to tourists, honeymooners. . .
                    bruce
          and people who are insanely                    '     *
          thirsty, i get it.                                   *
                    ally
          and you'll be interviewing irene
          dansfeild...
she positions a very, very old woman next to bruce.
                     ally
          ...she rode on the maiden voyage
          with her late husband. okay, 90                      *
          seconds.
bruce looks upward at the ridiculous umbrella. mutters
encouragement to himself.

                                                            22,



                     bruce
           90 seconds, going live. think
           anchor, think dignity,
                (glances up toward
                 umbrella)
           ignore umbrella. just have fun.
                                             cut to:

the live feed in the camera truck at the falls

some of the crew members watch the feed.

on tv

pete fineman is reporting.
                     pete fineman
           ...but because of the fast response
           by our local fire fighters, the
           toxic chemicals were cleaned up
           without incident. susan.
the female co-anchor, susan ortega:
                     susan
           bruce nolan is standing by at
           niagara falls with a report on the
           maid of the mist sightseeing boat,
           but before we go live to bruce, we
           have an announcement to make. as
           everyone knows, after 33 years, our
           beloved pete fineman is retiring.
pete smiles a proud, heart-felt smile.
                      susan
           pete's shoes are virtually
           impossible to fill, but the show
           must go on. and we could think of
           no one better than our very own
           evan baxter.
on bruce

listening to the feed. his face goes white.      he stands in
shock.
evan is seated next to susan.

                                                         23.


                    susan
          congratulations, evan. looks like
          we'll be sitting side by side from
          now on.
                    evan
          thanks, susan. i ' m thrilled and
          honored. like you said, no one can
          replace the great pete fineman, but
          i'll do my best. i have to say i
          am so proud to be a part of our
          local community. of buffalo. i
          think a great city is a lot like a
          great recipe really. put in some
          hard working citizens, add some
          care givers, maybe a few nuts...
the other news anchors and evan himself chuckle at "his"
joke. bruce listens on the feed, beyond stunned.
                     evan (cont'd)
          all sprinkled with the strength and
          love of our good families, that
          ultimately creates a sweet place to
          live. thank you.
                    susan
              (touched)
          wow. that was amazing. and now
          let's go live to wacky bruce nolan
          out at niagara falls.
