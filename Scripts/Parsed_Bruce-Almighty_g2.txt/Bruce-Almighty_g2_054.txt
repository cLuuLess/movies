int. bruce and grace's apartment - night

grace sits on the floor next to the coffee table with a box
of photos working on the album. she takes a sip of wine,
sets down the glass. sam walks over and laps up the wine.
                      grace
                (to sam)
           well, at least i have someone to
           drink with.
grace hears bruce coming up the stairs, singing.

                                                       51.



                     bruce
          what if god was one of us. . .
          just a slob like one of us...
          just a stranger on a bus...
          trying to make his way. . .
grace reacts a bit surprised by bruce's happy tone, she gets
up, opens the door and there stands bruce, beaming smile,
holding a very unique bouquet of flowers.
                    bruce
              (finishing song)
          ...home.
                    grace
              (re: the flowers)
          oh, my god.
                    bruce
          you can call me bruce.
                    grace
          where have you been? you're
          so...happy.
                     bruce
          who wouldn't be on a night like
          this?
               (holding out the flowers)
          for you.
grace takes the flowers, gives bruce a kiss, still sizing up
his mood.
                    grace
          these are amazing. what are they?
                    bruce
          it's a totally new breed. a cross
          pollination between tulips and
          daisies. i call them todayzees.
                    grace
          todayzees? okay...
grace goes to put them in water.
