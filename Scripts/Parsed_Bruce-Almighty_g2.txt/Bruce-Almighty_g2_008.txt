ext. highway - day
bruce is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. he stares at the
prayer beads with a "thanks alot" look.

                                                          10.



a big accident ahead. bruce looks at his watch, he's
screwed. a person is carried by on a stretcher, bruce is
oblivious.
                       bruce
             this is just my luck.
bruce's beeper sounds.      he checks it.
                        bruce.
             the meeting's starting, perfect...
                  (thinks)
             screw it.
he looks to the right of the car in front of him, then peels
off onto the shoulder, passing tons of cars.
                       bruce
                 (laughs)
             catch you later, lemmings 1 it's
             kill or be killed, only the strong
             survive, no guts, no glory1

bruce pulls over, fumes.
                        bruce
                  (looking heavenward)
             thank you.
