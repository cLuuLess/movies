int. bruce and grace's apartment - night
bruce is pacing, holding an ice pack to his swollen lip.
                    grace
          thank god you're alright.
                    bruce
          god, yeah. let's thank god.
          thanks for everything, lord. i am
          so honored that my horrible demise
          is a part of your loving and
          mysterious plan.
                    grace
          bruce, don't talk like that.
                    bruce
          oh, don't worry, he's not
          listening. if he is he doesn't
          care. have you seen the news
          lately? we got gangs, we got
          drugs, we got corruption. what
          kind of god lets that happen?
          every time we cure a disease he
          comes up with a new one!
              (goes into god character)
          yeah, is this the lab? yeah, it's
          god. they've just come up with a
          treatment for syphilis down there.
          i think it's time to release the
          tainted monkey. oh, and there's a
          guy in ohio who's praying for
          strength and wisdom, blind him and
          cut off his legs.
                    grace
          so god is torturing us?
                    bruce
          think about it, grace. god is all-
          powerful . he could fix everything
          in five minutes if he wanted to.
                    (more)

                                                         29.

                    bruce (cont'd)
          but he doesn't want to. he doesn't
          like me.
sam starts peeing on the rug.

                     bruce
          oh, perfect!
              (to the dog)
          but you're aim isn't so good, i'm
          over herel
                    grace
          bruce, please. this isn't his
          fault.
                    bruce
          of course not.
              (hushed tone)
          it's part of the mysterious plan.
grace puts sam outside. returns, trying to calm bruce.
                    grace
          honey, you're mad right now. it's
          understandable. and what evan did
          was slimy and wrong. but your job
          doesn't matter to me. you matter
          to me. you could've really been
          hurt. i'm just glad you're okay.

                    bruce
          okay? news flash: i'm not okayi
          and i'm not okay with the fact that
          you think everything is okay. i'm
          not okay with a mediocre job. i'm
          not okay with a mediocre apartment.
          i'm not okay with a mediocre life!
bruce angrily swipes at the table knocking the photos and the
photo albums to floor.
                    grace
          is that what you have, bruce?
          a mediocre life? well, i'm sorry
          for being a piece in your mediocre
          puzzle.
                    bruce
          terrific. i'm drowning and you
          throw me a brick!
grace starts to cry.

                                                                  30.



                        bruce
            perfect! i'll have the worst day
            of my life with a side order of
            guilt, please. i-- i don't need
            this.
bruce grabs his keys and heads out.
