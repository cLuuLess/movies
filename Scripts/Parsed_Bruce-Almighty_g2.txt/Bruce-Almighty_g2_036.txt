int. car - night
it's raining now. bruce drives, going nowhere in particular.
his frustration is turning to desperation.
                        bruce
            okay, god. you want me to talk to
            you? then talk back. tell me
            what's going on? what should i
            do? give me a sign...
bruce passes a blinking yellow caution light, doesn't
notice. . .
                      bruce
            i'm right here. speak to me.
a pedestrian stepping into the crosswalk, steps back out of
the way.
                      pedestrian
            slow down, asshole!

bruce is oblivious.
                        bruce
            all i need is some guidance.
            please send me a signal.
a truck transporting various road signs pulls in front of
br uce . f our way s, bli nki ng. the va rie d s igns re ad: yi eld ,
wrong way, dead end, do not enter, stop.

                       bruce
            oh well, i guess you don't care.
bruce spots the prayer beads hanging on the rearview mirror.
                        bruce
            okay, we'll do it your way.
                 (pulls the beads from the
                  mirror)
            lord, i need a miracle. please
            help me.

                                                               31.



he hits a bump and the beads drop to the floor.        bruce
reaches down, fishes for the beads...
                      bruce
           come on, where'd you go?
                (holds them up in triumph)
           ah ha! ahhh!
and bam!11 bruce's car slams into a light post.
