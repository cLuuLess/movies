int. kitchen

grace places breakfast on the table. bruce comes out, fully
dressed with a spring in his step.
                     bruce
          good morning.
                     grace
               (gushy-lovey, sing songy)
          good morning. cooked you grilled
          cheese.
                     bruce
          oo, my favey.
bruce sits, grace sets down his plate, leans close.
                     grace
          last night was just...
                      bruce
          heavenly?
                      grace
          mmm hmm.
bruce enjoys his grilled cheese.
                      grace
          it's funny, but when i woke up this
          morning, it felt like my boobs were
          bigger.
bruce looks away, guilty, trying to be nonchalant.
                     grace
               (holding them up)
          do they look bigger to you?
                     bruce
          huh? ah, no, they, ah, look the
          same to me.

                                                            56.


they aren't.    they are clearly bigger.      she holds them.
                      grace
            they're definitely bigger.      they
            feel huge to me.
bruce throws up his hands.
                       bruce
            you got me. probably just a
            hormonal thing.
                 (takes a quick final bite)
            well, enjoy your breakfast, i've
            gotta run.
                      grace
            where are you going?
he stops, turns. a new confident bruce.
                      bruce
            to get my job back.
