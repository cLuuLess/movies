int. bruce and grace's apartment

debbie is packing items into a box. she sees the photo
albums on the coffee table. she flips through, surprised.
                    debbie
          they're full... you did all this?
bruce nods. debbie looks at bruce, sizing him up.
                    debbie
          you really hurt her, you know.
                      bruce
          i know.
debbie starts to go, but turns back.
                    debbie
          you know what i do before i go to
          sleep every night? i tuck my kids
          in bed, i eat a scoop of ice cream
          and watch conan.

                                                          115.

                     debbie (cont'd)
          you know what grace does? she
          prays. most of the time for you.
this not only touches bruce, but it gives him an idea.
