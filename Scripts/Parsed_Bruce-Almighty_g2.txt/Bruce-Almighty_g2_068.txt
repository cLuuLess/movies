bruce continues    off, as bobby stops cold, adopts an odd
expression, then    his eyes roll up in their sockets, spin all
the war around,    then glow red. little horn bumps push up
from his skull.     he turns instantly demonic.

an overly perky female office worker approaches bobby from
behind.
                     female office worker
          hi, bobby. is there any of that
          split pea soup left?
she is instantly hit in the chest with a stream of green
vomit. a beat and bobby offers out a plastic spoon.
