ext. alley

bruce approaches the gang.
                       bruce
             hey guys, remember me?
the gang members turn to bruce.
                       hood #1
             oh look, it's the hero.
                       hood #2
             hungry for another can of whoop-
             ass?
                        hood #3
             your stereo sounds great in my car,
             man.
he and a couple other gang members laugh and high-five.
                       bruce
             look, i don't want to fight you
             guys. so as soon as you apologize,
             i'll be on my way.
a beat, then the hoods burst out laughing.         a few circle
behind, surrounding bruce.
                       hood #1
             oh, yeah. i'll apologize... the
             day a monkey climbs out of my butt.
                        bruce
             what a coincidence. that's today.
the hood gets a pained look, starts gyrating around, then a
monkey comes climbing out the back of his baggy pants.
the big guy looks at hood #1.
                       big guy
             did that come out of your butt,
             man?
hood #1 faints from shock.
                       bruce
             now i'm going to have to teach the
             rest of you guys a lesson.

                                                         49.



                     hood #2
           yeah, you and whose army?
                     bruce
           just me... and me...
another bruce steps out from behind a stack of crates.
                     bruce
           and me, and me, and me, me, me, me,
           me and me and me.
as bruce talks, duplicate bruce's begin popping out from
various spots, a doorway, hanging down from a fire escape, a
dumpster pops open, six bruce's jump out.
                      bruce
           pile on the rabbit1
t he b ruges conv erge on th e ga ng --

hood #2 is instantly tackled by three bruges --
one bruce kneels down behind a hood, another bruce pushes him
down over his back. the two bruce's high-five --
a hood climbs a fire escape. one bruce gives a hand up to
another bruce, who takes pursuit. another bruce leans out of
a window smashes a potted plant over his head --
on the monkey - screeching, enjoying the excitement

our bruce stands in the middle of the action, happily
watching the mayhem.
                      hood #2
           let's get out of here, manl
hood #2 takes off running, the gang members follow.
                      bruce
           okay guys, kum ba yal
the bruce's jog over, leaping and diving into bruce's body.
                      bruce
           i'll take it from here.
bruce takes a deep breath, opens his mouth wide, releasing a
swarm of locusts --

                                                             50.
