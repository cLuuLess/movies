int. bruce and grace's apartment - day
bruce sits at the computer, looks at the total prayer
requests, his jaw drops. 3 million and growing.
                    bruce
          oh, come on. what a bunch of
          whiners. this is going to suck up
          my whole life.
bruce gets an idea, pulls down a menu on the computer,
highlights "answer all" types in the word "yes" and hits
enter.
the computer takes over, answering each email automatically.
bruce smiles and gets up.
close on - the computer screen

we see the list scroll by, everything from "lost cat" to
"more money" "make me smarter" "make me thinner," etc.
"yes" "send", "yes" "send" and on and on.
