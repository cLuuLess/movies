ext. balcony - continuous
bruce opens the doors, steps onto the balcony. he surveys
the cloudy sky, reaches up with his hand and erases the
clouds, like on a chalkboard.
still not completely satisfied he reaches up toward the moon
and makes a lassoing motion, then begins to pull.
                                          cut to:
outer space - behind the moon
earth far off in the distance - and with a thunderous rumble
the moon starts moving closer to earth.
back to scene
bruce adds a finishing touch by adding several stars with
points of his finger.
grace joins bruce on the balcony and is taken aback by the
perfectly orchestrated sky.
                     grace
          wow, it really cleared up. i've
          never seen the moon that big.
bruce puts his arms around grace from behind.

                                                        53.



                    bruce
          we shouldn't waste it.
bruce starts kissing her neck. grace turns, .they kiss and a
meteor shower lights the sky behind them. the kiss ends.

                    grace
          five minutes.
