bruce is free-falling in full sky diving uniform.
                      bruce
           . . . so remember, it's sky diving
           season at old pete's airfield.
                (grabs the ripcord)
           this is bruce nolan..
                (gives it a tug, doesn't
                 budge)
           my rip cord appears to be a bit
           stuck.
bruce yanks again harder, nothing, then again and the cord
rips free from the suit.

                                                           67.

              this is a very unfortunate turn of
              events. i'm heading toward the
              earth at a very precarious speed...
the cameraman pops his shoot and we see bruce continue to
stream toward the ground below. he falls into a wooded area.
a camera on the ground picks up the coverage, runs through
the brush with other bystanders to find bruce laying on top
of a big, hairy creature.
                         bystanders (o.s.)
              he's okay...what's that?...it's
              bigfoot!...bigfoot broke his
              fall!. . .
bruce stands groggy, points to a dazed bigfoot.
                           bruce
              ah ha!     you are real!
