int. debbie and mike's house - morning
grace's alarm goes off. the radio comes on and it plays a
john cougar mellencamp song. but the lyrics are different.
                     john cougar mellencamp
           here's a little ditty,
           about grace and her man bruce,
           two americans growing up,
           needing to make a truce.
grace's eyes pop open.    is she dreaming?
