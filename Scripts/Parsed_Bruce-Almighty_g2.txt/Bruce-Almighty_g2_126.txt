int. hardware store - day
bobby places three blue home address number tiles on the
counter - all number 6.
                    bobby
              (demonic voice)
          do you have these in red?
bruce walks up behind bobby.
                    bruce
          okay bobby, it's time to come back.
bobby hisses at bruce, turns insanely demonic.

                     bobby
          leave me holy man or i will feed on
          your soul!it

                     bruce
               (casual)
          un-damn you, bobby.
bobby instantly transforms to normal.

                                                        112.


                    bobby
          hey thanks, bruce.
               (holds out a cookie)
          biscotti?
