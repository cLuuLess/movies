ext. city street - night

rain droplets splash on the river where bruce first raged at
god. he stands in the middle of the street, looks up
heavenward, weakly. humble.
                       bruce
             you win. i' m done. please. i
             don't want to do this anymore. i
             don't want to be god.
                  (sighs)
             please, help me.
and with that, the rain stops. the dark clouds slowly open
as beams of light cut through, shining down upon bruce,
birds begin to chirp.adding to this magical moment as. . .
honk1 honki

a mac truck slams through frame, mows bruce down. his spirit
remains in the same spot, looking confused, then streaks up
heavenward.
flying pov

                                                          117.



shooting heavenward like a missile, through the clouds,
through the sky to...

a huge white room - no walls, just white as far as the eye
can see. the flooring is the whitest of white puffy clouds.
bruce finds himself standing there. he looks around and when
he turns behind him, he sees god. floating on nothing, as
though sitting in the most royal throne.
                     bruce
          am i...?
                     god
          you can't expect to kneel down in
          the middle of a highway and live to
          talk about it.
                    bruce
          but why? why now?
                     god
          i work in mysterious ways, son.
a beat as bruce takes everything in.
                     bruce
          you knew it all along. you knew if
          i got everything i wanted, i would
          ruin my life.
god doesn't respond, just listens.
                     bruce
          so i'm dead... okay. if this is
          what you want. okay, okay...
god holds up the prayer beads, tosses them to bruce. bruce
looks at the beads, then up at god, puzzled.
                     god
          go ahead, use 'em.
                     bruce
          alright... i've learned that i
          don't know as much i thought i
          did...
                     god
          boy, you can say that again.
                     bruce
          hey, i'm praying here.

                                                        118.


                       god
          sorry, go.
                    bruce
          if i could have just one thing in
          the world. it would be for grace
          to live a happy, joyful life. and
          that she finds someone...
              (getting emotional as he
               realizes what he's
               saying)
          ...that she finds someone that will
          treat her with the love and respect
          that she so deserves.
god smiles the most satisfied of smiles.
                      god
          now that is a prayer.
               (beat)
          well, i better get on that one.
          see ya, bruce.
off bruce's puzzled reaction he drops through the clouds --
falling pov - back down towards earth, back through the
clouds, and right into another white room where...
bruce eyes open and he gasps for breath.    the prayer beads
still clutched tightly in his hand.
two doctors stop giving bruce cpr, see that his vitals have
returned. . .
                       nurse
          he's back!
                     intern
          bp 40 over 110 and rising.
                       doctor #1
               (to bruce) -
          bruce? can you hear me?
               (bruce nods)
          we almost lost you there.
wider angle - the white room is a hospital room - bruce is
heavily bruised and bandaged.
                     doctor #1
          you lost a lot of blood. it wasn't
          easy to find a match - you're a
          very rare blood type.

                                                      119.



bruce looks to the blood bag, sees "a/b positive" written on
the side.
close on bruce - thinking, his mind racing

                     bruce
               (groggy whisper)
          a/b positive...
                    doctor #2 (o.s.)
          you should thank god for donors.
          we don't have a lot of that type on
          hand.
                    nurse
          there's your angel now.
bruce turns toward the hospital door and sees...
grace

a cotton swab taped to her arm. now he remembers where he
heard of that blood type.
                     grace
               (re: her swab)
          i hear that all of this winds up in
          a warehouse somewhere. but you
          know me, i'm a sucker for this
          stuff.
the doctors give grace the nod to enter as they go, leaving
the two of them alone. grace tentatively approaches.
                     grace
          i don't even know what i'm doing
          here. but... when i heard that
          you'd been in an accident and that
          you might not make it. . .
she starts to cry.
                    bruce
          hey, i'm okay.
                    grace
          does it hurt?
                     bruce
          only when i talk., and smile... and
          y'know, exist in general.

                                                         120.



grace laughs. that's one thing bruce could always do, is
make her laugh. grace spots the prayer beads in bruce's
hand, raises his arm.
                    grace
          oh my gosh, you still have those?
bruce looks at the prayer beads, then looks at grace. he
remembers his prayer to god and the emotion wells within him
                    grace
          what is it?
                    bruce
          nothing. it's just really nice to
          see you.
she goes to him, bruce sits up a bit and they embrace.
                                          dissolve to:
