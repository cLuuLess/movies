setting up for the report. the falls roar behind him and the
mate of the mist sightseeing boat is in the b.g.

intercut day care and falls

                    debbie
              (cheery)
          no, it's debbie. the sister who's
          life you're not wasting.
                    grace
          hey.
grace grabs the phone.

                    debbie
              (feigns innocent)
          what?
                    grace
          sorry, honey. my sister seems to
          think she's my mother. where are
          you?
                    bruce
              (flying high)
          oh, a little place called the
          winners circle. i'm at the falls
          doing a "live" report.
                    grace

                    bruce (cont'd)
          they're seeing if i can think on my
          feet, like you might have to do in
          a live news anchor situation.
                    grace
          oh, my gosh.
                    bruce
          this is happening for us, grace.
          what we've always talked about.
          jack practically came out and told
          me.
grace quickly switches gears.   she experienced the premature-
celebration before.
                    grace
          wait, what do you mean practically?
                    bruce
          well, he didn't spell it out, but
          this is exactly what happened to
          susan ortega right before she was
          bumped up to the desk.
                    grace
              (being cautious)
          i just want to make sure we're not
          getting too ahead of ourselves.
                    bruce
          i totally agree, but in the mean
          time you should start thinking
          about what coast you want to live
          on.
ally interrupts, indicating the time.
                    bruce
          oh, they're calling me, i gotta go.
                    grace
