int. beauty salon - day

grace lies in full body wrap, while debbie is in the process
of being wrapped by margarita, a rather ruff spanish salon
attendant.
                    debbie
          so this is what success buys you.
                    grace
          i guess.
              (wiggling around)
          i feel like a human taquito.
                    debbie
          well, thank mr. exclusive for me.
          he's on a quite a roll. what'd he
          do make a deal with the devil?
                     grace
          and he's taking me out tonight to
          dinner at chez l'amour.
                     debbie
          well, la-ti-da. mike's idea of a
          romantic evening is chez sizzler.
margarita pulls the wrap tightly around debbie.
                     debbie
               (to margarita)
          what does this do again?
                    margarita
          ests para su grasa.
                    debbie
          grasa? doesn't that mean fat?

                                                          71.



                       grace
          afraid so.
debbie eyes margarita.
                    grace
              (gushing)
          so, bruce said and i quote:
          "prepare yourself for an amazing
          evening that will change our lives
          forever."
margarita reaches debbie's waist and yanks tightly.
                     debbie
          good - you wouldn't want to leave
          any spare oxygen in there.
               (back to grace)
          wait a second, you don't think he's
          going to propose, do you?
                    grace
          i don't think anything.
                       debbie
          you do. you think he's going to
          propose.
                       grace
          well, he's always said when he gets
          his career together, you know...
          and his career is more than
          together. i mean, come on, chez
          l'amour. change our lives...
                       debbie
          i don't know, hun. i mean, i like
          bruce but that man's priority list
          is him, him, him, then him some
          more and then you.
                     grace
          well, he just might surprise you.
                     debbie
          that's what i'm worried about.
               (re: margarita)
          careful, you missed a spot of free
          flowing circulation.
margarita senses the attitude and pulls tighter. debbie
reacts.

                                                         72.


                    debbie
          that'd do it.
margarita motions for debbie to lay down and leaves.    debbie
struggles to lay down.
                    debbie
          let's see, how do i--
debbie slides to the ground, grace cracks up, gets up to
help, but also in mummy wrap, topples on top of her. they
both laugh and struggling to get up.
hearing the ruckus, margarita enters and gasps.
                       margarita
          lesbianas1
grace and debbie crack up harder.
                    debbie
          hey, i'll take that over fat...
margarita tries to pull them up, but falls too.
                    margarita
          no sexo, no sexol
grace and debbie can't stop laughing.
