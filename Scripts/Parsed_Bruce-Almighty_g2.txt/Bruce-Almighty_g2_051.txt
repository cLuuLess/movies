ext. city streets - dusk
bruce struts down the street the embodiment of confidence.
he turns shooting a finger at a fire hydrant, it blasts
water. kids run off their front steps, start playing.
a pretty girl in a dress, comes' walking toward him. as she
passes he blows a little air out of the corner of his mouth
and turns to watch her skirt fly up.

          and he saw that it was good.
he spots a    mannequin in a store window display, wearing a
cool, casu   al outfit. he closes his eyes. when he opens
them, he's   wearing the cool new outfit and the mannequin is
dressed in   his clothes. he checks his reflection. . . better.
bruce rounds the corner, sees the same gang that beat him up,
hanging out in the alley.
