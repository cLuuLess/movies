int. chez l'amour - night
a waiter pours the first trickle of wine into bruce's glass.
bruce whiffs it, tastes it.
                    bruce
          very good. if you run out just
          bring me some water, i'll take it
          from there.
grace looks over the menu as bruce notices people at various
tables eyeing him. he glances up to a ceiling light and
redirects it with his mind, so it spotlights him in golden
light.
two cute girls with dates smile and wave.     he waves back.
                       grace
          should we ask for a more private
          table?

                                                         73,



                    bruce
          huh? oh, no this is fine right
          here.
bruce looks at grace lovingly.      he takes her hand.
                    bruce
          i was going to wait until after the
          meal, but i think it's going to
          just bust out of me if i don't do
          it now.
grace beams, looks at bruce with total love.
                       bruce
          you ready?
                    grace
              (nervous)
          i think so.
                    bruce
          i got anchor.
grace's face falls.    she does her best to cover.
                       bruce
          evidently, they're having problems
          with evan. he's finishing up the
          week and i go live monday.
                    grace
          that's great, honey.
          congratulations. wow. so that's
          what's tonight is about?
                       bruce
          well, yeah. grace, i got anchor.
          we got anchor!
she's having a hard time covering her let down.
                     bruce
               (noticing her flat
                reaction)
          what's the matter?
                       grace
          well, to be honest, i thought that
          maybe tonight, you--
the two cute girls interrupt, approach bruce.

                                                                       74.



                                  cute girl #1
                       i'm sorry, but we had to come over.
                       we just think you're amazing and...
                                 cute girl #2
                       well, we can't believe it's you!
             they both laugh, bruce enjoys the attention.
                                  bruce
                            (laughing along)
                       yep, it's me.
                                  cute girl #1
                       can we get a picture with you?
                                  bruce
                       well, sure.
                            (glances to grace)
                       just one second, hun.
                            (leans to grace)
                       fans. we better get used to this,
                       huh?
             grace sits watching the two girls take turns sitting on
             bruce's lap, taking pictures. sees bruce relishing in the
             attention. one girl gives bruce a peck on the cheek and they
r"ss!w^w!s
             leave. grace is clearly upset.
                                  grace
                       you have lipstick on your face.
                                  bruce
                       oh, thanks...
                                 grace
                       bruce, we need to talk. i thought
                       we had an understanding--
             suddenly, the whispers start again. bruce looks around,
             figures it's coming from the restaurant patrons.
                                 bruce
                       wow. it's kind of loud in here.
             grace looks around the quiet romantic setting.
                                 grace
                       what are you talking about? it's
                       not loud.
             the whispers grow in volume.

                                                         75.



                     bruce
          geez...
               (shouts to the restaurant)
-----   - could you ~keep tt downl---  --
                     grace
          bruce, this isn't funny.
                       bruce
               (talking loud .over the
                "racket")
          what? would you excuse me for a
          second?
he gets up and darts off.
