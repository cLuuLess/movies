int. upscale home - moments later
bruce walks in, susan is waiting for him.
                     susan
           i was right. she couldn't handle
           the fire.
                                                             *
bruce looks at susan with disgust, then glances to a fire
alarm on the wall, mentally triggers it. the sprinklers turn
on, as well. people scream, rush toward the exit.
bruce sits down on the sofa, being rained on by the
sprinklers, alone. he finally plops back and god is sitting
next to him.
                     god
          enjoying your party? yeah, nothing
          like spending time with some real
          frien ds. any s hrimp left ?
                     bruce
           grace left me.
                     god
           i know.
                     bruce
               (certain)
          she'll take me back.
               (uncertain)
          will she take me back?
                     god
          would you take you back?
bruce mulls this over,- then...
                     bruce
          how do you make someone love you
          when you can't effect free will?
                     god
          welcome to my world, son. you come
          up with an answer to that one, you
          let me know.
off of bruce thinking...
                                            cut to:

                                                          98.
