100  int. speck's house - attic_- continuing                      100

     mackelway looks around: lots of dusty junk around here - old
     clothes, mementoes.

     ...and one more trunk. a steamer-trunk. huge. and locked.
     looks just like the one in that drawing rendered by o'ryan...

     mackelway races for it. takes out his gun, uses the butt-end
     to bust the lock off. throws it open.

     ...as we hear the sound of those fold-out steps, being tugged
     down from the second-floor hallway. and:
                         abilene cop #1 (o.s.)
               freeze, asshole!

     the cop is just ten feet away, most of him still concealed by
     those steps - gun trained right on us.

     but mackelway seems utterly untroubled.

                         mackelway
                    (calmly)
               it's okay, fellas. fbi.

                         abilene cop #1
               i'll bet.

     mackelway drops his gun, kicks it toward the cop, who doesn't
     quite know what to make of that.

     also confusing him is the odd smile playing its way across
     mackelway's face. but we understand it now:

     the inside of that steamer-trunk is filled with body parts:
     bagged, stacked, and sealed in ziplocs...

     powdered lime is sprinkled on them.

     mackelway stares, at once satisfied and sickened. cop #1 can
     be heard, approaching across the attic floor. his gun is
     drawn...

     ...until he too sees what's in there.

                         abilene cop #1 (cont'd)
               oh jesus christ...

                                                              cut to:

     ...a grammar-school class picture: of barney fulcher and his
     2nd graders, sitting on a mantle. we are...
