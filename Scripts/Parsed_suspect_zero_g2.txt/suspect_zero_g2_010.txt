10   ext. atop the ravine - continuing                             10

     the driver, jumbo, is operating the winch from a hydraulic
     handle on the back of the truck. mackelway barrels in:

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               what the fuck're you doing?!

                         jumbo
               what's it look like, bud?

     mackelway reaches past jumbo and hits the "stop" button
     himself. the winch shuts down. mackelway turns. a handful of
     local cops stand atop this ravine, watching.

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               you guys ever heard of evidentiary
               procedure?

     no one replies. charlton approaches. mackelway tightens,
     expecting a reprimand for overstepping his bounds.

                         mackwelway (cont'd)
               sorry, sir. there wasn't time.

     charlton eyes the car. then mackelway.

                         charlton
               did the right thing, agent mackelway.
               let's have a look.

     charlton starts down the embankment. mackelway doesn't,
     hanging back as he eyes the tracks this buick made before
     tumbling. something about them...

     he pulls a small camera from his pocket, a minox. snaps off a
     few photos of the scene - the buick, the ravine, those tracks,
     some footprints alongside them.

     then he heads down the 15-foot embankment.
