29   ext. street - matamoros - night - mackelway's flashback       29
     we're running, dashing between two buildings of chipped-adobe,
     hearing nothing but the sound of our own breathing and the
     thuds of our own heavy feet.

     this is matamoros, mexico, a shit-hole of a border town.
     squalor and sin. we find a drunk mexican teen. he nods: "this
     is the place," and sticks out his palm.
