154  int. fbi office - o'ryan room - later night                  154

     ten minutes have passed, but mackelway has seen a revelation.
     we can read it on his face.

     he eyes the map... which has now been stuck with over 1,000
     black pins, one for each city with a have you seen me to its
     credit.

     and those black pins, seen from a distance, form a pattern we
     weren't expecting - something that never quite took shape when
     the pins were yellow.

     looks like a big black wave. and that's just what it is.

     1,000 black dots conspiring to form the same exact shape that
     o'ryan had painted onto the wall of his room - a massive wave
     of darkness, gathering strength.

     but this black wave is consuming america...

     mackelway stares at it: awed, even a bit frightened. the thing
     seems vast, unstoppable... a black wave - pure malevolence,
     covering the states like a fog.

     one blue dot lies in its center: that blue pin, in the heart
     of greenville, texas. then, piercing the silence:

                         charlton (o.s.)
               got one of those pins in denton yet?

     mackelway turns. charlton leans in the doorway.

                         charlton (cont'd)
               o'ryan was spotted there tonight. took a
               squad-car and a side-arm from a state
               trooper. 'bout an hour later a five-year
               old boy was abducted, roughly a mile up
               the interstate.

     it's 3 a.m. what's this guy doing here?

                         charlton (cont'd)
               the vehicle was found in an abandoned
               lot. we're establishing a perimeter
               around the city now.

                         mackelway
                    (knows already)
               but the trooper wasn't hurt...

                         charlton
               what makes you so sure?

                         mackelway
               professional courtesy.

     charlton's at a loss... until mackelway gestures to the table,
     where he has laid out o'ryan's entire fbi file. every memo,
     citation, letter, i.d. picture. 150 pages.

     charlton eyes it, calmly. he's not going to let his jaw drop,
     not with mackelway watching. so he just nods.

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               is that... possible, sir? an agent can
               just be deleted?

                         charlton
               looks like it.

     mackelway pauses. it's a depressing reality...

                         mackelway
               i couldn't understand it before - pushing
               speck's car onto the state line. makes
               sense now. he wanted to make the case
               federal. he's drawing us in.

                         charlton
               why would he do that?

                         mackelway
               so we'd be paying attention when he found
               suspect zero.

                         charlton
               ya know what? i'm getting extremely tired
               of hearing that word. in fact, that's
               gonna be policy from now on. no zero.
                         mackelway
               sir, profile the guy. he's straight outta
               quantico. all he's doing is working a
               case, like we would. he's not kidnapping
               little kids - he's chasing the guy who's
               doing the kidnapping! look at the map!

                         charlton
               what're you saying - that all these
               abductions are the work of one guy? do
               you know how fucking insane that is?!
                    (over mackelway)
               not let's try something that actually
               makes sense: he sends in these faxes,
               picks off three scumbags. for what?! so
               we'll think exactly what you're thinking
               right now - that we've got a friend out
               there, somebody willing to take out the
               garbage for the rest of us. and it's all
               horse-shit!

                         mackelway
               what if it isn't? what if there really is
               a zero out there and o'ryan's the one guy
               who's got a shot at him?

                         charlton
                    (just blew his top)
               fuck's sake, mackelway - when did you
               start buying into this guy?!

     a beat. mackelway lets the silence hover.

                         mackelway
                    (quietly)
               he's smarter than we are.

                         charlton
               speak for yourself.

     charlton heads for the door.

                         mackelway
               sir? what if i told you i knew how to
               catch him?

     charlton stops. turns.

                         charlton
               do you?

                         mackelway
               and what if i told you that the way i'd
               catch him involved sitting in a dark
               room, with nothing in front of me but a
               pad of paper... until i'd tapped into
               some kind of... energy out there. the
               collective unconscious. something. if i
               told you i thought i could target and
               locate him, without ever leaving this
               building, what would you say?

                         charlton
               i'd say you'd watched too many "x-files."

                         mackelway
               y'ever heard of a project called
               "icarus," sir?

                         charlton
               no.

     mackelway tosses over a few pages from o'ryan's file.

                         mackelway
               agents, trained to "see" distant
               locations using nothing but the mind.
               they called it remote viewing.

     charlton eyes the pages without comment.

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               army stole it from the soviets. the
               bureau stole it from the army - used it
               to track serial killers.
                    (a beat)
               experimental program. o'ryan was the
               first agent they recruited.

                         charlton
               good for him.

                         mackelway
               voodoo, right? pure bullshit.
                    (charlton's waiting)
               ...except, it worked. it's how he drew
               this:
     mackelway's referring to that drawing: a steamer-trunk, filled
     with ghastly ziploc bags:

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               he'd never been in that house before. he
               just saw what was in there - the bureau
               taught him how... same one that deleted
               him. same one that's trying to catch him
               now... does anything about all this
               strike you as odd?

     charlton studies him, a long beat, measuring him... then:

                         charlton
               i'm going to denton at oh-six-hundred.
               you can take the day off.

     with that, he's gone - leaving mackelway alone in here.
     nothing to look at but that black wave... he hears charlton,
     leaving the building.

     he slams another vicoden, then hears a phone ring. fuck it.
     he's not moving. let voice mail get it.

     ...until he hears the sound of a fax coming in.

     he rises. follow him:
