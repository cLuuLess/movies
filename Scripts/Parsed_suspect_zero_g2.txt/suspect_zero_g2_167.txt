177  int. mackelway's yukon - continuing                          177

     mackelway gets in, hits the ignition. reaches for his cel-
     phone. starts to dial.

                         o'ryan
                    (disappointed)
               awfully conventional - don't ya think?

     mackelway pauses.

                         mackelway
               huh?

                         o'ryan
               apprehend the fugitive, then call it in
               for your pat on the head.

                         mackelway
               sorry to disappoint you.

     mackelway continues to dial.

                         o'ryan
               i'll get over it.
                    (flat)
               but i'm not too sure that little boy
               will.

     bang. that just stopped mackelway, mid-dial.

                         mackelway
                    (minor test)
               what little boy?

                         o'ryan
               the one from the diner, in denton.

                         mackelway
               you know where he is?

                         o'ryan
               i can find him.

                         mackelway
               how?

                         o'ryan
               same way i found starkey, and speck, and
               fulcher... and you.

     that rang a bell.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               i need someplace quiet - someplace i can
               concentrate... and your assurance that
               once he's located, we go get him
               together.

                         mackelway
               i can't do that.

                         o'ryan
               then i can't help you.

     mackelway, disgusted, pulls out of the lot.
