175  ext. parking lot - resuming                                  175

     he hits a bottleneck of people at the entrance. but he bursts
     through, runs into the dirt parking lot, around cars and big-
     rigs, then turns a corner and:

     ...runs smack into benjamin o'ryan.

     the shock is so total it takes each of them a moment to
     recover from it. but here he is. o'ryan, five feet away.

     mackelway's speechless, still trying to recalibrate himself. a
     second ago he was chasing a possible zero. now he's face to
     face with o'ryan.

     and o'ryan isn't running. in fact, he almost seems amused.

                         o'ryan
               well, well... must be quite a moment for
               you. congratulations.

     mackelway still hasn't spoken, until:

                         mackelway
               what're you doing here?

                         o'ryan
               waiting for you.

     ...which is when mackelway realizes that he is standing right
     in front of vic's rig.

     but he wasn't expecting what comes next:

     vic has returned to the rig, with a woman beside him. turns
     out, she's his wife. vic opens the passenger-side door,
     unclasps that five year-old kid from his seat.

                         five year-old
               mommy!

     the kid dives into the woman's arms.

                         woman
               morning, baby!

                         vic
               i told you she'd be here.
                    (to woman)
               he's been a brat all morning.

     mother hugs son... which means that mackelway has misread
     things, badly.

     and o'ryan is a witness to it - hence the grin.

                         mackelway
                    (at o'ryan)
               hands up.

     o'ryan raises his hands. mackelway reaches for his cuffs.

                                                              cut to:
