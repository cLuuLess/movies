68   int. a hospital room - morning                                68

     mackelway's head is ringing. feels like he can hear
     electricity in the walls around him. slowly, he awakens. above
     him are fluorescent lights. monitors blink...

     fran is here. so's charlton. mackelway tries to sit up. the
     shock of pain from his chest stops him.

                         fran
               how ya doin'?

     mackelway half-nods. his chest is bandaged.

                         charlton
               we're gonna need everything you can
               remember about this guy, tom. physical
               description, any kind of distinguishing
               characteristics.

     that was terse. charlton looks pretty pissed-off.

                         mackelway
                    (scratchy)
               where is he?

                         charlton
               the suspect fled. couple janitors walked
               in on it.
                    (before mack can ask:)
               they're fine. but the description they
               gave of him wasn't worth a damn.

     mackelway nods.

                         charlton (cont'd)
               case you're curious the real professor
               daitz is on sabbatical, out of the
               country. we can't find him.
                    (mackelway nods)
               whose idea was it to meet there?

                         mackelway
               his, sir.

                         charlton
               uh-huh. did he ask you to come alone?

                         mackelway
               no, sir.

                         charlton
               but you figured you'd get a bigger pat on
               the head if you wrapped this whole thing
               up without any help - is that it?

     the truth? charlton has him pegged. but:

                         fran
               sir, i'm the one who took the call. agent
               mackelway was acting under the assumption
               that i'd already checked the guy out.
               we're both to blame.

     hold it. that was a major exaggeration, if not an outright
     lie. mackelway eyes her, thrown. she's poker-faced.

     charlton, however, seems unmoved...

                         charlton
               did agent mackelway attend the interview
               unaccompanied?

                         fran
                    (reluctantly)
               yes, sir.

                         charlton
               then whose fuck-up is it?

     mackelway eyes her: "thanks for trying." she nods.

                         mackelway
                    (at charlton)
               it was... poor judgment, sir.

                         charlton
               you wanna work alone, start your own
               agency.

     mackelway can do nothing but nod. then, bailing him out,
     another composite artist enters, tools in hand. charlton
     sighs, frustrated.

                         charlton (cont'd)
                    (re: composite artist)
               let's get you two started.

     composite artist is ready to begin...

                                                              cut to:
