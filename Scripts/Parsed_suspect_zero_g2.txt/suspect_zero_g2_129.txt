134  ext. unidentified play area - same                           134

     the sounds of that wave become fainter, receding to the
     background, giving way to that sound of laughter, and the
     squeaking of a play-set swing.

     moment to crystallize before us. but then it sharpens:

     we're in the play area of a truck-stop diner, but it feels
     like we're looking at it through a broken lens. the images
     appear spherical to us, surrounded by darkness.

     before us a 5-year old plays on a swing. call him charlie.
