195  ext. ranch house - entry - continuing                        195

     delia stands in the open doorway: an old blind lady, talking
     to the dark rainy street. that confuses them.

     ...until we hear the rumble of an 18-wheel truck.

     it turns a corner onto this street. mackelway turns now...

     we've seen this truck before. a monstrous, rolling beast. and
     mackelway straightens, reaching for his sidearm. behind him,
     delia smiles excitedly, almost dancing.

     but that smile soon leaps from her face... as she hears the
     sound of that 18-wheeler, braking abruptly, its tires locking-
     up on the wet road.

     mackelway gets a look at the driver now - a wiry, sinewy man
     of 35... let's call him zero.

     their eyes lock - until zero throws his rig into gear again
     and begins to rumble down the street.

                         delia (cont'd)
                    (confused)
               daryl? honey?

     no answer. that truck is rumbling away. mackelway turns,
     racing for the yukon, leaving delia at the door.
