127  int. hope house - o'ryan's former room - resuming            127

     mackelway scratches more of the white paint off of that wall.
     more blackness appears beneath it. then, a sound behind him.
     he turns.

     the door to this room just shut; someone outside must've
     pushed it. he keeps scratching at the paint.

     lightning rages outside. we pull back, away from that wall,
     which gives us the opportunity to see something that mackelway
     is too close to the wall to see for himself:

     there is indeed an image beneath that thin coat of white
     paint. it is the shape of a vast, black wave. a hand-painted
     image as large as this wall itself.

     mackelway seems tiny by comparison, and the mere inch of black
     that he has uncovered so far seems infinitesimal.

     in fact, it almost look as if the wave is poised to swallow
     him whole... and he can't even see it.

     but we can. must've taken o'ryan days to paint something this
     large. a vast, black wave. evil itself...

     and mackelway, without meaning to, is about to unleash it.
