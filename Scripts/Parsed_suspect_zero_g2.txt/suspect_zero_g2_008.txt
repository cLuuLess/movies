8    int. "fax room" - continuing                                   8

     a former closet, converted into useful space. five fax
     machines sit on stands, sharing a surge protector. one fax
     machine is printing. mackelway approaches it.

     six pieces of paper await him. the first is a top-sheet,
     written by hand: "attention: agent thomas mackelway, fbi
     resident agency - wichita falls." no sender named.

     he looks beneath the top sheet - at page one of the fax.

     a young boy stares back at him, his face photostatically
     copied. across the top, also-handwritten: "have you seen me?"
     at the bottom of the sheet, typed, we read:

     "jason corey, age 14. ht. 5'1", wt. 130, eyes brn, hair brn.
     last seen: riverside, ca. date of disappearance: 10-16-99."

     mackelway eyes the face, then the vitals. no idea why this was
     sent to him. then he looks at page two.

     a young woman stares back at him this time. another faxed
     photo. another "have you seen me?" scrawled across the top of
     it. and, at the bottom of the sheet:

     "anna casitas, age 22. ht. 5'6", wt. 125, eyes brn, hair blk.
     last seen: macon, ga. date of disappearance: 5-6-00."

     the other three faxes are more of the same: pictures and
     vitals. faces. facts. "have you seen me?"

     he looks at the bottom of the transmissions, finds the fax
     number of the sender. dials it. all he hears back is the loud
     grainy shriek of a dedicated fax line.

     he eyes the faxes again. it's not alarming, but it's odd. then
     charlton emerges from his office, shouting:

                         charlton
               mackelway! you gonna sit on your ass all
               day, or do you wanna do something?

     mackelway's out of this room in an instant.

                                                              cut to:
