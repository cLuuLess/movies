99   int. speck's house - second story - continuing                99

     a tiny hallway, with four doors. up ahead, dangling from the
     ceiling, is a tiny rope which promises a set of hidden fold-
     out stairs... and an attic.

     mackelway tugs on the rope. the fold-out stairs drop down out
     of the ceiling. then he hears:

                         neighbor lady (o.s.)
               he's inside! he's inside! went in through
               the back!

     ...which means he has mere seconds before this all blows to
     hell. so he climbs up those fold-out stairs.

     the two abilene cops now circle the house, entering through
     the back-porch door, just as mackelway did.

     he pulls up the folding stairs. maybe the guys'll do a half-
     assed search and then leave...
