118  int. mackelway's apartment - entry - continuing              118

     the door bursts open. the greasy bag and the soda fall to the
     floor. mackelway hurries to a phone, clutching that file. he
     dials hurriedly.

119  intercut with/int. fran's car - same                         119

     we're in a parking lot outside a wal-mart. fran's just thrown
     a bag into her ford taurus. her cel-phone rings. she grabs it.

                         fran (into cel)
               kulok.

                         mackelway (into phone)
               he really was fbi.

                         fran
               huh?

                         mackelway
               o'ryan. he left his file on my doorstep.
               fran, he was fbi.

     he can barely believe it himself, but we get a look at what
     was in that file now; pages are splayed across mackelway's
     coffee table:

     a copy of an fbi i.d. badge, xeroxed memoes, test scores,
     citations, evaluations, reports. the entire career of special
     agent benjamin o'ryan... in black and white.

                         fran
               that's impossible.

                         mackelway
               i'm look at his whole history!
               citations, letters of commendation, even
               his fucking test scores from quantico.
               the guy was an agent.

                         fran
               i don't believe it.

                         mackelway
               listen to me--

     then we hear a beep. call-waiting. great.

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               shit! hold on.

     that irritated her. mackelway clicks over.

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               yes?

                         o'ryan (thru phone)
               read anything interesting lately?

     mackelway's eyes go wide.

                         mackelway
               where are you?

     click. o'ryan's just hung up.

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               shit!

     he stares at the phone, then clicks over again, re-connecting
     to fran.

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               that was him.

                         fran
               he called you at home?

                         mackelway
               yes.

     beep. call-waiting again.

                         fran
               jesus. call me back.

     mackelway clicks over again without saying goodbye.

                         mackelway (into phone)
               o'ryan?

                         o'ryan (thru phone)
               i've found him, you know.

                         mackelway
               who?

                         o'ryan
               zero.

                         mackelway
               zero's a myth. you made him up.

                         o'ryan
               myths don't kidnap little boys. do they?

                         mackelway
               do you?

     sounds like o'ryan just laughed... then, another curve:

                         o'ryan
               was she pretty?

                         mackelway
               huh?

                         o'ryan
               i could hear her moaning, right under the
               navajo chanting. whole thing was
               downright tribal. what's she look like?

     that was unsettling. very. mackelway looks around feeling
     violated, feeling "watched." he draws the blinds. double bolts
     the front door. runs his hand under the window frame for any
     kind of wire tapping.

     but mackelway won't allow himself to over-react. not now, with
     o'ryan on the phone.

                         mackelway
                    (calmly)
               you tell me.

     o'ryan laughs. he liked that.

                         o'ryan
               fair enough. we'll stick to business:
               how'd ya like my old room?

                         mackelway
               huh?

                         o'ryan
               "hope house." you were there.

     how the hell did he know that? it's unsettling.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               dyson re-paint it?
                    (no reply)
               my room. did he re-paint it?

                         mackelway
               yeah. white.

                         o'ryan
               ...but you saw what was underneath, of
               course.

                         mackelway
               no. tell me about it.

                         o'ryan
               no. you tell me.

     click. o'ryan just hung up. mackelway stares at the phone.

                                                              cut to:
