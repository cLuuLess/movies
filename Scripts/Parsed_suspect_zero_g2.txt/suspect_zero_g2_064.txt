     mackelway enters. the lab is dark. he throws on every light
     switch within reach... and finds himself standing over the
     shards of what used to be a glass beaker.

     so he's in the right place. he scans it: five rows of work-
     stations, ten microscopes per row, each with a sink beside it.
     lining the walls are wide cabinets.

     but there's also a mini-library down here: four rows of
     bookshelves, housing medical journals. these are the "stacks" -
     perfect for hiding behind.

     he plunges in. row #1. doesn't see anyone. then row #2, row
     #3, row #4. okay, the stacks check out...

     he walks along the rows of work-stations, scanning, crouching,
     nudging open cabinets. one has been opened:

     bottles of solutions sit inside it. and a jar that's been
     unsealed: it's got gauze pads in it...

     in the back of the room, an instructor's desk awaits. it's
     tall enough to hide beneath. mackelway slinks around it.
     kneels down, looking into darkness...

     then, a noise. the front door of this lab just swung open...
     and o'ryan just bolted out. fuck.
