209  ext. service road - dawn                                     209

     hours have passed. dozens of law enforcement vehicles have
     arrived. sherrifs, feds. zero's rig remains on its side.

     mackelway sits nearby on a curb, his shattered wrist is in a
     sling. up above, the clouds have parted. morning sun streaks
     through. no more rain. fran sits beside him.

     at their feet, in the gutter of this service road, lies a
     discarded milk carton, covered with dust. the face under the
     "have you seen me?" is unknown to us.

     kathleen is nearby, holding charlie tight. cops surround them.

     an unmarked sedan arrives. charlton hurries out of it, making
     a bee-line for mackelway.

                         charlton
               nice work.
                    (mackelway half-nods)
               where is he?

                         mackelway
               sir?

                         charlton
               o'ryan. where is he?
     mackelway rises, studies charlton. there's nothing to say.

     so he extends a hand to fran. she takes it, rising to her
     feet. they leave charlton behind...

     we pull away from them, craning up, taking in this expanse of
     tall wheat, tilting up to that morning sun.

                                                   match dissolve to:

     ...an afternoon sun now - blazing white hot. tilt down...
