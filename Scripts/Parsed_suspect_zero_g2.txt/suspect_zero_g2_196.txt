208  ext. wheat field - resuming                                  208

     mackelway and zero wrestle, surrounded and obscured by all of
     that wheat... zero is a monster, and he's got that tire iron.
     mackelway has a busted wrist. hardly a fair fight.

     but mackelway is battling: kicking, clawing, getting in as
     many shots as he can. his shirt rips away from his body,
     exposing that brand-mark. they roll back and forth. until:

                         o'ryan (o.s.)
                    (calmly, firmly)
               up.

     zero freezes. mackelway too. they turn to find:

     o'ryan... who stands here, mackelway's gun in hand.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               up.

     mackelway's relief is total. he pushes zero away, rising. zero
     pulls himself off the ground, chagrinned.

                         zero
                    (re: mackelway)
               glad you're here, man. guy was about to
               kill me.

     o'ryan, without ceremony, puts a bullet through zero's left
     palm. that got mackelway's attention.

     zero howls with pain, his palm gushing. the tire-iron falls to
     the ground. mackelway approaches o'ryan.

                         mackelway
               i'll take it from here.

     he extends his good hand to o'ryan: "the gun." o'ryan pauses.
     then...

                         o'ryan
               are you going to shoot him?

                         mackelway
               give me the gun, o'ryan.

                         zero
               hey, i just surrendered.

                         o'ryan
               shut up.

                         zero
               i surrendered! that's it!

                         o'ryan
               shut up!!!

     o'ryan wheels around, aiming the gun right at zero's face.
     that shuts the guy up in a hurry.

     from that service road now, we hear a line of sirens,
     approaching from a distance. unit after unit.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
                    (quietly now)
               look at him, mack. he's not human
               anymore. go dig up that old lady's
               backyard - you'll find bodies there...
               maybe hundreds of them. of course, ya
               gotta get a warrant first, chain of
               custody's gotta be followed. one breach,
               and he walks.
                    (no reply)
               my way, he's eliminated; the world is rid
               of him. it's a lot closer to justice than
               having some prosecutor tell you you've
               left a tissue sample in the wrong lab.
               isn't it?

                         mackelway
                    (that stung)
               give me the fucking gun!

     o'ryan turns, studies him.

     ...and hands him the gun. just like that.

     mackelway eyes it. o'ryan doesn't say a word, just crosses
     back to zero, and grabs that tire-iron off the ground.

     o'ryan's now standing right behind zero, as:

                         o'ryan
                    (at mackelway)
               you have to understand: none of this was
               arbitrary. we were chosen, you and i.
     whap! o'ryan just swung that tire-iron into zero's rib cage.
     we hear bones crack, and air rushing from the guy's lungs. he
     drops to his knees, gasping.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               i saw us here. you did too.
     thump! another violent swing of that tire-iron, busting up the
     other side of zero's torso. now both sides of his rib-cage
     have shattered. breathing is almost impossible.

     mackelway tightens. his head just began to throb...

                         mackelway
               okay. you made your point.

                         o'ryan
               bullshit! if i'd made my fucking point
               you would've shot him yourself by now!

     another swing of that tire-iron, across the back of zero's
     neck. he crumbles, face down.

     fuck it. mackelway crosses to o'ryan and puts that gun right
     up against the back of o'ryan's head.

                         mackelway
               enough!

     then, an odd thing... o'ryan simply smiles.

     something about having that gun pointed right at him - it's a
     relief.

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               drop it.

                         o'ryan
               or what?

                         mackelway
               just drop it.

                         o'ryan
               would you shoot me?

     that's something mackelway doesn't want to consider.

                         mackelway
               put it down.

                         o'ryan
                    (calmly)
               i want you to think for a second. about
               your destiny. who you are. you're cursed,
               like i am - except you keep running from
               it.
                    (mackelway's silent)
               you hear things. you see things. that's
               why you can't sleep, why your head always
               aches.

     he turns. they are face to face. nothing but that gun between
     them.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               ...and it's why you are going to let me
               kill this animal. and then you're going
               to kill me.

     that threw mackelway badly. o'ryan seizes the moment -
     wheeling around...

     he takes one last swing at zero, like a lumberjack. the tire-
     iron impacts zero's skull with a dull thud, cracking it. he is
     dead.

     mackelway's eyes go wide. whole thing has been a blur.

     o'ryan releases the tire-iron... and drops to his knees like a
     man awaiting execution, his back to mackelway.

     mackelway is silent. stunned. the blood from zero's caved-in
     skull finds its way to o'ryan's knees.

     but o'ryan remains peaceful. calm. ready.

                         mackelway
               get up.

                         o'ryan
               i can't do that, mack. i've seen all this
               already. for months now.

                         mackelway
               get up.

                         o'ryan
               every time, we're in this field: same
               wind, same rain. and you...

     he puts a finger to his head, pretending it's a gun. then he
     pretends to pull the trigger. mackelway gets the idea.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               it's okay. i want you to. i'm begging you
               to.

     mackelway doesn't know what to do. then, making matters worse:

                         fran (o.s.)
                    (aloud)
               mack?

     she's about a hundred yards away... but she'll be here soon
     enough. that puts some heat under o'ryan:

                         o'ryan
               i'm tired, mack.

                         fran (o.s.)
               can you hear me?

     she's 90 yards out now...

                         o'ryan
               pull the trigger...
                    (no reply)
               i'm not going to jail. now pull the
               fucking trigger!

     mackelway's frozen. o'ryan knows it.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               fucking coward.

     o'ryan rises now, facing mackelway.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               some things are not up to us to decide.
               they just exist. they're inevitable. this
               field. this rain. this moment. it has all
               already happened. you know that. you've
               seen it too.

     he shoves mackelway in the chest.

                         fran (o.s.)
               mack?

     she's 70 yards out now...

                         o'ryan
               shut it off for me.

                         mackelway
               i'm not going to kill you, o'ryan.

                         o'ryan
               of course you will. i've seen it.

                         mackelway
               you saw wrong!

                         o'ryan
                    (incredulous)
               that's impossible.

                         fran (o.s.)
               mack? can you hear me?

     50 yards out now. maybe close enough to hear o'ryan's voice...

                         o'ryan
                    (rambling, unraveling)
               you don't understand. those fucking faces
               on that map. they call to me. i see their
               eyes in the dark - they're staring at me:
               "how did you let this happen to me?" but
               that's the thing about them - they're
               like pictures. they never blink. they
               just...stare, and always at me. that's my
               destiny, do you see? i didn't help them
               when they needed me and this is my
               penance. fine. i accept it. but i'm
               opting out now, ya get it? i can't stand
               this anymore! i wanna close my eyes for
               once and see something other than
               torture.
                    (mackelway's expressionless)
               it's not a bad start, mack. we've made
               the world a little safer now. speck,
               fulcher, starkey, now zero. we've made
               justice. but i get some too. you have to
               end all this for me. that's why you're
               here. it's your destiny.

                         mackelway
               stop telling me about my fucking destiny!

                         o'ryan
                    (again)
               but i've seen it!

                         mackelway
               open your eyes, o'ryan! here i am,
               standing here. i'm not shooting you.
               doesn't that fucking tell you something?
               you're a guy with a skill. period. they
               taught you more than they should've. i'm
               sorry about that... but you're not god.
               you can't see everything.
                         o'ryan
               yes i can! and you can too! that's why i
               chose you!

                         fran (o.s.)
               mack?

     mackelway's not budging. o'ryan can see that.

                         o'ryan
                    (re: tire-iron)
               fine. i'll make it easy for you:

     o'ryan picks up that tire-iron. mackelway sees what's coming.
     o'ryan swings the tire-iron as mackelway backs out of its
     range.

                         mackelway
               put the fucking thing down, o'ryan.

     o'ryan keeps pursuing. another swing. mackelway keeps backing
     up. the swing misses.

                         o'ryan
               look. it's perfect. won't even need a
               hearing this way. you apprehended the
               suspect in the commission of a murder.
               then he turned on you and you fired in
               self-defense.

     o'ryan isn't letting up. and mackelway can't quite fire.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               these things are bigger than you -
               haven't you seen that yet? destiny.
               justice. mercy. they're vast. we're just
               puppets!

                         mackelway
               i'm not going to kill you!

                         o'ryan
               you don't get to decide that!

                         mackelway
               yes i do!

     o'ryan takes one more swing, as:

                         fran (o.s.)
               freeze!!!

     silence. mackelway turns. so does o'ryan.

     there's fran, emerging from the tall wheat, gun trained right
     on o'ryan. his shock is total.

                         fran (cont'd)
               drop it.

     o'ryan doesn't move at first. then, slowly, an ironic smile
     snakes its way across his lips.

                         o'ryan
                    (at mackelway, surprised)
               it's funny. i never saw anyone else out
               here. did you?
     mackelway doesn't answer. he can't. o'ryan eyes him.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               do it, mack. please.
                    (mackelway's silent)
               please. i'm begging you.

     there it was: the very thing mackelway's been hearing all this
     time, the exact words. unsettling as hell.

     ...and we begin to intercut: images of this moment with images
     from those "visions" that have been hinting at this very
     wheatfield since page one...

208a intercut with/ext. wheatfield "fantasy" - same              208a

     tall wheat, wet wind, o'ryan's voice: "i'm begging you..."

     ...mackelway snaps himself out of the vision.

                         mackelway
               i can't.

     that was almost an attempt to make those images stop, to deny
     its awful, inevitable conclusion.

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               i'm not you.

                         o'ryan
               yet.

     two men, neither of them flinching... until o'ryan nods - as
     if to say "good-bye."

     ...more of that vision interrupts now: a gun, rising...

     o'ryan rears back and swings that tire-iron right at
     mackelway's head.

     fran has no choice. she fires.

     o'ryan is hit right between the shoulder blades. the tire-iron
     hits mackelway in the shoulder. o'ryan crumbles to the ground,
     landing face up.

     ...a body slumping to the ground. o'ryan... mackelway stands
     over him...

     now, real-life again, mackelway stands over o'ryan, just as
     o'ryan had always envisioned it. that makes him smile, even as
     he's dying.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
                    (weak)
               thank you.

     then he dies, eyes open. mackelway looks to fran...

                                                         dissolve to:
