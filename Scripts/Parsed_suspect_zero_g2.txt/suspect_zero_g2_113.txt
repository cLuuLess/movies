117  ext. mackelway's apartment - doorway - evening               117

     mackelway approaches, carrying a greasy bag: another frito pie
     and a soda. fumbles with his keys... then he notices
     something, waiting on his doorstep.

     it's a thick file, roughly 150 pages, in a folder. the word
     "mackelway" is written across the front.

     he leans down, opens the folder. the light is spotty out
     here... but it's just strong enough to show us the expression
     on his face: a look of pure awe.
