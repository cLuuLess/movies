115  ext. roadside - continuing                                   115

     trooper eyes him with caution. o'ryan holds his hands in front
     of his chest, keeping them visible to the guy.

                         o'ryan
               officer, i am carrying something that
               could be construed as a weapon. i'd like
               to hand it over, voluntarily, so you
               won't think i'm trying to conceal
               anything. would that be all right?

                         trooper
               what kind of weapon, sir?

                         o'ryan
               it's a hunting knife, right here on my
               hip.

     trooper notes the shape of that large, sheathed knife - the
     one o'ryan butchered starkey with - visible beneath o'ryan's
     shirt.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               i was on my way to the woods. my gear's
               in the trunk.
                    (trooper doubts it)
               would you like me to hand it to you? i
               don't know what the procedure is for
               something like this.

                         trooper
               take the weapon off your hip, place it on
               the ground, and kick it toward me.

                         o'ryan
               happy to.

     o'ryan takes the knife off his hip. the size of it gets some
     attention from the trooper.

                         trooper
               what exactly were you planning on
               hunting, sir?

                         o'ryan
               a fifty-foot shark.

     no reply. o'ryan drops the menacing knife to the ground and
     kicks it toward the trooper.

     trooper, slowly, kneels down to get it - never taking his eyes
     off o'ryan.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               ya know, i used to be in law enforcement
               too.

                         trooper
                    (kneeling)
               that right?

                         o'ryan
               mmm-hmmm. fbi. 'course this was some
               years ago.

     trooper grabs the knife, straightens. examines it.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               psy ops. classified.

                         trooper
               had anything to drink tonight, sir? under
               medication of any kind?

     an 18-wheel truck rumbles by, distracting o'ryan... rendering
     him immobile for a moment.

                         trooper (cont'd)
               sir?

                         o'ryan
               oh. sorry. just found myself wondering
               what was inside that truck.

                         trooper
               sir, i'm going to ask you to hand me the
               keys to your vehicle, please.

                         o'ryan
               of course.

     o'ryan opens the car door. we steal a look inside.

     ...he's got a gun under the front seat.

     in a flash, that gun is in his hands and pointing right at the
     forehead of that trooper.

     trooper knows he's been had. and he knows that he's about to
     die...

                                                              cut to:

116  omit                                                         116
