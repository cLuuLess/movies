88   int. hotel hallway - 5 a.m.                                   88

     mackelway stands outside room 217 at a mariott. he's just
     knocked on the door.

     fran opens it, in a robe. very confused. he looks manic.

                         fran
               what're you--

                         mackelway
               i can't get a read on this guy.

     two minutes ago, she was sound asleep.

                         fran
               huh?

                         mackelway
               why is he sending us all this shit? i've
               got 800 pins in that map, 800 missing
               people. what's he telling us?

     she gets it now: he's on a combination of painkillers and lack
     of sleep. or maybe she can sense where he's been...

                         mackelway (cont'd)
                    (rapid-fire)
               he kills a travelling salesman, then a
               school-teacher. then starkey? it doesn't
               connect.

                         fran
               you're a mess...

                         mackelway
               i'm fine. i'm clear. i just didn't think
               this could wait. fran, this guy is trying
               to point us at something. starkey's part
               of it. but the other two don't connect.

                         fran
               did you drive here?

                         mackelway
               i'm fine! i just need somebody to think
               this through with me! he wanted to meet
               me. it's like he was interviewing me
               somehow. what is that? then he kills
               starkey. so what was he doing with speck
               and fulcher?

                         fran
               you wanna come in?

                         mackelway
               no. no. you come out. get dressed.

                         fran
               out where?

                         mackelway
               i dunno. somewhere. we're right on the
               edge of this thing.

     she studies him. a long beat.

                         fran
               i'm going back to bed. you're welcome to
               the couch if you want. i think you could
               do with some sleep.

     he sags a bit. she reaches for his hand.

                         fran (cont'd)
                    (gently)
               mack...

     just like that, there is contact. their hands. it surprises
     them both.

     he appreciates it, but now's not the time. so he smiles
     thinly, turns, and goes.

     she watches him vanish around a corner.

                                                              cut to:
