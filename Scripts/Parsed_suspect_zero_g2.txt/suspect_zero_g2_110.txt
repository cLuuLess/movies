113  int. stolen car - driving - moments later (dusk)             113

     the radio is blasting - anything to shake those images out of
     his head. driving, unsettled... which may be why he doesn't
     notice that there's a siren wailing behind him.

     he looks in the rear-view. a texas state trooper is on his
     tail. shit. o'ryan tightens, pulling over...
