159  int. fbi office - outside the o'ryan room - morning          159

     6 a.m. fran pauses outside the o'ryan room... where mackelway
     sleeps on a chair. poor guy was here all night.

     she regards him... then her eyes find that map, and the gaping
     black wave across it. a horrible image...

     she studies mackelway again, almost tenderly, until:

                         charlton (o.s.)
               does he listen to you?

     she turns, startled. here's charlton, right behind her. and
     she's been caught... watching mackelway sleep.

                         fran
               i'm sorry?

                         charlton
               it's not a strength of his. i'm noticing
               that lately.

     truth is, she doesn't like charlton. or trust him...

                         fran
               he's fine.

                         charlton
               i'm not so sure.
                    (a beat)
               you oughtta sit him down, remind him how
               a chain-of-command works.

                         fran
               he's fine, sir.

                         charlton
               talk to him.

     with that, he's gone. fran watches as he heads for the front
     door... and exits.

     she looks back to mackelway. he awakens with a start. thinking
     no one's watching, he pops another vicoden.
