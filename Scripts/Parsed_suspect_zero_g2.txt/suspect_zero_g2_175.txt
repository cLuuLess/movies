186  int. mackelway's yukon - driving - night                     186

     a huge storm devours scenery on both sides of us. o'ryan
     drives. mackelway sits, no expression at all on his face,
     still recovering from what happened in that room...

     silence... then:

                         mackelway
               tell me about icarus.

                         o'ryan
               why?

                         mackelway
               just... wanna know.

     o'ryan eyes him. the sky is black.

                         o'ryan
               there were five of us. in the program.

     mackelway's all ears...

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               we'd come in in the morning, have a cup
               of coffee, talk about the yankees. then
               you'd go to your room, with your pen and
               your pad of paper, always alone, and
               you'd try to lock in. son of sam. john
               wayne gacy. ted bundy. he might be
               driving his car, or having a beer or
               brushing his teeth... or cutting
               someone's eyes out.

     that was said flatly, matter-of-factly. it's chilling.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               if you did it right, you got all of it:
               the way it sounded. the way it smelled...
               those people were looking up at you,
               begging you for mercy. it was like being
               god.
                    (a beat)
               ...except you're not. because you can't
               do a thing for them. can't make it stop.
               you're just watching, helpless.

     he pauses.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               they wired us into this current, the five
               of us: darkness, the pit itself. we were
               plugged right into it. but nobody taught
               us how to shut it off...
                    (thinking back...)
               we were just men. and we saw things men
               shouldn't see. agony, torture, evil - and
               it never shut off. even now, it's still
               there.

                         mackelway
               they all wind up like you? the other
               agents?

                         o'ryan
               no. they're dead now.

     oh. mackelway doesn't reply...

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               they broke down. then they opted out.
                    (mackelway's a blank)
               killed themselves... after a while, those
               conversations about the yankees became
               impossible. ya see?

     mackelway lets that sink in, as he stares at passing head-
     lights. then:

                         mackelway
               i'm sorry.

     o'ryan shrugs. he appreciates it. the windshield wipers beat
     back rain...

                                                              cut to:
