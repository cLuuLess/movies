     fran and mackelway emerge, heading for the bonneville.

                         mackelway
               we ought to work out some kind of
               protocol.

                         fran
               for what?

                         mackelway
               interviews. witnesses. looks pretty
               silly, our talking over one another.

     mackelway approaches, cautiously.

     he doesn't have gloves on him, so he uses his jacket pocket to
     protect against prints. he opens the trunk.

     first thing he sees is that symbol again: a circle-with-a-
     slash-through-it... staring right at him.

     but this time, it's been carved into somebody's back.

     mackelway stares. so does fran. before them lies a body,
     stripped to the waist: a chunky middle-aged man. dead.

     mackelway sighs. things just got tougher...

                                                              cut to:
