     the front door is open. through a screen door, mackelway can
     see an old-fashioned "foyer." he knocks. waits.

     two sounds dominate: the buzz from that tv, and the strident
     singing, which we realize is an a capela version of "la vida
     loca" audible through an open bedroom window.

     but no one's coming to answer the door, and it's wide open
     anyway... so mackelway enters.

                         mackelway
               hello?
