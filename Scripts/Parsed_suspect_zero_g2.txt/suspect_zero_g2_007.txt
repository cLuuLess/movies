     mackelway struggles with a coffee machine that's unfamiliar to
     him. filter, water, grounds, etc.

                         katie (o.s.)
               here. lemme do that.

     he turns. this is katie potter. she's 25, friendly, under-
     challenged by her job. been here two years. in two seconds
     she's got the thing percolating. of course.

                         katie (cont'd)
               it takes some experience.

     he shrugs, not feeling too smooth.

                         katie (cont'd)
               you're mackelway, right?

                         mackelway
               mmm-hmm.

                         katie
               fax came in for you. it's the room next
               door.

                         mackelway
               oh. thanks.

     he rises, heads for the "fax room"...
