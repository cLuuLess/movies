158  int. 18-wheeler - cab - moving - night                       158

     we've seen this truck before - several times in fact. it
     rumbles along the highway. we don't see who's driving, but we
     do see who's in the passenger seat:

     it's charlie, five years-old, whose abduction we just
     witnessed. he sleeps fitfully.

     a man's hand can be seen, edging into frame - the driver. he
     picks up a cassete, shoves it into the tape deck.

     and out comes the sound of "barney the dinosaur."

                         barney (thru dashboard stereo)
               oh silly songs get sillier/when you hear
               them once again/and maybe you're hearing
               an echo/or maybe it's only a friend!

     the truck continues to rumble along.

                                                              cut to:
