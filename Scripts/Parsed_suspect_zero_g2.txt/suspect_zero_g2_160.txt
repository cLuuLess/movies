170  ext. road/int. mackelway's yukon - continuing                170

     he follows vic's rig out of the lot and onto a road
     approaching i-30. but there are three cars between them -
     mackelway can't get a clean look at vic's license plate.

     vic approaches the interstate. so do the three cars between
     them.

     vic passes the interstate on-ramp. the three cars turn on to
     it... putting mackelway right on vic's tail.

     he grabs his cel, dials. this truck has license plates from
     ten states.

                         mackelway (into cel)
               this is mackelway. i need a run down on a
               plate. texas: delta-142-romeo-victor-
               alpha. got that?

     he puts the cel down, but doesn't hang up. vic just made a
     turn onto a vast dirt lot.

     a huge banner overhead reads, "founders day carnival!!!"
