105  ext. wichita falls fbi office - parking lot - night          105

     mackelway exits the office, heading for his yukon.

     then he stops... because katie is waiting out here, leaning
     against her toyota camry.

                         mackelway
                    (fondly)
               hey.

                         katie
               somethin', huh? guy with a wife and kids
               keepin' bodies in his attic?

     he nods... but what is she doing out here?

                         mackelway
               yeah.
                    (a beat)
               you okay?

                         katie
               yeah. just... wondered if you could do me
               a favor.

     mackelway waits... as katie hands over a manila envelope.
     mackelway opens it.

     inside, a photo of a heartbreakingly-sweet 22 year-old girl
     named karen sumpter, with an attached sheet listing her
     vitals: height, weight, age, etc.

     another face. another disappearance...

                         katie (cont'd)
               her name's karen sumpter. we were
               friends.
                    (almost reluctantly)
               she disappeared last year. nobody knows
               where. she was a little wild, but not
               like that.

     her sadness is obvious. mackelway nods.

                         katie (cont'd)
               anyway, i know you're gonna be in on the
               autopsies - of the girls they found over
               at speck's. figured you might see if one
               of 'em was...

     her voice trails off. this is hard.

                         katie (cont'd)
               if it is, i'd like to be the one to
               notify her folks. out families've been
               friends for years.

                         mackelway
                    (gently)
               sure. of course.

                         katie
               thanks... 'night.

     mackelway puts the envelope under his arm. she starts up the
     camry. the sky rumbles. he eyes her.

     for some reason, she hasn't pulled away yet...

                                                        smash cut to:
