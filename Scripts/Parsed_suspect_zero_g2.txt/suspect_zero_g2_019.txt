19   int. booth - continuing                                       19

     mackelway approaches. the woman doesn't turn.

                         charlton
               agent mackelway. i was 'bout to introduce
               you, but i understand that won't be
               necessary.

     mackelway doesn't get it... until the woman turns. she is
     agent fran kulok. 35, sharp, pretty when she allows herself to
     be. but with a guard that never comes down.

     mackelway has some history with her, so he tries not to react.
     it takes some effort.

                         charlton (cont'd)
               seems your former office has decided we
               might need some help on this one. so they
               sent out agent kulok.

                         fran
               tom.

                         mackelway
               fran.

     that was terse, from both of them. charlton takes note.

                         charlton
               i guess we're skipping the tearful
               reunion. have a seat, tom.

     mackelway sits opposite fran. she folds her hands.

                         mackelway
               how's things back at the ranch?

                         fran
               movin' right along.

     that might've been a dig; charlton can't tell.

                         charlton
               okay. whadda we know?

                         fran
               picked up a foot-print in the back seat
               of speck's car, size-and-a-half bigger
               than speck's.

     just like that, fran is piping up. mackelway's unoffended.

                         charlton
               'kay.

                         fran
               wounds on speck's throat indicate that he
               was strangled from behind... i think our
               guy waited for him in the backseat,
               sprung this on him once the car was
               moving.

     she slides that fourth drawing to charlton - giving us our
     first look at it.

     insert - the drawing:

     ...a steamer-trunk, lined with plastic. inside it are large
     ziploc bags. inside the bags are body parts.

     it's realized so accurately that it looks more like a
     photograph. no wonder it horrified speck so deeply.

     the booth - resuming

     charlton eyes it without reaction.

                         fran (cont'd)
               lab picked up talcum traces on the edges
               of the paper, consistent with powdered
               gloves.
                    (charlton nods)
               so he gets the dropped in his lap, it
               spooks him, and the car winds up in the
               ravine.

     plausible enough, until:

                         mackelway
               i don't think so, no. i think it was
               pushed.

                         fran
               how ya figure?

                         mackelway
               the look of the tracks. foot-prints near
               the embankment.

     without embellishing any further, he slides over the
     photographs that he took this morning with the minox: tire-
     tracks, foot-prints. she eyes them.

     then she eyes mackelway. charlton notes the tension.

                         charlton
               okay. so our guy likes to draw pictures
               of body parts and then spring 'em on
               people. what's that get us?
                    (they're silent)
               that's what i thought.

     there is plenty going unsaid here between mackelway and fran.
     charlton has no time for it.

                         charlton
               oh. 'fore i forget. this came in for you:

     he tosses a 9-by-12 envelope at mackelway, who opens it. six
     sheets of paper slide out.

     first one we see is the top sheet of a fax: same hand-written
     inscription as the last one: "attention, agent thomas
     mackelway, fbi resident agency, wichita falls."

     okay. this is twice now. he knows what will be under this top
     sheet without even looking. but here's page one:

     a photo of a middle-aged african-american woman. across the
     top of the photo, in hand-writing: "have you seen me?"

     and typed on the bottom: "tanya green. age 42. ht. 5'9", wt.
     165, eyes blk, hair blk. last seen: ames, iowa. date of
     disappearance: 3-22-97."

     the following four sheets bring four more faces: men, women,
     young, old. four more have you seen me's.

     but before he can think it through, he hears:

                         manager (o.s.)
               it's about time.

     they turn. that came from the night manager: a humorless guy
     named les. he's looking at the front door, through which dolly
     has just entered. pink cowboy boots tonight.

                         dolly
               don't start in on me, les. i couldn't get
               the pickup started and harlan took the
               dodge.

     the manager now throws a glance at the three feds in the
     booth. dolly stops short, taken aback.

                         dolly (cont'd)
               holy hell. my one shot at winding up on
               "cops" and i'm in my weekday boots!

                                                              cut to:
