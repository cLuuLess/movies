194  int. mackelway's yukon - resuming                            194

     o'ryan has that handcuff chain glowing now. we don't know if
     he'll have time to break the thing... until:

     the passenger-side door is opened, abruptly.

                         mackelway
               it's his birthday, isn't it?

     o'ryan turns. here's mackelway, who now gets an eyeful of what
     o'ryan's doing with that lighter.

     o'ryan pockets it, a bit sheepishly. mackelway decides to
     ignore the whole thing...

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               he comes home on his birthday.

     o'ryan nods. then delia's front door swings open.

                         delia (o.s.)
                    (aloud, delighted)
               darling?! that you?!
