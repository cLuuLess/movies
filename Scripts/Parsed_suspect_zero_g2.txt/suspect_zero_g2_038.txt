38   int. hope house - "o'ryan's room" - moments later             38

     mackelway leans in, looking around. a bed. a small end-table.
     bathroom. a window without bars.

     from down the hall we hear the sound of a phone ringing, then
     a fax transmission. an old fax machine begins to whine
     noisily, creaking. it's a distraction.

     but mackelway's focus is in this room. the walls have been newly
     painted. but there's a hint of barely-perceptible color
     beneath one of them. rain from a leaky roof is causing some of
     the new paint to peel a bit.

     a bucket collects drops in the center of the room. the feeling
     in here is damp, mildewy, creepy. mackelway remains in the
     doorway... then backs out.

                         dyson (o.s.)
               i guess you fellas're never unaccounted
               for, huh?
