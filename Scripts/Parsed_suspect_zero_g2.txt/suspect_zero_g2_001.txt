1    ext. ditch - off the interstate - 4:30 a.m.                    1

     amongst the refuse is a discarded milk carton, resting on its
     back. the carton asks "have you seen me?" above a photographed
     face that's been obscured by grime.

     yellowing newspaper, old coke cans, twinkie wrappers... in
     that bed of untended weeds. a hollow texas wind blows through
     it all. we stay with the carton...

     then that hollow wind gains speed... and a deep rumble grows
     in the distance, becoming a roar. the yellowed newspaper lifts
     off and whips past us.

     ...as an 18-wheel mack truck blows by, just a blur in the
     corner of our frame, doing 75 in the pre-dawn darkness.

     then, the truck is gone, and the rush of air dissipates. the
     milk carton, the coke cans... they lie undisturbed.

     a light rain begins to fall... and some of the grime washes
     away from that milk carton, revealing a face. a child. "have
     you seen me?" it's heartbreaking.
     tilt up... to take in the vast flatness of texas' i-35:
     concrete forever. in the distance, gray highway yields to
     black stormclouds gathering silently over endless prairie.

     a vertical vein of lightning streaks through one of them.

                                                              cut to:

     ...a spoon, stirring a cup of coffee.
