169  ext. truck-stop - parking lot - moments later                169

     mackelway backs out in the yukon, trying to keep a visual on
     vic's truck.

     another 18-wheeler pulls in front of him, blocking his view
     entirely.

                         mackelway
               dammit!

     he honks - loud - pulls around that other 18-wheeler, heading
     for the exit of the lot.

     just spotted vic's rig again.
