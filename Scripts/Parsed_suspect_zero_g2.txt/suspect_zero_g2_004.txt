4    int. speck's car - driving - moments later                     4

     speck guns the buick. interstate 35 flies by. the farther he
     gets away from that diner, the happier he'll be.

     ...until a strange sound gets his attention: it's wind, as if
     whistling through a ghost town. hollow, varied - building then
     falling off again. wind.

     trouble is, the windows in this buick are up.

     yet there it is again: a thin, hollow ghost-town wind,
     whistling over his shoulder. he's heard it before - in every
     western he ever watched as a kid.

     but this wind is coming from his back-seat.

     the blood drains right out of speck's face. doesn't know if he
     should jam on the brakes or drive faster.

     he looks in his rear-view, catches a glimpse of a latex glove
     snapping onto a hand. dear god: o'ryan is back there, making
     that odd ghost-town wind sound. whistling.

                         speck
                    (sheer terror)
               what-do-you-want?! what-do-you-want-with-
               me?!

     no reply. instead, another gift appears from the back: a
     fourth drawing, tossed from the darkness into speck's lap.

     he looks down, registers the image... and shrieks.

                         o'ryan (o.s.)
               there's a rest stop, next off-ramp. pull
               into it.

                         speck
               i have some money. it's not a lot but--

                         o'ryan
               nobody wants your money, harold. just
               pull in.

                         speck
               why?!

     o'ryan rises into frame now, like nosferatu...

                         o'ryan
               because i don't wanna do this at 70 miles
               an hour. it could be dangerous.

     speck finds the off-ramp. his breaths are shallow now.

                         speck
               please, mister - what do you want from
               me?

     o'ryan's face: a knowing grin fans across it...

                                                              cut to:

     ...the face of virgil ray starkey, on a bulletin board.
