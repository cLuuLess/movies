160  int. o'ryan room - continuing                                160

     fran enters, feeling slightly dirty from that exchange.
     mackelway checks his watch as a few agents exit the suite.

                         mackelway
               they going to denton?

                         fran
               mmm-hmm.

                         mackelway
               but not you?

                         fran
               sitting in on two autopsies.

                         mackelway
               oh.

     he rises. heads for the door, stiff. she looks at those o'ryan
     fbi documents now - her first time seeing them...

                         fran
               you okay?

                         mackelway
               yeah. why?

                         fran
               nothing.

     she leaves it at that. he's about to exit, when:

                         mackelway
               are they male or female?

                         fran
               huh?

                         mackelway
               the autopsies.

                         fran
               females - logan, utah; and decatur,
               alabama.

     (neither city is represented with black pins on that map.)

     she slides over a packet of photos: two female victims,
     photographed in separate morgues - face up, face down, waist
     and above, waist and below, etc.

     mackelway eyes them, then leaves the room. we stay with
     fran... taking in that o'ryan fbi file. it troubles her.

     mackelway returns, carrying the 9-by-12 envelope that katie
     gave to him.

                         fran (cont'd)
                    (re: o'ryan's file)
               so is this what happens when an agent
               spins out? he gets deleted?

                         mackelway
               sometimes. the lucky ones get sent to
               wichita falls.

     she breathes out an ironic laugh. he hands over the envelope,
     opens it. inside: that photo of karen sumpter. mackelway
     didn't pay much attention to it before.

     fran eyes the photo, then the vitals.

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               friend of the receptionist, missing for
               about a year now. i told her i'd let her
               know if the body ever turned up.

     fran doesn't look up from the photo.

                         fran
               the receptionist.

                         mackelway
               her name's katie.

     she half-smiles: "you mean the one you've been fucking?" he
     shrugs, confirming nothing - wishing fran weren't quite so
     smart. she puts the photo back into the envelope.

                         fran
               i see you got the blue pin out of
               greenville.

                         mackelway
               yeah. last night. kid named simms.

     that confused her.

                         fran
                    (re: sumpter)
               no. i meant her. the girl.

     that confused him.

                         mackelway
               what're you talking about?

                         fran
               did ya look at her vitals?

     she hands him the material on karen sumpter.

                         fran (cont'd)
               greenville, texas. october 26.

     he grabs the material, looks at it for the first time:

     "karen sumpter, age 25. ht. 5'6", wt. 110. eyes blu, hair
     blnd. last seen: greenville, tx. date of disappearance: 10-26-
     00."

     mackelway looks to the conference table - that huge stack of
     faxes, all those helpless faces.

     the one on top is the one that came in last night: lloyd
     simms, age 9. ht. 4'10", wt. 67 lbs. last seen: greenville,
     texas. date of disappearance: 10-26-99.

     at last, a pattern. a break.

     mackelway grabs the simms fax, hurries out of the room.
     nearest agent is grieves. mackelway hands him the fax.

                         mackelway
               need an address on this fax line.

     grieves has done this on fifty different faxes now; it never
     yields their suspect, but:

                         grieves
               'kay.

     mackelway leans back in to the o'ryan room.

                         mackelway
               o'ryan's in greenville.

                         fran
               what makes you think so?

                         mackelway
               that's where zero is.
                    (fran's a blank)
               lloyd simms - october 26, '99. karen
               sumpter - october 26, 2000. both
               disappeared from greenville.
                    (still no reply)
               zero comes back to the same spot, once a
               year. today's the 25th.

                         fran
               wait. when did we establish that zero was
               real?

                         mackelway
               o'ryan thinks so.

                         fran
               do you?

     that's the million-dollar question, and it hangs there.

     mackelway's about to answer... when he stops himself. just
     noticing something. that morgue photo from logan, utah:

     there's a burn mark on the lower left calf of the victim.
     we've seen such a mark before, on another autopsy photo.

                         mackelway
               i've seen this before.

                         fran
               huh?

     he doesn't answer, just hurries to a thick box of other
     autopsy files and photos. starts rifling through them...

     ...until he finds the one we've seen before. the body from
     trenton. he extracts it. eyes it. a confirmation...

     he lays the two photos side by side. looks to fran.

                         mackelway
               same burn-mark.
                    (she leans in)
               i saw it before but it didn't register.

     fran eyes the photos. no doubt about it - they both have the
     same burn mark on the lower left calf: a symmetrical, almost
     horizontal stripe across the flesh.

                         fran
               he burns them?

                         mackelway
               i dunno. almost looks too symmetrical to
               be a burn.
                    (re: logan victim)
               they're autopsying her this morning?

                         fran
               yeah.

     she gets the idea: "find out where the hell this mark on the
     leg came from." grieves enters.

                         grieves
               fax number traces back to a copy center
               on i-30. greenville.
                    (mackelway eyes his watch)
               i called. they don't open for another
               hour.

     mackelway looks to fran. she's not entirely sold yet... but
     she's getting there.

                                                              cut to:
