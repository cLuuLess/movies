163  int. "fast-copy" - counter - day                             163

     mackelway stands opposite a day-manager: 30, harried, eyeing a
     copy of the composite drawing of o'ryan.

                         day-manager
                    (re: o'ryan)
               naah. i never saw that guy in here.

                         mackelway
               he sent a fax from this location 'bout
               seven o'clock this morning.

                         day-manager
               we're closed at seven.

                         mackelway
               are your faxes programmable? could he
               have paid last night to have it sent this
               morning?

                         day-manager
               sure. but that costs extra.

                         mackelway
               were you here last night?

                         day-manager
               nope. haven't done nights since i got
               promoted.

     mackelway eyes the guy... then hears a cel-phone ring.

                         mackelway
               'scuse me.

     mackelway grabs his cel, backing away from the counter.

                         mackelway (cont'd)
                    (into cel)
               mackelway.

164  intercut with/int. morgue - same                             164

     fran is at a phone, in the morgue. the logan utah body lies on
     the table.

                         fran
               it's not a burn. it's a freezer-burn.
                         mackelway
               you're sure.

                         fran
               there's crystallization in the blood
               stream. the blood never clotted in the
               wound. it's a freezer burn... i'm having
               the other body shipped out - the guy from
               trenton. we'll see if he's got the same
               thing.

     mackelway pauses, thinking...

                         mackelway
               so... he keeps the bodies in a freezer,
               then buries them...?

     that was a question. he can't do any better.

                         fran
               i dunno. if he kept them in a freezer
               they'd have marks like this all over.
               wouldn't they?

     mackelway nods - that made sense. shit.

     the noise of the interstate doesn't make things any easier. a
     huge truck rumbles by. 18 wheels.

     mackelway eyes it, absently. then a bolt hits him:

     on the side of the truck is a trademark: "ever-frost." this
     truck is hauling ice cream.

     things just began to click.

                         mackelway
               thanks, fran.

     he has hit "end" before she can reply. heads to his yukon.

     fran eyes the phone: that was odd...

                                                              cut to:
