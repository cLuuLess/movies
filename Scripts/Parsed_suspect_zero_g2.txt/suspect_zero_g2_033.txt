     three months have passed since the arrest in matamoros. now
     mackelway sits in this courthouse anteroom, adjacent to a
     courtroom. four sour prosecutors surround him.

                         prosecutor #1
               leaving a tissue sample in the care of a
               mexican lab? are you fucking kidding me?

                         mackelway
               they assured me that they understood
               protocol.

                         prosecutor #1

               prick's gonna walk, ten murders or not.
