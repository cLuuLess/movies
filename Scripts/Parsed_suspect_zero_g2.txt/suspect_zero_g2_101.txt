103  int. fbi office - the o'ryan room - evening                  103

     everything yet known about the murders of speck, fulcher, and
     starkey fills the wall space in here:

     we see o'ryan's map: all those yellow pins... and the one blue
     one, (greenville, tx.) also, that drawing: of the ghastly
     ziploc bags inside a steamer trunk. damn thing seems prescient
     now.

     agents mill about, awaiting a conference.

                         grieves
                    (passing by)
               nice job, mack.

                         mackelway
               thanks.

     a few other agents also pat him on the back. fran's proud of
     him too - we can see it. in fact everyone in here seems to be
     giving mackelway his due. it all feels good.

     charlton enters.

                         charlton
               seated please.

     the agents find seats around the table. charlton takes his
     place at the head of it.

                         charlton (cont'd)
                    (to the assembled:)
               okay. we've got a serial killer of serial
               killers.

     fran scribbles something on a piece of paper: "what a genius!"
     slides it over. mackelway conceals the note, as:

                         charlton (cont'd)
                    (still grand-standing)
               he's a transient with a history of mental
               illness. he also happens to think he's a
               former agent of this bureau. and he is
               pursuing something that he calls "suspect
               zero." anybody got anything intelligent
               to say?

     nobody's volunteering.   there's just silence.

                         charlton (cont'd)
                    (familiar refrain)
               that's what i thought...

                                                              cut to:

104  omit                                                         104
