28   int. basement - beneath the stairs - continuing               28

     mackelway climbs under the stairs, crouching down, pushing
     aside all of the aforementioned junk. he grabs the box.

     sure enough, that bucket once held red paint - same color
     o'ryan used to cover that wall. there's also a bucket of black
     paint here. and some used brushes.

     mackelway brings the box into the meager light. we get a look
     inside it now. so does dyson.

     inside, beneath the paint-buckets, we see a few tv guides, a
     yo-yo, a football. then a book on tribal ritual and trance.
     mackelway grabs it, eyes it.

     he flips through a few pages - odd images: a tribesman with
     eyes rolling back in his head, strange rites, etc.

     mackelway sets the book down. then, amidst the other materials
     in this box, he spots a large folded map.

     he grabs it, begins to unfold it. we see that this map's been
     written on, in pen. cities on it have been circled.

     but before we can get a good look at it, mackelway spots
     something else, at the bottom of this box, a shocker:

     a photograph of himself.

     it takes him a second to realize what he's looking at. but
     there it is, a newspaper photo, of agent thomas mackelway.

     it is part of a front-page story, dated july of this year,
     concerning the trial and release...of virgil ray starkey. #7
     on the f.b.i.'s most-wanted list...

     dyson can't help but notice the picture of mackelway.

     mackelway stares. suddenly we jump back in time, nine months,
     for a brief, choppy flashback.
