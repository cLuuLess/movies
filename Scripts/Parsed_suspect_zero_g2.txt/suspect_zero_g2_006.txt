6    int. wichita falls f.b.i. office - later                       6

     a brief montage: mackelway, in his cubicle, watching as those
     other agents take calls, strap on guns, head out on
     assignment. men in motion.

     but mackelway's land-locked, writing up an auto-theft report.
     it's drudgery, but he's meticulous about it, deleting the word
     "beige" and replacing it with "tan."

     his head is throbbing - not an unusual circumstance for him.
     but after lingering for a half-second on that "most-wanted
     list" again? starkey? it's a wound...
