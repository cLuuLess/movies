     there are several big-rigs parked here, but the vast majority
     of the vehicles we see are garden-variety cars and suv's. a
     few pick-ups.

     there are rides at this carnival: pony rides, a ferris wheel,
     and a huge ring of barbeques, each fired up and cooking. must
     be a thousand people in attendance today.

     vic parks his rig. mackelway hangs back, watching:

     vic gets out of the rig. from here we can see that that 5-year-
     old boy is still stick in his car seat, and he is still
     screaming and flailing.

     vic points a stern finger at the kid as if to say, "behave or
     else." then vic disappears into the crowded carnival.
