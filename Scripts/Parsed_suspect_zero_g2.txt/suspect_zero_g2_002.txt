2    int. "the all-american diner" - gainesville texas - continuing 2
     (4:30 a.m.)

     harold speck sits: mid 40's, pleasant face. a family man.
     reads "rod and reel" magazine. has a salesman's case by his
     side. around him is a truck-stop in twilight:

     truckers at the counter, elvis on the wall, a "drink bud!"
     mirror. the world series can be heard on a radio...

                         dolly (o.s.)
               top that off for ya, hon?

     that's dolly, a waitress, (50, been here too long.) speck
     looks up, smiles thinly, "no." dolly heads off. speck returns
     to his article, underlining a particular passage.

     ...until a man seats himself, suddenly, in the seat opposite
     speck's. speck reacts, startled.

                         speck
               jesus...

     the man's name is o'ryan. we only see pieces of him: his eyes,
     his hands, a stain on his parka...

                         o'ryan
               what's in the case?

                         speck
               i'm sorry?

                         o'ryan
               you're always lugging that case around.
               i'm curious.

     speck looks around: there are plenty of empty tables in here.
     so why is this guy bothering me???

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               what do you sell?

                         speck
               i'm... in restaurant supplies. i didn't
               get your name?

                         o'ryan
               must travel a lot, huh?

     speck is looking for dolly, a manager, anyone...

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               whole country, or just hereabouts?

                         speck
               i don't mean to be rude but--

                         o'ryan
               how's your wife feel about it?

     that spun things a bit. speck pauses.

                         speck
               what?

                         o'ryan
               she must get lonely, with you gone all
               the time. does she?

                         speck
               look, i...

                         o'ryan
               do you get lonely?

     speck's so thrown now he can't answer.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               ya miss fucking her, harold?

                         speck
               listen, i don't know who you are but you
               can't--

     o'ryan silences him... by holding up a piece of paper. on it
     is a drawing. the image faces away from us. but speck can see
     it in rich detail. and his eyes go wide.

     we catch glimpses: the color of flesh. a body-part. looks like
     a rendering of a young, naked woman.

     and, just like that, speck finds himself staring. glued.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               did it myself. it's sort of a hobby.
                    (no reply)
               i've got more. would you like to see
               them?

     o'ryan lowers it and slides a second drawing over... speck is
     speechless, transfixed. can't look away.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               tell me: those jokes about the traveling
               salesman and the farmer's daughter - are
               they true?
                    (speck remains silent)
               here. this one's my favorite.

     o'ryan slides over drawing #3. again, we don't get to see it.
     and we still haven't seen all of o'ryan's face.

     but we can see speck, and his reaction. utter horror. in fact
     he recoils so violently that his coffee spills.

                         o'ryan (cont'd)
               really says it all, wouldn't you agree?

                         speck
               you're a... you're sick.

                         o'ryan
               that's a matter of opinion.

                         speck
               you're sick!

     he rises, leaving the drawings behind. we stay with him as he
     crosses the diner - deeply unsettled. he reaches the manager,
     (mel, balding, 50, in no mood) at the register.

                         mel
               mmm-hmm?

                         speck
               i'm having a problem - with another
               customer. i'd like you to ask him to
               leave, please.

                         mel
               what kind of problem?

                         speck
               he's--

     he turns, to point out o'ryan.

     ...but the booth, suddenly, is empty. the guy has simply
     disappeared, taking those drawings with him.

     speck tightens. mel eyes him, annoyed.

                                                              cut to:
