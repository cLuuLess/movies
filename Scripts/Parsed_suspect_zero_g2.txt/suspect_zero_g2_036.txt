36   int. courthouse bathroom - continuing flashback               36

     the door bursts open and mackelway storms in. no need to look
     composed now; he's alone in here. he crosses to a paper-towel
     dispenser, slugs it. stares in the mirror.

     he's livid, embarrassed, frustrated - can barely look at his
     own reflection.

     then he hears laughter, behind him. he turns.

     out of the darkness of a badly-lit stall, virgil starkey
     emerges, coming into view under a single light.

     beside him is a grim cop, his chaperone. starkey passes by
     mackelway, almost snickering. then he's gone. mackelway shuts
     his eyes tight. his head is pounding. end flashback.
