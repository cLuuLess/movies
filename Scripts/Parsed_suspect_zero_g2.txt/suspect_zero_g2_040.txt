     mackelway descends, having had quite enough of this place.
     piper is where we left him, watching vh1 in the tv room.

     mackelway passes, eyeing those newly-faxed pages: five more
     have you seen me's... he reaches the door.

                         piper
               ever seen a fifty-foot shark?

     mackelway stops, turns.

                         mackelway
               i'm sorry?

                         piper
               fifty-foot shark. ever seen one?

                         mackelway
               no.

                         piper
               doesn't mean there aren't any.

     great. mackelway reaches for the front door again. then he
     halts. maybe this guy can be helpful. mackelway turns:

                         mackelway
               did you know him?
                    (piper's silent)
               the guy who used to stay upstairs.
               "o'ryan." did you know him?

                         piper
               why? is he dead?

                         mackelway
               i don't...

                         piper
               you said "did." is he dead?

                         mackelway
               oh. i mis-spoke. no, he's not dead...
                    (a beat)
               you know him?

     piper nods.

     mackelway eyes him, then approaches, holding up a copy of that
     image: the circle-with-slash-through-it.

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               he ever talk about this? a circle with a
               slash through it?

     piper rises, crosses to us... leaning in unnecessarily close.
     it's unsettling.

                         piper
               that's not a circle. it's a zero.

                         mackelway
               oh. how do you know?

     piper doesn't answer. instead he simply starts whistling.

     but it's not a tune coming out of his mouth. it's that same
     sound that o'ryan made: a whistling wind, blowing through a
     ghost town... building, then falling again.

     piper smiles, backing away, enjoying the theatricality of it,
     stifling a giggle...

     then, suddenly, everything turns grainy, choppy...

     we've jumped into a distorted, remote pov of this same scene -
     as if watching it through a crystal ball, or a broken lens, or
     a distance of time and space...

     we see images, fragments: piper, the tv, the sofa, mackelway's
     face. then all sound breaks up, and we are...
