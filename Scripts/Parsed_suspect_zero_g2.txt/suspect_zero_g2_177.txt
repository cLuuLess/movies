188  ext. ranch-house - greenville, texas - continuing            188

     we've seen this place before. that is, we've seen it in
     o'ryan's drawing, which lies on the dashboard before us: a
     ranch-style house with a windmill in the backyard.

     o'ryan pulls over. rain pounds on the roof and hood. wind
     blows. mackelway studies the house. then his eyes shift
     briefly to the drawing.

                         mackelway
               can't bring you in with me. you know
               that.

     o'ryan shrugs, then raises his hands: "cuff me."

     the cuffs are lying on the floor in the back seat. mackelway
     reaches back, to grab them... a golden opportunity for o'ryan
     to club the guy.

     but o'ryan remains still. mackelway grabs them. then he stops.
     simply has to ask:

                         mackelway (cont'd)
               those faxes, the have-you-seen-me's...
               how many of 'em is he actually
               responsible for?

     o'ryan lays it right out:

                         o'ryan
               all of 'em.

     mackelway nods, sobered. cuffs o'ryan to the steering wheel
     and approaches the house.
