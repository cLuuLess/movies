24   ext. "hope house" - oklahoma city - night                     24

     a three-story victorian residence in decay, next door to a
     church/soup kitchen in the middle of oklahoma city's skid row.
     rain falls. the street is still.

     mackelway approaches this halfway-house. a few lights shine
     within, and the blue glow of a tv. upstairs can be heard the
     strident, off-key voice of somebody singing.
