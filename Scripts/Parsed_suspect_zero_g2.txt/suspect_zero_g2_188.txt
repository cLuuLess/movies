200  ext. wheat field - continuing                                200

     tall wheat in a stiff wet wind, and not a drop of moonlight to
     guide us. mackelway plunges in, gun drawn. no idea where he's
     going.

     ...except he's been here before. he's seen it. and there is a
     feeling of inevitability to all this; it's haunting.

     he's practically blind in here. can't see five feet in front
     of him. nothing but the sound of his own breathing.

     that, too, was presaged. those visions...
