          int. lulu's classroom - later
          
          the teacher hangs a series of cute "turkey hand" drawings
          above the blackboard (the kind where your fingers make
          the feathers). she hangs one of a huge hand, and smiles
          at shane, who sits in the back, sunglasses on. shane
          nods, "yeah, i know it's good." then...
          
                                 voice (over the pa:)
                    will shane wolfe please report to vice
                    principal murney in the gym.
          
          lulu's classmates all chant, in unison:
          
                                 second graders
                    ooooooooh! (you're in trouble!)
