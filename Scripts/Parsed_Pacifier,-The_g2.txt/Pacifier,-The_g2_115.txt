          int. nursery - continuous
          
          tyler's asleep. shane sighs, and whispers to peter,
          reading from todd's notes:
          
                                 shane
                    when you're down and low, lower than the
                    floor. and you ain't got a chance. don't
                    make a move `til you're in the groove,
                    and do the panda dance...
          
          peter starts bawling. shane doesn't know what's wrong.
          todd calls from the doorway...
          
                                 todd
                    you have to do the dance. like dad used
                    to do. he made it up for him.
          
          shane sighs. he sings again, mortified. he does the dance
          as he sings... shane hops forward three times.
                                 s
                                 shane
                    just hop three times like a kangaroo --
                    sidestep twice, just like the crabs do.
          
          peter applauds. humiliated, shane crab-walks sideways.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    take three steps forward and one step
                    back... (he does.)
