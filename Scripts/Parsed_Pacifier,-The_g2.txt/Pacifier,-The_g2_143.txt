          int. garage - night
          
           hane turns the light on. gary follows shane as he looks
          for tool. suddenly, the duck starts quacking... shane
          turns. gary's foot is caught in a grate.
          
                                 shane
                    what happened, gary?
          
          shane gets down on his hands and knees and gently pries
          gary's foot from the grate. shane is about to stand when
          something below catches his eye.
          
          shane pulls out a pen flashlight, shines it down the
          grate... we see a crank wheel.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    what do you suppose this is?
          
          shane tugs at the grate until it pops off. shane grips
          the valve and tries turning it. nothing. he tries harder,
          muscles rippling, and then it gives... the wheel spins.
          
           he floor opens, revealing a circular staircase, leading
          below the garage. shane steps down it...
