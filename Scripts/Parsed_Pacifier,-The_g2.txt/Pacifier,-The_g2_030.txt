          int. plummer house/foyer - morning
          
          julie, with her suitcase, shane, helga and the kids stand
          in the doorway. zoe listens to her i-pod ignoring the hug
          julie gives her.
          
                                 julie
                    don't worry about the kids, helga will
                    handle everything. (worried:) but if
                    there is an emergency, all the emergency
                    numbers are on the fridge. and on the
                    phone. and on the back door...
          
                                 zoe
                    mom -- we'll be fine, chill.
          
                                 julie
                           (a little choked up:)
                    i know, it's just... i am a mom, it's my
                    job to worry. ... i love you guys. i'm
                    gonna miss you. i'll be back in 48 hours.
                    and guys, whatever lieutenant wolfe asks
                    you to do... do it. okay?
          a
           ll the children nod in agreement except zoe who pops her
          chewing gum bubble.
          
                                 julie (cont'd)
                    lieutenant, i don't want you to worry
                    about anything except the safety of my
                    children. helga will take care of
                    everything else.
          
                                 shane
                    don't worry. they'll be safe with me.
          
                                 helga
                    everything will be fine, mrs. plummer.
          
          julie gets in the car and it drives away. shane turns
          back to the kids who loom in the doorway.
          
                                 helga (cont'd)
                    tell me, are you licensed to kill?
          
                                 shane
                    ... no.
          
                                 helga
                           (she frowns)
                    too bad.

          helga trudges up the path and in.
