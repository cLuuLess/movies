          shane lands shoulder deep in disgusting sludge. he
          winces, then checks the tracker -- the dots are close,
          feet away. shane trudges through the river of muck.
          
                                  shane
                    red 1?   red 2?
          
          it's horrific. the dots beep louder. he's almost there!
          he splashes around a corner -- then gasps -- he sees the
          blinking lights below the surface. he takes a deep
          breath and dives under. he comes up for air with zoe and
          todd's homing beacons. a note is tied to them: "ha! ha!"
          
                                                                  42.
