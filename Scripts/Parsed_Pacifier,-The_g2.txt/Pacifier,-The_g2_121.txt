          the bleachers are packed. murney struts out onto the mat.
          the two fighters begin circling one another. the
          wrestlers scream for murney. todd cheers shane on.
                                 m
                                  urney
                     on, you're about to enter murney's house
                    of pain.
          
                                 shane
                    i'll be sure to lock up when i'm through.
          
          murney roars and charges shane. shane defensively uses
          murney's momentum to flip him halfway across the mat.
          wham. murney lands on his back.
          
          the wrestlers mouths drop. murney, shocked, climbs to his
          feet and charges again, shane side-steps, and sweeps
          murney -- sending him right into the wall, hard.
          
          murney bounds to his feet, rushes shane. shane dives
          over murney, grabs onto murney's waist. shane's momentum
          pulls murney backwards -- bam. murney's shoulders hit the
          mat with shane smiling down on him.
          
          todd flops to the mat, raises his hand and slaps it down-
          
                                 todd
                    pinned!
          
          shane stands. shane throws an arm around todd, and they
          head out. the wrestling team huddles around murney, who's
          quietly twitching on the ground, mumbling something.
          
                                  s

                                  todd (cont'd)
                    is he okay?
          
                                 shane
                    dislocated nerve, that's all. he'll be
                    fine in (checking his watch) two months.
          
                                 todd
                    that was awesome.
          
          they walk out. the crowd cheers. claire, too. shane
                                 s
          smiles at her as he passes. she gives him a thumbs up.
          
                                 shane
                           (to todd)
                    let's go, todd. i got my troops waiting.
