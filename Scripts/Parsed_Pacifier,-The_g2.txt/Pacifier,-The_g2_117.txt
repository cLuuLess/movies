          int. garage - moments later
          
          todd sits in the back of the minivan, listening to sound
          of music on his walkman, lulu is next to him, with her
          gameboy, zoe and peter are half asleep. shane climbs into
          the passenger seat. zoe realizes he's staring at her,
          through the mirror.
          
                                 shane
                    today you drive.
          
          t
          
          
          
          
                    a
          
          
          
          
                                                                   70.
          
          
          
          the kids sit bolt upright. they turn to zoe, terrified.
          she gets out in shock, and gets in the driver's seat. the
          other kid's seat belts click loudly.
          
                                 zoe
                    but -- i can't even pass driver's ed.
          
                                 shane
                    exactly.
          
                                 zoe
                    have you given a driving lesson before?
          
                                 shane
                    n
                     ot in a car, no... but it's a lot like
                    a bradley assault vehicle.
          
                                 todd
                    especially when zoe's driving.
          
          the kids share a dubious look. zoe backs jerkily out.
