          int. garage - moments later
          
          the garage door opens, dramatically unveiling shane. he's
          wearing tyler in a snuggle. across his chest, he's got a
          bandoleer of baby-bottles and juice boxes. shane can't
          hide his contempt as he sees: julie's white minivan. a
          bumper sticker declares "world's greatest mom." shane
          puts tyler in a car seat. its interlocking buckle
          connects four ways. shane fumbles with it for a while.
          it just doesn't add up...

                    we're gonna be late.
          
                                 shane
                    not on my watch.
          
          shane ties the buckles in a fancy knot.
