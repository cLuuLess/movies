          int. kitchen - later
          
          the children are assembled, lined up tallest to shortest.
          at the end on the floor is baby tyler, sucking on a
          bottle. shane firmly starts his patton speech:
          
                                 shane
                    listen up, ladies. your behavior is
                    unacceptable. in order to maintain a
                    state of safety we need to maintain a
                    state of discipline and order. i've only
                    got one rule: everything is done my way.
                    no highway option. do you copy?
          
                                   lulu
                    do you copy?
          
                                  shane
                    what?   i said -- do you...
          
                                  lulu
                            ("copying" him)
                    what?   i said -- do you...
          
                                 shane
                    do not copy me!
          
                                  ulu
                    make up your mind.
          
                                 l
          
          
          
          
                                                                  21.
          
          
          
          shane starts to speak then thinks better, he's furious.
          everyone stares blankly -- a tense silence. it's broken
          by the sound of a large air bubble from the aquarium.
          
                                    ulu (cont'd)
                    p
                     eter farted.
          
          everyone cracks up. shane tries to maintain decorum. he
          reaches into his bag and unpacks a set of small high-tech
          security bracelets with a red light and a covered button.
          he straps one to each kid's wrist.
          
                                 shane
                    tracking devices. now that i know i can't
                    trust you... never take them off. the
                    panic button is only for emergencies.
                    touch that -- you better be dying, or
                    you're dead.
          
                                 zoe
                    i am not wearing that. just because my
                    mom's paranoid doesn't mean we have to
                    take orders from you.
          
          he yells at her, marine sergeant style:
          
                                 shane
                    let me explain how the chain of command
                    works. i tell you what to do -- and you
                    do it. end of chain. now i'm not gonna
                    have time to learn your names. so you are
                    -- (pointing) red 1, red 2, red leader,
                    red baby... wait, where's the older male?
                    there were five.
          
                                 helga
                           (mysterious)
                    he walks like dracula, with footsteps
                    silent like death --
          
          shane looks to zoe for translation.
          
                                 zoe
                    he's in his room.
          
          angry, shane bounds up the stairs.
