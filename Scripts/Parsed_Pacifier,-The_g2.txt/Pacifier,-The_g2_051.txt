          int. bathroom - moments later
          
          shane enters, holding out the baby at full arm's length.
          he lowers tyler onto a changing pad, takes a deep breath,
          then pulls out pliers and a screwdriver. using the tools
          as chopsticks, he cautiously unfastens the diaper... and
          then -- it flops open. sshane groans, repelled.
          
                                   shane
                      the things i do for my country.
          
          shane tries approaching -- he can't do it. aghast, he
          looks around for a solution. then: shane picks up the
          baby and dips the bottom half in the toilet, then
          flushes, over and over and over.
