          ext. house - continuous
          
          shane chases helga to the cab.
          
                                 shane
                    red leader! i command you to come back!
                    that is a direct order! you can't leave
                    a man behind!!
          
          helga jumps in the cab.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                           (screaming)
                    i don't know the peter panda song!!
          
          as the cab pulls away, in the rear window, helga glares
          back, then does an obscene romanian hand gesture.
          
          angle - shane
          
          his jaw drops in disbelief. he drops his head, defeated.
          then -- he slowly glances up.
          
          across the street
          
          the korean couple is staring at him, dumbfounded.
          
                                 korean woman
                    don't worry, if she loves you, she'll
                    come back.
          
          angle - shane
          
          rises, takes a deep breath and strides inside.
