          int. kitchen - breakfast - morning
          
          the kids are dressed for school. on the table in front of
          each place is a tan bag. the kids sit down at their
          designated spots, confused by the mre's (meals ready to
          eat) in front of them.
          
                                 shane
                    what are you waiting for?    dig in.
          
          todd, lulu and zoe all tear open their bags.
          
          todd pulls out a bag of corn beef hash and a snickers
          bar. zoe pulls out a bag of fettuccine alfredo and some
          matches. lulu takes out a bag of turkey slices and a
          coffee packet. shane smiles, proud of his accomplishment.
          the kids stare at "breakfast," dubious.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    don't worry, i can get lots more of
                    those. and i've survived off this stuff
                    for months.
          
                                
          
          
                                                                  31.
          
          
          
                                 zoe
                    like i'm really gonna eat all those
                    carbs.
          
          shane turns to address them:
          
                                 shane
                    okay, ladies. your mama -- is not here to
                    take care of you now. so -- here's how
                    it's gonna be. we're gonna pull together,
                    all for one, one for all. if i say in,
                    you stay in, if i say out, you go out...
          
          peter stands in his chair, dancing...
          
                                 peter
                    ba ba do the hokie pokey...
          
                                   shane
                    i did not say at ease!
          
          peter's eyes fill with tears.
          
                                 zoe
                    he's only two, he doesn't have any idea
                    what you're talking about. i don't have
                    any idea what you're talking about...
          
          shane sighs. lulu asks shane:
          
                                 lulu
                    can you kill a man with your bare hands?
          
                                 shane
                    you play too many video games. (then:)
                    yes.
          
                                 lulu
                    ... i can cross my eyes. wanna see?
          
                                  shane
                    negative.
          
          lulu crosses her eyes at shane, then at tyler -- who
          screams at the top of his lungs. shane turns to lulu.
          
                                 lulu
                    tyler hates it when i do that...
          
          peter starts bawling, too. he runs away, crying. the
          table cloth is yanked to the floor. and the phone rings.
          shane answers, trying to hear over the screaming.
          
          
          
                                                                32.
          
          
          
                                 shane
                    plummer residence... yes, i know it's
                    monday. oh. thank you, sir.
          
          he hangs up. zoe smiles at him, innocently.
          
                                 zoe
                    who was that?
          
                                 shane
                    your vice principal. he said if you're
                    late again, you and todd are expelled. he
                    wants to see you in his office. with your
                    ... legal guardian.
