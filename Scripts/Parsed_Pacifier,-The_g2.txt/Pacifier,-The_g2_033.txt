          ext. plummer house - back yard - continuous
          
          the yard is littered with toys. in the middle is a
          trampoline. he spots the figure climbing the trellis.
          shane runs, jumps onto the trampoline. he flies in the
          air and latches onto the figure. they both tumble to the
          ground.
          
          shane yanks off the dark figure's hood, revealing scott
          (16) a nervous teenager. he's dazed, but alright, wearing
          sharper image night vision goggles.
          
                                 scott
                    ... zoe?
          
          zoe runs out the door, setting off the piercing alarm.
          
                                 zoe
                    he's my boyfriend, tool.
          
                                 shane
                    so you're the one who broke in.
                    zoe -- go back inside.
          
                                 zoe
                    okay, fine... come on scott.
          
          shane grabs scott by the scruff of the neck.
          
                                 shane
                    not with this kid. (to todd:) you --
                    gimme twenty!
          
          freaked, scott fumbles for his wallet and gives shane a
          twenty dollar bill.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    i meant push-ups!
          
          befuddled, scott starts to   do lame push-ups. shane grabs
          the back of scott's shirt,   lifting him in the air,
          spinning him away from the   house like a marionette. scott
          runs off, calling out from   across the street.
                                 s
                                  cott
                    ... i'll call you, zoe!
          
          zoe storms inside. shane stands there, fuming. the
          alarm's still blaring. the window of the house next door
          opens: a korean couple, the chuns, pop their heads out.
          they're arguing with each other in korean. shane
          addresses them, in perfect korean with subtitles:
          
          s
          
          
          
          
                                 s
          
          
          
          
                                                                17.
          
          
          
                                 shane
                    my apologies. we had an intruder. a
                    simple misunderstanding.
          
                                 mr. chun
                           (perfect english, no accent)
                    we speak english, kojak.
          
                                 shane
                    oh. sorry.
          
                                 mrs. chun
                    ... look, about the 2000 decibel alarm
                    and the kleig lights and stuff... we own
                    a bakery, so we're up kind of early.
                    would you mind?
          
                                 shane
                    sorry.
          
          shane pulls a remote control from his pocket and clicks
          it. the alarm stops.
          
                                 mr. chun
                    thanks a bunch. oh, and we found this in
                    our pool filter... try to keep that zoo
                    reigned in, huh baby-sitter?
          
          mr. chun tosses him the troll doll and slam their window
          shut. shane's about to head inside, he pulls a tiny
          camera phone from his pocket, and snaps a shot of the
          chun's car in their driveway.
