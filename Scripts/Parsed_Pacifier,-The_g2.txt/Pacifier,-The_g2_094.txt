          shane inspects the house, as kids clean. shane wipes a
          finger down the sofa. clean. he lifts the sofa, and rubs
          his finger under it. he holds it up to a kid... residue.

          a girl reorganizes a stack of cd's. shane goes over
          them, straightening -- then he notices something. he
          pulls out a cd: it is a home-burned disk, labeled with a
          sharpie. it reads: ghost. oh my god...
