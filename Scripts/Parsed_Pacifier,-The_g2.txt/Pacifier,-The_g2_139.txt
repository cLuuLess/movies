          ext. balcony - night
          
          zoe sits on the railing, she seems sad. shane approaches.
          
                                   zoe
                    don't worry.    i'm not gonna jump.
          
                                 shane
                    what's wrong... scott?
          
                                 zoe
                     o. scott's fine. i don't know what you
                    did, but he's really straightened up.
                    flowers, phone calls. ...i've never been
                    in love like this before.
          
          shane nods.
          
                                 shane
                    how long you been together?
          
                                   zoe
                    a month...
          
                                 shane
                    that's longer than any relationship i've
                    ever had.
          
                                 zoe
                    you're okay, shane. i'm not used to
                    anyone giving me the benefit of the
                    doubt. my teachers don't trust me. mom
                    doesn't. my dad didn't care about us, he
                    was never here...
          
                                   z

                                   s
          
          
          
          
                                                                 81.
          
          
          
                                 shane
                           (interrupts her, stern:)
                    hey. your father cared about you very
                    deeply. he told me you were the greatest
                    things in his life. that what's bothering
                    you? cause -- we can talk about it, if
                    you want.
          
          zoe's eye well up, then she cries. shane holds her.
          
                                 zoe
                    i miss him so much...
          
          shane is a little taken by surprise. then -- he decides
          to answer. he takes his sfather's medal out of his pocket.
          
                                 shane
                    this was my dad's. he was the only family
                    i ever had. mom left when i was little,
                    cause dad was always gone. two years
                    in... an indisclosable locale. another
                    six in... another indisclosable locale. i
                    didn't really have a home, so i went to
                    military school -- then one day my mom
                    got the letter. no more dad.
          
          he looks at the medal.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    i always wanted to be just like him. i'm
                    starting to realize, i never really knew
                    him. i don't know if i'm like him or not.
          
                                 zoe
                    that's horrible, shane.
          
                                 shane
                    the hardest part was living without any
                    details...why? how? where? i always
                    wondered if he thought about me.
          
                                   oe
                    me too.   so how did you get through it?
          
                                 shane
                    you could say i just shut down my
                    emotions. i turned off all feelings and
                    dedicated myself to becoming the perfect
                    soldier.
          
                                  oe
                    i never even got to say good bye.

          a tear runs down zoe's face. she throws her arms around
          shane. the phone rings. shane answers it.
          
                                                        intercut with:
          
          j
