          ext. "price club" store - a moment later
          
          the cub scouts have all been tied with their own bandanas
          to the cart corral. shane comes out of the store, and
          catches lulu, using his "catchphrase."
          
                                 lulu
                    from now on, you do things our way -- no
                    highway option!
          
          the scouts nod, terrified. shane gives her a stern look,
          then laughs.
