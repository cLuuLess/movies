          int. plummer house - living room - later
          
          principal claire sits with the kids in the living room.
          from outside, they hear the front door open, and the
          sound of ominous, squishy footsteps.
          
          then the door swings open, revealing shane, looking like
          a swamp creature. everyone gasps, then covers their
          noses. a cute young cop enters behind shane. todd
          stiffens. zoe fixes her hair. the cop looks at them.
          
                                 cute cop
                    14 year old male, weird hair. 16 year old
                    female. ditto. (into his radio:) cancel
                    that a.p.b..
          
          the cop turns to shane, with a smirk.
          
                                 cute cop (cont'd)
                    in the future, use our nonemergency
                    number. that's the one to call if
                    nobody's fleein' or bleedin'.
          
          the cop leaves, zoe checks him out as he goes...
          
                                 claire
                    shane are you okay?
          
                                 shane
                           (eerily calm:)
                    just fine, thank you.
          
          covering her nose. the smell is bad.
          
                                 claire
                    i should probably get going then. if you
                    need anymore help... call.
          
          she practically gags as she passes him. shane looks
          around at scott and zoe, he doesn't say anything, but
          with his hand he makes a "my eyes on you" gesture.
