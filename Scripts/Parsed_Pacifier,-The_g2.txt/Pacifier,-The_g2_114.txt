          int. lulu's room - later
          
          shane tucks lulu into bed.
          
                                  ulu
                    tell me a story.
          
          shane looks at her surprised. he sits on the bed...
          stumped. then he starts:
          
                                shane
                    okay. let's see. once there was a family
                    of elves.
                                (more)
          
                                 t
          
          
          
          
                                 s
          
          
          
          
                                 l
          
          
          
          
                                                                 68.
                                 shane(cont'd)
                    one day, the little elf family -- uh.
                    went into the magic forest. to find a
                    secret gnome... facility, where gnomes
                    where turning mushrooms into... uranium.
                    the elves had to go in and take it out.
          
                                  ulu
                    why?
          
                                 shane
                    they were ordered to. by the elf unit
                    commander at elf station bravo. so --
                    they waited for cloud cover, and they
                    came in from the north...
          
          as shane finishes the story, he illustrates, setting up
          the scene with dolls, on lulu's floor.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    the elf team decided on an l ambush -- so
                    three elves formed a base leg and laid
                    down a heavy suppressive fire on the
                    gnomes while the others maneuvered around
                    to the right flank and walked through
                    finishing off anything left alive... i
                    mean standing...                    d
                                                         issolve to:
          
          an hour later:
          
          shane's really into the story. lulu's fallen asleep.
          shane's eyes are brimming with tears as he finishes:
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    ... and not one elf got left behind that
                    day. we got `em all. even, the teeniest
                    little elf of all -- rodriquez.
          
          then, from across the hall, peter wails.   todd pops his
          head in the door.
          
                                  odd
                    you have to do the panda dance... or he
                    won't stop.
          
                                 shane
                    oh, c'mon... i can't remember that thing.
          
                                 todd
                    i'll write it down for you...
          
          the wails get louder and louder...
          
                                 s
          
          
          
          
                                                                   69.
