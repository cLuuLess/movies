          helga, suitcases in hand, heads to the door -- shane
          tries to block her path. peter's in the aquarium. the
          duck flies around, quacking.
          
                                    helga
                    aggh!     these brats!   sugi pula!
          
                                 shane
                    red leader, remain calm --
          
          
                                                                   26.
          
          
          
                                 helga
                    i am calm. i quit, that makes me calm!
          
                                 shane
                    let's not be hasty.
          
          suddenly, ring! amid the chaos, shane moves for the
          phone. helga takes the opening and runs for the door. he
          grabs her suitcase. as she tries to wrestle it away,
          shane picks up the receiver.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    hello---
                           (sees helga crawling away)
                    don't even think about it.
          
          the suitcase handle breaks off, and helga dashes for the
          door. shane dives, grabbing her foot. he drags her back.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    ah, mrs. plummer.
                           (covering the phone, so julie
                            can't hear the struggle)
                    no no -- everything's fine. you're gonna
                    be gone how much longer?
          
           here's a pause, the camera dolly/zooms as he says it:
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    five business days?
          
           elga's shoe comes off -- helga falls forwards, and shane
          falls back, against the counter.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    that is not a problem. just doing my...
          
          he picks up his hand, that landed on a diaper.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    duty.
          
          helga's at the door. shane body-checks it closed. helga
          struggles to get him off. crunch. helga chomps down on
          shane's hand...
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    ah! things are great!!! you do what you
                    have to do.
          
          shane lets go. helga scampers out the door.
          
          
          
          
                                                                    27.
          
          
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    take care, mrs. plummer.
          
          shane hangs up the phone, as helga makes a dash down the
          path to a waiting cab.
