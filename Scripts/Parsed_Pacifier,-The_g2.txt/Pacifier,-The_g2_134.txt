          ext. "price club" store - evening
          
          the brownies sit at their cookie table beside the door.
          across the lot, the chubby cub scouts, at their own
          table, see them. the scouts head towards the brownies.
                                 u
                                  gly cub scout
                    hey skeever, what's in a girl scout's
                    pants when she has diarrhea?
          
                                  2nd scout
                    brown...
          
          he stops short, the brownies have moved into a formation,
          ready to strike, lulu at the front: it's (kind of) scary.
          
                                 lulu
                    go away and we won't hurt you.
          
          the scouts share a look -- they laugh. the head scout
          steps forward and grabs lulu's cookies. in one move, she
          spins out of the way and pulls off his neckerchief.
          
                                   gly cub scout
                    gimme that!
          
          he grabs the neckerchief, but like lightning, she wraps
          it around his arm, tying him. she shoves a cookie in his
          mouth.
          
                                                                 79.
          
          
          
                                 lulu
                    uh oh. you're gonna have to pay for that.
          
          the scout struggles, the other scouts are scared.
          
                                 ugly cub scout
                    let go! let go -- mommy!
          
          she lets him go -- in a flip, he lands on the ground
          hard. lulu lets out another "kia!" the girls move
          forward in unison, striking a cool pose.
