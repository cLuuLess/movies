          int. stairway - same time
          
          todd and zoe kneel on the stairs. they surreptitiously
          pour cooking oil all over the wood.
          
          then -- a creak. zoe whispers.
          
                                 zoe
                    here he comes...!
          
          zoe and todd run downstairs and hide behind the couch.
          
          f
          
          
          
          
                                                                24.
          
          
          
          shane strides to the top step and raps on the wall. he
          raps again, listening for hollow spaces. nothing. shane
          lifts his left foot out to take a step down...
          
          when he hears an alert from his laptop. he goes back to
          the living room, then turns his attention to his laptop.
          mr. chun's photo appears next to a vehicle registration.
          shane scans it...
          
          todd and zoe's faces fall. the footsteps again-
          
                                 todd
                    he's coming back-
          
          but helga, carrying a huge laundry basket, appears, takes
          a step onto the stairs --
          
                                  helga
                    ahhh!!!
          
          bump! bump! bump! she flies down the greased stairs,
          banging her head and ass on each step, all the way down.
          
            inally, bam! helga hits the bottom with a mighty crash.
          she screams, as laundry flutters down from above.
          t
           ight - zoe and todd
          
          they gulp, terrified.
          
                                  zoe
                    uh-oh.
