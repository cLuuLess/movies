          int. principal's office - moments later
          
          close up on: a stopwatch. it hits zero, and at that
          moment, the school's bell rings.
          
          holding the stopwatch is the vice principal murney
          (50's). he's huge and mean.
          
                  
          
          
                                                                33.
          
          
          
                                 murney
                    i always said these kids didn't need a
                    baby sitter, they needed a parole
                    officer. looks like mrs. plummer finally
                    listened.
          
          he glares at shane, and the kids: shane sits with tyler
          in a snuggle, holding peter on a harness, as he plays on
          the floor. the kids are seated around him, mortified.
          
                                  murney (cont'd)
                           (to shane)
                    what's your name, son?
          
                                 shane
                    wolfe. shane. lieutenant. i'm in charge
                    of watching these kids for... a few days.
          
          murney is unimpressed.
          
                                 murney
                     aby-sitter huh. well, whatever work you
                    can get. i'm murphy. duane. v.p in charge
                    of discipline, conduct and truancy. top
                    to bottom, k thru 12. you're in my house
                    now, boy. i coach wrestling, too. (re:
                    todd:) and the creeper here played hookey
                    from every wrestling practice this month.
          
          the kids crack up. murney is furious.
          
                                 murney (cont'd)
                    she's missed twenty-two driver's ed
                    classes. out of twenty-three. they're the
                    worst students in my school.
          
                                    oman's voice
                    your school?
          
          murney grimaces as principal claire nelson (early 30's)
          enters. she's attractive, assured, tough. he withers.
          
                                 principal claire
                    good morning kids. what are you doing in
                    my office, murney?
          
                                 murney
                    i was explaining, that as vice principal,
                    i am in charge of....
          
          
                                                                     34.
          
          
          
                                 principal claire
                    very little. i thought i asked you to
                    find out who stuck to the baloney slices
                    to the cafeteria ceiling with mustard?
          
                                 murney
                    i'm got some leads. (then, confidential:)
                    my informant's about to crack.
          
                                 principal claire
                    then hop to it. i think i can handle this
                    from here.
          
          the opens the door for murney. he exits, fuming.     the
          bell rings.
          
                                 shane
                    red 1, red 2. get moving.
          
          the teens hustle off to their classes. shane checks his
          tracker -- two little red dots move away. good.
          
          principal claire eyeballs him... staring him up and down,
          as he casually holds the three kids.
          
                                 principal claire
                    so. you're the new baby-sitter?
          
                                 shane
                    bodyguard. you see, mrs. plummer called
                    my captain, she thought the kids needed -
          
                                 principal claire
                    it's okay, lieutenant, i was briefed of
                    the situation by mrs. plummer. she told
                    me all about you.
          
          she notices navy seal tattoo on his upper arm. claire
          sees this -- and suddenly reacts, impressed.
          
                                 principal claire (cont'd)
                    lieutenant, huh? you with "the teams?"
                           (shane nods.)
                    petty officer third class claire nelson
                    at your service.
          
                                 shane
                    ... you're kidding?
          
                                 principal claire
                    four years at naval base coronado.   the
                    service paid for my college.

          shane stares not sure whether to believe. on the spot,
          claire looks nervously around. she lifts her pants leg...
          revealing a tiny anchor tattoo on her ankle.
          
                                   shane
                      "honor, courage...
          
                                   principal claire
                      commitment". that's the way i live my
                      life, and the way i run my school.
          
                                   shane
                      can't be too careful. so. permission to
                      stick around and keep eyes on the kids?
          
          she smiles.
          
                                   principal claire
                      permission granted. welcome aboard. just
                      try not to frighten the children.
          
                                   shane
                      no one will even notice i'm here.
