          int. 2nd grade classroom - continuous
          
          2nd graders are sitting on the floor. lulu is in front of
          the class, with the panic button in her hand. the board
          reads: show and tell. shane lands in fight stance -- the
          class applauds. next to lulu is a very upstaged little
          boy with a frog. lulu sticks her tongue out at him.
          
                                 lulu
                    see! my nanny can kick your nanny's butt.
          
          shane is furious, but the final bell rings. at that
          moment, his tracker alarm sounds again. he looks:
          
          close-up on the tracker screen: two dots labeled red 1
          and red 2, are heading away from the school fast.
