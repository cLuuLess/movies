          int. fishing boat/control deck - continuous
          
          a surge of electrical force blasts from the control
          panel. sparks fly.
          
          the two serbian men jolt backwards -- wham -- and hit the
          wall. all the needles inside all the dials go limp. the
          roar of the engines dies and the boat stops.
