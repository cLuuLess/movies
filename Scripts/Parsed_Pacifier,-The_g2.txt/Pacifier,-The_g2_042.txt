          int. hallway - night
          
          the bathroom door opens, and todd comes sauntering back.
          he sees shane, the destroyed door and wall...
          
                                 shane
                    all i need is a hammer and some plaster
                    of paris. i can fix this.
          
          a piece of the ceiling falls, hits shane on the head.
          
                                 todd
                    can i get by?
          
          embarrassed, shane steps aside, then mutters-
          
                                 shane
                    here's your bracelet. if you'd been
                    wearing it, this wouldn't have happened.
          
          shane snaps it onto todd's wrist, and head down the hall,
          patrolling. zoe comes up the stairs, to her room. she
          stops at todd's door -- they glare at shane.
          
                                 zoe
                    he has to go.
          
          todd nods in agreement.
