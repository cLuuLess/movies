          shane leads the brownie troop through combat exercises.
          in unison, the girls punch, kick. punch, punch, kick.
          shane's got tyler's cradle next to him, in between
          punches, in perfect tempo, he reaches out and rocks it.
          the duck watches all this -- fascinated.
