          int. plummer house - night
          
           hane marches zoe up the stairs. loud, angry rock music
          blares from todd's room.
          
                                 shane
                    your mother thought you were in real
                    danger. you should have told her the
                    truth.
          
                                 zoe
                    who do you think you are -- my dad?
          
          zoe starts to turn -- then suddenly spins and tries
          kicking him in the crotch. but shane catches her foot --
          and whirls her away. she has to hop on one foot, to not
          fall over. he "hops" her down the hall to her room.

                                                                 18.
          
          
          
                                 zoe (cont'd)
                    let me go! it's saturday night.   i have
                    plans!
          
          zoe's back to her door, shane flips her foot in the air.
          zoe falls backwards into the room. shane shuts her door.
          
                                   shane
                    not anymore.
          
          shane marches back down the hall, bangs on todd's door-
          
                                   shane (cont'd)
                    lights out.
          
                                   todd (o.s.)
                    bite me!
          
          shane frowns, continues down the hall. he passes the
          nursery (peter and tyler's room), where helga is singing
          a lullaby: (as annoying has something barney might sing).
          
                                  elga
                    when you're down and low, lower than the
                    floor.
                    and you feel like you ain't got a chance.
                    don't make a move `til you're in the
                    groove, and do the peter panda dance.
                    just hop three times like a kangaroo --
          
          she does a little "dance" that goes with the lullaby: she
          hops forwards three times, then "crab-walks" sideways.
          
                                 helga (cont'd)
                    sidestep twice, just like the crabs do.
                    three steps forward, one step back.
          
          she does. the children, in bed -- laugh and laugh.
          
                                 helga (cont'd)
                    then quick like a turtle lie on your
                    back!
                     riggle like a snake `til you can't no
                    more.
          
           he wriggles on the floor. then jumps up, to their beds.
          shane shakes his head, keeps walking-
          
                                 shane
                    this family's in for a rude awakening.
