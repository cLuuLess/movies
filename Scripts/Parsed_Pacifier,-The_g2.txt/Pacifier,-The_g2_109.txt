          int. todd's room - continuous
          
          shane knocks on todd's door. nothing. he enters. the
          window is wide open, shane checks his window alarm --
          there's a refrigerator magnet stuck to it, keeping the
          contact, so the alarm didn't go off.
          
                                 shane
                    smart kid.
          
          shane looks out the window -- far down the block, he can
          see todd, running around the corner. shane hops out the
          window. he sees zoe, peering out her window.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    zoe, you're in charge. if anyone gets
                    within forty clicks of the perimeter,
                    signal me. keep all doors sealed, do your
                    homework, preheat the oven, and make sure
                    lulu brushes her teeth!
          
          
                                                                   63.
          
          
          
          he starts to shut the window, but the duck leaps up on
          the sill.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    you want in or out?
          
          the duck leaps out. shane screws the window shut. on the
          corner, shane sees todd climbing on to a city bus.
          
          shane picks a girl's bicycle up off the front lawn. it's
          pink, with a flowered basket. it's small for him, but he
          hops on and pedals furiously after the bus.
