          the brownies are trying to sell the cookies, but they're
          very shy. shoppers blow passed them without even noticing
          them. one of the brownies spots something...
          
                              
          
                                                                46.
          
          
          
                                 brownie
                    oh no... they're back.
          
          slow motion: in a shot out of reservoir dogs, we see who
          she means: a group of bad ass, chubby cub scouts. they're
          headed straight towards the cookie table, menacingly.
          
                                 ugly cub scout
                           (to another scout)
                    hey skeever, what's stinky and floats
                    `til you flush `em?
          
                                 2nd scout
                    brownies?
          
          the scouts cackle. the ugly scout yanks a box of cookies
          away from lulu. he rips it open, dumping the cookies on
          the ground and grinding uthem with his foot.
          
                                 ugly cub scout
                    this is troop 16 territory. how are we
                    supposed to sell raffle tickets when this
                    place reeks of your skanky cookies?
          
                                 2nd scout
                    beat it, before i get my face punching
                    badge on you.
          
          the brownies take off running, clutching their boxes. one
          of the scouts grabs lulu -- she tugs and tugs, but can't
          get away. finally, the cub scout takes her scarf. he
          laughs, and lets her go. the cub scouts high-five.
