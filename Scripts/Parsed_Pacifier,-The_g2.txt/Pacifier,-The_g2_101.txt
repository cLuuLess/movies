          shane and the kids sit around shane's computer. shane
          slips the ghost cd in the disc drive, pushes play --
          
                                 shane
                    c'mon c'mon c'mon...

          the sound comes on: it's music. "unchained melody." and
          then, picture: demi moore and patrick swayze at a pottery
          wheel. shane is furious -- a long pause. then...
          
          zoe laughs: she can't help it, it's been a long night.
          then, the other kids join in. soon, even shane is
          laughing too: the telephone rings -- they all jump,
          startled. zoe answers it, all smiles, she tries to play
          it cool and not frighten her mother:
          
                                 zoe
                    hey mom we're fine, absolutely nothing
                    happened you should worry about. nope.
          
          shane takes the phone.
