          ext. east bethesda k-12 school - mid-morning
          
          shane, dead serious, (tyler in snuggle) is riding the see-
          saw in the school's playground. peter rides on the other
          side with a group of kids, to balance shane. shane types
          on his laptop: claire nelson. a picture of claire in a
          naval uniform pops up as well as her stats...
          
                                   shane
                      clean as a whistle.
          
          shane closes the computer, picks up a pair of binoculars.
          
           binoculars p.o.v. as shane goes from window to window of
          the school: zoe is glaring at him through the window from
          her seat in a class. todd, sitting in the back row of a
          class, yanks his hood over his head. lulu waves from 2nd
          grade, delighted.
          
          along line of first graders wait for the seesaw.
          
                                   shane (cont'd)
                      back off. official business.

          on the playground:
          
          shane stands with his baby snuggle. peter is running in
          circles around him on his harness, like a tether ball. he
          checks his tracking device...
