          int. the gym - moments later
          
          shane enters. zoe sits in a folding chair, mortified. she
          is holding a broken-off side view mirror. murney stands,
          principal claire next to him. they look concerned.
          
                                 shane
                    don't worry. so, she wrecked a driver's
                    ed. car -- she'll pay for the damage...
          
                                 murney
                    that? lady drivers, what do you expect.
                    no, it's not that -- it's the boy...
          
                                 shane
                    red two? i mean todd?
          
          claire nods. shane gives zoe a look. zoe shrugs.
          
                                 principal claire
                    ordinarily i would wait for his mother to
                    return... but -- i'm a bit concerned, and
                    i'm not sure what to do...
          
                                 shane
                    has he been skipping class?
          
                                principal claire
                    well -- yes. he does always miss sixth
                    period. but this...
          
          murney calls into the hallway. todd enters. shane stops,
          in shock: todd's long hair is all shaved off, he now has
          a bleach blonde buzz cut, giving him a "skinhead" look.
          
                
          
          
                                                                  61.
          
          
          
                                 murney
                    this is how he showed up to practice. and
                    that's not all. i was doing a little re-
                    con in his locker... and i found this:
          
          murney hands shane a book and shane flips through it.
          it's a book of photographs of nazi uniforms. shane
          scowls.
          
                                 murney (cont'd)
                    if he'd had hustler or something, boys
                    will be boys -- but this is just sick.
          
                                 shane
                    he's not a nazi.
          
                                 principal claire
                    it's certainly not normal.
                           (pulls shane aside.)
                    see if you can talk to the boy.   find out
                    what's going on.
          
          shane shakes his head: todd is worse than he thought.
          todd and zoe stand to go, and shane walks them out.
          
          the wrestling team is assembled, stretching. they snicker
          and shake their heads at todd, as he passes. shane walks
          the kids out, and murney chases after him.
          
                                 murney
                      hope you won't go light on him -- that
                    whole family's no good, if you ask me.
          
                                 shane
                    i'll talk to him.
          
                                 murney
                    you're a good man, shane. bet you're a
                    hell of a fighter on the mats, huh?
                           (shane ignores him, and keeps
                            walking.)
                    maybe sometime we oughta strap up, we'll
                    give these boys a treat.
          
          he "fake-punches" one of his boys -- who flinches like
          murney has maybe hurt him a couple times. murney laughs.
          
                                 shane
                    another time, maybe...
          
                                 murney
                    it's a date then. i'll show you a couple
                    moves. i promise i won't hurt you.
          
                              
          
                                                                   62.
          
          
          
          shane walks away. without warning, murney lets out a kung
          fu scream, and leaps at shane, kicking him in the back,
          shane trips forwards to his knees. murney tells his team:
          
                                 murney (cont'd)
                    see that? you never know when your
                    adversary is going to strike!
          
                                 shane
                    did you kick me in the back? is there a
                    footprint on my jacket?
          
          shane dusts off his back, and leaves.
          
                                 murney
                    come on frogman! don't be a sissy!
          
          shane turns back. it looks like shane might fight, but
          instead he takes a deep breath, and leaves. murney shakes
          his head, and snickers to his team.
