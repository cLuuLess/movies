          zoe pulls to the curb, almost tapping a bus's rear
          fender. shane unclenches his teeth.
          
                                 shane
                    good. next lesson, 1500 hours.
          
          zoe smiles. and the other kids all bolt from the car,
          terrified. lulu makes a big show of kissing the ground.
          
                                 zoe
                    ha ha ha. very funny.

           hey head into the school.   shane spots something.
          
          another angle reveals: scott (zoe's boyfriend), with a
          few friends, laughing, being obnoxious. shane jumps out
          of the car. before scott knows what's happened, shane's
          lifted him in the air by his backpack. scott's terrified.
          
                                 shane
                    i know 437 ways to hurt a man without
                    touching him. broken promises lead to
                    broken legs. do we understand each other?
          
          scott nods, trembling. shane lets him down and heads into
          school.
