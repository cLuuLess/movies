          int. old factory - night
          
          todd and "liesl" work on the you are sixteen dance.
          
                                    odd
                      ... your life little girl, is an empty
                      page/that men will want to write on...
          t
           odd tries the spinning kick, but blows it, landing hard.
          shane blows a whistle.
          
                                   shane
                      why don't we just let the nazis win
                      tonight -- huh? now. from the top --
                      think of yourself as a gazelle prancing
                      over the plains. graceful.
          
          todd tries the kick. thud!    shane blows the whistle.
          
                                    shane (cont'd)
                      gazelle.   prancing. graceful.   again.
