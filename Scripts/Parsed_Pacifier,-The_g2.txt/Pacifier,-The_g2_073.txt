          int. kitchen - later
          
          tyler is in a high-chair, peter rocks in a cradle-swing.
          
          shane enters, in just a towel. he sees on the fridge;
          helga's shopping list -- all junk food. he looks at it,
          cringing in disgust, before he notices:
          
          sitting around the table are lulu's entire brownie troop -
          - a dozen little girls in uniforms, they're staring at
          him. the brownies applaud, and whistle.
          
                                 brownie
                     oo hoo! hubba hubba!
          
          shane covers up and leaps into the family room, pulling
          lulu after him.
