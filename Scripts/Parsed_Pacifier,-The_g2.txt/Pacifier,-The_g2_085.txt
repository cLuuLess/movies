          int. chuck e. cheese - a little later - day
          
          an extreme cu of the chuck e. cheese manager. he wears
          braces and head-gear, which causes him to lisp.
          
                                 manager
                    welcome to chuck e. cheese!
          
          wider reveals...chaos. screaming children everywhere.
          on stage, the chuck e. cheese automaton band jams.
          
                                 shane
                    i wish i were in chechnya.
          
          a little later:
          
                 
          
                                                                   48.
          
          
          
          brownies are running around, playing video games and skee
          ball. shane's watching peter, in the plastic ball pool,
          while he holds tyler in the snuggle. the manager
          approaches shane.
          
                                 manager
                    anything elsh i can do for you?
          
                                 shane
                    in a big glass (he shows him)   this much
                    ice... this much cyanide.
          
          the manager laughs, but the headgear seems to hurt his
          face when he smiles.
          
                                 manager
                    how `bout a re-fill on that pischer of
                    mischer pibb?
          
                                   shane
                    what?
          
                                 manager
                           (gesturing:)
                    pischer of mischer pibb?   mischer pibb?
          
          frustrated, the manager picks up a pitcher and exits.
          lulu approaches, she grabs shane by the sleeve and drags
          him over to the stand up mortal kombat game.
          
                                   lulu
                    let's fight!
          
                                 shane
                    i'm watching your brother...
          
                                 lulu
                    i pressed two player. i thought you liked
                    combat. unless you're scared.
          
          shane doesn't like the sound of that. he steps up to the
          machine. he cracks his knuckles, stretches. then he takes
          a joy stick. he checks over his shoulder -- peter's
          happily splashing about in the plastic balls.
          
          on the screen: they each select a fighter. lulu picks a
          small female character. shane picks a man who looks like
          shane. they begin, lulu screams out with her fighter, in
          unison:
          
                                 video game/lulu
                    prepare to be annihilated!
          
                                
          
                                                                49.
          
          
          
          she leaps over shane in a somersault and throws a dozen
          throwing stars. then kicks him in the head repeatedly.
          
                                 shane
                    that's not fair. nobody can jump thirty
                    feet.
          
                                 lulu
                    the hulk can.
          
                                 shane
                    that wasn't a documentary.
          
          the second round starts, brownies have gathered around to
          watch. lulu's fighter does a series of kicks. shane can't
          even get one punch in -- she pins him to the ground,
          kneels on his head, then kicks him in the face. shane is
          taking it really seriously. he's really mad.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    this isn't fair. my joystick's broken.
          
                                 lulu
                    you wanna switch?
          
          they switch sides. round three starts. lulu's fighter
          picks up shane's in the air, spins her, then cracks her
          in half over his knee... and then a kick in the face.
          
                                 shane
                           (re: the snuggle)
                    you don't have a baby on your chest...
          
          lulu's having fun now, she's just avoiding shane's
          fighter, dancing, jumping, while he pounds the buttons,
          swinging and missing... shane's really fuming.
          
                                 lulu
                    you're not even trying...
          
                                 shane
                    i am too trying.
          
                                 lulu
                    too slow... come on -- take a shot...
                    oops too slow... swing and a miss...
          
          she keeps dancing. it's really annoying. shane's working
          the joy stick hard, slamming buttons, but he can't hit
          her. he is ko'd. she does a very obnoxious victory dance.
          
                               
          
                                                                  50.
          
          
          
                                 lulu (cont'd)
                    in your face! i am the greatest hand-to-
                    hand combat champion in the entire world!
          
          shane screams and rips the joystick off the machine.
          sparks fly. shane looks around to see if the staff
          noticed. he and the brownies sneak away, leaving the
          sizzling machine, its joystick dangling by its wires.
