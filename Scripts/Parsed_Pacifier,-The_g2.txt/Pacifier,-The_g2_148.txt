                    in to my co, whoever's been bothering you
                    guys won't be bothering you anymore.
          
          everyone reacts happily, relieved.   except for -- lulu.
          she looks stricken.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    what's wrong, lulu? you should be happy.

          he goes silent.    tongue-tied, he has no answer.
