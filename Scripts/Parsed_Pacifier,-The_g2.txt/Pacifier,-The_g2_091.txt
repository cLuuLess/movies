          int. chuck e. cheese - later - dusk
          
          shane (tyler in snuggle) bursts in, the brownies follow.
          we see what he forgot: peter, still happily playing in
          the pool of plastic balls. the manager is watching him.
          
                                 manager
                    i figured you'd come back for him -- they
                    almost always do.
          
                                 shane
                    inexcusable, to leave a man behind like
                    that...
          
                                 manager
                    relax, we once found a kid in the ball
                    pool when we opened in the morning --
          
          shane wades into the ball pool and pulls peter out, which
          is fine, except that he's missing his diaper.
          
                                 manager (cont'd)
                    whoa, whoa. not okay, freestyling in the
                    ball pool -- not okay.
          
          s
          
          
          
          
                                                                    52.
          
          
          
          shane grimaces. he holds his breath, and goes down for
          the diaper. he disappears under the balls -- for a long
          time. the manager and the brownies share a concerned
          look. he's still down there. silence.
          
                                 lulu
                    should we send someone in after him?
          
          he surfaces, gasping. he's holding the diaper, out away
          from him. he charges across the room with the diaper.
          
                                 shane
                    clear out! go go go!
          
          and he bursts out the other doors, at a full run.
