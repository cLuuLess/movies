          the armed guards stop shooting into the water. one of
          our seals calls out to them, in perfect serbian:
          
                                 seal
                    keep shooting!
          
          the guards fire again. the seal speaks into his neck mic.
          
                                 seal (cont'd)
                    give it a second, they're almost out of
                    ammo.
          
          the seal calls out: "shoot more, more!" they do, until
          there's nothing but empty clicks from their guns.
          
                                 seal (cont'd)
