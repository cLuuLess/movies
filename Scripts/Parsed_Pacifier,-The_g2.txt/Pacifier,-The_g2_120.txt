          int. bethesda k-12 school, cafeteria - lunchtime
          
          shane (peter in lap, tyler in snuggle) keeps an eye on
          the kids at their tables. kids boisterously run past.
          suddenly -- claire barks out.
          
                                  rincipal claire
                    children... stop running!!
          
          the kids instantly freeze. claire strides into view.
          she's wearing a cute dress, and a little make-up.
          
                                 principal claire (cont'd)
                           (a long, severe stare)
                    now... walk! double time.
          
          chastened, the kids gulp and orderly march away. shane's
          eyes alight, impressed.
          
                                  shane
                    wow.   i'm glad i never had you for a co.
          
                                 s

                                                                72.
          
          
          
                                 principal claire
                           (she coyly smiles)
                    i've noticed improvement in your troops
                    lately, too. noon and none of them have
                    been called to my office. it's a miracle.
          s
           he sits beside him, and offers him a milk.
          
                                  rincipal claire (cont'd)
                    buy you a drink, sailor?
          
                                 shane
                    thanks.
          
           hey eat in silence. shane`s not so good at small talk.
          she's waiting for him to say... something.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    you look nice today.
          
                                 principal claire
                    this old thing? well, you never know who
                    you're going to run into.
          
          she smiles. he smiles back... suddenly, there's a
          commotion: murney is marching todd towards them, dragging
          him by the ear. principal claire sighs "not again." in
          one move, shane leaps over the table. principal claire
          watches him leap:
          
                                 principal claire (cont'd)
                    ... love it when he does that.
          
          murney shoves todd forward.
          
                                 murney
                    i've had it. i just caught this boy
                    dancing under the bleachers like some
                    kind of bavarian fruitcake.
          
          murney gets up in shane's face.
          
                                 murney (cont'd)
                    i want this freak outta my school and
                    into treatment. somebody needs to give
                    this punk a talking to...
          
                                 todd
                    hey. i'm right here. talk.
          e
           veryone is shocked that todd talked back. a hushed
          whisper goes through the cafeteria. murney turns around.
          
                                 m
          
          
          
          
                                                                   73.
          
          
          
                                 murney
                    you got something to say? boy?
          
                                 todd
                    yeah. yeah i do. i quit, murney.
          
          a hushed "oooh" goes through the students.
          
                                 murney
                    winners never quit, boy. what're you so
                    scared of, freak?
          
          the students snicker. todd looks, intimidated. then:
          
                                 todd
                    i am not scared. i... i want to sing.
          
          silence. no one's sure they heard him right. todd pulls
          out a stack of sound of music flyers and hands them out.
          todd is on the poster in his rolf costume. principal
          claire takes one: she laughs, now it all makes sense.
          
                                 todd (cont'd)
                    i'm in sound of music. it opens friday...
          
                                 murney
                    a musical? you're blowing off wrestling
                    for a musical? (to shane:) this is what
                    happens when there's no man in the house.
          
                                 todd
                    there is a man in my house -- me. (murney
                    turns:) let's get one thing clear. i'm
                    not quitting cause i hate wresting. i'm
                    quitting because you're a bad coach. you
                    suck. the whole team wants to quit. i'm
                    the only one with the guts to do it.
          m
           urney looks over at the team. they look to the ground
          sheepishly, todd's telling the truth. murney looks
          around, humiliated, furious --
          
                                  urney
                    so -- you're a tough guy now?
          
          murney takes one step towards todd -- shane steps between
          them, protecting him.
          
                                 murney (cont'd)
                    stay out of this, baby sitter!
          
          murney glares at him -- face to face. so calm, it's scary
          
                    s
          
          
          
          
                                                                   74.
          
          
          
                                 shane
                    you said you wanted to wrestle. you win.
                    let's do it.
          
          everyone is watching. murney did not expect to be called
          out. his voice cracks -- then he regains his calm:
          
                                 murney
                    after school. the gym. your ass is mine.
          
          he storms out. there is a stunned moment -- and then a
          mob of students, and a lot of cute girls, swarm todd,
          taking flyers. shane gives todd a proud thumbs up.
          
          a quick series of shots: of students whispering to other
          students, passing notes: a kid opens a note -- it reads:
          "murney's getting his ass kicked. 3:00."
