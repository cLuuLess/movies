          int. cafeteria - lunch time
          
          binoculars p.o.v.: five hundred students eat at long
          tables. zoe, with a group of hip friends, turns her back
          to him embarrassed. todd, in line to get lunch, does the
          same. lulu sees shane and waves.
          
          shane puts down his binoculars. he turns to the person in
          front of him, with stern intensity.
          
                                 shane
                    give up now. save us both a world of
                    pain. now -- last time: open the hanger,
                    black hawk coming in.
          
          reveal: shane is talking to tyler, in his safety seat --
          trying to get him to eat. beside shane, peter is
          destroying a sandwich with animal crackers.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    open in t minus three, two, one...
          
          tyler gurgles, ignoring him. shane sighs. principal
          claire sits next to shane with her lunch tray.
          
                                 principal claire
                    what would you say is the secret with
                    kids, mr. wolfe?
          
                                 shane
                    show no weakness.
          
                                  rincipal claire
                    i'll drink to that. (she toasts, with
                    milk.) shane... can i call you shane?
          
                                 shane
                    ... sure.
          
                                 principal claire
                    so. when you agreed to serve your
                    country, i bet you didn't know you'd be
                    serving creamed bananas to one year olds,
                    huh?
          
          shane gives her a look. principal claire smiles.
          
                     
          
                                                                   37.
          
          
          
                                 shane
                    hey -- i out rank you, you know.
          
                                 principal claire
                    not here, you don't. you're on dry land,
                    lieutenant. (she looks at his chair)
                    well, not so dry where you're sitting, i
                    guess.
          
          shane sees that tyler is pouring his juice box all over
          shane's pants. he yanks tyler away from him.
          
                                 shane
                    oh, man...
          
          tyler starts to cry -- but shane stops him from crying by
          making a funny face. tyler laughs. claire smiles.
          
                                 principal claire
                    don't take this personally -- but you're
                    pretty good at this. seriously, i'm
                    impressed. a whole day, and all three
                    plummer's stayed out of trouble.
                    that's... unusual.
          
          suddenly there's a huge crash around the corner, and the
          sound of students in an uproar. shane hands tyler off to
          the principal and leaps over the table...
