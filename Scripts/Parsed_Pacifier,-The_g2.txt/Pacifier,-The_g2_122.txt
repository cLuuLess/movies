                    if you're ever lost in the woods, the
                    first thing you have to do is find a
                    source of drinking water! and make sure
                    it's potable. if you're not sure, boil
                    it for thirty minutes!
          
          the girls are loving it, fascinated.

                    no brownies   either. a lot of roots are
                    edible. so    is some tree bark. when i
                    halo'd into   rwanda, i lived off the
                    underground   fern stem for three weeks!
          
          shane kicks over a rock.    underneath are crawling bugs.

                    insects. they look nasty but they're full
                    of nutrients that may save your life.
          
                                                                76.
