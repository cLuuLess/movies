          int. living room - day
          
          julie sits, shane stands "at ease" (which doesn't look
          "at ease" at all).
          
                                 shane
                    you have a pleasant family, ma'am.
          
                         
          
                                                                  12.
          
          
          
                                 julie
                    charles wasn't around too much. his work
                    took him all over the world. he'd be gone
                    six or seven months at a time. so i
                    think for the younger ones it's a little
                    confusing. zoe and todd... well, they're
                    dealing like your normal teenagers.
                    maybe in todd's case semi-normal.
          
                                 shane
                    mrs. plummer, i have to tell you that i
                    did everything i could...
          
                                  julie
                    charles was in a dangerous business. i
                    knew it when i married him. no one's to
                    blame here.
                            (beat)
                    everyone thinks that charles told me or
                    the kids where he hid it. and until
                    g.h.o.s.t. is found, we're all in danger.
          
                                 shane
                    nothing will happen to your family as
                    long as i'm here. i've dealt with much...
          
          suddenly from behind shane's head a duck appears and
          nibbles his ear. shane spins in full fight stance. he
          sees the duck... and relaxes. sort of.
          
                                 julie
                    that's gary. he was charles'.
          
          the duck quacks angrily. confused, shane returns to "at
          ease," keeping one eye on the duck.
          
                                 shane
                    mrs. plummer-
          
                                 julie
                    call me julie.
          
          beat.
          
                                 shane
                    ... mrs. plummer, i'll go secure the
                    perimeter.
          
                                 julie
                    i'm glad you're here-
          
          
          
          
                                                                    13.
          
          
          
          but shane is already gone.
          
                                                                 cut to:
          
          montage. military music plays:
          
          shane secures the area.       he paces off the yard.
          
          he mounts surveillance cameras in the eaves.
          
          he attaches contact alarms in the doors and windows.
          
          shane climbs a telephone pole, opens the circuit box and
          taps the phones.
          
          shane, now wearing an ear transmitter, crawls through the
          shrubs, hiding electric eyes.
          
           nighttime -- the family eats dinner. we slowly pull
          out... through the kitchen window... and reveal shane
          with night vision goggles on scoping the property.
          
          the phone rings inside. through the window, julie
          casually answers it. shane touches his ear transmitter
          and listens as he walks into the house.
          
                                 bill (o.s.)
                    julie, it's bill fawcett. i have some
                    potentially good news.
          
                                    julie
                    what is it?
          
                                 bill (o.s.)
                    a safety deposit box under charles' name
                    was just found in switzerland. i think
                    it could contain ghost.
          
                                 julie
                    that's wonderful. this could all be over!
          
                                 bill (o.s.)
                    there's a catch. swiss law says only his
                    family can access it. i'm going to need
                    you on a plane tomorrow morning.
