          ext. east bethesda k-12 school - 9:29 a.m.
          
          a big suburban school, busses and parents are parked at
          the curb, students of all ages are hurrying inside. the
          minivan skids completely sideways, into a tiny parking
          spot -- a death defying, perfect parallel park.
