          int. hallway - seconds later
          
          composing himself, shane approaches zoe's door.     he
          quietly knocks.
          
                                   shane
                     kids.   it's safe. you can open up.
          
          a long pause -- then the door creaks open. the kids run
          out and hug shane with all their strength, bawling. todd
          and zoe enter, terrified. shane isn't sure what to do...
          then, he hugs peter and lulu. he really hugs them.
          
                                  lulu
                     please don't leave us shane.
          
                                  shane
                     i'm not going anywhere.
          
          he hugs them, even zoe is crying and hugging shane.
          
                                  zoe
                     i'm sorry for giving you a hard time.
          
                                  shane
                     shhh... it's okay.
          
                                  todd
                     who were they? what did they want...?
          
                                  shane
                     they're looking for a program, that your
                     father invented.
          
                                  zoe
                     so mom's not paranoid? there really are
                     people out to get us.
          
          he takes out the cd labeled ghost.
          
                                  shane
                     they're not after you. they want this.
                     but nothing's gonna happen to you, as
                     long as i'm here. and i'm not going
                     anywhere.
          
                                                                   58.
          
          
          
          the kids shudder, relieved. they hug him tighter. he
          looks zoe, eye to eye. he dries her tears:
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    but i can't do this without your help,
                    okay? we need a little more cooperation
                    here. (the kids nod) tell you what --
                    let's start over. from now on, you listen
                    to me, and do what i say. (to zoe and
                    todd:) and i... i'll listen to you too.
                    deal? truce -- okay?
          
          zoe and todd nod. shane offers his hand to shake. they
          shake -- then they hug him, too.
