          int. ship's hold - continuous
          
          professor plummer panics, as the water rises up to his
          mouth he struggles, but can't get free. up to his nose,
          over his head.... he's gone.
          
          then shane wolf rises out of the water, hauling the
          professor up. he cuts the professor's gag. plummer
          screams. shane removes his mouth piece. shane doesn't
          seem the slightest bit fazed by the circumstances.
          
                                 shane
                    lieutenant shane wolfe, united states
                    navy. i'm gonna get you outta here. but
                    you have to do exactly what i say, when i
                    say it. my way -- no highway option. do
                    you copy?
                           (plummer nods, terrified.)
                    where's the briefcase?
          
          the professor gestures across the room, where a metal
          briefcase is floating. shane calmly handcuffs it to his
          own waist. as the water rises, to the roof.
          
                                 plummer
                    how did you know where i...
          
          shane sticks the mouth piece into plummer's mouth, giving
          him his oxygen.
