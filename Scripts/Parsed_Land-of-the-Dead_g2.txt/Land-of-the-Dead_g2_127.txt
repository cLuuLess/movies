      three dinghies lie, upside down, next to the water's edge.      
      slack shoves one into the river, climbing onto its upturned     
      bottom. she pushes off. the boat doesn't budge. a tether        
      holds it within inches of the shore.                            
      slack pulls out a jackknife and goes to cut the rope, but...



      ...rats snap at her hands. slack recoils, but keeps cutting.    
      finally, the rope frays, enough for the boat to pull free.

      slack crouches on top of the upturned hull. no way to steer.    
      no paddles. the current carrying her away.
