     int. dead reckoning - night




     riley and mike step into a tight, uncomfortable space.           

                                                                      

     generators whir. gears turn. the two men open a storage
     locker and strap on ammo belts as...                             




                                                                      

     ...something terrible looms out of the shadows! it moves
     toward riley and mike, who can't see it from behind the          
     locker. the left side of the thing's face has been burned        
     away. only scar-tissue remains, and a single usable eye
     bulging from a socket.



     riley turns. sees the thing. and, surprisingly, he relaxes,      
     recognizing charlie houk, a heavily-armed guerilla whose
     intellect is as burned as his face.




                        charlie

              tcha doin', riley?




                        riley

              havin' a bad dream.




                        charlie

              i have bad dreams. hell, yes. just
              look at me, you can tell that i
              have terrible dreams.




                                                                














                                                       6.











                   riley

         the town is full of walkers.




                   charlie

         every town is full of walkers.




                   riley

         these aren't just walking. they're
         like...regular folks.




                   charlie

         but they're dumb, riley. hell, dead
         folks is near as dumb as me!




                   riley

         you learned how to make yourself
         useful. that's what they're doing.                     

                   woman's voice (o.s.)

         they dumped the trash. cholo's on                      
         his way.



riley and mike look across the room in the direction of the     

                                                                

voice. twenty feet away, a woman sits at the controls of what
looks like a scavenged airplane cockpit that's outfitted with   
a mixture of high- and low-tech equipment. she wears a black    

                                                                

leather jacket with "pretty boy" emblazoned across the back.




                   mike                                         


                                                                

         (surprised) pretty boy's a dame?




                   riley


                                                                

         this one is. last one was a guy.




                   mike                                         

         what happened to him?                                  
pretty boy turns, poking her finger through a bullet hole       
encrusted with year-old blood in the chest of her jacket.       

                   pretty boy                                   

         i kept his jacket. for good luck.                      

                   mike                                         

         luck?                                                  

                   riley                                        

         put some flowers in the graveyard.                     
pretty boy reaches out and flips a toggle switch on the         
control panel. thoomb! thoomb! deep concussive sounds can be    
felt as much as heard as...
