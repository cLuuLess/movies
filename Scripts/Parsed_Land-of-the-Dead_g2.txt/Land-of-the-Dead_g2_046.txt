     the steel doors under the "subway" sign open and cholo strides 
     out with his team. a depot guard steps forward as the doors    
     close and lock automatically behind them.                      

                        depot guard                                  

              what's up, cholo?




                        cholo

              (flashing an official-looking
              paper) takin' the truck out.

              you just got back in this morning.                      

                        cholo

              nobody gets a day off these days.




                        depot guard                                   

              (taking cholo's paper) hey, wait a                      
              minute this is from yesterday.                          

                        cholo

              (keeping his cool) oh, i must have                      
              given you the wrong one. here...



     cholo reaches down, but not into his pocket. for his gun.        
     just before he draws it...shots ring out.                        

                        cholo (cont'd)

              what's that?
