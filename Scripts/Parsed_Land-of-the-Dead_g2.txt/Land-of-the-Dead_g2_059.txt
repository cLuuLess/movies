     soldiers pass out monster weapons to riley, charlie, and
     slack. riley straps on a k-90. charlie turns one down.

              a second.



     charlie unstraps his own remington. a la sergeant york, he
     licks his thumb. wets the sight. and blasts a cockroach
     climbing on a wall twenty feet away.
