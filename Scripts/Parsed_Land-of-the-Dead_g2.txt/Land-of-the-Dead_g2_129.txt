      riley bursts out of the booth, only to be confronted by...      

                                                                      

      ...the bridgekeeper. drooling. dead. it grabs riley, pushing
      his head back toward the enormous gearworks of the bridge.      




                                                                      

      riley struggles. bests the creature. spins him around toward
      the gearworks and...                                            




                                                                      

      ...sssnipppp! the bridgekeeper's head is scissored off! it
      drops with a plunk into the river below.
