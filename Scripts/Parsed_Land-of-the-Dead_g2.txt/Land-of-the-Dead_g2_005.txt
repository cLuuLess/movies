    the sound of groaning wood as three heavily-armed guerillas      
    push a large crate over a precipice into a deep garbage pit      
    below. five similar crates lie amid the rubble.                  
    insects buzz. rats crawl. human skeletons, most headless, lie
    everywhere, no flesh left on their bones. those with heads       
    show various wounds to their skulls. except for one, which...    
    ...suddenly, startlingly moves! its bony arm reaches up from     
    the bottom of the pit toward...

    ...cholo demora, a latino in his 20s, handsome, roguish, and       
    confident...a bit too confident. he reaches over his shoulder      
    and unstraps a crossbow.                                           

                       cholo

             poor bastard.                                             
    wfffft! cholo shoots the skeleton. his arrow goes completely
    through the white skull.
