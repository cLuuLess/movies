     cholo approaches a checkpoint manned by two security guards.        
     setting down the champagne and cohibas, he unstraps his             
     weapons and hands them over.

     the guard takes cholo's weapons and returns a claim check.       
     cholo collects his boxes and steps onto an escalator that        
     carries him up into an enormous atrium. the "mall" we saw on     
     tv. sunlight splashes through glass walls onto box-planted
     trees. caged birds chirp seemingly in tune with the chopin       
     that lilts over a sound system. shoppers, expensively over-      
     dressed, stroll past stores. other residents lunch at            
     "outdoor" cafes. cholo pulls out a kerchief and wipes the        
     smudges off his face, trying to make himself presentable.
