75                                                            75     

     mouse looks at a grimy window as the shadow of a walker stops   
     just beyond the glass. mouse fires a burst shattering the       
     window and dropping the walker.                                 
     silence. mouse takes a tentative step toward the window. a
     scratching sound. something climbs up onto the sill from        
     outside. mouse raises his gun, but hesitates when he sees...    
     ...it's a child. a girl scout. it died at age nine, still       
     wearing its uniform. now, it's voracious. it grabs mouse's      
     gun-hand. the weapon fires harmlessly into the floor. mouse     
     is about to be chomped when...                                  
     ...a stalagmite of glass in the top of the shattered window     
     drops, piercing the girl scout's head.                          
     mouse runs screaming to the door, where he is grabbed by        
     another dead thing. and another. as he is torn apart, he sees   

                                                                     

     that there are dozens more.
