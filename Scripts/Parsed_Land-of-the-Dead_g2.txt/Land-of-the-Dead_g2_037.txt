     riley and charlie step into the cellar of an old brownstone.
     dirt floor. stone walls. the place is filled with smoke and
     buzzing with flies. as riley and charley turn their guns over   
     to two big bruisers inside, a tout named roach sidles over.     

                        tout

              (eyeing the weapons) supply run last                   
              night, uh? bet you have some money in                  
              your pocket. i can show you how to                     
              turn that money into more money.                       

                        riley

              on in.                                                 




                                                                     

     riley is already in. he has pushed past the tout and is
     striding into a fog where gamblers are rushing to place bets    
     with heavily-armed bookies. we're reminded of a cock-fighting   

                                                                     

     joint in a pancho villa movie.

              lot of action tonight.




                        tout                                         


                                                                     

              gotta new kind of game.



      iley strides toward a cluster of bettors. a very tall man      

                                                                     

     stands among them, wearing a texas stetson that sticks up
     high above all other heads, its peacock feathers poking even
     higher out of a snake-skin hat band.



      iley grabs him and spins him around.



      he man's feet are off the ground. way off the ground. far
     from tall, he's a little person, who has been standing on a
     platform, wearing a purple satin pimp-suit. he's a latino,
     who looks like a chihuahua. and that's his name. chihuahua.

                        chihuahua

              what? they're fixing it up.

              guys aren't there. the car's not
              there. my dinero's not there.

              this to you. i am your friend. put

              carry you out of here inside that
