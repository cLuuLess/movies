     ext. depot - night


 2                                                            62     

     the steel doors to the subway tunnel open. riley and his team   
     step out. the depot has been devastated. fires burning.         
     fences down. only tony baloney moves, still waving spookily.

                        c                                            


                         harlie

              geez. cholo made a mess.




                        riley

              cholo didn't do all this.



     clouds of thick black smoke from the fires billow across the
     depot, restricting visibility. ever-shifting openings in the
     clouds reveal glimpses of torn body parts.




                                                               














                                                               














                                                      45.











                   riley (cont'd)

         stenches have been at this place.



he leads the way into the depot, his m-16 at the ready.        
behind him, all eyes peer nervously into the smoke. everyone   
speaks in hushed tones.                                        

                   manolete

         when the truck pulled out, it must
         have knocked the fence down. that's
         how they got in.




                   riley

         that fencing was pushed in from
         outside.




                   teahouse

         you know how many stenches it
         would take to do that?




                   riley

         there's a thousand of them out
         there for every one of us.




                   charlie

         good thing we're smarter.




                   slack

         look who's talkin'.




                   riley

         they're getting smart. i saw it in

                                                               

         uniontown, last time out. they're
         learning how to work together.                        
thoughts darken. so does the smoke, which billows thicker,
virtually blinding the team. sounds come. the moaning of the   
wind. the popping of burnt metal and wood.                     

                   teahouse

         what do they want?                                    
slack looks back as she walks. the zombies have taken down     
another section of the depot fence, beyond which lies a        
suburb. beyond which is the river. beyond which is the glow    
of the fiddler's green high-rise.                              

                   slack                                       

         they want the city.                                   

                   riley                                       

         the city is us. they're after us. we                  
         pissed `em off one too many times.

                   charlie                                      

         thank heaven.                                          

                   riley                                        

         gotta love the guy. he still believes                  
         in heaven. anyone got a radio?                         
teahouse pulls a motorola from his belt. just as he tosses
it to riley, they hear...growling!



 he team draws their weapons, standing in a loose circle,
their backs to each other, guns searching for a target.
darting eyes peer into the void. more noises emanate from       
somewhere. everywhere. slowly...



...charlie unstraps his remington. licks his thumb. wets the
sight of the rifle.




                    lack

         (a whisper) why do you do that?                        

                   charlie

         (whispering back) catches the                          
         light. right now it's moonlight.
         lets me see where i'm aimin'.



blam! charlie fires! a single shot into the black smoke.




                   slack

         the hell you shooting at?




                   charlie

         that thing.

a

  dead man steps out of the smoke! before anyone can react, it
grabs slack's shoulder from behind! she whirls around. pulls
away. is about to shoot when she sees an entry wound on the    
left side of the thing's forehead.




                   charlie (cont'd)

          ff-center. but i got him.



the thing relaxes its grip and drops at slack's feet.




                    anolete

         (hysterical) there's more of `em out                   
         there. i can hear `em. there's more!



there are shuffling sounds in the smoke. manolete backs away.
pillsbury grabs him. slaps him, hard, across the face.

                        pillsbury

              if they is more, we gonna need
               o guns. pull `em out n'stann up
              wid us, like de man you ain't.



     riley lifts teahouse's motorola and pushes "send".




                        riley

              riley denbo. calling the green.
