      the bridge is lowering slowly. too slowly. riley scrambles       
      up the incline of the roadbed and calls back to charlie.

               bring her over as soon as you can!



      charlie pops back into dead reckoning.                           
      riley climbs to the top of the descending roadbed and...         
      ...leaps across the narrowing gulf to the other side.            
      he lands. falls. rolls. gets to his feet and runs toward
      slack and the city.
