      ext. river - night




      slack, adrift on the boat, lies prone at the bow and begins     

                                                                      

      to paddle with her hands. one of which hits something long
      and slimy. it looks like a snake!                               
      but it's not. it's only a moss-covered rope. slack grabs on.
      pulls hand over hand. it seems to take forever for the rope     
      to become taut.                                                 

      a face bobs out of the water!




      slack screams.                                                  
      it's the bridgekeeper's head, its eyes blinking as it floats    
      off on the current.                                             
       he rope is attached to a stanchion on the opposite shore.      
      slack's muscles strain as she pulls on it until...              
      ...her boat reaches the stanchion and she jumps off, finding    
      herself at the same boat ramp the army of the dead used. the    
      river has carried her into the very part of the city riley      
      and the team were trying to avoid. screams rise nearby. she's   
      in the war zone.
