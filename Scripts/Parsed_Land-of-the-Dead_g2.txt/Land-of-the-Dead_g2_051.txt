     kaufman rips a turkey leg off a cooked bird on a platter in
     front of him and eats. across the table sits one of his board
     members, harrison sutherland. knipp enters.




                        knipp

              phone call, sir.




                        kaufman

              thank you, knipp. i'll take it.



     knipp brings a radio-phone to the table. kaufman picks up the
     receiver and lifts it to his ear.




                         kaufman

              yes?




                         cholo (o.s.)

               aufman?



     kaufman tenses, just enough for sutherland to notice.




                        kaufman

              ah. the one that got away.

              you said we should talk when i was
              less excited. i'm a lot less
              excited now.




                        kaufman

              what do you want, mister demora?
