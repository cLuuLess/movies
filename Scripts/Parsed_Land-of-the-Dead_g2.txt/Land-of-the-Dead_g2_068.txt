     close on: a small, electronic unit, the size and appearance    
     of a "game boy". an led screen shows a blinking red dot        
     moving along a map.                                            

                        riley (o.s.)                                

              turn left up here.                                    
     slack, driving the t-bird now, makes the turn. the car blows   
     through a deserted town, moving fast. riley notices that       
     slack is effected by the desolation she sees.                  

                         iley

              how long since you been out here?




                        slack

              never been out. lived in the city
              since...it was a regular city.




                            iley

              pull over.




                        slack

              (surprised) huh?




                        riley

              you said you were going to make
              yourself useful. right now what i
              could use is for you to pull over.



      he does. the t-bird stops along a road bordered by a marsh    
     thick with tall cat tails. unexpectedly, riley stands and
     points his automatic at pillsbury and manolete.




                        riley

              i made a deal with your boss. find
              cholo. i'm gonna do it. keep him from                 
              blowing up the green. i'm gonna do
              it, i don't want people to get hurt.
              bring back dead reckoning... sorry.
              that's where i stop. i didn't ask him                 
              for much, just guns, ammo, and a car.
              i've got the guns. i've got the ammo.
              and if i find dead reckoning i'm
              gonna have the best fucking car                       
              that's ever been built, and i'm
              taking it to canada. if any of you
              don't like that idea...



     riley reaches down and opens the passenger door. manolete
     looks out and sees the cat tails moving. three walkers are
     slogging through the marsh.

                   r














                                                                














                   r














                                                      54.











                   manolete

         some choice.




                   pillsbury


         g

          ood choice. i like see canada.



pillsbury reaches out and slams the car door closed again.




                    iley

         charlie, keep these two covered.



charlie pulls his .45.                                          
riley turns around his seat, glancing down again at the "game
boy" in his palm. the red dot has moved on to another map.      

                   riley (cont'd)                               


                                                                

         take a right onto route six.



slack pulls out.                                                

                   slack

         this is what you were thinking
         about all along. you got me out
         here figuring i'm a boy scout, and
         now you're telling me we're just                       

                                                                

         stealing a fucking car?




                    iley

         you have a problem with that?




                   slack


                                                                

         no. i like the way you think.




                    harlie

         i like the way he thinks, too.
         just look at me you can tell i
         like the way he thinks.




                   riley

         take another right.                                    

                   slack                                        

         how do you know which way you're                       
         going?                                                 
riley holds up the "game boy". it beeps softly as the red dot   
shifts onto another map.                                        

                   riley                                        

         i built a homing device into dead                      
         reckoning. if cholo's anywhere within                  
         fifty miles, we can track him.                         




                                                                     














                                                                     














                                                           55.
