      ...the two fourteen-inch cannons on the vehicle's turrets.

               we gotta blow the fences!

               johnson's are loaded!

               yeah, but they're capped!                              
      the barrels of the two fourteen-inchers are still capped.
      dead reckoning keeps rolling. riley climbs out onto one of
      the cannon barrels.



      wham! a walker grabs him by the leg from the road. riley
      blasts him with his .45. as other walkers approach, he shoots
      them with one hand, rusing the other to uncap the cannon.




                           iley

               number one is clear! i'm going for
               number two!

               i don't norm'lly need two shots,
               riley.



      riley turns. the road is now filled with walkers.



       tanding astride the vehicle, riding it as if it were a
      living beast, riley picks some of them of with his .45.
