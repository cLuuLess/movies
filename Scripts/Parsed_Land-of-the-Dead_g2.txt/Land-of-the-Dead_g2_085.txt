     ext. boat ramp - night




     one head rises out of the river. it's big daddy, rivulets of    

                                                                     

     water running down the creases of his face. another head
     rises. and another. number nine and the butcher zombie.         
     more and more heads break the surface. the water fills with
     bodies emerging from the deep. hundreds of them. the city       
     lights reflect off their wet clothes as the army of the dead    

                                                                     

     clambers up a boat ramp on the city side of the river.
