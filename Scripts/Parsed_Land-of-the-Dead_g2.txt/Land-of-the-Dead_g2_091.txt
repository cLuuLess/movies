     riley and charlie step on board. pretty boy is at the            
     controls. foxy, anchor, and scar stand nearby. charlie is        

                                                                      

     grinning like a badly scarred cheshire cat.




                        cholo

                        charlie

              let us come in.                                         




                                                                      


                         cholo

              i'd rather have you in here than                        
              out there.                                              
     ka-chunk! cholo lifts his crossbow, pressing a loaded arrow      
     up under riley's chin. blood trickles.                           

                        cholo (cont'd)                                

              who's the smart one now?



     charlie is about to react when he feels foxy's m-16 poking       
     into his back.                                                   
     cholo looks into riley's eyes.




                        cholo (cont'd)
