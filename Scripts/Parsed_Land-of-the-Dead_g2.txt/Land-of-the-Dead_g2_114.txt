      riley closes the hatch. blood trickles from under his chin       
      where cholo stuck him with the crossbow.                         
      slack reaches up and pulls off the bandana that holds back
      her hair, which cascades down. she uses the fabric to clean      
      the blood off riley's neck.                                      
      he looks at her, touched by the familiarity of the gesture.      

                         slack

               almost lost you there.                                  

                          riley                                        

               i don't get lost so easy. (to                           
               pretty boy) we gotta get across                         
               the water.




                         pretty boy                                    


                                                                       

               the bridges into the city are all
               bricked up.                                             




                                                                       

      pretty boy hits a button. a map appears on a monitor, showing
      the "golden triangle" bordered by the rivers and the             
      barricaded bridges spanning them.                                

                         slack                                         

               we could blast our way through.                         

                         riley                                         

               don't want to. if the stenches got                      

                                                                       

               in, there's a war going on in the
               city. we take any of those bridges                      
               we'll end up right in the middle                        
               of it.                                                  
      riley runs his finger along the monitor, outlining the           
      natural and man-made barriers that protect the triangle.         

                         riley (cont'd)

               we've gotta come in above the                           
               throat.                                                 
      his finger continues down the monitor to "the throat" at the
      base of the triangle, where the long fence runs between the      
      two rivers.                                                      

                         riley (cont'd)                                

               what was built to keep folks safe                       
               is gonna trap them inside. we've                        
               gotta give them a way out.
