     angle on: a solid wall of wood. big daddy, number nine, and
     others of the dead push against it. the wood holds.



     big daddy turns, surveying his troops. focusing on the
     butcher. on the meat cleaver it has in its hand.                 
     big daddy pounds on the wood, demonstrating. points at the       
     meat cleaver. pounds again. the butcher gets it. approaches      
     the wall.                                                        
      hack! the meat cleaver chops into wood, splintering it.         
     reverse angle: from the other side of the wall as the wood
     splinters to reveal big daddy's eyes staring through at...       
     ...the fiddler's green high-rise, looming closer than it was     
     before, though it's still across the river.
