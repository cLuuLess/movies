      he security guards lead cholo down the stairs. cholo whirls
     like a ninja. he slugs one guard, kicks another in the groin,
     the third in the face, and escapes through a fire door.

     riley rips off part of his shirt-sleeve and starts to bandage
     the wound on slack's arm. they are in a jail cell that has
     brick walls and a small barred window facing a dark alley.
     charlie, stripped of all his guns, stares outside longingly.




                        riley

              (to slack) why you? in that arena.
              why did the little fat man throw
              you in with those things?




                        slack

              it wasn't the little man. it was the
              big man. the man upstairs. he's got
              his fingers in everything down here.
              if you can drink it, shoot it up,
              fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs
              to him. he's just seein' that we get
              a few cheap kicks so we don't go
              thinkin' too hard about why he's
              eating steak and the rest of us are
              lucky to get the bones.




                        riley

              same question. why you?




                         slack

              they found out i was working with
              mulligan and his people. tired of
              eatin' off cbones.




                         harlie

              what can you do? every place is the                    
              same.




                        riley

              places with people. i'm gonna find
              me a place where there ain't no
              people. north. canada.




                        slack

              wherever you're going, take me                         
               ith you.




                         charlie

              he won't. riley likes to be alone.
              he might take me. cuzz havin' me
              around is pretty much the same as
              bein' alone. (glancing at riley)
                can make myself useful. and i
               an shoot.

                   slack

         i can shoot. and i can be pretty
         fucking useful. i had training. i
         was gonna join the army. up the
         green. till somebody figured i'd be
         a better hooker than a soldier.




                   riley

         i don't need to hear your story.
         everybody's got a story, and i'm
         tired of hearin' them all!




                   slack

         what's your story, riley?



they look at each other, clearly attracted.

                    iley

         i said everybody has a story. that
         was wrong. i don't have one. daddy
         was a preacher. mama kept the
         house. school. engineering. nothing
         bad ever happened to me...(turning
         away)...till everything changed.




                    lack

         everything changed for all of us.
         whether we had a story or not.




                                                                

a sound outside the window. charlie glances through the bars.




                     charlie

         hey...



riley and slack look out the window. four security men are      
chasing mulligan into the alley outside. they drive him like    
an animal against a wall, club him, and drag him away.




                     riley

         mulligan.



riley instinctively reaches through the window's bars, but
there's nothing he can do. it's a helpless feeling.




                    harlie

         what are they gonna do? kill him?                      

                   slack                                        

         not right away. first, they'll try                     
         to get what they can out of him.                       
         about people like me.                                  
riley puts his hand on her back.
