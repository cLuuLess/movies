     ext. the city - "the throat" - dawn


30                                                               30      

     in live action, not on the   monitor, weary troops, sloppily
     uniformed, guard four rows   of electrified, barbed-wire fencing.
     dead things cluster by the   dozens outside the barricades.

                        m

     corpses hang all along the   stretch, suspended on the barbs.




                         ilitary woman

              stench! ten o-clock!



     a walker lumbers in and touches the fencing. sparks fly! the
     thing's flesh is literally cooked! boils develop, popping
     open, emitting smoke. still the thing remains animated.




                        military man

              take its fuckin' face off.



      udda-budda-budda! the military woman fires. the thing is
     decimated. its body hangs, welded to the sparking barbs.
