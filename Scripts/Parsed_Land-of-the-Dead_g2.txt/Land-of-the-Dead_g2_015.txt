     through the windshield: riley and mike watch the t-bird roar
     down main street. the four guerillas inside laugh gleefully     
     as they use the machine guns to mow down hapless zombies.

              (through an open hatch) kid, these
              are the toughest guys in the `hood.
              you can't keep `em from wantin' to
              get some chuckles.



      iley gives cholo an irritated look.




                        cholo (cont'd)

              hey, not me, boss. you told me not
              to have any fun, i'm not having any
              fun at all. (to mike) come with me,
              kid. i'll show you the ropes.                          
     mike climbs out and gets on the back of cholo's motorcycle.




                        riley

              where you goin'?




                        cholo

              to get supplies. essential supplies.
              that's job our job, ain't it?
