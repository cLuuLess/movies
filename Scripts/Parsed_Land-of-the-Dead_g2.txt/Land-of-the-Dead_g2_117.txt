      ext. hillside home driveway - night




      cholo and foxy run up the road to the t-bird. seeing a walker   
      lurking ahead, they duck into the dark cover of the trees.

               i got it.



      wfffft! cholo picks off the walker with his crossbow.           

                          holo (cont'd)

               come on, let's go.



      he slaps a hand on foxy's back.



       xcept it's not foxy! it's another walker that has moved
      between the two men. it grabs the hand that slapped him and
      bites it.




                          holo


               ahhh...fuck!




      foxy, a few yards away, whirls, aiming his gun at the walker.
      cholo is faster. with no time to reload, in agony, he pulls     
      a fistful of arrows from his quiver and drives them through     
      the walker's face and skull. the walker falls. so does an       
      ominous silence.

               i can't fucking believe it. (a sad
               chuckle) nothin' works out. it's                       
               like...the world is spinning around                    
               and we're just...caught in the                         
               wind. nothin' works out. some damn                     
               thing always comes around the                          
               corner and gets you.

      foxy aims his rifle fat cholo's forehead. their eyes connect.

               your choice.



      for a moment, cholo looks despondent. then he forces a smile.




                         cholo

               no, don't shoot. (a dark chuckle)
                 always wanted to see how the
               other half lives.



      foxy lowers his gun.
