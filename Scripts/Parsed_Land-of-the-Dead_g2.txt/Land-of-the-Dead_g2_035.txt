      ing! an elevator door opens. cholo, carrying the champagne
     and cohibas, steps out, walks to "penthouse number one", and   
     rings the bell. an instant after he pushes the button...       
     ...the door is jerked open by tyler knipp, 50-something, an    
     african american man in a white butler's jacket. frightened,   
     he's wielding a scissors, poised to strike.                    

                        knipp

              (lowering the scissors) oh, mister                    
              demora. mister kaufman ain't home                     
              and there's some shit goin' down.                     
              no lie. i heard...                                    
     a scream rings out down the corridor!                          

                        knipp (cont'd)

     another scream.                                                 


                        knipp (cont'd)

              upset about this.                                      
     cholo drops his boxes and moves down the corridor.              

                        knipp (cont'd)                               

              i called security. they should be                      
              here...                                                
     cholo reaches the door to penthouse number two. it's locked.    
     another scream from inside. he flings himself at the door.      
     the latch splinters out of the frame. the door bursts open...
