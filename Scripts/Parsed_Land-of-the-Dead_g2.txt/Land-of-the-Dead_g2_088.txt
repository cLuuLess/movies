     riley walks down the road. the growling of the diesels is        
     getting louder, the glow from the high-beams brighter. riley     
     is startled by a noise behind him. he whirls around and sees     
     charlie approaching.                                             

                        charlie                                       

              everything's cool back there.                           
     riley is about to object, when dead reckoning comes rumbling     
     around a corner a hundred yards down the street. riley checks    
     his watch again. 11:52.
