      manolete has the machine gun aimed at dead reckoning's open     
      hatch. where cholo is standing.                                 
      out of the corner of his eye, riley sees manolete's machine
      gun barrel flash in the moonlight. manolete fires! ratatat!     
      riley pushes cholo out of the way just in time! he drops from   
      the hatch onto the pavement, wounded in the shoulder.           
      the walker starts to rip manolete apart. slack shoots him in    
      the head. then she and pillsbury open fire on the walker,       
      destroying it.
