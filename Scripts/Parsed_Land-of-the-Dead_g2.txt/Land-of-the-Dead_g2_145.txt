      ext. outside the city - night




      fireworks explode. a zombie looks up toward the "blooms". a        

                                                                         

      strong hand grabs the collar of its shirt, pulls its gaze
      away from the sky, and herds it onward.                            




                                                                         

      the hand is big daddy's. he herds others along, too. a small
      group of two dozen, including number nine and the butcher.         




147                                                           147
