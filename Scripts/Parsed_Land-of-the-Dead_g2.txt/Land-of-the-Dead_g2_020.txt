     harry, the biker with the spear, is making another run toward   
     a walker, who stands mesmerized by the fireworks, when...       
     whap! harry is sent flying!



       dead woman, once pretty, wearing a softball uniform that      
     bears the number nine, has used its bat to hit a home run.      
     harry's riderless motorcycle fishtails up the street and hits
     the side of a building.                                         
      arry tries to get up. two dead things attack him. another      
     motorcycle, driven by anchor, who looks like popeye, rumbles    
     up in the nick of time.                                         

                        anchor

              harry, jump on!




                                                                     

     fighting off the dead things, harry gets on and speeds away.
