     riley and his team move through drifting smoke. vehicles are
     scattered about. they stop at the t-bird. there are no keys    
     in the ignition.




                        charlie

              gotta go get the keys, riley.



      iley looks across the lot to the charred ruin of a shack.
     tire fires burn around it. debris smolders.




                        riley

              ain't no keys to get. melted.




                         anolete

              screw keys. hot wire the fucker.



     manolete climbs in and goes to work under the dash.




                        pillsbury


              h

               e feelin' better since i hit `im.



     suddenly, charlie draws his .45 and fires at slack! blam! the
     bullet buzzes just above her ear, blowing a wisp of hair as... 




.

...a dead old man behind her drops, a hole in its head.        

                    lack

         thanks, charlie. that was useful.



the wind shifts and black smoke envelopes them.




                   manolete

         i can't see!



riley pulls out a flashlight and shines it under the dash.



 he team fans out around the t-bird. the smoke is so thick     
they can't make out anything. including each other.



 harlie peers into openings that shift on the breeze. what
he doesn't see, what he can't see, is what's behind him...



 ..a female walker, wearing the soiled and tattered remnants
of a bridal gown. the fabric seems to glow in the smoke.       
the bride shuffles toward charlie. we see it coming. no one    
else does. just as it opens its mouth to bite...               
blam! slack shoots! her bullet cuts closer than the one
charlie fired, clipping off the top of his ear before          

                                                               


dropping the bride.





                   slack

         even-steven.




                   charlie

         not! that hurt! i didn't hurt you!



manolete fumbles with colored wires under the dash.




                     riley                                     

         hurry up.                                             

                   pillsbury

         (impatient) yellow to red!




                   teahouse

         what the fuck does a samoan know
         about hot-wiring cars?




                   pillsbury

         five thousand cars. stole. every
         year in samoa.




                   manolete

         fifty thousand in mexico.

                   pillsbury

         mexico got a million cars. samoa got
         five thousand. every one. stolen.




the t-bird's engine revs.                                       


                   manolete


         i got it! let's get out of here!




riley leads the team into the t-bird. manolete starts to get    
out from under the dash. as teahouse settles into a seat by     
the door...                                                     
...something heavy and wet smacks his shoulder. it's a          
forearm! it drops onto teahouse as if thrown at him.




                   teahouse

         god! oh, god, what's this?!



teahouse hurls the bloody thing onto the asphalt. shockingly,
the arm springs back, thumping against teahouse's face! a
twist of torn muscle, no thicker than clothesline, is keeping
the limb loosely attached to...



...a dead thing that has crawled beside the t-bird. lifting     
itself, it bites a large filet out of teahouse's arm. charlie

m

shoots it.



 anolete climbs up behind the wheel and...vrooooom!...pedal
to the metal he pulls out of the depot. slack glances at
teahouse, then, wind in her hair, leans in close to riley.      

                   slack

         (softly) how long does he have?




                   riley

         i had a brother. real brother, by
         birth. bit. hung on for six days.
         before he turned. i was the one had
         to shoot him.




                   slack

         and you said nothin' bad ever
         happened to you.




                   riley

         that happened to my brother.




                   slack

         (into his eyes) but you kept going.




                    iley

         got to, right?




                        c


              b

                        slack

               up. dead is dead. and that ain't
              you. and that ain't me.



     slack turns to teahouse.




                         lack (cont'd)

               orry, man. i truly am.



     she draws her .45, aims at teahouse, and fires.
