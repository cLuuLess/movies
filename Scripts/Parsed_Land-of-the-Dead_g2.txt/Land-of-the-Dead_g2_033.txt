     riley and charlie walk down a street into the city's "ghetto"    
     zone, which is lined with taverns, gambling clubs, strip
     joints, like a boom town from alaskan gold-rush days. buyers
     and sellers lurk in the shadows, copulating, dealing drugs.



      iley is welcomed by nearly everyone he passes, greeting         
     them in return with a smile and a nod, handing some bills to
     a father with a young son, patting an old man on the back.




                        charlie

              wanna get a drink, riley? just
               ook at me, you can tell i could
              use a drink.

charlie follows riley, who strides into...                      
...an alley, surprised to find a cadre of rough-looking         
revolutionaries, led by mulligan, a defiant man who stands      
on a soapbox. a small audience is gathered in front of him.     
he takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey.                       

                   mulligan                                     

          irish accent) how long are you                        
         gonna let him push you around? if                      
         there was enough of us...if you all                    
         would join up with us...we could                       
         pull him down off his throne!                          
some of the people in the audience nervously shift their eyes   
to the fiddler's green high-rise ten blocks away.               

                   riley

         you can't fix a place like this,                       
         mulligan. you just have to get out                     

                                                                

         of it.




                   mulligan                                     


                                                                

         we've got the firepower, riley. if
         you and your friends would come in                     
         with us, we'd be unstoppable.                          
mulligan holds out his bottle to riley, who passes it to
charlie, who takes a swig.




                   riley                                        

         everyone's stoppable.                                  
we hear the sound of a boy coughing. mulligan's son brian
stands behind him, looking feverish.                            

                   mulligan                                     

         you alright, son?                                      

                   brian                                        

         i'm fine, dad.                                         
as riley starts past, he stops, pulls something from his        
pocket, and presses it into mulligan's palm.                    

                   riley                                        

         antibiotics. for your boy.                             
mulligan looks down with gratitude at a bottle his hand.        
when he looks up again, riley is gone.
