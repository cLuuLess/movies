     kaufman sips a scotch. sutherland is present, with a middle-   
     aged board member named chandler styles and cliff woods, who   
     is young and ambitious. all of them are nervous, pacing. a     
     door opens and riley is ushered into the room.




                        kaufman

              mister denbo. come in. can i offer
              you a drink?




                        riley

              i don't drink.




                        kaufman

              well, then...please sit down.




                        riley

              nobody else is sitting. i think
              i'll just stand here, like the
              rest of you. while you tell me
              why i'm standing here.




                          aufman

              we need you to repossess a vehicle
              that belongs to us. the vehicle you
              designed, mister denbo. dead
              reckoning has been stolen. by your
              second in command. i want him
              captured. or killed. and i want my
              two-million-dollar piece of
              equipment returned.

              the truck.




                        kaufman

              which has guns. big guns. that
              could do a great deal of damage if
              he were to aim them at this city.




                        riley

              why don't you just send out your
              troops?

                    kaufman

         i don't want to lose them. i could
         send five hundred men against that
         thing and they'd all come back in
         body bags. it's your vehicle. cholo
         was your man. you might be able to
         get close enough to...do what has
         to be done. (refilling his scotch)                   
         do this for me and i'll grant you                    
         something in return. residence in                    
         the green.                                           

                   riley

         not me. that's what cholo wanted,                    
         and you didn't give it to him, did                   
         you? that's why he's out there                       
         waving a cannon at your ass.                         
kaufman won't admit that riley's right, but he looks at him   
with a glimmer of respect.                                    

                   riley (cont'd)                             

         give me one of those vehicles, over                  

                                                              

         in the depot, weapons, and enough
         ammunition to go north.




                   kaufman

         but...there's nothing up north.




                   riley

         that's the idea.




                   kaufman

         alright. you've named your price.
         an easy one to pay.

                   r


                     iley

         one more thing. my friends. they
         go with me.




                      kaufman

         take them.



 e looks at riley, a hint of desperation behind his eyes.




                   kaufman (cont'd)

          an you find dead reckoning?
         quickly?




                   riley

         how quickly?

              by midnight.                                            

                        riley
