     ext. dead reckoning - night


11                                                            11     

     ...riley, charlie, and mike step out of a vehicle the size      
     of a city bus. the words dead reckoning are painted on its      
     side. this is no bus. it's a war wagon, built of scavenged      
     parts with a riveted steel skin. gattling guns protrude from    
     a mean-looking snout. a roof turret supports two fourteen       
     inch-cannons. rotating lights shine in all directions,          
     piercing the night.                                             
     thoomb! thoomb! thoomb! that sound again. mortar tubes on the   
     vehicle's roof are launching fireworks that burst in the sky.   

                        charlie

              (looking up) `flowers in the                           
              graveyard'. why do you call `em
              that, riley? i don't get it. these
              here flowers ain't the kind you lay
              down on the ground. these here are
              sky flowers. way up in heaven.

                        r


                         iley

              i love ya, charlie. know why?
              cuzz you still believe in heaven.



     the white moving van rolls in and parks beside dead reckoning. 

                                                                    

     cholo jumps out with the three guerillas from the dump.




                         holo

              you guys scope out the town?




                        riley

              looks like nobody's hit it before.



     four guerillas get into an old t-bird convertible mounted with 
     machine guns. two other armed men climb onto motorcycles. the 
     very night seems to growl as everyone starts their engines.    

                         holo

              ready?




                        charlie

              always ready. just look at me
               ou can tell i'm always ready.




                        cholo

              i look at you, all i see's an idiot.                   

                        charlie

              i don't think that's all you see.
                bet you see this iron, too.

                                                            8.










     charlie is wearing four holstered sidearms, two shouldered
     automatic rifles, a remington...and a sly smile that makes us
     wonder whether he's an idiot or not.




                        cholo

              let's go have some fun.




                        riley

              ain't about fun, cholo.



     vrooom! the t-bird and the motorcycles pull out toward town.     

                          iley

              we go in, do our job, and get out,
              all of us alive, okay? i don't want                     
              any fuck-ups on my last day out here.

                        c                                             


                         holo

              (grinning) my last day, too.




                                                                      

      iley looks surprised. cholo mounts a motorcycle, revs the
     engine, and heads out.                                           

                        cholo (cont'd)


              yeeee-haaaaaaaa!





                         charlie

              what'd he do, hit the lottery or
              somethin'?




                        riley

              somethin'. (wondering) somethin'.



     riley and charlie start to get back into dead reckoning. mike    
     follows, pausing to look up at the "sky flowers".                

                        mike

              do those things really work?                            

                        riley

              yup. (almost sadly) stenches can't                      
              take their eyes off `em.
