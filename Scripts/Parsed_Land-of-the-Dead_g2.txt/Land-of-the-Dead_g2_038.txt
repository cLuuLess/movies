38                                                            38

     in a dark catacomb, dead men are chained to the walls. wham!    
     a pole shoots out. a noose on the end encircles the neck of a   
     captive dead man and is cinched tight. two men hold the pole
     while a third sprays red paint on the thing's face. another     
     dead thing is dragged in and sprayed with black paint.
