     int. kaufman penthouse - night




     wham! the door slams behind kaufman as he enters the foyer.     
     knipp emerges from the rear.                                    

                        knipp                                        

              any word from mister denbo, sir?                       

                        kaufman                                      

              no. pack us up. we might have                          
              to be leaving.




                        knipp                                        

              in the helicopters?                                    

                        kaufman                                      

              we'll only need one of them.                           




                                                                     











                                                                     














                                                                     








                                                                     














                                                           57.











     int/ext. dead reckoning - night


77                                                            77     

     pretty boy eases the vehicle up the road to the complex of      
     buildings: ross park, a sprawling munitions depot.              
     the searchlight continues to sweep across the night, but no
     one is manning it. it's mounted to an automatic rotator on      
     the roof of the main building.                                  

                        foxy

              looks like no one's here.                              
     the gates stand wide open. there's no sign of life.



     cholo punches a button. the side hatch hisses open.             

                        cholo                                        


                                                                     

              foxy. you're elected. get out there
              and see what the fuck.                                 




                                                                     

     foxy moves out through the open hatch.




                        cholo (cont'd)


                                                                     

              somebody go out and help.



     scar grabs his weapons.                                         

                          scar

              i'll go.
