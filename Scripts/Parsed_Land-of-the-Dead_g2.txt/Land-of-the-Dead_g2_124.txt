      riley ducks under a caution gate at the entrance to the          

                                                                       

      bridge and starts across the roadway. behind him...



      ...slack and charlie stand, weapons ready, eyes alert for        

                                                                       

      danger.



      as riley runs...                                                 
      ...something skitters across the road, chasing him. not a        
      zombie. much smaller. a river rat.                               
      charlie draws his remington. wets the sight with his thumb.      

      blam!                                                            

      riley stops running. looks back to see what's being shot.




                         slack                                         

               you missed.                                             

                         charlie

               nope. i blew its ass off.                               
      the rat is now half a rat. its ass has been blown off. yet       

      it's still running!                                              


                         charlie (cont'd)

               just didn't hit it in the head.                         




                                                                      














                                                            74.











                         slack                                        

               (realizing) jesus. it's dead.                          

                         charlie

               they all are.                                          
      skreeeeeeee! zombie rats crawl up onto the roadbed. dozens.     
      riley takes off away from them. slack and charlie hurry         
      closer, firing, trying to pick the critters off.                
      the rats reach riley! nip at his heels. he leaps. swings onto
      a girder. climbs to the control booth. the rats don't follow.   
      slack heaves a sigh of relief just before...                    
      ...skreeeeeeee! a second pack of rats scurries toward her!      
      she vaults over a railing, dropping several feet to...          
      ...the riverbank below. but there are rats here too! charlie    
      fires at them from above. blam! blam! blam! fur and blood       

                                                                      

      fly. but there are too many. he can't shoot them all.
