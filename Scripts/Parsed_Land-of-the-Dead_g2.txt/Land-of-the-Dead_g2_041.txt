     a uniformed guard leaves cholo in a pristine white conference
     room with glass walls overlooking the rotting city far below.
     cholo sets the case of champagne and the box of cohibas on a
     conference table. a sman stands in silhouette at the windows.




                         ilhouetted man

              how was uniontown?




                          cholo

              dead.




                        silhouetted man


                                                                      

              death intrudes on us even in the
              green, i'm afraid. i heard about                        
              what happened with my neighbors.                        

                                                                      

              i'm grateful for your help.




                          cholo


                                                                      

                  brought you back some presents.



     cholo opens the case of champagne. he pulls a bottle out,        
     untwists the wire, and uses his strong thumbs to pop the         
     cork. foam runs.                                                 

                        cholo (cont'd)

               ou probably want a glass, don't
              you? sure, a high-toned man likes
              to drink out of a glass.



     cholo grabs a highball glass from a cupboard, pours champagne
     into it, and brings it, overflowing, to the silhouetted man.




                        cholo

              i got something else, too.



     cholo tears open the box of cohibas. he picks up two cigars,
     bites off the tips, puts one in his mouth, then, walking back
     to the silhouetted man, puts the other in his mouth, lighting
     them both with a wooden match that he strikes on his jeans.

                                                      31.











                      silhouetted man

         thank you.




                   cholo

         no, thank you! twenty grand. that's
         what i got comin' for last night. i
         never bothered to pick it up.

                   s


                       ilhouetted man

         you didn't?




                   cholo

         nope. i left it in the bank. your
         bank. with all my other dough.
          rom all those other nights. i got
         enough now to buy me a place.




                                                              


                   silhouetted man

         you mean here? in the green?                         
the silhouetted man steps away from the window. expensively
dressed, in his early 60s, he is paul kaufman. he sets down
the highball glass cholo gave him, gets out a proper          
champagne flute, and fills it from the bottle, smiling
politely at cholo.




                   kaufman

         i'm sorry, mister demora, but
         there's a very long waiting list.




                      cholo

         how long?




                   kaufman

         this is an extremely desirable
         location. space is limited.




                   cholo

         you mean restricted.




                   kaufman

         well, i do have a board of
         directors, a membership committee
         that has to approve...



a wave of incomparable sadness sweeps over cholo's face.

                   c


                    holo

         i guess it takes more than money to
         become a "member".

                        kaufman

              take my advice. withdraw your funds
              from the bank and spend them
              somewhere else.




                        cholo

              (quietly) don't do this to me. don't
              do this to me.




                         aufman

              i'm sorry, but...




                        cholo

              no, no, no. three years! three
              years i been cleaning up after you,                    
              taking out your garbage, and you
              tell me i'm not good enough? you're
              the one who's no good. you are no
              fucking good. and you are gonna let
              me in. you know why? because i know
              what goes on around here. how many
              of your fucking "members" know
              what's in that garbage i take out
              for you?



     cholo lunges at kaufman, grabs him by the collar.




                        cholo (cont'd)


               ou'll let me in or i'll...




     cholo feels the barrel of a .45 against his waist. kaufman,
     who has drawn the pistol from his jacket, is still smiling.




                        kaufman

              maybe we should talk about this
              when you're less excited.



     kaufman presses a button under the table. three security
     guards rush in, grab cholo, and drag him away. kaufman stops
     one of the guards at the door.




                        kaufman (cont'd)

               softly) i won't be needing this
              man any more.
