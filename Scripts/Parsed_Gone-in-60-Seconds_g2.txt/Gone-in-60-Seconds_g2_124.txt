	ext. residential neighborhood - chestnut hill - night

	a nice neighborhood... upper middle class ... so damn suburban you
	can practically smell the gas grills ... a neighborhood security
	patrol car glides by them...

				tumbler
		gettin' fancy... got their own palace
		guard -

	when, from the back of the jeep:

				toby
		i never been to the suburbs ...

	toby is there ... having stowed-away...

				tumbler
		what are you doing here, assface?

				toby
		checkin' it out

	he smiles at kip ... kip looks at tumbler ... drives ... at last,
	pulling up to one house where the '98 benz - "'carol" lives. kip
	parks, a half block down ... they get out ... head for the
	house...

	and there she is. "carol." obsidian black. in the
	garage. the garage is open. and three kids, two boys and a
	girl. late teens. they are standing around "carol"...
	drinking beer... listening to the new beck album on the
	car's cd player ... the folks clearly out of town ...

	well-scrubbed, white suburban children of plenty ... the only crew
	they've ever run in is j. crew... from the hedge, kip, tumbler and
	toby watch the kids ... with equal parts fascination, loathing,
	envy... and then, the kids go inside... leaving "carol" exposed...

				toby
		i got this one...

	and before the others can respond, he moves for her. and she's
	open... toby's in ... butterfly popped - gizmo in. the others start
	to get in when one of the kids comes out from the house. he stares
	at toby, who freezes mid-boost ...

				kip (cont'd)
			(whispered hiss)
		get her started, man -- !

	and toby does... and slams her in reverse.  and they're off
