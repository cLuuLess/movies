	int. kip's guest house - later - night

	small, cluttered... posters of kurt cobain, a skying kobe bryant,
	pamela anderson, two nude girls draped over a glittering
	lamborghini espada, etc. there's a fish tank... and a big-screen
	tv, on which the lakers are currently defending a high-speed
	boston celtic fast-break...

	memphis sits on a ratty couch before the tv... kip comes out of
	the bedroom... he's changed clothes ... he wears clunky fur-lined
	moon boots, leopard-skin speedos and a tshirt ... he looks
	slightly ridiculous...

	throughout the scene, memphis should be studying kip, as if he's
	seeing him for the very first time ... and waiting for the
	inevitable crack...

				memphis
		you okay -- ?

				kip
		totally. i'm fine. you want a beer,
		man -- ?

				memphis
		sure --

	and kip limps toward the refrigerator ... he comes back with two
	beers ... hands one to memphis ... glances at the tv --

				kip
		you like kobe's game? i do. you
		think he's heir apparent to mj? i do.
		he speaks fluent italian, you know? so he's
		got that going for him --

	and a cut on kip's forehead starts to bleed ... kip grabs a towel
	... presses it to his head --

				memphis
		you sure you're okay -- ?

				kip
		yeah, man. where is your beer?

	memphis holds it up ... kip nods ... there are a pile of ignitions
	on the table ... kip picks one up, absently begins trying to strip
	it...

				kip
		cool. so you're living up north?

				memphis
		yeah -

				kip
		i heard you were pumping gas -

				memphis
		something like that -

				kip
		you're kind of cultivating a new look.

				memphis
		yeah --

	beat ... they watch the game ... kip replaces the soaked towel
	with another ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		maybe you need a stitch --

				kip
		nah. it's a scratch.

				memphis
		okay --

	beat ...

				kip
		hey, you want something to eat ?

				memphis
		what do you got ... ?

	and kip hoists himself painfully to his feet ... limps over to the
	'fridge ... memphis watches him, a slight grin at kip's attempt at
	cool ... kip peers into the 'fridge ...

				kip
		not much. i got olives. you like
		olives?
		kalamata olives rule, i think. ma likes
		the calabrese. it's more mellow

	and he brings over a bowl of olives.

				memphis
		there's certainly a time and a place
		for a mellow olive -

				kip
		yeah, yeah. that's what i'm thinking --

	and they nibble on them. kip bites into one ... and the juice
	stings his cracked lip ... but he disguises his grimace as an
	appreciative nod...

	and for a moment, they nibble olives and drop pits into an
	ashtray... then:

				memphis
		so what are you gonna do?

				kip
		about what?

				memphis
		"about what?"

				kip
		about calitri? no worries, man.
		i'll call him. he's a reasonable
		dude ...

				memphis
		i can see that -

	and memphis glances out the window. to the crushed car. kip
	catches the glance, glances himself, chooses to ignore it.

				memphis (cont'd)
		you have everything ... under
		control?

				kip
		yeah. he just wants to know i'm
		still on it. he needs reassurance.
		all these big swinging dicks do.
		no worries. i won't let him get
		into our kool-aid...

	kip shrugs ... picks up another olive... remembers the pain' of
	the last one... drops it back in the bowl ... memphis is staring
	at him, disgusted... kip feels it ...

				kip (cont'd)
		what -- ?

				memphis
		what happened to you?

				kip
		what?

	and now memphis gets to his feet ... paces the place...

				memphis
		you just got crushed in a car. you're
		bleeding all over your self. and you
		sit there - eating olives and talking
		basketball, as if, at this very
		moment, people weren't plotting
		your demise ...

				kip
		c'mon, man... my "demise..."
			(chuckles)
		overreaction

				memphis
		"over--"  you know - i can maybe
		understand, since i been gone, you
		taking up this dumb-ass life of
		crime, and for that i can partly
		blame myself. but what is baffling
		to me, is how, since i been gone,
		you've become a complete and total
		moron--

				kip
		hey, now -

				memphis
		he's gonna kill you -- !

				kip
		i can handle it --

				memphis
		you can handle it?

				kip
		i can handle it --

				memphis
		you can handle it?

				kip
		i can handle it --

				memphis
		you?

				kip
		me.

				memphis
		you?

				kip
		me...

	beat ... hold the look ... kip shifts in his chair ... even this
	hurts... he tries to hide the wince ... memphis goes to the 
	window, looks out at the harbor below... beat ... then:

				kip (cont'd)
		why? you think you can help me?

	and he turns back to kip ...

				kip (cont'd)
		what can you do? you haven't done
		anything in six years but pump gas 
		and go overall shopping. and 
		the cars, they've changed ...
		there's new shit. computer chip
		keys and sophisticated alarms and
		i don't think, an old guy, could much
		bypass 'em...

				memphis
		you don't think so, huh?

				kip
		not really ... but you know... maybe
		i'm wrong ...

	and the brothers look at each other ... in the pale glow of the
	tv... for a long beat ... and then we'll cut to:
