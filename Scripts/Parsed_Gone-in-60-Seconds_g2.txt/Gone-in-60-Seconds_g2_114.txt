	ext. newport beach - the maserati

	the persian man and his date ... mackin' hard... behind them
	memphis and sway wait in the mazda. memphis is on the cell

				memphis
		... okay, check with you soon ...

	he hangs up ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		otto says 22 ladies have reported for
		work...

	sway nods ... the maserati's windows are fully-steamed...

				memphis (cont'd)
		man, they're going at it

				sway
		they're in love ...

	long beat ... he looks at her ...

				memphis
		what about you?

	she looks at him... shrugs...

				sway
		you remember my gramma? yeah. i was
		thinking. if she were alive. and she
		asked me. if she came down, right now.
		asked me. "what do you do, sara?
		what's your life?" innocently.
		nonjudgemental. i think it would break
		her heart if i said i was a thief. i
		steal cars, gramma. and even though,
		hey, i learned it all from her son.
		my uncle eddie. who taught me the basics. 
		which you refined. (you remember randall,
		gramma? you thought he was neat. well,
		he refined the basics ... ). i don't
		think that's what she hoped for me...

	she looks at him ...

				sway (cont'd)
		but ... that said... car thieves are my
		weakness ... it's all so terribly loretta
		lynn or something, i know... but ... i
		don't wanna be a thief anymore ... i don't
		wanna love a thief anymore ... i want to
		wear a dress maybe once in a while... maybe
		have a kid... watch a lot of audrey hepburn
		movies.. and think about my gramma without
		also thinking "shame on me. shame on
		me. shame on me... "

	she looks at him... he leans into her ... kisses her... tentative
	at first ... then... with urgency...
