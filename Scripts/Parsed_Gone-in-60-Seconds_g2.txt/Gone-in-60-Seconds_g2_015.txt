	int. "the side pocket" - pool hall - night

	a dozen tables... smells of blue chalk and whiskey... the juke box
	cranked... we take it to the back of the joint ... where kip, and
	tumbler and mirror man are knocking a rack... freb sits nearby,
	with a few badly made-up girls...

				tumbler
		... so ... it's my new move ... it's called
		"the stranger." what i do is, i sit on
		my hand for 10 minutes.  till it falls
		asleep. till it's good and numb. no feeling.
		and then i jerk off.

				girl
		that's disgusting -

				freb
		what's the point, man -- ?

				tumbler
		cos it's like you're bein' done by a stranger
		... it rocks ... it's the power move of the
		new millennium...

	he sinks another ball. a kid, 15, toby - comes up to them.

				toby
		hey, kip, what's up?

				kip
		what do you say, toby?,

				toby
		i'm cool -

				tumbler
		what do you want, shithead?

				toby
		why you gotta front me like that? i'm
		talking to kip --

				tumbler
		why don't you leave him alone?

				toby
		i known kip longing than you, man ...

				tumbler
		oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --

				freb
		any word, kip -- ?

				kip
		no ... and they won't take my calls ...

				freb
		what does that mean -- ?

				kip
		it ain't what you'd call a "good sign"

	he groks their fear...

				kip (cont'd)
		look - we managed to get 13 in a week.
		we just gotta step it up ...

				freb
		but we only got till friday. that's
		four days. and we lost the 13. so's
		we gotta start over ...

	kip looks at him...

				kip
		that, too ...
			(off of freb's look of fright)
		don't sweat it, freb. we're cool.

	angle the front door. for memphis has entered. he
	clocks the room. sees them at the rear ... walks back

				kip
		it can be done, man. we just gotta
		step it up... it's a challenge ...

				mirror man
		the challenge is not to get our nuts
		cut-off and shoved down our throats ...

				tumbler
		can i help you, pal -- ?

	and kip looks up ... to see memphis there ...

				memphis
		hey, kip ...

				kip
		hello, memphis --

				tumbler
		"memphis?" you're memphis?

				memphis
		that's right...

				tumbler
		damn. damn, damn, damn ...

				freb
		memphis. holy shit. it's an honor,
		man --

	and he pumps his hand... memphis continues to stare at kip

				kip
		it's good to see ya, man. you changed
		your look -

				memphis
		you, too

	hold the stare... the others are excited...

				freb
		what are you doing back, memphis?

				memphis
		little visit. check on the family.

				kip
		it's nice to see ya, man -

	he smiles ... memphis eyeballs him... toby is there ...

				toby
		hey, memphis. remember me? toby
		walker. i live next door ...

				memphis
		sure. hey, toby. you grew up

				toby
		yeah, i'm cool ...

	and memphis turns back to kip, who's picked up a pool cue.

				kip
		who's got next game -- ?

	and he makes to rack 'em up ... then:

				mirror man
		i get it. you ain't gotta be a genius:
		memphis come back to save our bacon!

				tumbler
		shut-up, mirror man --

				freb
		izzat true? you come back to save our
		bacon?

				mirror man
		of course it's true. he come to save
		his brother's dangling ass --

				kip
		that can't be it. cos we don't need
		saving

				freb
		we don't -- ?

				memphis
		he give you an advance -- ?

				mirror man
		hell, yeah. ten larger man

	kip shoots him a look... as if he's spoken out of turn ...

				memphis
		you just give 'im back the money.
		all's well...

	the others look glum... kip laughs ... long and hard...

				kip
		"give lim back the money." "give 'im
		back the money..." be nice. if only
		we didn't drink the money. and smoke
		the money. and buy nikes with the
		money. and sony play stations with the
		money. and dirty girls with the
		money...

	and kip sinks a ball ... memphis looks at the others ... they
	nod... it's true ... the money's gone ...

				kip
		but don't worry, man. things are all
		sweetness and light here...

				tumbler
		things are all leafy and suburban ...

				mirror man
		the hell they are --

				kip
		sure they are. although we do appreciate the
		gesture, memphis. but we do got it handled...
		and it was nice to see you -- -

	memphis nods ... looks at all of them... smiles ... and then
	reaches out, grabbing kip by the collar, yanking him to his feet
	and in close, nose to nose ...

				memphis
		you listen to me, baby brother. you fancy
		yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum,
		well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a
		poundcake. but i remember the days when you
		used to steal my colorforms and eat 'em...
		so you can't stop me from saving your
		"dangling ass' if that's what i feel like
		doing...

	and with that, he shoves kip back down into his seat, toppling the
	table, bottles and glasses crashing... and barrels away from them,
	the crowd parting like a wound...

	kip's crew left stunned, flustered, and maybe a bit impressed...

				tumbler
		damn... homeboy's on the dazzle ...

	and, off of kip's furious look, we cut to:
