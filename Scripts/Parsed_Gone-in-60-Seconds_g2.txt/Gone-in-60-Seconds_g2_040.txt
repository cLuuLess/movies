	int. otto's auto - later - night

	memphis, kip, donny, mirror man and otto sit around the garage ...
	going through the list ... tumbler calls from the next room:

				tumbler
		freb's here. open the gate.

				donny astricky
			(to otto)
		we sent him out on a solo boost. see
		what he could do ...

	freb pulls in an '89 cadillac coupe de ville ...

				freb
		how do i look in this one?

				mirror man
		like a goofy white boy in a cadillac.

				donny astricky
		how'd it go?

				freb
		keys were in it ...

				donny astricky
		well, that defies the point, don't it?

				mirror man
		you should ask him how he got the name
		"freb."

				freb
		shaddup, man ...

				donny astricky
		get the damn thing in there and get it
		cleaned up -

	freb pulls in. pops the trunk. the gate is closed.

				kip
		this is loaded with crap - get a duffel.

	he pulls out a set of golf clubs ... freb brings over a duffel ...
	mirror man plucks something from the trunk ...

				mirror man (cont'd)
		holy shit ...

	it's a plasticine bag - full of a white powder...

				donny astricky
		lemme see that -

	he pierces the skin.. tastes ...

				donny astricky (cont'd)
		heroin.

				kip
		no shit?

	and they pull back the trunk tarp ... and there are perhaps two
	dozen similar smack-filled bags ...

				donny astricky
		there's gotta be a million bucks worth
		here -

				tumbler
		we're rich. goddamn, we're rich!

				memphis
		where'd you pick her up?

				freb
		in front of one of them poker parlors in
		chinatown ...

				memphis
		well, take it back --

				kip
		take it back? what do you mean take
		it back? are you crazy, man?


				memphis
		take it back, freb --

				mirror man
		hey, now, memphis... c'mon, man -

	donny makes to grab the bag from mirror man ... but mirror man
	holds on ... they tug back and forth ... the bag drops ...
	splitting on the ground, behind the car. spilling heroin.

				mirror man (cont'd)
		now, see what you--

	but a bang! bang! on the front gate, gives them all pause.

				otto
		who is it -- ?

				detective castlebeck (o.s.)
		castlebeck.

				donny astricky
		jesus. the whole damn thing's loaded.

				otto
		one minute -- !

	and the others scatter into the back office, with their tools and
	devices and lists. leaving only memphis and otto.

	memphis picks up the broken bag ... sticks it in the trunk ...
	puts the golf clubs in on top of it ... slams the trunk. only
	there's still a neat mountain of smack on the floor by the rear of
	the caddy ... but there's no time...

	for the gate is opened. detective castlebeck ambles in.

				detective castlebeck
		i know you.

				memphis
		you know my back.

				detective castlebeck
		what are you still doing here,
		randall?

				memphis
		stopped by to see otto. say hello.

	castlebeck looks at otto... otto grins... castlebeck walks around
	the garage... taking it all in...

	castlebeck notes the caddy ...

				detective castlebeck
		what's this -- ?

				otto
		cadillac.

	angle - the mound of heroin on the floor ...

				detective castlebeck
		what's wrong with it -- ?

				otto
		needs brightening ...

	castlebeck takes out a walkie ... barks into it ...

				detective castlebeck
		run me down a tag - 329 hro. cadillac.

	he clicks off ... otto and memphis share one ... a glance to the
	smack ... castlebeck is a mere inches from it ...

				otto
		no faith in our new-found goodness,
		detective ...?

				detective castlebeck
		sure. but sometimes we got to
		create some numbers. the task force
		is run by statistics, you know ...

	before they can respond, the radio crackles ...

				radio (o.s.)
		329 hro. there's no want on the license at
		this time...

	castlebeck looks disappointed... otto grins ... castlebeck stares
	at the caddy, still unconvinced...

				memphis
		you're thinking: okay, there's no want ...
		but they probably stripped its guts and
		crated 'em up, right ... ?

				detective castlebeck
		something like that -

	memphis opens the driver's side door ... gestures castlebeck in
	... castlebeck gets behind the wheel ...

				memphis
		let her rip ...

	and castlebeck starts the car...

	angle - tailpipe ... whoosh! all of the heroin on the flo is blown
	away by the exhaust ... memphis winks to otto ... castlebeck seems
	satisfied ... gets out.

				detective castlebeck
		okay, then. i'll catch you later,
		randall ...

				otto
		double-meaning intended, right?

				detective castlebeck
		right ...

	castlebeck stops at the gate... turns back to them...

				detective castlebeck
		it's funny. there's probably been
		five more cars stolen in the time
		i've been here ...

				memphis
		i don't think so, detective ...

	and castlebeck is gone. memphis and otto exhale big time.. the
	others come out from the back... to find memphis and otto dumping
	the heroin into the sink, running the tap ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		take her back to where you found her,
		freb --
