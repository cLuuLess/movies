	int. "the nautical mile" saloon - night

	a shot glass, slammed down on a bar by a surly drunk... in a
	mariner saloon. drunken sailors and fisherman and navy types.
	sawdust on the floor. broken beer mirrors. a rough joint...

				drunk
		one more, girl -

	the bartender comes over.. . she is a dark-haired, heavily 
	tattooed girl, 26, with the faded blue world-weariness of roy orbison
	song... her name is sara wayland... and she goes by sway. she
	collects the drunk's empty glass...

				sway
		i think you've had enough, billy...

				drunk
		enough? i haven't even started, girl.
		gimme another --

				sway
		if you leave now, billy, you can get
		a head-start on waking up in a pool
		of your own vomit...

				drunk
		listen, you little cooze--

	and the drunk reaches out across the bar, to grab a bottle and
	sway grabs his hand, twists it ... the drunk groans in agony ...
	and sway, still clutching his hand, hops over the bar ... and
	drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front ... cries of
	"attagirl, sway!" pepper the air ...
