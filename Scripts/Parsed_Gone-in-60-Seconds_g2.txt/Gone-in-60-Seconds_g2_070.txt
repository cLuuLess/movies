	ext. bacchiochi's foreign motors - day

	memphis walks out... going over to the parked car across the
	street ... castlebeck...

				memphis
		i'm on the move -

				detective castlebeck
		your girl works in there ...

				memphis 
		not my girl anymore

				detective castlebeck
		yet your still here ... i gave
		you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...

				memphis
		what do you want from me?

				detective castlebeck
		honestly? i want to - once every
		few months - get into my car. pack
		a lunch. and drive on up to chino.
		on visiting day. bring you some
		magazines. maybe some almond clusters.
		and see you all bright and shiny in
		your orange jumpsuit. that's what i want ...

	and with that, he starts his car ... drives off... memphis gazing
	after him...
