	ext. ten-ton transfer company - front gates

	a huge trucking company warehouse. kip gets out. bolt-cuts the
	chain-fence out front.

	and memphis drives on in, passing the long rows of gargantuan
	car carriers here. he picks one ...

				memphis
		this one ...

	he slim-jims the door ... but the alarm goes off ... a wild
	whooping alarm ... deafening... try as he might, he can't get it
	off. he pops the trunk. looks for wires ... nothing.

	then, at once, it goes off. memphis turns. kip is there. he holds
	a little device.

				memphis (cont'd)
		what's that thing -- ?

				kip
		reads the infrared. then kills it. little
		something the r & d department came up with ...

				memphis
		how long were you gonna let me try and
		stop it...?

				kip
		after a while, it became a little pathetic ...
		figured i'd put you out of your misery ...

				memphis
		thank-you ...

				kip
		de nada ...

	he gets behind the wheel. pops the ignition. the truck's flipping
	stack belches. memphis climbs in next to him.

				memphis
		ain't we good-timing here ... ?

				kip
		the family that steals together, deals
		together...

				memphis
		dad'd be proud --

				kip
		maybe not. but dad was from another era...

				memphis
		what era was that -- ?

				kip
		the era when crime didn't pay --

				memphis
		as opposed to now, kid car crusher?

				kip
		price of doing business...

				memphis
		what about just getting a job, 9 to 5,
		five days a week, that whole mystery
		achievement -- ?

				kip
		it's for assholes. the legal buck blows,
		memphis.  you know that. doing this, we
		make mad bank, my boys are down, the
		girlies come around and the boosts are
		a breeze. yeah, sure, you're gonna get
		jacked-up every now and then - but ain't
		that a small price to pay for never,
		never-ever, having to say "paper or
		plastic?"

	and he grins and puts the truck into gear. and off they go
