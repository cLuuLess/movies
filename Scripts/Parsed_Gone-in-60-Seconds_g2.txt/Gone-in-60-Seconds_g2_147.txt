	ext. long beach boulevard - day

	memphis drives... kip beside him...

				memphis
		you okay -- ?

				kip
		i dunno ... i keep thinking about
		him.

	memphis nods. but then flashing lights behind them ... an unmarked
	with code 3 capabilities - lights & sirens ... memphis considers
	... he could make another run ... but the looks at kip... enough
	is enough ... he pulls over ...

				kip (cont'd)
		what are you doing? you can outrun
		him...

				memphis
		it's over. the dumb shit is over ...

	the unmarked pulls up behind him... the cop comes over ... it is,
	of course, detective castlebeck.

				detective castlebeck
		i know you.

				memphis
		you know my back.

	castlebeck opens his coat... showing stuffed holster ...

				detective castlebeck
		it's finished, randall. get out of
		the car... you, too, kid...

	memphis starts to get out. when castleback's radio crackles.

				radio (o.s.)
		we have suspect vehicle matching description
		at the woodburn scrap and metal ... repeat:
		the suspect vehicle has just been
		apprehended at the woodburn scrap and metal,
		190 street and campanza ...

	castlebeck frowns, goes to his radio. memphis looks at kip.

				kip
		i reported it ...

	memphis is impressed...

				memphis
		not bad

	angle - castlebeck at his car, on the radio ...

				detective castlebeck
		dispatch, what's the license on
		the suspect vehicle... ?

				radio (o.s.)
		license is california 6-1-4 hso. repeat:
		california. 6-1-4 henry sam ocean.

	and castlebeck looks at the license on this eleanor... a vanity
	plate that says - my 67 ...

				detective castlebeck
		10-4.

	and he goes back over to memphis ...

				detective castlebeck (cont'd)
		looks like we live to fight another
		round. you're free to go ...

	memphis can barely believe it. castlebeck leans down, to kip:

				detective castlebeck (cont'd)
		your brother's a clever man and a
		talented thief, kipling. but as role
		models go, you should observe the man,
		not the thief ...

				kip
		yes, sir ...

	castlebeck sighs...

				memphis
		don't look so glum, detective. it's a
		beautiful day, the birds are singing,
		and there's a container ship on
		pier 14, that's guaranteed to bring you glee ...

	castlebeck nods ...

				detective castlebeck
		i want you gone, randall. settle your
		affairs. make it right with those you
		love. hell, take 'em with you. but i
		want you out of here. out of here for
		good this time ...

				memphis
		consider me gone, detective --

				detective castlebeck
		i'll catch you later, randall --

				memphis
		double-meaning intended --

				detective castlebeck
		you betcha --

	and memphis races off ...
