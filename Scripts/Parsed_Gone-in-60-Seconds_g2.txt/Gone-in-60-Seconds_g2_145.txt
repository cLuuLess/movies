	int. woodburn construction - workshop

	the sliding door is open. the casket for kip rests to the side ...
	calitri uses a router to make a rabbet along the bottom frame of a
	plywood gossip bench. he senses something and turns to

	the loading dock - memphis

	has driven up in the smashed-to-shit eleanor ... he climbs up,
	entering the workshop... calitri glances to the wallclock: 7:55
	am...

				calitri
		well, well. you've caused quite a ruckus ...

				memphis
		this is number 50. we did it. it's
		over where's the money ?

				calitri
		right there -

	he gestures to a haliburton case ... memphis opens it ... there's
	a lot of cash inside...

				calitri (cont'd)
		200 k. just like we said ...

				memphis
		you should never have gotten my brother and
		his friends involved ...

				calitri
		but i had to. it was the only way to
		get to you --

	memphis looks at him... calitri smiles ...

				memphis 
		well, now, he's clear. and you'll stay away
		from him...

				calitri
		i don't know about that, randall.
		he did such a good job on this paper.
		and another one just came in ...

	calitri goes to the fax machine... tears off the sheet..

				calitri (cont'd)
		it's an easier take. 30 cars. two
		weeks. most of them suvs. going to
		russia. think kip'll be interested?

				memphis
		you don't want to even sniff at that --

	calitri grins. but then his smile goes south, as he sees, for the
	first time -- eleanor -- parked out on the loading dock. and she
	is smashed-to-shit.

				calitri
		well, that certainly won't do.

				memphis
		what do you mean -- ?

				calitri
		look at it. i can't very well make
		delivery of that thing ...

				memphis
		you got no choice. it's over.

				calitri
		fifty cars. fifty cars by 8 am
		friday. or kip goes in that box.
		that was the deal ... goddamn, it ...
		that was the deal ...

	memphis is by a table saw... he flicks it on. the electric motor
	rumbles, so as to obfuscate, any noise in here ...

				calitri (cont'd)
		what are you doing -- ?

				memphis
		tell you what i'm not doing: i'm not
		gonna let you get into my kool aid...

	and memphis is on him... they go rolling about in grunts and
	groans - eddies of sawdust swirling - the noise of the table saw
	drowning out the sounds of combat ...

	calitri is on top, grabbing an awl from the floor, bringing the
	lethal point down to memphis' face... memphis holds calitri's
	wrist, straining, the point inches from his eye

	angle - floor socket - right above memphis' head. with a last
	gasp, memphis misdirects the awl so it stabs the floor socket - a
	small clap of voltage shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl
	akimbo ...

	both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself
	out inside of them... calitri is up; and he's found the gun ...

	he crawls over to memphis, climbing on him, sitting down hard on
	the younger man's chest ... but then memphis grabs him by the hair
	and tosses calitri off him ... memphis pounds calitri's head into
	the floor ...

	once, twice. three times. calitri is out ... memphis gets to his
	feet, nose bloody. he catches his breath. only the door opens ...
	and atley is there ...

				atley jackson
		jesus, man ... what'd you do?

				memphis
		my version of "take this job and shove
		it..."

				atley jackson
		are you crazy? you throw down with the
		carpenter? you got a grudge against
		your life?

	but before memphis can respond, there are approaching engine
	sounds from up the alleyway -- as a panel van arrives. memphis and
	atley look at the wall-clock. 8:05. a glance to the unconscious
	calitri ...

				atley jackson (cont'd)
		now you done it. and with you
		gone - who'll save kip the next
		time ... ?

				memphis
		this is all about there not being
		a next time, atley --

	and the two men hold the look... and the van doors slam, as digger
	and butz, calitri's grave-diggers, get out ... atley goes to the
	unconscious calitri ... and he picks him up, straining under the
	dead weight ... dragging the don over to

	the open casket - one final burst of strength and atley drops
	calitri into the casket... slamming the swell top lid of the
	coffin. he turns to look at the shocked memphis -- as digger and
	butz are there -

				atley jackson
		hello, boys -- !

				digger
		hey! what happened? did they make it

				atley jackson
		they did not. a tragedy.

				digger
		mr. c. around?

				atley jackson
		he's napping. he said to take it away...

	atley gestures to the coffin. and they pick it up, move it to the
	van...

				digger
		that'll do ya. tell mr. c. we was by.

				memphis
		absolutely.

	and they are gone ... and atley turns to memphis

				atley jackson
		ding dong the witch is dead, right?

				memphis
		point-five ...

	and he holds out his hand ... and they shake ...

				atley jackson
		get outta here, memphis --

	and memphis does ... nods to atley...

				memphis
		thank you...

	atley nods ... memphis walks out to the loading dock... atley
	watches him go ...

				atley jackson
		hoo-boy.
