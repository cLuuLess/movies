	int. helen raines' house - kitchen

	memphis is at the kitchen table. the list of cars before him. he's
	making notations. he gets to his feet ... he goes to check on his
	mother ... she's asleep in her room... he closes the door ...

	and goes back to the kitchen. he goes to a framed photograph - of
	he and kip. earlier times. happier times.

	when there is an enormous thud! from outside. memphis goes to a
	window. sees a ramp truck unloading a gnarled blob of metal.
	memphis runs outside. just as the ramp truck drives off ...

	memphis goes to the mangled trans am... leans down ... and there's
	kip ... seriously smooshed in the flattened car.

				memphis
		kip -- ?

				kip
		yeah ...

				memphis
		you all right -- ?

				kip
		i think so. there's things i can't
		feel right now. like my feet. but ...
		you think you can get me outta this,
		memphis? i'd appreciate it -

				memphis
		just hold-on there --

	memphis goes to the garage ... finds a crowbar, an acetylene
	torch, tin-snips ... he goes back to the wrecked car... and sets
	to work... he looks at kip ... shakes his head...

				memphis (cont'd)
		so you want to run that part by me
		again about things being "all
		sweetness and light..."

				kip
		this has nothing to do with any
		of that --

				memphis
		oh. you maybe have more than one
		enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?

				kip
		all my enemies own car crushers. 
		it's like a pre-requisite ... owwww...

				memphis
		easy ... take it easy ... we're almost
		there...

	indeed... memphis has freed him ... kip crawls from the wreckage
	... his clothes in tatters... blood seeps from a variety of
	contusions ... he limps ... memphis helps him to the guest house
	...
