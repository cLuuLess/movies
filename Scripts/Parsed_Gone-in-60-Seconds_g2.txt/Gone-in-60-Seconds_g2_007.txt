	int. warehouse - long beach harbor - night

	a dozen purloined autos are parked here ... and a number of
	shipping containers ... a thuggish man reads the paper ... the
	tennis ball bouncer is tumbler, 20 ... and he's sitting on a
	tilted back chair, and wall-bouncing the ball and annoying the
	piss out of

	atley jackson

	whom we remember from the drop-car at our opening ... atley walks
	with a limp now... thunk! thunk! thunk!

				atley jackson
		can you stop that, for chrissake?

				tumbler
		what's your problem, bro ?

	thunk! thunk!

				atley jackson
		where are they -- ?

				tumbler
		they'll be here. you nervous, bro? you? back
		in the day, they say you had anti-freeze in
		them veins ... what happened -- ?

	and atley intercepts the tennis ball ... and hurls it over to the
	far side of the warehouse ... tumbler merely grins ...

				tumbler (cont'd)
		relax and enjoy --
