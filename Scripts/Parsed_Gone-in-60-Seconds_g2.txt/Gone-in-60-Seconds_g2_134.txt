	int. long beach police station - day

	two dozen cops sit in the muster room listening to the dispatch.

				police dispatch (o.s.)
		... suspect is headed southbound
		on mount vernon, at cambridge street --

	the cops look at each other. holy shit! and race for the exit.
	because mt. vernon and cambridge is the address of
	the long beach police station

	where there are literally 15 police cars parked out front... and
	memphis has just arrived...

				memphis
		shit ...

	watch the mad scramble as cops dive into their units... and try to
	get out of each other's way... fenders crunch ... cops curse.
	memphis bootlegs - going reverse down the wrong way. left on
	cambridge ... left onto city hall plaza --

	city hall plaza

	is 10 acres of brick in the heart of downtown ... and now it's 
	like a demolition derby... as drycoff/castlebeck and some 4 squad cars
	are chasing memphis around the plaza ...

	a police chopper has arrived on the scene... camera out. memphis
	takes one more spin around the plaza, then sees a

	shallow flight of stairs by the back entrance to city.hall. and he
	takes them... clump-kump-ka-dump-dump-dump

	and now he's on some of the narrowest streets in long beach. he
	flies through them... a mad mouse in a maze ... int. kiss-108 -

	matty in the morning

	watches the chase on tv, via copter-cam. still broadcasting.

				matty in the morning
		man, is this boy driving! you go,
		boss barracuda
