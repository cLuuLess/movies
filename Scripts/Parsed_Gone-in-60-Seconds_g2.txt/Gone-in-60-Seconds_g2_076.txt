	mirror man and tumbler are at the window memphis brought them to
	last night ... mirror man has a radio transmitter in his hand...
	donny comes by ...

				donny
		what are you doing?

				tumbler
		watch and learn, old-timer --

	as mirror man points the antennae out the window ... a toy car - a
	1970 hemi 'cuda replica ... radio-operated, the car speeds along
	the curb outside, using parked cars as cover... she really cooks...

				donny
		the hell are you doing?

				mirror man
		delivering ordnance. y2k-style.

	angle - the 'cuda. as it cruises along. is stopped by a discarded
	40 oz. empty... but mirror man maneuvers and its back on track ...
	at last, parking jammed up to the front, right tire of drycoff and
	hawkings' unmarked.

				tumbler
		the hemi has landed --

				donny
		big deal. now what?

				mirror man
		what we call: fun and shit.

	and he hits a button on his radio control ... angle - the model
	'cuda. wedged in front of the tire. as a quartet of thin steel,
	razor-tipped spikes thrust out from the shaker hood ... a fraction
	away from the tire's skin ... mirror man and tumbler appear
	satisfied ...

				tumbler
		we can go now --
