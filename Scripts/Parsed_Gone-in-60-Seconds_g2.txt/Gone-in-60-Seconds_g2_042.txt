	ext. international towers high rise condos - day

	the garage door opens as a resident drives out ... and memphis and
	donny and kip and toby enter the garage ... they walk along the 
	rows of parked cars ... searching ...

				donny astricky
		car-jacking is the lazy man's boost.
		no skill. no finesse. can only take
		the car if the key is in it. that's
		not thieving. that's parking ...
		thugs ... with the decency of dirt ...

				toby
		they're just cars, man ...

	to prevent donny from biting the kid's head off, memphis chimes in
	with:

				memphis
		this eleanor's been living at the
		international towers for 3 years now.

				toby
		who's "eleanor?"

				memphis
		the 167 mustang shelby mustang gt-500.

				toby
		why do you call it "eleanor?"

				memphis
		all the vehicles get code names.
		female names. you say "eleanor lives
		at such and such... " and no one
		listening on the waves is the wiser ...

				donny astricky
		eleanor is memphis' "unicorn."

				memphis
		and there she is --

	indeed, slotted nearby is a '67 shelby mustang gt-500 silver with
	black top ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		hello, eleanor --

	and he looks at her. an old friend he hasn't seen in years.

				toby
		it looks just like a regular mustang --

				kip
		don't go there, toby --

				memphis
		she's not. carroll shelby tweaked the
		mustang's high-performance 289 engine
		and got it legally rated for the street
		at 450 horsepower ... but its actual
		output is closer to 600 ...

				toby
		so she flies -

				memphis
		she soars -

				donny astricky
		grade-a unicorn ...

				toby
		what's a "unicorn?"

				donny astricky
		fabled creature. you know - the horse
		with the horn? impossible to capture?

	toby looks blank ...

				donny astricky (cont'd)
		we all got one. the single car
		that, no matter how many times
		you try to boost, something happens...
		cops show up, car doesn't start, owner
		comes back. it's voodoo...

				toby
		you guys and the car thing, man --

	they head off ... memphis turns back to the shelby

				memphis
		see you in a few days, eleanor --
