	int. eleanor - park

	memphis in the middle of the gauntlet ... on the phone ...

				matty in the morning (o.s.)
		is this the boss barracuda -- ?

				memphis
		yes, sir.

				matty in the morning (o.s.)
		how you doing, man -- ?

				memphis
		the truth is - my car here doesn't
		have a tape deck. you mind hooking me
		with up with some driving tunes ?

				matty in the morning (o.s.)
		you got it, brother.

	memphis hangs up ... hears:

				matty in the morning (o.s.)
		this one is going out to
		the boss barracuda. catch him
		if you can --

	and he plays chuck berry's "no particular place to go" and 
	memphis smiles ...

				memphis
		attaboy --

	and punches the gas ... going right at castlebeck and the others
	... smashing through the squad cars ... and across the foot
	bridge, over the swan boats ...

				police dispatch (o.s.)
		all units. the pursuit is going
		again

	is it ever. memphis drives out of the park.. and gets onto

	another freeway

	ten lanes of gnarly superhighway ... he opens her up... full
	throttle ... the chopper above him ...
