	ext. city street - night

	freb and donny astricky have gotten "laura", a '99 bentley
	started...

				freb
		you ever feel bad about any of this?

				donny astricky
		of course not. i'm robin hood. i take
		from the rich, and give to the needy...

				freb
		you mean the poor --

				donny astricky
		no. the needy. us. cos we need this
		car!

	and donny puts her in gear, when a gun is jammed agains't donny's
	temple ...

				jacker
		out of the car, bitch, or i blow your
		fucking head off -- !

	donny looks at the jacker... surprised... it is a kid ... no more
	than 16 ...

				donny astricky
		are you kidding me -- ?

				jacker
		now -- !

				donny astricky
		i'm stealing this car. so back off!

				jacker
		i'll shoot you fool... i'll blow your
		brains out -- !

				freb
		donny --

				donny astricky
		donny-nothin'!

	and he slams open the door... catching the kid in the balls ...
	and the kid doubles over... dropping the gun ... donny gets out of
	the car...

				donny astricky (cont'd)
		lazy, disrespectinif half-assed
		bully. any asshole can pull a gun ...

	and he starts to kick at the kid ... beat at him...

				donny astricky (cont'd)
		you don't know how to steal a
		car, do ya? so you gotta take
		them when there's already a key
		in them ... and a person in them...
		scare people ... intimidate ...
		little freakin' bully ...

				freb
		c'mon, donny... let's go, man --

				donny astricky
		lazy ... lazy ... i ask you, freb:
		what's the matter with kids today?

	but then - blam! blam! blam! bullets rip into donny astricky in
	terrifying slow-motion. he turns ... to see another kid ...
	scared... at the edge of the road... gat held high ... and donny
	drops to the pavement ... and the first jacker gets to his feet...

	freb goes to donny... to his splayed-out body ... sirens split the
	night. the jackers run off down the street.

				donny astricky (cont'd)
		get outta here. get out. now!

				freb
		i can't leave you here, man --

	freb doesn't know what to do... donny croaks ...

				donny astricky
		i'm all right. been shot before. you
		take me to the hospital, they bust the
		both of us. the cops'll take me. go!

	and freb-makes to run off down the street... but --

				donny astricky (cont'd)
		freb -- !

	freb turns back

				donny astricky (cont'd)
		take laura with you, you stupid shit!

	freb blinks. nods. oh, yeah. he climbs into the bentley drives off...
	as the cruisers pull up around him... and the uniforms getout, guns
	drawn, approaching warily -

	to find donny astricky ... splayed-out on the pavement ...
	laughing at the moon ... and, as jimi hendrix' "crosstown traffic"
	blasts on track, we cut to:

	of the final series of boosts ...

	1) the maserati parked and empty. sway breaches it.
	expert. they drive off ...

	2) kip and tumbler. clocking a viper. they circle it..
	it's loaded with bells and whistles and clubs and a
	metallic voice that warns: "warning: you are too close the 
	vehicle!" over and over ... kip shakes his head ...
	ushers tumbler back ...

	3) mirror man and the sphinx deliver an aston martin to the docks
	... watch as it is driven into a container. the container loaded
	by gantry crane, onto the ship, lashed to the deck by overworked
	longshoremen...

	4) helen raines. looking out the window. listening to
	the scanner for word of her boys...

	5) the big board. female names disappearing like dust..

	6) castlebeck and drycoff. cruising the streets.
	searching ...

	7) kip and tumbler return to the viper. this time, in a ramp
	truck. they raise the ramp. tie down the viper. a drive off with
	it, to be disarmed at a later, safer venue as it continues its
	robotic exhortation of "warning. you are too close to the
	vehicle."  over and over again ...

	8) all our teams... speeding toward us ... in different
	cars ... as the music fades and we end montage
