	int. bacchiochi's foreign motors

	sway looks at memphis ...

				sway
		she's trouble --

				memphis
		i put the boys on it. they're clever
		that way...

	she nods ... long look ...

				sway
		i go with you --

				memphis
		that what you want?

				sway
		that's what i want ...

				memphis
		okay.

	she hits the lava soap and starts washing the grease from her
	hands ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		i missed you, you know -

				sway
		you mentioned that in your letters 

				memphis
		i always thought you'd follow me up.

	she shuts off the taps ... towels her hands...

				sway
		we were good when you bailed, weren't we?

				memphis
		very good...

				sway
		cos there were those dark days, when
		i figured - my god, how easy it was
		for him to just give it up; to make the
		deal; take the rot for the whole crew ...
		and give me up in the process.

				memphis
		no way ...

				sway
		no ... ?

				memphis
		no ...

	and he holds out a hand to her ... and she puts her greasesmeared
	towel into it ...

				sway
		don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me,
		randall. i'm the jane that was left, and
		you're the jim that did the leaving. so
		save the sanctimonious shit for someone
		who believes. the only reason i ride with
		you, is cause i don't want to spend the
		whole night with any of them other creeps!

				memphis
		oh. okay. right.
