	int. ruby's all-nite - long beach - night

	a 24-hour diner in the heart of long beach... the three plates are
	picked-up with an impressive dexterity by

	helen raines

	early 60s, clear-eyed... in pink ruby's uniform and chunky
	shoes... black currant hair striated with wisps of gray... helen
	delivers the plates to a booth of college kids ...

				kid
		can i get some more coffee -- ?

				helen raines
		sure, hon ...

	and she goes to the coffee station... when

				memphis (o.s.)
		who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna
		melt in this joint -- ?

	and she turns around to see memphis standing there. her expression
	displays many things ... most of them joy ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		hello, ma --

	and she goes to memphis ... wraps her arms around him ... squeezes
	tight ...

				helen raines (cont'd)
		oh, randall ...

	she takes his head in her hands ... kisses his cheek ... then the
	other... hugs on ... unmindful of the customers ... the cook
	smiles from behind the order wheel ...

				cook

				memphis

				helen raines

	and she leads him over to a booth ... barking to the cook - ruby -
	on the way...

				helen raines (cont'd)

		extra tomato, dijon... and a chocolate
		milk... lots of syrup...
			(to memphis)
		right?

				memphis

	and they settle in ... across the booth from each other ... she
	takes his hands...

				helen raines

				memphis
		you, too, ma...

				helen raines
		what are you doing back?

				memphis

				helen raines
		have you seen him?
