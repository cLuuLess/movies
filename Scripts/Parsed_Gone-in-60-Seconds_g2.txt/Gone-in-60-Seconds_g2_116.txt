	int. the mazda - back bay - night

	as "little red corvette" by prince warbles on the track... memphis
	and sway still kissing... she breaks it for:

				sway
		arright ... enough ... i can't have you
		bellying up to my heart again, man, f
		you can't help falling off the stool.
		but he puts his mouth to her ears ...

				memphis
		shhh... car thieves are your weakness.

	whispers ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		i approach you. it's quiet. i look
		this way. that. no one around ...

				sway
		stop. what about maserati boy?

				memphis
		i take out my slim-jim...

				sway
		oh, god...

	and yes, this is patently absurd. but it's also oddly sexy.

				memphis
		slip it in ...

				sway
		you're going high-cheese, dude --

				memphis
		unlock your button ...

				sway
		"unlock my button" ... ?

				memphis
		the alarms go off ...

				sway
		woo-woo-wooooo!

				memphis
		i pop your hood; find your siren wires

				sway
		they're factory alarms ... easy to get
		around... for a man with... skills...

				memphis
		i do ... i cut "em...

				sway
		cut 'em...

				memphis
		now... i'm in ...

				sway
		of course you are. you're a
		professional...

				memphis
		i ratchet your ignition mechanism ...

				sway
		i bet you say that to all the girls...

				memphis
		with a twist of my wrist ... you're turned
		over ...

				sway
		wrong preposition...

				memphis
		hear you roar ...

				sway
		what about the club ... ?

				memphis
		let me worry about the club ...

				sway
		no worries ...

				memphis
		i've got you floored... we're off ...
		take the curb... man, can you corner...
		know not to get on it ... momentum
		shift ... don't get on those brakes
		too hard ... get her up on her
		tires. up on her toes. up ... up...
		up.

	back arched... a small moan escapes her ... prince wails ... and
	sway has achieved whatever kind of silly climax they aspired to
	here... she flops back down... looks at him...

				sway
		you're still quite the boost, randall
		raines ...
			(he shrugs)
		except now i've been chopped, and my
		parts are in a honda prelude being driven
		to church in south america by some
		bolivian consulate's wife ...

				memphis
		and tracy's on the move ...

	indeed, the girl has gotten out of the maserati... and the car has
	rocketed off... memphis punches the gas,'sending sway to the floor...

				sway
		wham, bam, thank-you, ma'am, point-
		five ...
