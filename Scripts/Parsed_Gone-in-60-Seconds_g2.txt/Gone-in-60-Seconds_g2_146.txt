	memphis walks to the battered eleanor ... as pearl jam's
	"rearviewmirror' crunches and a car comes motoring up to him. it's
	another 167 shelby. another eleanor, a "for sale" sign pasted on
	the back window. it's being driven by kip...

				memphis
		what are you doing here?

				kip
		i saw her get smashed-up on the tv.
		knew there was no way he was gonna
		accept her ...

				memphis
		where'd you find this one?

				kip
		ya gotta keep tabs on your "eleanors",
		memphis. cos you never know when
		you're gonna need one --

				memphis
		you boost her -- ?

				kip

				memphis
