	ext. the 405 freeway north - eleanor - moving - day

	memphis driving. sway riding shotgun. long beach at their backs
	... memphis looks quite enthralled behind the wheel... he loves
	driving this car. sway watches him. he feels it --

				memphis
		what -- ?

				sway
		nothing. just that if i was less
		secure, i might think you were more
		into eleanor than you are me...

				memphis
		she does have one thing you don't.

				sway
		what's that?

				memphis
		bench seats.

	and he grins ... pats the seat beside him... and sway slides
	close... he throws his arm around her ...

	and off they go ... as the turtles' ("eleanor/gee, i think you're
	swell/and you really do me well/you're my pride and joy, etc.")
	sing on... and we hear:

				memphis (o.s.)
		you like bingo -- ?

	and eleanor drives away from us ... into the searing horizon line
	... becoming just another single, yellow dot in the pointillist
	pattern that is the american road.
