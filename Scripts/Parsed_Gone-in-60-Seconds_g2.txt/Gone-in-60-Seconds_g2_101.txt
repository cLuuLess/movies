	ext. san pedro warehouse - night

	where mirror man is still struggling with the lock, his drills
	and punches, scattered about ...

				mirror man
		just give me another --

	only the sphinx shoves him aside ... pulls the gun from his 
	holster and blang! blasts open the lock...

	mirror man stares at the opened door ...

				mirror man
		oh, i get it: old school.

	and memphis and the others drive up ...

				memphis
		how's it going?

				mirror man
		it's going fine. the quiet riot and me are
		swapping trade secrets ...

	and in they go --
