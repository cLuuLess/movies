	helen raines is rooting through a crowded closet. at last she
	finds what she's looking for ... a small black boxy device. she
	goes to the living room. plugs in the box ...

	it is a police scanner... and it immediately starts to pop and caw
	... helen sits down ... and listens... her face clenched with
	worry ...
