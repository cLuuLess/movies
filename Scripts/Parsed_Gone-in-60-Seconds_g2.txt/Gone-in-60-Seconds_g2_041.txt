	int. raines apartment - night

	kip is in front of the tv, playing a video game. helen raines is
	at the kitchen table, going through a photo album... memphis comes
	home ... hangs up his coat ...

				memphis
		hey -

	he kisses her head ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		kip -

	kip nods ... plays on ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		what do you got there?

				helen raines
		the photo album. i get nostalgic around
		this time of year ...

				memphis
		what time of year?

				helen raines
		tuesdays ...

	he smiles ... sits down next to her ... they go through the

	photos: - childhood shots of memphis and kip, a younger helen;
	memphis at 17, in his "ike's garage" coveralls; 14year-old
	memphis, an infant kip, and their father (robert raines) a man
	with bright eyes and a quiet smile, standing before an old cutlass
	442; robert raines ... outside a car dealership. we can almost
	feel his strong, sure presence ...

	memphis looks at his mother ... as she looks at the picture.

				memphis
		you ever wonder what things'd be like
		if he hadn't died?

				helen raines
		every day. i wonder about that every day...

				memphis
		kip and i'd probably be working at the
		dealership...
			(to kip)
		imagine us selling cars?

	nothing from kip ... eyes glued to the tv... memphis glances to
	his mother ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		imagine that -- ?

				helen raines
			(salesman voice)
		and just in case you lose your keys, good
		sir, i can toss in a complimentary slim-jim,
		free of charge ...

				memphis
		mother -- !

	they laugh ... look at the album ... at robert raines ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		i remember, every day, he'd come home
		in a different car.
		that was the greatest thing ... and
		we'd climb all over it ... examine
		every inch of every different
		car ...

				helen raines
		i remember. supper getting cold, cos you
		two are out there heads under hoods ...

				memphis
		you remember that, kip?

				kip
		i was six ...

	memphis and helen look at him... then:

				memphis
		after he died ... i think that's
		what i missed most of all ... that
		there was no different cars every night ...
		when i started hanging around otto's ...
		and he started showing me the things ...
		it was a way to kill two birds ...
		put food on the table for you and kip ...
		and ... ride in different cars every
		night ... just like when dad was here.

	tears stand in helen's eyes ... kip gets to his feet ...

				kip
		ancient history's two things.
		"ancient." and "history!"

	and he walks out of the house, door slamming behind him. memphis
	turns to his mother ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		we're gonna have to do this thing, ma.

				helen raines 
		i know...

				memphis
		we do it. he'll get clear once and
		for all 

	and she nods ...

	angle - a photo. robert raines. smiling beside an olds 98.
