	int. garage - the mexican man

	is sobbing. as raymond calitri marches toward him, glancing at the
	bloodied windshield.

				calitri
		you bring this to me in this
		condition? blood and guts all
		over it? you make me complicit?
		on my property? who taught you
		how to think? and worst of all:
		weren't there supposed to be two
		hondas?

				thief
		please ...

	and calitri, rapid-fire, punctures the man's belly and chest and
	legs with the chisel, old-school prison-shiv style ... until the
	man is on the floor, howling ...

				calitri
		stupid sonuvabitch...
