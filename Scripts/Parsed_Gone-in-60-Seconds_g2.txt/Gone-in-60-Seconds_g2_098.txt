	int. memphis' van - moving

	memphis and sway... they ride in silence ... she busies herself by
	looking through the consul. comes up with a tube of lipstick. uses
	the visor mirror to apply it.

				memphis
		gosh, no. lipstick? what next? mascara, blush,
		floral-print dresses?

				sway
		deodorant.

	and she looks at him... she's really laid the lipstick on
	thick ... but it's oddly effective ...

				memphis
		wow. bozo, the very sexy clown --

	beat. she looks out the window, throws the following away.

				sway
		so, you seeing anybody?

				memphis
		no. i had a girl. she was great. the
		problem is: great girls come along once
		every ten years. so i gotta wait
		another three years before i can even
		bother to look...

				sway
		she was so great, why'd you leave her?

				memphis
		her parole officer strongly recommended 
		it ...

	she looks at him... but he's stopped the car... for kip and
	tumbler are waiting at the side of the street. they get in.
