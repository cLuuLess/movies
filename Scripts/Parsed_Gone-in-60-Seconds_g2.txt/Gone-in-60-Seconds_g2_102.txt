	int. warehouse

	dark as pitch. flashlights come on. to reveal

	row upon row of gleaming ferraris

	old and new models. daytonas and boxers and dinos and
	testarossas. there must be at least fifty of them here.

	flashlight beams dance over car after car. it's a treasure chest
	of automotive jewels ... all of our heroes are in awe. and then a
	soft whimpering. they turn. to see sway, overcome with emotion.

				sway
		it's just... so... beautiful ...

	and it is kip that puts an arm around her ... she sobs into his
	chest ... never taking her eyes from the array of italian grace
	... indeed, they are all in something of trance. memphis is the
	first one out --

				memphis
		c'mon, gang. let's focus. sway, can
		you prep 'em -- ?

				sway
		i think so... they're just... so ...

				memphis
		i know. but let's prep 'em. we could
		stay here all night... that wouldn't
		be good --

	the others are still gazing ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		let's go, people --

	and they set to work...
