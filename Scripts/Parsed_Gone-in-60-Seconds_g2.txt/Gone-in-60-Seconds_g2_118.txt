	int. countach - mirror man

	is freaking out ... the snake wrapped all around him...

				mirror man
		what do i do? what do i do? aw, man.
		he's gonna swallow my shit whole 
		let's go to a hospital or something!

	but the sphinx shakes his head. no.

				mirror man (cont'd)
		c'mon, you creepy no-nosed motherfucker.
		take me to a hospital!

	nope. the sphinx drives on... into yet another

	director's chase scene

	this one even cooler than the last ... and once they've eluded all
	of the police, the sphinx pulls over to the side of a darkened
	street...

				mirror man
		what are you doing? i'm gonna die!

	the sphinx leans over... and pinches the snake behind the back of
	the head...

				mirror man (cont'd)
		you tryin' to make him more mad?

	but, miraculously, the snake relaxes its grip on mirror man... and
	slithers off... to the back of the car ... where it immediately
	goes back to sleep ... mirror man stares at sphinx, who smiles
	genially. then:

				mirror man (cont'd)
		i never thought it'd be possible:
		but your ass just got spookier ...
