	ext. night club parking lot - night

	donny astricky and freb have accessed a '61 jag... watch as donny
	takes out 3 screws in the jag's ignition and removes the whole
	thing ...

				donny astricky
		so? tell me: how come they call you
		"freb" anyways -- ?

				freb
		c'mon, man ...

				donny astricky
		we're partners here --

	freb considers ... then, reluctantly --

				freb
		my names "fred." you know: frederick?
		one drunk night, i decided to give
		myself a tattoo. hot needle it. i
		used a mirror to guide me ...

	and he pulls up his sleeve - to show the blue "freb" tattooed
	there ...

				freb (cont'd)
		the mirror messed me up with the "b" and
		the "d"... everything's reversed, you
		know? now, i'm "freb."

	donny chooses from a selection of ignitions he's brought along.
	finds the right one ... installs it ... tightens the 3 screws ...
	starts the car with his own key ...

				donny astricky
		glad to know you, "freberick." let's
		roll -

	and off they go ...
