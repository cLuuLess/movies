	ext. lower grand - later

	rescue team presence. atley being hauled out of the wreck... his
	leg is a torn mess ... he's barely conscious... a cuffed donny
	astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ...

	a police car pulls up ... and out steps

	detective roland castlebeck

	of g.r.a.b. the governor's regional auto-theft bureau. castlebeck
	is mid-50s, black, saturnine. - but don't let the tacit nobility
	fool you - the man's a street viper ...

	castlebeck goes to another cop - hawkings..

				hawkings
		astricky. and jackson. no sign of
		raines...

				detective castlebeck
		well, then it's all for naught,
		ain't it, hawkings?

	castlebeck looks out over the mess ... and then looks up...
	because, further down lower grand, a car is parked. it is the
	shelby. with memphis leaning against its hood...

	castlebeck looks around him, but no one's noticed. so he walks
	toward it, hand on hip...

				detective castlebeck
		i know you --

				memphis
		you know my back -

				detective castlebeck
		you want to come along quiet?

				memphis
		how's atley -- ?

				detective castlebeck
		leg's all banged-up. he made a
		stupid play ... he'll limp around
		the yard up at folsom. but
		astricky will be there to take
		care of him. with their priors,
		they're looking at a serious bounce --

				memphis
		let them go --

				detective castlebeck
		how's that?

				memphis
		let them go. and i'll leave ...

				detective castlebeck
		you'll leave -- ?

				memphis
		you don't have anything on me. a
		misdee auto-theft. i got no record.
		i'll be out in three days, and back at 
		it. or you let them go, and i give
		you my word. i'm gone. and without the
		ringleader ... your tee-times have
		just grown exponentially...

				detective castlebeck
		i don't golf...

	and they stare at each other, as castlebeck considers.

				detective castlebeck (cont'd)
		i do this. and i see you again. i'll
		come after you with everything i got.
		you won't be able to steal a glance
		at a blind man without me by your side ...

				memphis
		you have my word...

				detective castlebeck
		get out of here, then. now.

	and memphis makes to get into the shelby...

				detective castlebeck
		leave the car, randall ...

	memphis nods ... takes one last look at the shelby... sorry to 
	leave it behind ... and he runs off into the mists of lower
	grand ...

	castlebeck walks back toward the crime-scene tumult ...

				detective castlebeck
		arright, let lim go. cite him for
		rolling the stop ... and cite old
		atley for driving to endanger ...

				hawkings
		what are you talking about, rollie? we're
		springing 'em? just like that?

				detective castlebeck
		just like that. quit your bellyaching,
		hawkings ... and let's wrap this up ...

	and off of donny's surprised look, as springsteen wails to
	crescendo and we

									cut to:
