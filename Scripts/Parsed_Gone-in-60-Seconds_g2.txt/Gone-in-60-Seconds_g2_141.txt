	ext. tunnel - eleanor

	eating asphalt ... coming to the tunnel's mouth ... to the road
	block ... memphis pins her ... zooooom! dead-on to the roadblock
	... and, at the last moment, as the cops dive out of the way --

	memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral -- and yanks the parking
	brake -- and the mustang spins on the straight --(and yes, this is
	exactly like our opening) screeching spin ... it stops inches from
	the road block ...

	beat ... thirty squad cars stop behind him ...

				police dispatch (o.s.)
		all units. pursuit has been
		terminated. repeat: pursuit has
		been terminated at harbor tunnel
		eastern terminus --

	sure it has. memphis' foot slams on eleanor's pedal ... smashing
	through the roadblock... cars and cops flying ... and the dispatch
	guy is getting pissed.

				police dispatch (o.s.)
		check that, all units. you guessed it.
		pursuit has not been terminated. jesus
		christ, will you catch this guy?
