	int. otto's auto - garage - night

	the replacements chime in with "someone take the wheel." memphis
	and the crew ... all but sway are present.

	tumbler and mirror man follow memphis to one side of the shop ...
	to a window ... he gestures outside to where we see and unmarked
	car and the orange glow of two cigarettes ... staking them out ...

				memphis
		we've got to shake them tomorrow
		night. i'm making that your problem.
		that's called delegation of duties.
		you like it -- ?

	mirror man and tumbler regard the cops ...

				mirror man
		sure, man --

	and they follow him back into the garage ...

				memphis
		okay. tomorrow night it's on. each
		team has been assigned their ladies.
		the teams are: me and sway. donny
		and freb. kip and tumbler. mirror
		man, you and the sphinx ... 

	mirror man looks horrified ...

				mirror man
		aw, c'mon, man ...

	the sphinx grins at him...

				toby
		what about me?

				memphis
		you'll be at the docks ... keeping otto
		abreast of our progress ...

				toby 
		how come ... ?

				memphis
		because you should be home with
		nintendo, listening to the spice
		girls, little man ...

				toby
		come on. kip, talk to the guy

				kip
		there's no talkin' to him --

	and otto and junie come out with two bottles of champagne and some
	paper cups ...

				otto
			(cup raised)
		to a safe and successful session of bumping
		fenders and trading paint.

	everyone toasts ... drinks ... donny goes to the tape deck... hits
	play ... and "little deuce coupe" by the beach boys blasts.
	("little deuce coupe/you don't know what i got...")

	and all of our guys dance to it ... singing along ... otto dances 
	with junie; tumbler with toby; even the sphinx lipsyncs the falsetto
	parts ...

				beach boys 
		"well, i'm not braggin,' babe so don't put
		me down but i got the fastest set of wheels
		in town, etc."

	yes, it's the requisite rock-to-an-oldie bit ... but god, it's
	fun. as they exorcise some pre-boost jitters.  only kip stands
	aside from the frolic ... we watch them dance and laugh and sing
	for a bit ...

	and then atley jackson is there. and behind him, another calitri
	goon... and, finally, calitri himself stands there.
	someone kills the music. they all look at him... donny and the
	sphinx nod to atley ...

				calitri
		this is how you're spending my time?
		having a sock hop?

				memphis
		everyone know ray calitri? pillar of the
		community ...

				calitri
		look at this. a multi-generational gathering
		of scumbags ...

				otto
		so saith the god of scumbags --

				calitri
		hello, otto. my boys at the dock report no
		cars have yet to be delivered. and there's
		only one more night ...

				otto
		getting nervous, ray? what happens to you, i
		wonder, if delivery isn't made?

	calitri ignores him... looks at kip ...

				calitri
		with all the free time i've had not
		counting cars as they're loaded onto
		my ship, i've managed to sand the
		cedar inside your box, kip. this 
		will protect you from the anaerobic
		bacteria, that normally thrives in
		an airless; environment. thus
		prolonging decay ...

	he smiles ... and kip actually makes a run for him... only to be
	held back by tumbler and donny ...

				memphis
		get out of here, ray --

				calitri
		one more night --

				memphis
		get out --

				calitri
		i hope you know what you're doing. god help
		you if you don't ...

	and with that, he leaves, his goons following. leaving our

	crew to stare after him ... and then we fade to black...

	as a super on-screen reads part iii: switchin'-to-glide
