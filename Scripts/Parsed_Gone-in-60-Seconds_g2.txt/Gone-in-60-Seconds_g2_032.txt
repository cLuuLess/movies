	ext. long beach harbor - cannery / fish auction - day

	a rack of eel and octopus hung out to dry in the salty sun ...

	memphis walks with atley jackson past the bustling commercial
	fishing hubbub: portuguese fishermen unloading albacore and
	bluefin from their ship's hold; greek fishermen emptying mackerel
	and halibut from their nylon trawl nets; their women gut, clean
	and fillet ...

	as they walk, atley is selecting fish from the various mariners
	... who wrap it up for him... he places it in a leather satchel
	... everyone seems to know him...

				atley jackson
		nicolo, how's the yellowtail today?

	an old fisherman, who speaks broken english, wraps up several
	steaks...

				fisherman
		very nice, atley. very nice ...

				atley jackson
		you can't get it any fresher than this,
		memphis ... from the sea to my
		skillet ... nothing in between...

				memphis
		what's with the fish thing -- ?

				atley jackson
		we can learn something from our asian
		friends. they smoke a thousand
		cigarettes a day; they're completely
		stressed and overworked; they drink
		like, well ...

				memphis
		fish.

				atley jackson
		and they still have the lowest rate of
		cancer of anywhere in the world. you
		know why? all they eat is seafood.

				memphis
		also, never underestimate the restorative
		powers of "karaoke."

				atley jackson
		i do a poaching number. six-ounce
		fillets in a saucepan of brine. in
		8 minutes, i could cater a goddamn
		wedding. plain but flavorful. and
		it's a good way to show off my
		hollandaise sauce ...

				memphis
		you have a hollandaise sauce ?

				atley jackson
		i do ...
			(laughs)
		christ, what happened to us ?

				memphis
		speak for yourself, boss i don't
		have a hollandaise sauce

				atley jackson
		no, but you dress like an asshole ...

	they walk...

				memphis
		i think about that night a lot...

				atley jackson
		me, too. every time i walk...

				memphis
		how they were just there ... waiting on
		us ... the fix was definitely in ...

	nothing from atley... they walk ... memphis looks at him.

				memphis (cont'd)
		yeah, you know: i just. i just
		never really thanked-you. i meant
		to. i just want you to
		know...

	memphis nods. atley shrugs, and selects some halibut
	filets.

				memphis (cont'd)
		tell him it's on ...

	atley looks at him...

				atley jackson
		yeah -- ?

				memphis
		yeah tell him to lay off kip and
		them tell him it's on

	atley nods...

				atley jackson
		any idea how you're gonna go at it?

	memphis looks at him... shakes his head... fade to black.

	as a super on-screen reads: part ii - back to wrong
