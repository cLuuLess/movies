	ext. residential streets - "carol" - moving - night

	toby drives them out, kip shotgun, tumbler in the back. but the
	suburbs are confusing. they can't find their way out.

				toby
		which way's out, man -- ?

				tumbler
		shit all looks the same here --

	they drive. only up ahead, blocking the street, lights blinding...
	are two security patrol cars - security cops on the strong ...
	guns drawn...

				kip
		shit ...

				tumbler
		run it...

	toby looks to kip...

				kip
		no...

				toby
		what am i supposed to do?

	toby pins the gas. straight at the block... the security cops dive
	out of the way. except for one standing tall and firing into the
	windshield... into toby... the car swerves. going off the road.
	into a bank of mailboxes.

	the security guards run for her... kip, forehead bloodied,
	switches places with toby, getting behind the wheel ... punches
	the gas ... getting them out of there ...
