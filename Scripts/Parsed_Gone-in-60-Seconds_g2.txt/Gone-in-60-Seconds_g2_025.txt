	ext. raines' house - night

	memphis comes out ... moves to the sedan parked across the street
	... it is detectives castlebeck and drycoff...

				memphis
		the other day....

		heard we got shaquille ...

				detective drycoff
		where you been, anyway?

				memphis
		just out there. roaming around. building up my
		collection of refrigerator magnets ...

				detective drycoff
		you seem a little hinked-up ...

				memphis
		not at all ...

	he and castlebeck lock eyes ... castlebeck takes a pear from his
	coat pocket ... sets to polishing it ...

				detective castlebeck
		i remember us having made some
		kind of deal, randall. i don't
		remember this deal having some kind
		of time-limit. i look at you -
		here - in my town - and i'm
		confused...

				memphis

				detective castlebeck
		i hope it's not your dear sweet
		mother...

				memphis
		no...

				detective castlebeck
		or your baby brother. what was his
		name?

				memphis

				detective castlebeck (cont'd)
		i got a rash of thefts.  a new crew is
		making noise. we recovered a big take -
		last week...

				memphis
		and this has what to do with me?

				detective castlebeck
		i don't know. but you shouldn't
		be here. take care of your business.
		i'll give you 24 hours. and
		then i don't want to see your face.
		ever again. make a fool of me
		once, that's my bad. make a fool of
		me twice. that's really my
		bad, and i'll kick your ass from
		here to india ...

	castlebeck gives him a long look... as they walk back to the car...

				detective castlebeck
		good. cos you know how it plays.
		six years ago, i let you go free. but
		the next time ... the next time sends
		you away for'a long, long while ...

				detective drycoff
		by the time you get out, asshole, there
		won't even be cars. we'll all be cruisin'
		around in space ships ...

	he laughs... and they drive off ... memphis watching them go ...
	once they're gone... he walks ...
