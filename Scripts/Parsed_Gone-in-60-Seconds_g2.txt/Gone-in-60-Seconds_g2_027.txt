	ext. woodburn scrap and metal - night

	kip comes to. in his car. hot white lights blind him. the trans
	am is in the crusher. figures above him. calitri. the goons ...

				calitri
		hello, kip --

	kip tries to get out. the doors are pinned by the forklift.

				kip
		lemme out of this --

				calitri
		were it only that easy --

				kip
		we can still do it --

	calitri nods ... and the crusher presses ... the roof caves a bit
	... kip is close to scrunch ...

				calitri
		no you can't. flies on sherbert is what you
		remind me of. because just being attracted
		to something, doesn't mean you belong...
