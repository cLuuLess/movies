	kip walks through the dark house ... at last, coming to the living
	room... to "annie'. he gets behind the wheel ... her ignition is
	quick work. he's got her started, loud, in the quiet house. she
	coughs a bit; it's been a long time. tumbler is there...

				tumbler
		now what -- ?

				kip
		now, we go -

	and he drives her off the platform. tumbler directs him...

				tumbler
		this way... this way... this...

	her nose bumps a zillion-dollar vase, which topples and shatters...

				tumbler (cont'd)
		that way...

	and tumbler climbs in beside him... kip drives her around the huge
	living room... and kip punches the gas ...

	and they drive the roadster down the hall ... and right through
	the open door... driving down onto the lawn ... up to their
	cohorts ...

				kip
		see ya back at the ranch, kids -- !

	and off they go ... vanishing down the street ... the others watch
	after him ... mirror man to memphis:

				mirror man
		gotta tell ya, man: since you been back?
		you've had a real calming influence on
		ol' kip...
