	ext. san pedro warehouse - night

	mirror man works the thick steel door ... he's got a sledge and
	center punch... he knocks the knob off with the sledge and then
	goes to work with an electric drill ...

				mirror man
		this is some state-of-the-art shit,
		kid. the drill breaks the sockets,
		which force back the spindle and release
		the lock ...only it doesn't seem to be
		working... and the sphinx is getting
		impatient ...
