		tumbler messed up. he said the lotus
		would be at the corner of hawthorne

		he didn't mess up. there it is ...

	and he points ... to a corner building - exotic motors ltd. twenty
	foot high glass - windows surround a showroom of exotic dream
	cars: porsches and ferraris, lamborghinis and bertones ... and-
	there it is, a 1996 lotus esprit v8, gleaming in the all-night

	carrying a brick --

				mirror man (cont'd)
		oh, no --

	and kip walks toward "exotic motors"... calm and cool ...
	ten feet from it ... he winds up ... and hurls the brick at
	the window which explodes on impact, a shower of glass
	raining down ...

	alarms squeal

	as kip walks into the showroom, glass crunching underfoot. freb
	and mirror man can't believe it --
