int. entrance to u.n. - continuous action
the girls pass through the metal detector and move toward
a small group of tourists waiting by the sign that reads:
next tour 11:00.
                        drew
                  (re: warren)
          do you see him?
parker consults the jpeg pic on her blackberry, then
scans the group.
                         parker
          no.
at the head of the group, the u.n. tour guard, geeky in a
clark kent way and nice enough looking but definitely not
a male model, leans into a petite brunette and her little
sister.
                        tour guide
                  (conspiratorially)
          i can't tell you how much i've
          looked forward to this.
the brunette looks at him like he's a serial killer.
                         brunette
                   (in russian)
          momma?
her fierce-looking babushka mom gets in the tour guide's
face.
                         tour guide
          sorry.   my mistake.
this is when drew notices williamson and hogan entering
and approaching a u.n. security guide, flashing their
badges.
                         drew
          oh, shit.   what now?
                         parker
                   (out loud)
          warren? does anyone know warren
          collier?
                                            (continued)

                                                         66.

continued:
the tour guide, warren collier, looks over at them.
                           warren
             parker?
warren moves back to drew and parker.
                           parker
             gee, warren. isn't that strange?
             i didn't recognize you from your
             picture.
                           warren
             yeah, i, uh...
                           drew
                     (urgently)
             we don't have time for this now.
                           parker
             do you have an office or someplace
             private we could go?
                           warren
             i just have to do this tour and...
but williamson and hogan, led by the u.n. security guy,
enter the lobby.
drew grabs warren by the arm and turns him.
                           drew
             we'll get back to that.
                           warren
             what's going on?
parker looks warren right in the eye.     this is a test.
                           parker
             it's important.
                            warren
                     (beat)
             okay. let me get somebody to
             cover for me.
warren leads them into a small adjoining office...
