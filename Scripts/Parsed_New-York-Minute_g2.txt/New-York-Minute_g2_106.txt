int. girls' bathroom - evening
both girls are putting on makeup, getting ready to go
out. everything appears the same as before, drew's side
neat and clean, parker's a wreck.
                                           (continued)

                                                       107.

continued:
                            quinn
                      (sternly)
             girls?
quinn steps in, grimfaced.
                           quinn
             how naive do you think i am?
the girls share a look.       busted.
                           parker
             we, uh, don't think you're naive,
             mom.
                          drew
             no. honestly, it was all an
             accident.
quinn holds out her hand revealing a belly ring.
                           quinn
             i know what this is.
there's almost a palpable sense of relief between the
girls. they both look down and pull up their shirts --
parker's not the only one who has her naval pierced --
drew does, too.
                           quinn
             parker, i'm disappointed you'd do
             something like this without
             consulting me, but drew? what got
             into you? do you know how
             unhygienic those places are?
                           drew
             it was... spontaneous.
                          quinn
             yeah. obviously. oh, by the
             way...
she holds out her other hand, which has an envelope.
                           quinn
             this came in the mail.
they stare at the envelope -- nyu admissions department.
                              parker
             so?   open it.
there's a honk.
                                              (continued)

                                                           108.

continued:
                           charley (o.s.)
             the guys are here!
parker and quinn stare at drew.
                              parker
             come on!
                           drew
             it doesn't really matter one way
             or the other. maybe i shouldn't
             be in such a hurry. why don't we
             go out and have some fun.
             besides, if this isn't good news,
             i don't want it to ruin our night.
parker and quinn simply continue to stare.
                                                 cut to:
