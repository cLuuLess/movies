int. macleod living room - evening
charley's laying on the couch with some chips on his
stomach watching the game.
jim and warren are watching, too.
                           charley
             so, how'd you two meet the girls?
jim and warren share a look.        this is a story best left
untold.
                           jim/warren
                     (simultaneously)
             a dance/a class.
                           charley
             dance class, huh? stupid    me. i
             figured it had to be that   day in
             new york when parker blew   off her
             chem test and drew was in   jail.
charley smiles.       he's not as out of it as he appears.
suddenly, all three women scream joyfully o.s.
                              charley
                        (offering)
             chips?
