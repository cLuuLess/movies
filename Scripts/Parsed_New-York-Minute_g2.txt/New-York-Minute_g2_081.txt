ext. block north of the garden
drew watches as roger climbs out, looks up and down the
street, then moves around to the passenger side, grabs
the emperor and drops him into a gym bag.
at the end of the block -- spectators for the new york
kennel club dog show have begun filing into the garden.
ever wary, roger carries the emperor under one arm. the
emperor pokes his nose out. roger pushes it back in.
the dog pokes it back out.
                           roger
                     (to emperor)
             knock it off.
whoosh! from behind, drew grabs the emperor and takes
off running.
                             roger
             hey!    give me that dog!
holding the emperor at arm's length, drew makes a run for
it with roger after her.
on drew -- looking right into the smiling mauve face of
the emperor.
                           drew
             i just want you to know that i'm
             allergic to you and cynophobic!
she and roger race right past...
... mr. lo biancho, holding out the saks bag of money.

continued:
                             mr. lo biancho
             excuse me?
                             drew
             i can't stop!    i have to return
             this dog!
                           roger
             i'll be right back!
puzzled, mr. lo biancho falls in line behind roger,
keeping up pretty well for an old dude with a gut.

where parker's taxi appears.
