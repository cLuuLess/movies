ext. the plaza - continuous action
the police and security look left, right, across the
street.
                           bruce
             where'd they go?
                           hogan
             they couldn't have gone very far.
             we'll split up.
                     (pointing)
             you go that way! you take fifth!
             come on, get on your horse!
morty and bruce take the cop's order and race off in
separate directions. neither hogan nor his partner
moves.
                           williamson
             coffee?
                           hogan
             sure.
williamson and hogan step over to a hot dog cart set up
next to a newspaper stand.
                           williamson
                     (to hot dog vendor)
             two black.
                           hogan
             where do you think those two went?
                           williamson
             beats me. they didn't have any
             stupid dog with them from what i
             could see.
                           hogan
             might have stashed it.

continued:
                           williamson
             maybe they ate it.
the cops giggle at this.
                           williamson
             the rent-a-cop said the mutt's
             worth like 50 g's. that makes it
             grand theft, my friend. five to
             ten.

angle on the news stand
where a blind cashier (speedy) smiles at the two
policemen.
                            hogan
                      (to blind cashier)
             hey, speedy. you didn't see a
             couple of blondes run past here,
             did you?
                           speedy
             yep. couldn't miss 'em. real
             criminal types. looked like they
             were headed to mexico.
                           hogan
             that's where they all go.


another angle
reveals drew and parker, crouched down behind the counter
right next to speedy.
                           williamson
             see you around.
                           speedy
             not if i see you first.
the cops head back to the plaza.
                           hogan
             i say we put abbott and costello
             on the ransom watch. i don't want
             to be stuck in the same room all
             day with leona helmsley's nasty
             stepsister.

with the detectives gone, speedy turns up his nose and
waves the air, fanning away a bad smell.
                           speedy
             whew. you know, it's not some old
             wives' tale about blind people
             having an acute sense of smell.
                           drew
             sorry.
                          speedy
             so? what did you do with that
             dog?
                           drew
             we didn't steal it, i swear.
                           parker
             a painter did.
                           speedy
             you girls best give yourselves up
             and tell 'em the story.
                            drew
                     (torn)
             he's right, parker.
                           parker
             of course he's right. we're going
             to march in there and give
             ourselves up right this minute.
             they will, of course, take us down
             to the precinct, call mom and dad,
             we'll give our statement, they'll
             grill us under hot lights for a
             few hours, force us to confess
             with some tricky good cop/bad cop
             routine and the next thing you
             know we're doing five to ten in
             attica.
drew checks her watch.
                           drew
             so we'll turn ourselves in right
             after the interview.
                           speedy
             may i make one suggestion?

continued:
                           parker
             sure.
                            speedy
             hit the showers before you do
             anything else.
a beep beep indicates parker's blackberry is receiving a
message.
                           drew
             we're facing felony charges,
             parker. maybe you can do your on-
             line flirting later. better yet,
             he can see you during visitor's
             hours.
parker reads the incoming message from...
thoreau 786:     how'd chem test go?
                           parker
                     (beat; epiphany)
             oh my god. warren works in the
             city.
                           drew
             warren? warren?! so you lied,
             right to my face. no, drew, this
             isn't about the chat room guy.
             nah!
but parker's typing furiously even as drew rants on --
she has to lean around speedy's legs. a guy buying a
newspaper peers down at the strange sight.
                           speedy
                     (to guy)
             take your daughters to work day.
the guy pays for his paper, leaves.
notatwin: warren. my real name's parker macleod.         my
sister and i need a favor.
                           drew
             are you listening to me?!   give me
             that stupid thing!
drew reaches for the blackberry.

continued:
                           parker
             knock it off, drew! this guy
             might be able to help. he lives
             here.
                           drew
             parker, you have completely lost
             your mind if you can be thinking
             about boys at a time like this!
thoreau 786:     parker.   thanks for sharing.   anything you
need.
notatwin: bit of a jam in the city. mob, police and
hotel security on our tail. could use a hideout.
thoreau 786: lol!      adventurous type.   meet me at work?
i'm at the u.n.
                           parker
                     (to drew)
             the united nations?
                           drew
             you can't possibly know somebody
             who works at the united nations.
             maybe he meant united sub
             sandwiches. or united skate rats
             store.
notatwin:     united nations?
thoreau 786:     just a day job.    join the 11:00 tour.
soon.
parker pockets the blackberry.
                           parker
             so. we're going to the united
             nations to use the restroom.
                           drew
             how convenient. you arrange a
             little date while your sister's
             future hangs in the balance.
                           parker
             look, he said he'd help and it's
             only a couple blocks away. you
             got a better idea?
speedy opens the rear door of the newsstand.

                            speedy
                     (how's he know?)
             coast's clear.
                           parker
             thank you, mr. speedy.
                           speedy
             you're quite welcome.    good luck
             in that interview.
drew sighs, then reluctantly follows parker out.
