int. taxi - continuous action
parker leans across warren to drew.
                        parker
          excuse me, what were you doing?
                        drew
          someone was sick in the bathroom
          and they asked me to -- hold on, i
          don't owe you any explanation.
                        parker
          you're the one all 'i gotta get to
          this interview or i'm gonna have a
          nervous breakdown' and yet you
          have time to address the united
          nations?
                                             (continued)

                                                        77.

continued:
                           warren
             you know, technically, you have to
             have security clearance to enter
             the assembly.
                           parker
             not now, warren.
                           drew
             you have a lot of nerve, parker.
             it was you that got me tossed off
             the train! you had to give the
             bum that dollar! you get the
             suit, i get the leather bikini!
                           warren
                     (under)
             which isn't so bad.
                           drew
             and you got bernie lipscomb while
             i got scrabble with mom and dad!
                           warren
             who's bernie lipscomb?
                           parker
             i told you, i didn't know you
             liked him! it was no big deal!
                             drew
             it was to me!
                           parker
             how could i know? you never tell
             me anything!
                           drew
             there's a good reason for that!
                           parker
             what's that supposed to mean?
                            drew
             you know very well what it means,
             ms. big mouth!
                           parker
             big mouth?! ooh, i hope you miss
             that stupid interview!
                                               (continued)

                                                         78.

continued:
                           drew
             oh yeah? well, the joke's on you,
             because there isn't any interview!
oops. this just slipped out in anger.        parker's brain
has to adjust, then:
                           parker
             what?
                            drew
                     (beat)
             no interview. i screwed up.
                           parker
             you screwed up what?
                           drew
             scheduling the interview.    you
             deaf?
                           parker
             you're drew. drew doesn't screw
             anything up, let alone scheduling.
             you're the iron chef of
             scheduling.
                           drew
             i missed the deadline.
                           parker
             how?
                           drew
             after they made the first cut from
             the preliminary application, we
             were supposed to send in a form to
             secure our interview time and i
             filled it out and had everything
             ready to go in the mailbox and
             then...
drew is near tears.
                           parker
             and then what? earthquake?
             tsunami? nuclear winter?
                           drew
             i forgot.
                           parker
             forgot?
                                                (continued)

                                                            79.

continued:
                           drew
             yes. i just forgot. when i found
             it in my bag a week later, i'd
             missed the deadline.
                            parker
             so today?   all this?   what are you
             doing?
                           drew
                     (humiliated)
             i... i was going to try to meet
             professor spaulding and...
                           parker
             you were just going to jump him?
                           warren
             sort of a guerilla interview?     you
             know, i'm a big michael moore
             fan...
a look from parker quiets warren.       drew's choked up.    she
just nods, yes.
                           drew
             i called and the secretary said
             there were no exceptions to the
             deadline so i was going to try to
             see him when he finished the other
             interviews. i knew it was
             hopeless, but... i was so...
             embarrassed.
drew wipes her tears, then:
                           drew
             oh, to hell with it.
she opens the door and jumps out!
                            parker
             drew?!   drew, get back in this
             taxi!
parker starts to open her door on the traffic side! honk
honk! it's nearly sheared off by a passing truck and she
closes it just in time.
                           warren
             she's pretty upset.
                                                 (continued)

                                                        80.

continued:
                           parker
             gee, you really are a genius.
as the taxi bogs down in traffic, drew disappears around
the corner up ahead.
                           parker
             talk about spontaneous.
