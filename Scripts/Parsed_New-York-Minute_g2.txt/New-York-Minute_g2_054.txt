int. charley's '77 ford pickup - day
charley's driving,      eating a sandwich and dialing his cell
phone at the same      time, veering dangerously and
obliviously across      the center stripe. the oncoming car
careens out of his      way in a blaze of horn.
                            charley
                     (to phone)
             hello, beautiful doctor lady. how
             goes your day?
                     (beat; huh?)
             right next to the magazine rack?
             what did they name it, newsweek?
                     (beat)
             i'm going into the city to meet
             some big shot publisher. maybe
             i'll swing by nyu afterwards and
             see if i can give drew a ride
             home. you talk to her today?
                     (beat)
             she's probably having too much fun
             to call. i'll ring her up. bye
             bye.
he hangs up and of course veers into the other lane
again, correcting wildly before resuming his merry way.
                                                cut to:
