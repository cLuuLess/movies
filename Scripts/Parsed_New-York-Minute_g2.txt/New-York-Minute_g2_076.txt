int. roger's van - continuous action
roger dials a cell phone while the emperor stands on the
passenger seat with his front paws on the dash. as far
as we can tell, he's having a great time being kidnapped
and doesn't mind being mauve.
                           roger
             get in the back, will ya?
the emperor ignores him, happily watching the streets of
new york go by.
                            roger
             stupid dog.
but his call has gone through.        he imitates a girl's
voice.
                            roger
                      (as girl)
             hello?
                                                cut to:
