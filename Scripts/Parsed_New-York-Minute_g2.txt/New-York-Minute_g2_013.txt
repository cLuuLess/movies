int. the train - women's room - continuous action
parker stands by the door, waiting, listening to hear if
the coast is clear.
sounds good. she cracks the door, steps out on tiptoes,
closes the door and there's the conductor. he smiles.
                        conductor
          ticket, please.
                         parker
          why don't i save the b.s. story
          and just ask you to cut me a break
          this one time because i know
          you've got a big heart and you
          remember what it was like when you
          were young and... and...
                  (off the conductor's
                   look)
          ... randy?
