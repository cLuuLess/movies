int. burt's pump 'n' go - morning
burt, who has no teeth, hands over the restroom key to
the girls. the key is attached to a full-sized steering
wheel. burt sniffs, wrinkling his nose.
                        burt
          you know, it's not my place to
          say, but you young girls got your
          whole lives ahead of you. you
          shouldn't be drinkin' at this hour
          of the day.
                        parker
          that's what i keep telling her.
                        burt
          'round the side.
