ext. jersey sidewalk - morning
they hit the sidewalk and without breaking stride, race
around the first corner, looking back over their
shoulder.
                         parker
           he's stuck at the light!
vrrooom!   here comes the lincoln storming around the
corner.
                         drew
           he has no respect for traffic
           laws!
they run into the first alley and hunker down by a
garbage can. the lincoln flies past. they dash back
out, the same way they came.
screech!   bennie locks up the wheels!
they round the same corner going the opposite way and
parker pulls them into the first door...
