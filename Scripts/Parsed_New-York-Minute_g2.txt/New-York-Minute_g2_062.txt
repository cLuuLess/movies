int. u.n. lobby - continuous action - day
the three make their way across the vast lobby, but
before they reach the main hall...
                            hogan (o.s.)
                      (spotting them)
             hey!   you two! stop!
                            warren
             this way!
almost instinctively, they go completely separate ways,
warren and parker breaking left, drew right.
drew makes a mad dash down a hallway, makes a turn,
another turn, working her way deeper into the labyrinth.
even while running frantically, she tries to smile
politely at everyone she passes until she spots a women's
room and quickly ditches inside.
