int. the plaza - lobby - continuous action
... right back into the plaza lobby.
                              drew
                        (realizing)
             perfect.
                           parker
             is this what they call 'returning
             to the scene of the crime'?
unfortunately for them, to get to the front door they
have to pass by...
... the plaza manager and the other house security agent,
bruce (butch haircut, bad suit), consoling mrs. lo
biancho.
when morty and the cops come through the doors behind
them, however, there's no choice.
the girls try to look as inconspicuous as possible
heading for the revolving doors but they overhear:
                                                (continued)

                                                         52.

continued:
                           plaza manager
             i assure you, mr. and mrs. lo
             biancho, the plaza will do
             everything in its power to see
             that the emperor is safely
             returned and that the criminals
             are brought to justice.
                           mrs. lo biancho
             justice?! i want them executed!
             tortured first, slowly, and then
             beheaded!
                           plaza manager
             the plaza's policy is of course to
             serve you in any capacity we can.
morty spots the girls across the lobby just as they reach
the revolving doors.
                             morty
                       (calling)
             bruce!    10-80 at the wagon wheel!
bruce looks over to morty like he's speaking slavic, but
morty's furiously pointing and bruce sees...
the girls break for the revolving doors. parker gets
there first, plunges in so fast that a man entering is
tossed headlong into the lobby.
drew tries to time the quickly-spinning door but one of
the very high spiked heels catches, throwing her forward
and sandwiching her in the revolving door.
                             drew
                       (no breath)
             park...
outside -- parker sees drew caught in the door as bruce,
morty and the cops close in. quickly, parker pushes the
door back, releasing drew, who jumps in and swings out.
