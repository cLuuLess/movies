int. the plaza - hallway
rubbing his sore head, morty the security guy lumbers
down the hallway.
behind him mr. and mrs. lo biancho get out of the
elevator:
                           mrs. lo biancho
                     (peeved)
             when competing in a dog show, best
             to bring one's dog along, yes?
                           mr. lo biancho
             i thought you had him, dear.
                            mrs. lo biancho
                      (holding up her hands)
             see?   empty.
but now they both notice the door to their suite is wide
open.
                             mrs. lo biancho
             oh, dear god!
the elderly couple do their version of a panicked run
inside.
                           mrs. lo biancho (o.s.)
                     (screeching)
             ahhhh!! my baby! someone's
             kidnapped my baby!
                                                  (continued)

                                                              44.

continued:
on morty -- making an abrupt halt. baby?!          he turns
around and lopes back to the suite.
                           morty

                           mr. lo biancho
             the emperor is missing.
                           morty
                     (somewhat relieved)
             the emperor is a dog, right?
                           mrs. lo biancho
             not 'a' dog, no. the new york
             kennel club champion and why
             aren't you trying to find him!
morty pulls his radio as he backs out the door and heads
down the hall.
                            morty
                      (to radio)

                           morty

                             another security guy (v.o.)
                       (beat)

                                                (continued)

                                                           45.

continued:
                           morty
             just call the damn police and
             patch me through. the emperor's
             been kidnapped.
                           another security guy (v.o.)

             moron!
                           another security guy (v.o.)

                           morty
                     (decrying his fate)
