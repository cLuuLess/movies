ext. u.n. plaza - day
the horse carriage passes the usual groups of protestors
and tourists outside on the u.n. plaza and...
... the girls jump off and move into the crowd, headed
for the entrance where there's a line at the door.
down the block the detectives' unmarked car appears and
parks at the curb.
williamson and hogan climb out, scanning the crowd.
                        williamson
                  (pointing)
          there they are.


detectives' pov
-- just a glimpse as they enter the building.

                                                    65.

back to scene
                        hogan
          what in the world could they be
          doing here?
