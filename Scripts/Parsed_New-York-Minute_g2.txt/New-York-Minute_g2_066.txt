int. u.n. assembly - day
drew peeks in through the door, reading the country
identifications on the desks... bangkok, borneo,
bulgaria... canada.
the representatives are in the middle of a heated debate
that we hear being translated (and we see in subtitles).
                        chinese rep
                  (chinese; subtitles)
          impossible! this would be
          globally destabilizing!
                         bulgarian rep
                   (pointing angry finger)
          hah!   posturing and rhetoric!
                                             (continued)

                                                            72.

continued:
the canadian representative is sitting gingerly in his
chair, shifting uncomfortably. he looks pale, shaky.
drew commits herself and rushes down the stairs to his
desk with the file.
                            drew
                      (whispering)
             sir?
he puts a hand to his stomach -- he's struggling.
                            canadian representative #2
                      (ugh; groan)
             yes...
                           drew
             oh, no. you didn't have the
             mussels at lunch, too, did you?
even as she holds out the file, he races past her,
puckering his bum.
she watches him waddle up the stairs but as he exits, he
passes williamson and the u.n. security guy in the
doorway.
drew sees them. uh, oh. the only thing she can do to
make herself inconspicuous is to drop into the canadian
rep's chair and turn her back on them like she's one of
the assembly members. she sits up, shuffles the files
around.
glancing furtively to either side, she sees that everyone
else is wearing the translation earphone. she puts one
on.

angle on the detective
williamson's gaze comes to rest on...
... the back of drew's head.         hm.   that looks familiar.
this is when the chinese rep stands, furious, and points
an accusatory finger at drew!
                           chinese rep
             this crisis falls at the feet of
             one nation and one nation only!
             canada!
all eyes turn to drew.
                                                  (continued)

                                                       73.

continued:
                           chinese rep
             how do you defend such a position!
             the world is waiting to hear!
these are fighting words. the assembly grows silent.
drew wishes she could beam herself somewhere off planet.
she gulps air. glances left, right.
but she knows the detective's eyes are on the back of her
head and so she clears her throat and:
                           drew
             well, i'm not certain...
this furrows some brows.
                           drew
                     (recovering)
             ... that i need to defend our
             position!
ah, yes, some knowing nods.
on the north korean representative leaning over to confer
with the norwegian representative:
                           north korea
                     (subtitles)
             is she new?
                             norway
             beats me.
                             north korea
             she's hot.
                             norway
             weird hairdo.

back on drew
                           chinese rep
             that is absurd!
                             drew
             absurd?!
uhhh... where now? she notices the file the rep in the
bathroom gave her and holds it up, shaking it for
emphasis.
                                              (continued)

                                                          74.

continued:
                           drew
                     (dramatic emphasis)
             not so absurd, since i have the
             documents right here in my
             possession!
this draws a chorus of murmurs throughout the hall. the
chinese rep suddenly looks terribly worried and pauses to
confer with his associate.
                                                cut to:
