ext. trenton train station - street side - continuous
action
parker steps outside where it's just as crowded. she
scopes the situation, which isn't good -- stranded
commuters jostle for the few remaining taxis.
two executives get into a shoving match.
to the left, a couple of black lincoln town cars --
standard car service rigs -- sit idling, each with a
driver next to it, holding up his sign with his client's
name scratched on it.
an executive (#2) passes her, finger in the air,
signaling the first driver who holds a sign that read:
"wilcox."
                        executive #2
          that's me.
with no further ado, the driver opens the back door for
him, the exec climbs in, the driver hustles around to his
side and in an instant, the car leaves the chaos behind.
parker raises an eyebrow.    hm.
the second driver (bennie) with a head like a cinder
block and no neck, is talking on his cell phone and
holding up a sign, "scarpelli."
parker shoots a finger into the air. this barely gets
his attention but he nods, nonchalantly. parker signals
again -- one minute -- then turns back inside.
