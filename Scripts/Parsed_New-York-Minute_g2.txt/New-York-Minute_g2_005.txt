int. macleod house - kitchen - morning
drew's seated, napkin on lap, eating granola and studying
her open daybook.
                                               (continued)

                                                         5.

continued:
dr. quinn macleod, dressed professionally and obviously
together even at this hour, pours coffee for herself and
her husband, professor charley macleod, who enters still
in his ratty old bathrobe and outrageous bed-head.
as a matter of routine, quinn holds out his cup and he
takes it, kisses her and sits down to the paper.
                             drew
             morning, dad.
                             charley
             morning, baby.
                           drew
             how's the book coming?
                            charley
                     (sigh)
             well, sweety, my writing process
             is a lot like a giant
             hydroelectric dam. for a long
             time i just let the great ideas
             build up and build up until the
             sheer weight of them spills over
             and the words just come pouring
             out.
                           drew
             still stuck, huh?
                             charley
             not a word.
parker enters with her blackberry in hand, smooches her
pop, then takes a sat.
parker's clearly a chip off her dad's block. both pour
milk first into their bowl, then charley drops in super
sugar crisp while parker pours in count chocula. both
hit 'em with a couple of spoons of extra sugar.
mom takes a seat, too, primly eating a piece of dry wheat
toast that she slices in half first. like mom, like
drew.
drew spots the blackberry jpeg of warren before parker
can turn it over.
                           drew
             another one for the trophy room,
             huh?
                                                (continued)

                                                         6.

                            parker
             boys can be fun. you should try
             one some time.
                           quinn
                     (to drew)
             you ready for your interview?
                           drew
                     (funny you
                      should ask)
             i've prepared a color-coded
             itinerary based on dividing the
             day into fifteen minute increments
             alternating blue/red, double-
             checked the train schedule,
             confirmed with the weather channel
             and rehearsed a couple of
             alternate scenarios last night,
             you know, just to account for all
             the possible glitches.
                           parker
             we'll take that as a yes.
                           charley
             i'm proud of you for sticking to
             your plan all these years, sweety.
                           parker
             i still don't understand why you
             want to finish college in two
             years? what's the big hurry?
                           drew
             i want to hit the ground running.
             all those football games and the
             partying and the whole dating
             scene. it just seems like a lot
             of wasted time that could be spent
             more productively.
                           quinn
             the accelerated program would look
             great on your med school
             application.
                           parker
             football games i get. but
             partying? a waste of time?
parker looks to her dad.     he shrugs.
                                                (continued)

                                                        7.

continued:
                           charley
             to each her own.
                            quinn
             well, drew.   i have a surprise.
everybody stops what they're doing for a beat.
                           quinn
             i took the day off.
                     (excitedly)
             i'm going into the city with you.
                           drew
                     (panicked)
             what -- ?!
drew chokes on her granola and a little milk trickles out
her nose.
                           quinn
             isn't that great! we can do some
             shopping, have lunch, real girl
             stuff. won't that be fun?
                           parker
             if you want to have fun, i'm the
             one who should go, not mother
             teresa over there.
drew is still choking -- pretty badly.
                           parker
             let me know if you want me to do
             the heimlich. it'd be cool to
             have you owe me your life.
whoosh!   the granola goes down and she sucks air.
                           quinn
             you okay?
                           drew
                     (still clearing)
             no... i mean, it's... impossible.
             i've got every minute accounted
             for right up to the interview.
             blue and red! it won't work.
                           quinn
             i just thought... you know... i've
             been working and we haven't had a
             chance to spend much time
             together...
                                               (continued)

                                                         8.

continued:
quinn, the normally thick-skinned m.d., is tearing up.
                           quinn
             ... and both my babies are going
             away to college next fall.
she takes her plate and goes to the sink and parker
follows her, putting an arm around her shoulder.
                           parker
             don't be sad, mom. just think,
             when drew leaves for school, you
             won't be losing a daughter, you'll
             be losing an anal-retentive social
             misfit who will be voted most
             likely to die a virgin.
drew throws an arm around quinn's other shoulder.
                           drew
             i'm sorry, mom. it's really sweet
             of you. but don't worry. parker
             will be living here with you
             forever since no college on earth
             will ever take her.
                           quinn
             stop it, you two.
mom blows her nose.
                           parker
             it's not fair you guys get to go
             into the city and i don't.
                           charley
             don't you have a chem test, young
             lady?
                           parker
             chemistry? please. name one time
             you ever used chemistry in your
             life.
                           charley
                     (beat)
             good point.
                           quinn
                     (adamant)
             i use chemistry every day.
                                                (continued)

                                                    9.

continued:
                              parker
             you're a    doctor, mom. i'm not
             going to    be a doctor. i can't
             even say    the word 'orifice,' let
             alone put    a finger up one.
the beep beep of drew's alarm watch signals time to go.
drew is trying to cover up, but she's reeling from the
news that her mother's going to accompany her.
                           drew
                     (worried)
             time to go.
