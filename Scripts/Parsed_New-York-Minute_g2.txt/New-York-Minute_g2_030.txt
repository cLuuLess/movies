ext. "today show" sidewalk - morning
"today show" security guards and nypd descend on the
crowd.
                            nypd officer
             all right.   who's the wise guy?
parker pulls drew out of the pile-up and grabs the key,
tossing it away from them, sending the desk clerk
scrambling after it.
the two girls high tail it around the corner.       winded,
they stop.
                           parker
             man, that little guy could really
             motor. why'd you bolt?
                           drew
             there was a rat, parker. a rat
             the size of a doberman eating my
             foot.
                           parker
             that was all our money.
                            drew
             our money?   our money?!
                           parker
             key down, you're going to have an
             attack.
                                                (continued)

continued:
drew's sucking on her inhaler but is so irate she spits
out the words.
                            drew
             parker, it was not 'our' money and
             this is not 'our' day in new york.
             what it is, is quite possibly the
             most important day of my life.
             i've resigned myself to the fact
             that you don't give a crap about
             what you do with yours, but if you
             could find it in your heart, your
             tiny, cold steel heart, to respect
             what this means to me, i would
             appreciate it.
but parker's not listening.       she's staring intently...
... across the street where several town cars are parked,
the drivers chatting next to a hot dog/pretzel cart.
among them is bennie, sipping coffee.       parker spots him
and freezes.
                           drew
             you're not even listening. that's
             typical. look, we're splitting
             up. give me back my secret safety
             money.
                             parker
                     (still looking past
                       drew)
             you know how i told you not to be
             paranoid?
                           drew
             paranoid?
                           parker
             what i meant was, it isn't
             paranoia if someone really is
             chasing you.
parker tries to subtly indicate with her eyes that drew
should look across the street.
                           drew
             what's wrong with your eyes?
                           parker
                     (whispering)
             it's him.
                                                (continued)

                                                     35.

continued:
drew finally turns and she, too, freezes.
                            parker
             quiet.   don't run. he'll see us.
not wanting to draw his attention, the girls shuffle off
quickly down the street.
on bennie -- squinting across at them. can he make them
out in the crowd? he nods to another driver, tosses his
coffee cup and climbs in behind the wheel.
                           drew
             he saw us!
the girls break into a run.
                           drew
             how'd he find us?
                           parker
             maybe it's just coincidence!
                           drew
             or maybe we told him where we were
             going!!
she points up at the street sign -- 57th and 5th.   oops.
                           parker
             come on!
parker leads her into traffic, horns blaring, as they
weave their way across. on the far side, a horse
carriage pulls away from the curb and at the last minute,
parker spots a fresh pile of...
... horse shit, which she manages to leap. drew,
however, isn't going to make it over. she closes her
eyes.
                           parker
             jump!
drew stumbles, wrong-foots the takeoff but somehow
manages to get across it to the curb. for just a beat,
we see her surprised face. hm. i did it.
then they see bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and
puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits
in full stride, slips on, and plops into on his ass.
this gives the girls the opening they need and they ditch
inside some revolving doors.
