int. backstage (madison square garden dog show) -
continuous action
drew has entered her own personal circle of hell -- dogs
of every shape and size surround her.
                        drew
                  (to no one/everyone)
          where's the policeman?
a groomer combing a hound dog points toward the curtains
on the far side of the room and she blasts off that
direction.
                                           (continued)

                                                        87.

continued:
close on the hound dog -- lifting his big nose in the
air, he sniffs mightily and then...
baying like he's coon hunting under a kentucky moon, the
hound dog leaps off his table, heads after drew.
