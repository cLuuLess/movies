int. madison square garden - lo bianchos' private box
far below, garden employees set      up for the dog show.
inside, the lo bianchos' luxury      box is likewise being
prepared. in one corner, bruce       and morty are fumbling
with the unfamiliar electronic      tracing gear, readying for
the ransom call.
mrs. lo biancho turns up her nose at the buffet table.
                                                (continued)

                           mrs. lo biancho
                     (to caterer)
             what are those?
                             caterer
             rumaki, ma'am.
                           mrs. lo biancho
             rumaki! yech! you might as well
             wrap dog turds in bacon. take
             them away.
a society friend of mrs. lo biancho, babs, arrives to pay
her respects, shuffling her feet across and leaning in to
trade air kisses.
                           babs
             andrea, andrea. how dreadful!      i
             shudder to think how the poor
             emperor may be suffering.
                              mrs. lo biancho
             dear babs.     i'm at wit's end.
when she turns on morty and bruce, they both jump a
little.
                           mrs. lo biancho
                     (putting on a show)
             you! tell the thieves i'll pay
             anything they want! anything!
                              babs
             of course.     what price on a loved
             one?
                             mrs. lo biancho
             precisely!
                              babs
             i've got to    run. that stupid
             groomer used    a commercial
             conditioner    on coco and she looks
             like trailer    trash.
babs nabs one of the rumaki on her way out. as soon as
babs is gone, mrs. lo biancho looms over morty and bruce.
                           mrs. lo biancho
             i'll give them ten grand, tops,
             but only if the dog's back before
             show time.
                                                 (continued)

                                                          61.

a troubled bruce isn't having much luck operating the
trace machine.
                           bruce
                     (aside to morty;
                      whispered)
             do you know how to turn this on?
