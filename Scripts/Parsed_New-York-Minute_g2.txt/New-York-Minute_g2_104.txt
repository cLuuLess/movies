warren and jim sit waiting when the girls come out,
smiling.
drew turns to parker.
                           drew
             thanks.
the sisters hug, but we go...
                                              (continued)

                                                         105.

close on parker -- eyes wide.
                              parker
             sis?
                              drew
             yeah?
                              parker
             gotta go.
parker grabs warren by the hand and blasts around the
corner just as...
charley macleod pulls up in his truck and parks half on,
half off the curb.
he leans over, waving to drew.
                              charley
             hi, baby!
drew goes over to the truck.
                           charley
             i was in the city. i tried to
             call you. thought you might want
             a ride home.
                              drew
             sure.
                           charley
                     (what?)
             is that a new outfit?
                              drew
             yeah.     hey, one minute, 'kay?
                              charley
             sure.
drew goes back to jim.
                              drew
             thanks.
                           jim
             you're welcome.
                              drew
             i, uh...
                                                (continued)

                                                            106.

continued:
                           jim
             you want to maybe... get together?
                           drew
             first i want to take a shower.
             for about a week.
drew leans over and kisses him on the cheek.         then she
reaches into her bag and pulls out a card.
                            drew
             call me, okay?
                           jim
             you have a card? aren't you in
             high school?
she smiles, shrugs and climbs in her dad's truck. they
pull away, leaving jim waving. when they're out of
sight, parker and warren come back around the corner of
the building.
                           parker
             oh, man. i'm doomed.     i'll never
             get home before them.
                            warren
             sure you will.
warren pulls out a cell phone, hits speed dial.
                             warren
             dad?   hey.   i need a favor.
