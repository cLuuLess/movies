int. u.n. assembly - day
drew glances williamson exiting.
                           drew
             and besides, who said absurd is
             necessarily bad? sometimes absurd
             is good! for instance, absurd can
             be sort of... funny! in conclusion,
             i propose that all of you should
             talk amongst yourselves.
                     (quickly)
             thank you.
like cinderella at midnight, she turns and races up the
stairs as the assembly is in complete turmoil -- kofi
