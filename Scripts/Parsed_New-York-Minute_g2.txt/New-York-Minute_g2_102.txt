students leisurely make their way between classes.
                             jim (o.s.)
             yo!    coming through!
                                                (continued)

the students dive out of the way as jim comes barreling
across campus with drew clinging for life to his
handlebars.
just outside the administration building, jim hits the
brakes and drew flies off the handlebars and like the
puppy in the opening, disappears into a shrub.
                           jim
             you okay?
the old drew is back.     she scrambles out of the
shrub...
                           drew
             fine.
... and up the stairs -- then stops, turns.
                            drew
             wait right there.
                     (beat)
             i mean, i don't want to be bossy.
             you don't have to stay right
             there, if you don't want to.
                           jim
             i'll be right here.
                           drew
             great.
she launches herself into the building.
