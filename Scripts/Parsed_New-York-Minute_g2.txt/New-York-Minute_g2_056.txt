ext. sidewalk in new york - day
the girls try to be as inconspicuous as possible walking
cross-town in couture, drew with only one shoe and in a
bad mood.
                           parker
             we're going to make it, drew.
             you'll see. there's still plenty
             of time. you'll get cleaned up,
             we can trade clothes... this is a
             nice suit, huh? right?
                           drew
                     (abrupt)
             yes.
                           parker
             you're going to get accepted, then
             we can explain the
             misunderstanding about the dog to
             the police and everything will be
             okay.
                           drew
             maybe after the police forgive us
             for sneaking into someone else's
             hotel room, we can ask them to
             please keep the mob hit man from
             whacking us and dropping us into
             the marina so he doesn't get his
             suit dirty.
                           parker
             first things first.
                           drew
             parker, i know you're trying to
             cheer me up, but i have to be
             honest. this is all your fault.
                                                (continued)

                                                        62.

                            parker
                     (beat)
             my fault? my fault?! i didn't
             mean for any of this to happen!
                           drew
             yeah, right! like you didn't mean
             to ask bernie lipscomb to the
             prom!
                           parker
             what's that supposed to mean?
                           drew
             i'll bet that was just another
             accident of yours that happened to
             screw up my life!
                           parker
             bernie lipscomb?
                     (dawning)
             you...?
drew didn't want to admit that -- it just slipped out
under pressure.
                           parker
             you liked bernie, too?
                           drew
             you know i did!
                           parker
             no i didn't.  i haven't seen you
             talk to a guy since we were in
             kindergarten and we thought jerry
             wester was a girl.
                           drew
             you asked bernie just to snake him
             from me!
                            parker
             i did not!
                     (beat)
             wow, the really spooky thing is,
             that would mean we liked the same
             guy.
a block away, the united nations building stands
majestically against the sky.
                                               (continued)

continued:
directly in front of them, however, a police car is
stopped at the light with two uniformed policemen inside.
the girls spot the police and stop.
the police look up at the girls through their windshield.
