int. mailroom - continuous action
vacant and quiet. the door opens slowly and hogan
enters. it's a small room with a few canvas mail sacks
piled in a corner and a wall of mail-sorting cubbies.
an in-house monitor mutely broadcasts the now empty
assembly room.
nothing here, hogan closes the door. in a beat, one of
the mail sacks wriggles and warren sticks his head up.
                           warren
          he's gone.
parker pops up from the same sack. face to face, there's
an awkward moment of attraction between them.
                        warren
                  (no better idea)
          you have nice breath.
                         parker
          thank you.
                  (beat)
          maybe we should get out of this
          sack.
                                             cut to:
