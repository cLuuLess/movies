int. the ritzy plaza
this looks like a good place to get your throat cut
fighting over a dime's worth of crack.
there's no real       lobby, just a small area to stand at the
"desk" which is       behind iron bars. behind the iron bars a
rabbit-eared tv       with a busted-in tube houses a dead
houseplant. an        old easy chair leaks stuffing.
                             parker
                       (swallowing)
             hello?    anybody?
                                                 (continued)

                                                           30.

above, a baby screeches. something breaks.        then a
disembodied voice speaks to them.
                           desk clerk (o.s.)
             keep your pants on. what'dya
             want?
the girls look behind them, nobody.       behind the bars?
still nobody. what the hell?
                           desk clerk (o.s.)
             i don't got all day.
                           parker
                     (uh...)
             we need a room... with a shower.
             just for an hour.
there's the sound of something scraping across the floor
and then the midget hotel clerk appears behind the
counter. now he's standing on a stool and we don't know
what he was doing behind the counter.
                            desk clerk
             sixty bucks.
                           parker
                     (getting oriented)
             hi.
                           desk clerk
             you want the room or not?
                           drew
             sixty dollars an hour for this --
                           parker
                     (interrupting;
                      covering)
             -- really nice place. how much
             for half an hour.
                           desk clerk
             maybe if you two were in school
             you could figure out that half a
             sixty is thirty.
                           parker
             we've only got twenty-five.
                                                 (continued)

                                                           31.

continued:
                           desk clerk
             you think because i'm short you
             can just charm me into making some
             deal, is that it?
                           parker
             no, not at all.
                           drew
             it's all we have. twenty-six
             dollars and thirty-six cents.
                           desk clerk
             are you the one that stinks so
             bad?
                           drew
                     (insulted)
             i had a little accident, okay?
                           desk clerk
             all right, all right, don't    get
             your underwear in a bunch.     as a
             public service, just 'cause    you
             stink so bad, you can have    it for
             twenty-five.
he retrieves a key and holds it up just out of reach
between the bars.
                           desk clerk
             ten-dollar deposit on key.
                           drew
             what part of 'that is all the
             money we have' didn't make sense
             to you?
                             parker
             sir,   that's every last cent we
             have   in the world. i swear to
             you,   we aren't planning to steal
             your   key.
                           desk clerk
             i give you some special deal, the
             next thing you know, you two are
             telling everybody, hey, this
             midget was a real sap. we gave
             him some sob story and the little
             guy just busted up into crocodile
             tears and handed over the key.
                                                  (continued)

                                                              32.

continued:
                            parker
             i promise we won't tell anyone.
             will we, drew?
                               drew
             not a word.      girl scout's honor.
he grudgingly holds out the key for parker, who takes it
and hands it to drew while she gets the money out.
on drew -- sensing something, she looks down at her feet
where a huge rat is licking the sweet stuff off her
shoes.
there's a rather long beat while this horror sinks in,
then:
                              drew
             ahhhhhh!!!!
key in hand, drew makes a beeline out the door.
                              parker
             drew?!   drew?!
parker follows her.
                           desk clerk
             come back with my key!
the desk clerk jumps off his stool, opens his cage and
follows them into the street.
