tears running, drew's walking too quickly for the one
stupid shoe. she nearly turns her ankle.
                            drew
             darn it!   darn it darn it darn it!
this is when she sees, parked just down the block...
roger's van with "michelangelo's painting" across the
back door.
                           drew
             that's... that's the painter.

out of sight and watch the van.
