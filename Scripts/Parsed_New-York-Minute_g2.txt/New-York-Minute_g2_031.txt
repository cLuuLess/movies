int. the plaza - girls' pov - day
in the street, bennie's getting up, brushing the crap
off. when a cab honks at him, he gives it an italian
salute and slaps the hood, but when he reaches the curb
it's clear: he's lost the girls.

drew and parker
                        drew
          i don't want to do this anymore.
          i want to be done. no more rats,
          no more mob hit men.
                        parker
          well, cinderella, your wish has
          come true.
                  (gesturing)
          voila, la plaza, mademoiselle.
                            drew
          so?     hello?   no dinero?
                        parker
          yeah. i've got what i'd like to
          call a 'creative solution' to
          that.
                           drew
          no.     i'm calling mom.
                        parker
          what good will that do?
                         drew
                  (beat)
          i'll have her... uh...
                        parker
          have her what? hi, mom? could
          you leave that baby halfway outta
          there and drive into the city?
                           drew
          dad, then.
                        parker
          dad, hey. drew. complete loser.
          couldn't get to an interview by
          myself, need full bail out. yeah.
          i'm the one who was going to
          change the world, i just couldn't
          get across town.
                                            (continued)

                                                         37.

continued:
                           drew
             damn it, parker, my itinerary is
             shot to hell! blue, red --
her watch alarm beeps.
                           drew
             i don't even know what that means!
             i'm running out of time.
                     (noticing)
             is that guy looking at me?
parker starts to look.
                           drew
             don't look.
                           parker
             when you ask a question like that,
             the person is going to look.
drew drags her behind a palm. sure enough, across the
lobby, a guy dressed as plainclothes hotel security
(morty sestero) now pretends he wasn't keeping an eye on
them.
                           drew
             i think he was.
                           parker
             drew, we haven't done anything.
                           drew
             yeah, but i'm standing in the
             lobby of the plaza looking like a
             deranged street person who might
             attack at any moment. in fact, i
             might attack at any moment.
the elevator behind them opens.
                           parker
             let's go.
the girls slip into the elevator.     when it closes,
morty's watching.
