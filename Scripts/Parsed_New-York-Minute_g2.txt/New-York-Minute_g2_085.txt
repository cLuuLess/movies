ext. block north of the garden - continuous action
the emperor's having the time of his life. he licks
drew's face joyfully as she weaves through the growing
crowd.

drew's dog-slobbered pov
reveals a uniformed policeman doing security at the
delivery entrance to the garden, where show participants,
wheeling their dog kennels, are being checked in by two
show officials.


back to scene
drew draws a bead on the policeman, determined to reach
him and hand over the emperor:
                         drew
          officer?!   officer?!
but show official #3 appears from inside, taps the
policeman on the shoulder -- they need him inside.   he
turns and goes through the door just as...
... drew reaches the loading dock and hustles up the
stairs.
                           drew
          officer?!
she sprints past the other show officials checking in
contestants.
                       show official #1
          miss! you can't go in without
          credentials!
