int. macleod house - parker's room - morning
close on a japanese executive (with a clock in his belly)
which suddenly begins screaming in japanese, its jaw
wagging.
from under piles of clothes and sheets, parker macleod,
17, drew's twin sister, opens one eye, shuts off the
shrieking alarm clock.
with a sigh, she throws her feet  over the edge of the
bed. her room is a train wreck.    grabbing a matchbox 20
t-shirt from the pile on the bed,  she gives it a sniff.
good enough. pulling it on, she   pauses, looks a bit
concerned down at her navel.
a recent belly-button piercing looks a little red. she
touches it. ouch. when a ringing is heard, she begins
tossing clothes, blankets, shoes, trying to unearth the
source.
she pulls her blackberry from under the covers:
thoreau 786:   made critical error last p.m.
parker snickers, types her return from...

thoreau 786:   dropped triple depth charge after dinner.
notatwin:   that much caffeine is illegal in utah.
thoreau 786: then bought 'no money down' real estate
course around 3:00 a.m.
this makes her smile.
notatwin:   a career man.   i like that.
