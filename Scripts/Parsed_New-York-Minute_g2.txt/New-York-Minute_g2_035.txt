int. lo bianchos' suite
it's lavish, yaddada yaddada.
                           drew
             i can't do this.
                           parker
             drew, you're not a criminal. you
             just smell like one. this way.
                                                (continued)

                                                    40.

continued:
parker leads her to the big double doors of the master
bedroom and slowly opens them.
there, on the bed, is the emperor, defending champion of
the new york kennel club dog show. a chinese crested
hairless with his little crown sticking straight up, he
may be the most absurd-looking dog in history. he simply
eyes them. he might even be smiling.
                           drew
             oh, no.  oh my god. a... a...
                     (puzzled)
             what the hell is it?
                           parker
             a dog?
                           drew
             i'm itching already.   see?   are my
             arms red?
drew backs away -- she's about to break for the door.
                           parker
             key down. i'll take him in the
             living room and keep a lookout.
             you just get in that shower.
parker approaches the emperor.
                           parker
                     (baby talk)
             hi, little guy. you don't look so
             tough, huh? you don't look much
             like a dog, actually. more like
             woody woodpecker.
happy to give the company, the emperor practically jumps
into parker's arms.
                           parker
             you're cute, aren't you, in a
             freakazoidal kinda way.
she takes him into the living room and moves to the door.
                           parker
             was your daddy a rat? is that it?
             well, i still like you.
parker, holding the emperor, opens the door a crack to
keep a lookout.

                                                       41.

parker's pov
the hallway's empty.
but the emperor, feeling frisky, leaps from her arms into
the hallway, then turns to face her. come on. let's
play!

back to scene
                        parker
          come back here, little ratdog.
          come to mommy parker.
parker pulls off a shoe and sticks it in the doorway to
keep it from closing, then, hesitantly, trying not to
spook him into running away from her, she steps into the
hallway.
