int. hallway - the plaza - day
the girls climb out of the elevator and sneak to the end
of the hall where parker stops and peers back around the
corner.

                           drew
                     (whispering)
             what are we doing? and why am i
             whispering?
                           parker
             we're getting you a shower. blake
             greer pulled this at the sheraton
             after the prom.
                           drew
             great. now we're emulating blake
             greer, voted most likely to commit
             a felony before having to shave.
                           parker
             we're not going to steal anything.
             we're just going to sneak in, use
             a little soap and water and get
             out.
                           drew
             oh, we're not going to steal
             anything. super. just a little
             'breaking and entering.'
                            parker
             we're not going to break anything.
                     (beat)
             we are going to enter, however.
                               drew
             no.   no.   no.
                           parker
             shhh... here comes somebody.
down the hall a door swings open and mr. and mrs. lo
biancho, wealthy bostonians, exit their suite.

another angle
reveals -- at the opposite end of the hallway, parker and
drew aren't the only ones watching. a painter with one
lazy eye, roger, pauses with his roller and carefully
peeks around the corner.
                           mrs. lo biancho
             it's the new york kennel club,
             emile, not the new york
             knickerbockers. please call the
             caterer and cancel the beer.
                                               (continued)

                                                          39.

continued:
the elevator opens       for them and they step in. parker
runs like hell for       the door of their suite... it's just
about to close when       she slides like pete rose into first,
just getting a hand       on it.
she lies there on the floor, holding the door and
whispers loudly to drew.
                                parker
             hurry up!
                                drew
             no!
                            parker
                     (beat)
             i didn't want to have to do this,
             but... look in the mirror behind
             you.
on drew -- bracing herself, she turns slowly.
                                                cut to:
