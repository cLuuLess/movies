... jumps onstage, vamping it down the catwalk like she
was born to it.
drew's still at the end of the runway, basking in the
applause and attempting to negotiate a precarious turn in
her scary spiked heels when parker approaches her and...
... throws a hand on her hip, thrusts it out -- sexy
executive! and leans into her sister:
                           parker
                     (whispering)
             the hotel guy's here.
the juxtaposition of the two polar opposite outfits
draped over twins suddenly throws the audience into
paroxysms of appreciation for the inspiration of the
artist and they call him out! bobo! bobo! auteur!
brava!
here comes a smiling bobo, through the curtains, blowing
kisses and heading for the girls.
                           parker
                     (louder)
             and the police.
bobo presses himself between the girls, taking their
hands and beginning his bows, but the girls spot morty
peeking from backstage, and they take off, leaping off
the front of the stage into the audience like punks

continued:
the adoring crowd holds them up and they crowd surf
toward the rear of the room.
                           drew
             everybody washed their hands,
             right?

angle on morty
spotting the commotion, he and the two cops race down the
catwalk. realizing he'll never get through the crowd,
he, too, leaps off the stage to surf toward them but...
the crowd abruptly parts and he does a complete face
plant.
                           hogan
             i guess that explains why he's a
             security guard.

who bust out the back doors of the large room and
