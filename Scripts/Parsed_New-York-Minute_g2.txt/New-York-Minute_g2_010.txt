int. the girls' honda - morning
parker pulls up to the curb at the station.       drew
collects her bag.
                           parker
             good luck with your interview.
drew pauses, holding the door open.
                           drew
             you know, parker. chemistry is
             important. when you think about
             it, everything's made of
             chemicals.
                                               (continued)

                                                         12.

continued:
                           parker
             oh, i'm interested in chemistry.
             just not the kind with all the
             numbers and stinky test tubes.
drew shuts the door and hustles off into the train
station. parker sighs, looks to the blackberry on the
seat next to her.
                           parker
             ah, chemistry.
