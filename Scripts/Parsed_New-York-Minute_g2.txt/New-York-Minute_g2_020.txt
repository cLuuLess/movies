int. town car - morning
parker tries to play cool -- drew's rigid -- angry and
afraid. bennie checks his invoice.
                                                (continued)

                                                          21.

continued:
                           bennie
             so you're headed to the teamster's
             hall on second street?
                           parker
                     (chewing a lip)
             you know, mister...
she checks his chauffeur's license up front:        benjamin
loyola.
                              parker
             ... loyola.
                              bennie
             bennie.
                           parker
             mr. bennie? we have a slight
             change of itinerary. we need to
             go into manhattan. 57th and 5th
             will be fine.
bennie doesn't seem perturbed a bit.
                              bennie
             it's pre-paid.     no skin off my
             nose.
                           drew
                     (whispering
                      throughout)
             pre-paid? what's 57th and 5th?
                              parker
                        (whispering
                         throughout)
             barneys.
                              drew
             not barneys.
                           parker
             we've got five hours.     relax.
he fires up the lincoln and off they go.
drew now has a pretty clear inclination as to what's
going on. she leans into her sister and whispers.
                           drew
             this was supposed to be someone
             else's car, wasn't it?
                                                 (continued)

                                                        22.

continued:
                            parker
             so?
just then, bennie tosses the sign, which he'd stashed on
the dash, onto the seat next to him, face up so drew can
read:
                            drew
             'scarpelli'?   we're supposed to be
             italian?
                           parker
             northern italian.
                           drew
             this is so... wrong.
                           parker
             what? you need to get to that
             interview. we now have a ride.
             we will pay for the ride. end of
             big deal.
this is when bennie's cell phone rings and he answers it.
                            bennie
             yeah?
                     (beat)
             no.  the city.
                     (beat)
             what'a you talkin' about?
bennie glances into the rearview mirror, smiling at the
girls...
                           bennie
             i already got 'em.
... but his smile turns down at the corners as he
listens. the girls exchange doubtful looks. it gets
worse.
                           bennie
             they're right here in the car.
                     (to girls)
             'scuse me.
bennie raises the privacy glass but doesn't realize he's
left the intercom button on so they can still hear his
half of the conversation.
the girls are petrified.
                                               (continued)

                                                    23.

continued:
                           parker
                     (low to drew)
             not good.
                           drew
                     (swallowing)
             what's happening?
                            bennie
                      (to phone)
             don't you think that's a little
             severe? i mean, they didn't see
             nothin' yet. they can't hear
             nothin'.
yes they can and they're now scared as hell.
                             bennie
             you're the boss.
                      (beat)
             take it easy. i'll fix it.
                      (beat)
             no, i don't have a shovel. not
             today. it'll be a big mess.
             besides, i just had this suit
             cleaned.
the girls want out of this car!
                           bennie
             i'll take 'em to the wharf, what
             difference does it make?
drew yanks out her inhaler and sucks on it.
                            drew
                      (whispered terror)
             parker, i think maybe we should
             get out.
parker sees the light ahead turn red.
                            parker
             i agree.   how about... now!
just as bennie brakes for the light, parker throws her
door open and pulls drew into the street!
an oncoming buick locks up its brakes as they dash for
the sidewalk.
                            bennie (o.s.)
             hey?!   where you goin'?!

                                                     24.
