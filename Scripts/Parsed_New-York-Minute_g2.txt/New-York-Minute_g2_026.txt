ext. times square - morning
the bus pulls over then pulls away, leaving the girls on
the sidewalk.
                            parker
             see?   new york. we made it.
                           drew
             i could be arrested for vagrancy
             looking like this.
                            parker
             listen.   i've got an idea.
                           drew
             no. no ideas. i'm going straight
             to that interview and wait,
             without moving or speaking,
             especially to you, for four hours.
                           parker
                     (ignoring her)
             come on! we're going to the
             plaza! we can be eloise! we'll
             get a nice room, you can take a
             shower and i'll swap clothes with
             you! simple as that!
                           drew
             do you have the slightest clue
             what that would cost?
                                                (continued)

                                                         28.

continued:
                           parker
             so? you've got the emergency
             credit card mom gave you, right?
drew's suddenly looking at her empty hands.
                             parker
             what's wrong?
                            drew
                      (dawning realization)
             oh.   my. god.
                           parker
             where's your, uh, stuff?
                           drew
                     (near coma)
             i left it in his car.
                             parker
             oh.
                           drew
             he knows where i live. he's going
             to hunt me down and kill me.
                            parker
             come on, drew. i don't think even
             the mafia kills people just for
             scamming a ride. quit being
             paranoid.
                     (beat)
             so, we don't do the plaza. i've
             got...
parker digs in her pockets.
                           parker
             six dollars and thirty-two cents.
                           drew
             that won't get me hosed down at a
             car wash.
                           parker
             what are we thinking? you've got
             your secret-safety twenty!
                            drew
                     (beat)
             my secret-safety twenty. of
             course. but it's only for
             emergencies.
                                                (continued)

                                                          29.

parker looks her sister right in the eye.
                             drew
             yeah.
drew takes off her shoe, lifts the inner sole and pulls
out a twenty, then realizes:
                           drew
             hey, how'd you know about my
             secret-safety twenty?
                           parker
             that's not important now. but
             let's just say that it's a good
             thing for you i think those shoes
             are so ugly i never borrowed them.
                     (pointing)
             hey, how about there?
parker points to hotel where the dilapidated sign reads:
the ritzy plaza -- hourly rates, hot tubs.
                           drew
             no. i want to get clean, not
             contract hepatitis.
                           parker
                     (sotto voce)
             twenty-six dollars and thirty-six
             cents.
                           drew
             we touch nothing.
parker leads them inside.
