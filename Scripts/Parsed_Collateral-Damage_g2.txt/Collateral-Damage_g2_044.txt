95   ext. parque nacional los katios - morning                      95

     the sun is already cooking the jungle as gordy reaches a
     break in the trees, sees a small town ahead.

                                                               41.

96    nearby - moments later                                         96

      gordy has left the trail. he lowers his pants just
      enough to expose his injured thigh. a bandage covers the
      wound made by the glass shard. gordy unwraps the
      bandage, revealing...

      a wad of cash is hidden inside, along with a photo of
      anne and matt. a long, livid scar marks the wound.

      gordy studies the photo of anne and matt a moment, then
      removes some cash from the wad and re-wraps the money and
      photo inside the bandage.


97    back on trail                                                  97

      gordy heads into the town.
