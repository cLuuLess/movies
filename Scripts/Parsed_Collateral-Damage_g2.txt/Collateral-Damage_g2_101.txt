      gordy is making slow progress through the wall, when he
      hears the vehicle arrive. he moves to the window by the
      door and looks out. sees the suburban. four guerrillas
      are getting out, including the beaten man. felix meets
      them. the beaten man exchanges words with felix. felix
      indicates gordy's room. as the beaten man continues to
      question felix...

      gordy realizes he's fucked. he can't get through the
      wall fast enough. his eyes go to water dripping from a
      pipe leading to the washtub sink. he moves to it. finds
      the water pipe underneath that feeds the tap. cranks
      shut the master valve on the pipe. wraps his hands
      around the pipe and pulls. nothing. jams his feet
      against the wall for leverage and pulls harder... and
      this time, he yanks the pipe free from the sink. he
      finds the rubber hose. fits an end over the pipe.

      quickly lashes it on with some wire. then cranks on the
      master valve. high-pressure water streams from the hose.

      gordy sneaks a peek out the window. the beaten man's
      still questioning felix. the sound of the hose water is
      being covered by the diesels.

      gordy crosses the room, extending the hose to the hole
      he's made in the wall. he aims the stream at the hole.
      thumbs the end of the hose to make the water jet even
      harder... and watches the jet begin eating away at the
      old adobe and brick, just as it ate through the crumbling
      plaster in the spanish harlem tenement.
