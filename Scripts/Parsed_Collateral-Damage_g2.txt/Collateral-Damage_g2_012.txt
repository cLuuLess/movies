18   int. matt's bedroom                                           18

     anne opens the door to find an exhausted gordy sitting on
     the floor with their four-year-old son, matt. they're
     building a k'nex spaceship.

                             matt
               look what we made!

                             anne
               nice rocket... that took a while.

                             gordy
               he was awake when i got home.   his
               throat still hurts.

                               anne
               shit.

                             matt
               that's a bad word.

                               gordy
               you're right.
                                                     (continued)

                                                                  7.

18   continued:                                                        18

                                anne
                  sorry.

     she feels matt's forehead.    gordy's done it already.

                                gordy
                  no fever.

                                anne
                         (to matt)
                  you better see dr. bob.
                         (to gordy)
                  and this time, no opening fire
                  hydrants to play in till he's
                  completely well.

                                gordy
                  yes, ma'am.

     she leans down and kisses him.      there's passion in it.

                                anne
                  how was your shift?

                                gordy
                         (shrugs)
                  the usual.

     she yawns.    starts heading out.

                                anne
                  dreamed i did a triple axel in an
                  ice skating championship.

                                gordy
                         (beat; calls after
                          her)
                  come back and let me see those
                  legs again.
