25   ext. spanish harlem - bodega - day                                25

     through the window, we see gordy delivering luis to a
     latin man, clearly luis's father and the bodega's owner.
     we don't hear the words, but we can tell gordy's
     complimenting the boy to his dad.

     gordy emerges.    checks his watch.   whistles up a taxi.
