     nyfd lt. gordy pitt strains as he works the handle of an
     old-time, hand-cranked ice cream maker. it's a tough job
     requiring strength, patience and determination. in a
     nutshell, that's gordy.

     firefighter junior montine, black panamanian descent,
     watches gordy crank away.

                               junior
                 hear the big news, lieutenant?
                 it's the twenty-first century.   we
                 got electricity now.

     gordy keeps cranking.

                               junior
                 got these supermarkets, too.   big
                 places, freezers full o' ice
                 cream.

    gordy stops.    pops the lid.   spoons out a dollop.

                               gordy
                 open up.

    he sticks the spoon in junior's mouth.      junior eats.
    junior loves it. gordy smiles.

                               gordy
                 screw the twenty-first century.

    the fire bell sounds.
