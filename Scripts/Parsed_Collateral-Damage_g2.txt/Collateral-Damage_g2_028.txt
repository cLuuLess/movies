65   int. vacant second-floor office (queens) - night              65

     an fbi surveillance team has taken over the office.
     three agents work video and audio recording devices.

     a camera points out the window to a line of storefronts
     across the street. the lights are on in one building
     with a sign reading "ipc" (indigenous people's committee).

     the fbi agents listen to live audio from the ipc office.

               rosetta, i said mustard on the
               side. you'll have to go back.

                             fbi surveillance agent
               know what cracks me up about
               commies? they're all 'equality
               this, equality that,' and they're
               all chauvinists. listen to that
               fucking guy.

     what they hear, however, is rosetta scream as a door
     crashes open.

               what do you want?

     glass shatters. things are broken.


66   video monitors                                                66

     the video monitors show gordy wrecking the ipc office
     with a baseball bat.

                                                               25.
