172   ext. river - various shots - day                                 172

      as dawn breaks over the river, find gordy sitting in a
      motored panga being steered by a local boatman. gordy
      reaches into a pocket and pulls out the photo of anne and
      matt. he looks at it for a few moments. then pockets it
      again.


173   same scene - later                                               173

      the panga passes a dead body floating downstream.

                                                               66.

174   same scene - later                                             174

      the panga passes revolutionary banners and signs lining
      the riverbank.

                              boatman
                la zona guerrillera.


175   same scene - moments later                                     175

      the panga rounds a bend, and...

      two souped-up bass boats filled with heavily-armed elc
      guerrillas move to intercept it.

      the boatman slows, puts the panga in neutral and keeps
      his hands in sight.

      one boat of guerrillas pulls alongside. the other sheers
      off and stops a short distance away, ready to open fire.

      gordy shows the guerrillas his travel pass. one of them
      takes it. reads. looks gordy over. then starts to rip
      the pass in half, when...

      he stops. grins. it's a big joke. he hands back the
      pass, searches the boat quickly and waves the panga on.

      off gordy's relief as the panga heads on...
