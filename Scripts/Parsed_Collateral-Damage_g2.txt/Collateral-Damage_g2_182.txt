      selena blasts into the bottom floor, runs through a
      playroom. gordy's right behind her.

      gets there just in time to keep the screaming girl from
      falling all the way to the bottom. he sits the uninjured
      girl down and continues on.

      runs toward the living room, which is undergoing a
      renovation. without stopping, she tears through the
      plastic covering the doorway to seal in dust from the
      rest of the house. she topples what she can into
      gordy's way. throws nails down behind her. grabs a
      circular saw and hurls it back at gordy, just missing him
      and shattering a large wall mirror.

      selena's a soldier, taught to pick up and use whatever
      weapons she finds as she moves through a battlefield --
      this battlefield gives her a crowbar, which she keeps as
      she runs out through plastic covering the other doorway.

       leads into the dining room. selena runs in. gordy's
       right on her heels. selena pulls down dining room chairs
       in front of gordy. he vaults one but trips over the
       second and falls.

       blows through a swinging door into the kitchen, slamming
       into a hispanic maid, who's coming to investigate all
       the noise. both women tumble. selena gets right back
       on her feet. she breaks out a window with the crowbar
       and exits onto a fire escape as gordy blasts in from the
       dining room.
