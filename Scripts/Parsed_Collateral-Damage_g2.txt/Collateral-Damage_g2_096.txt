213   int. bar - night                                               213

      the guerrilla patrol has taken gordy to felix, still
      sitting with berta in his lap.

                              felix
                are you trying to get us both
                killed?

                              gordy
                i went for a walk. i figured you
                wanted to be alone with berta.

                                 felix
                          (to the guerrillas;
                           in spanish)
                   i'll make sure he's on a shorter
                   leash.

      the patrol leader looks at felix hard. then nods. the
      guerrillas go. felix dumps berta onto her feet, stands.
      felix looks at gordy, shakes his head.

                                 felix
                   shit...
