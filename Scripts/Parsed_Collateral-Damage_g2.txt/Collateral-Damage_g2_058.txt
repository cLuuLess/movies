126   ext. ferry - day                                                126

      gordy stands along the rail looking out at the lush,
      beautiful countryside sliding past.

      armstrong joins him.

                               armstrong
                that little kid and i had a nice,
                long snooze... we're almost to
                mompos.
                        (gazing out)
                beautiful country.

                                gordy
                it better be.    a lotta people're
                dying for it.

                              armstrong
                       (looks overboard)
                y'know, i haven't noticed one
                darn body floating downstream
                this whole trip, have you?

      gordy doesn't respond.    beat.

                              gordy
                i was thinking... maybe we could
                travel together into caguan. you
                could show me around.

                              armstrong
                       (shakes his head)
                pass is only good for one person,
                if that's your idea, which i think
                it is... besides, i can't risk
                traveling around up there in the
                company of a big gringo with a
                dumb-ass cover story about coffee
                beans.

      gordy looks over.   armstrong smiles back.     beat.

                                                        (continued)

                                                           53.

126   continued:                                                 126

                                 gordy
                   i've got money. i'll buy the pass
                   from you.

                                 armstrong
                   i've worked too hard for it. and
                   you don't have that kind of money
                   on you.

                                 gordy
                   i'll be getting some life
                   insurance money --

                                 armstrong
                          (shaking his head)
                   it's all cash and carry down here,
                   gordy.

      the ferry whistle toots.

                                  armstrong
                   mompos... you want to have some
                   fun, we'll hook up later. i
                   always schedule a stopover. to
                   sample the local wares and such.
                          (winks)
                   life can be what you make it here
                   on the frontier.

                                 gordy
                   no, thanks.

                                 armstrong
                   gotta get off the boat anyway.
                   mompos is the last stop. from
                   here into the guerrilla zone you
                   can only travel by panga... if you
                   change your mind, i'll be at the
                   tropicale later. it's a gringo
                   bar. just follow the cockroaches.

      they see the beginnings of mompos. two 4x4 trucks are
      parked on the riverbank. lean, clean-cut men in jeans,
      tight shirts, cowboy boots and sunglasses lean on the
      truck and watch the ferry pass.

                                 armstrong
                   sicarios. death squads. avoid
                   those dudes at all costs.

                                                            54.

128   same scene - few moments later                              128

      the ferry pulls up to the dock. the dock street is a
      culture clash of shanty bars and amazon indian traders,
      of big-wheel suvs and mule carts. there's a definite air
      of menace.

                              armstrong
                federales are looking for someone.

      gordy follows armstrong's look to two plain-clothes
      federales, one fat and one thin, standing near the dock
      watching the boat pull up.

      when gordy glances back, armstrong is gone.
