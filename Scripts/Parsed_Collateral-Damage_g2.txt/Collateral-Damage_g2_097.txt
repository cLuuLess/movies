      gordy and felix get in.

                                 felix
                   you're working all night,
                   beckmann. that generator gets
                   fixed, and you're out of my hair
                   in the morning.

      felix jams the car in drive.

      gordy looks down, sees the spoon of the grenade exposed.
      as he readjusts his shirt to cover the spoon...
