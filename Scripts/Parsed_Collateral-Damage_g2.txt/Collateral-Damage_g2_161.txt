344   int. latin american institute - "the wolf" room - day            344

      gordy's on his feet, looking at the wolf evidence, etc.,
      on the walls. he can't keep his eyes off it. it's
      reminiscent of what he constructed on his wall at home.
      the second agent's not in the room.
                                                    (continued)

                                                                 119.

                                 fbi agent #1
                   ... let's go through it again, mr.
                   pitt.

                                 gordy
                   i've told you all i know.

                                 fbi agent #1
                   we gotta be sure.

      gordy's eyes go to numbered evidence photo.       it's a
      picture of a seashell. he points to it.

                                  gordy
                   what's that?

                                 fbi agent #1
                   what's the number on it?

                                  gordy
                   eleven.

      the agent refers to an index sheet as the second agent
      returns. he's holding a document. to gordy --

                                 fbi agent #2
                   mr. pitt, you said selena told you
                   she had a daughter.

                                 gordy
                   she was killed in guatemala.

                                  fbi agent #2
                   according to tests on the blood
                   we drew on the plane, selena's
                   rhesus f-six. she's genetically
                   barren. she couldn't possibly
                   have had kids.

      gordy doesn't understand.     why would she have lied?

      the first agent finds what he's looking for in the index.

                                 fbi agent #1
                   number eleven, small seashell with
                   a hole in it... that was found in
                   the getaway car used in the
                   bombing in new york.

      off gordy's face...


345   flashback - selena's seashell bracelet                            345

      there's a gap where one of the shells is missing.

                                                              120.
