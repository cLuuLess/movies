192   int. bar - night                                               192

      they've had a lot more than two beers. felix has,
      anyway. he's drunk. he's also in love with a waitress
      on his lap, a cute gordita named berta. he pats her.

                                 felix
                   this is mine. this is the reason
                   i come here... right, berta? me
                   amas?

                                 berta
                          (playing along)
                   si, amor.

      somebody whistles for a drink, and berta goes.

                                 felix
                   ... she's hot, isn't she?

                                  gordy
                   yeah.

      long beat.    gordy makes the play he's been contemplating.

                                 gordy
                   armstrong said to watch my butt
                   around here. i guess the fucking
                   americans come down and shoot
                   everyone all the time.

                                 felix
                   especially now, since the bomb in
                   new york.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                 73.

192   continued:                                                       192

                                 gordy
                   yeah, i heard about it.   who did
                   it?

      felix is just loose enough.

                                 felix
                   the wolf, and they'll never catch
                   him.

                                   gordy
                   ever see him?

                                   felix
                   once.

                                   gordy
                   where?

                                 felix
                          (beat; eyes gordy)
                   if you know too much around here,
                   it can get you killed.

      gordy's gotten all he'll get from felix.     he feigns
      nonchalance, smiles.

                                 gordy
                   tell me what doesn't get you
                   killed around here.

      gordy takes a swig of beer.      when...

      gordy sees the beaten man from the jail in mompos.       the
      man has just walked in with another guerrilla.

      gordy barely avoids being seen as the guerrillas cross
      the room. at the bar, the bartender puts out two crates
      of beer. the guerrillas take the beer and head out. no
      money's changed hands. when they're gone, to felix --

                                 gordy
                   we'd better get back, huh?

                                 felix
                          (checks his watch)
                   ... shit. it's late.
