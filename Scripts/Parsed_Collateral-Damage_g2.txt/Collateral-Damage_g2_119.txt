277   ext. elc jungle village - night                               277

      water drips from jungle leaves and the eaves of
      buildings. we see the bustling life of the place, the
      families, the women and children who live with and
      support the well-organized and high-tech guerrilla
      military. the village is simple but decidedly not
      primitive. these people have generators, a satellite
      dish and a school with a computer. at night, the school
      is a tv room. right now on the tube daffy's getting his
      beak blown off.
