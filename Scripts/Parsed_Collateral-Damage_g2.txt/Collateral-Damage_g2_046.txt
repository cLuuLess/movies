99    ext. finca (colombia) - day                                    99

      a sprawling farm/estate deep in the countryside. beyond
      the hacienda, we see a military compound containing tents
      and three heavily camouflaged helicopter shelters. a
      recently arrived light observation helicopter (loh) sits
      on a chopper pad with its rotors still turning.
