225   ext. plantation - moments later                               225

      the guerrillas report to the beaten man. they can't find
      gordy. to the men guarding the plantation --

                              beaten man
                       (in spanish)
                keep looking.

      he signals his men to come with him.   they get into the
      suburban. whereupon we find...

      gordy's hanging onto the chassis. with the large tires
      and high ground-clearance, there's just enough room to
      get his legs over the rear axle. he's just finishing
      rigging up a rope he took from the store room -- the

      the suburban comes within inches of crushing gordy's
      legs. rocks are pinging everywhere. the dirt and the
      dust are choking. even for a short distance, it's going
      to be a long, dangerous ride.
