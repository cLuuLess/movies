209   ext./int. land cruiser - moments later                           209

      gordy gets the grenade from the tool box. he slides it
      just inside the top of his pants, with the spoon hooked
      over the waistband. he finds some wire. then searches
      for something else. finds a piece of string and checks
      its length. from gordy's reaction, we understand it's
      too short.

      gordy opens doors and checks seat pockets. nothing. he
      checks the glove box. no long string there, either. but
      he does find two rubber bands. gordy studies them a
      moment, thinking. tests their elasticity. then pulls
      out the zippo and thumbs it. the lighter still works.

      as gordy pockets everything and walks off...
