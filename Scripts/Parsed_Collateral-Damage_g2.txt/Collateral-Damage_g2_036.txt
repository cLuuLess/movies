84    int. gordy's apartment - living room - day                         84

      gordy's mood is dark. it's not improved by hearing the
      bullshit in updegraf's reply.

                                 gordy
                   tell him not to bother.

      he slams down the phone. rips up brandt's business card.
      he's alone with his frustration, with his rekindled
      hatred and rage. off gordy, glaring at the photo of the
      wolf on his wall...
