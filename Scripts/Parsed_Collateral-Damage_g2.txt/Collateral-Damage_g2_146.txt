325   int. blackhawk - moments later                                  325

      everyone's aboard and buckled in. everyone's tired. the
      chopper lifts off. selena's glaring at brandt, who
      pushes a headset at her, shouts over the engine whine --

                              brandt
                f.b.i.'s on the radio.     tell 'em
                everything you know.

      gordy's her protector, intervenes.    grabs brandt's arm.

                                                      (continued)

                                                               112.

325   continued:                                                      325

                                  gordy
                   they both get asylum.    and she
                   needs a medic.

                                   brandt
                   on the plane.

                                 gordy
                   what about the asylum?

                                 brandt
                          (beat)
                   they'll get it. but she's in my
                   custody till we're done with her.

      beat. gordy hates going along with brandt, but has no
      choice, nods to selena. she takes the headset. as she
      puts it on, brandt sees her pack. takes it and opens it.
      he inspects it, then hands it back. gordy glares at him.
      brandt meets his eyes. a long beat. then --

                                 gordy
                   he wasn't even there.

      brandt doesn't reply. just holds the look a moment
      longer. then looks out the window and ignores gordy.
