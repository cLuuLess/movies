206   ext./int. land cruiser (caguan) - day                            206

      gordy climbs in.   felix starts driving.   gordy's down to
      final straws.

                              gordy
                we can't stop for one beer?

                              felix
                there's beer at the plantation.

                              gordy
                       (thinking fast)
                there's no berta at the
                plantation. i like drinking beer
                around pretty girls, not a bunch
                of guys with automatic rifles.

                              felix
                to hell with berta.

                              gordy
                what happened? last night you
                were in love with her.

      there's a beat. felix glances at gordy.     decides it's
      safe to confide.

                              felix
                ... i had a dream... i fed her
                lobster, got her drunk, and she
                rejected me for another man.
                       (off gordy's look)
                dreams tell the future.

                              gordy
                ... that wasn't a dream, that was
                the alcohol talking... you saying
                two men can't go have a beer and
                look at women's breasts because
                of pink elephants?... nothing
                makes any sense down here.

                                                      (continued)

                                                                 79.

206   continued:                                                       206

      felix pulls out his .9mm.    gordy doesn't blink an eye.

                                 gordy
                   go ahead and shoot me, and you
                   fix the goddamn generator. part's
                   in the back.

      beat.   off felix, thinking it all over...
