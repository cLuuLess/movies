271   ext. elc jungle village - night                               271

      it's raining buckets. most of the people inhabiting the
      village have been driven under roofs or indoors.

      guerrillas drag gordy roughly up out of the bunker into
      the tropical downpour. they march him out into the open.
      throw him to the ground. a man draws his pistol as gordy
      gets to his hands and knees. the guerrilla puts the
      pistol to gordy's forehead.

                                 guerrilla
                   it's time, gringo.

      beat.   he extends a bar of soap with his other hand.

                                 guerrilla
                   bath time... you stink, gringo.

      the guerrillas laugh. gordy throws the soap in the mud.
      gets to his feet. points his face up into the soothing
      rain... when he hears arguing and looks over to see...


272   wolf and selena                                               272

      are inside a small house nearby, obviously fighting about
      something. selena emphasizes her argument by slapping
      her hand. the wolf storms off, and we hear a door slam.
      selena is left alone, disconsolate, framed in the window.
      she looks up and sees gordy outside. her eyes meet his.
      off their look...

                                                              99.
