274   int. underground bunker - day                                 274

      selena brings gordy food. she's extremely subdued.
      leaves the tray and starts back to the door.

                                                     (continued)

                                                                 100.

      then stops.     turns back to gordy.

                                 selena
                   i tried to stop him.

      she holds gordy's eyes a moment.       her look is grim,
      haunted.

                                 selena
                   he's gone back.

                                 gordy
                          (beat; realizes)
                   the united states? another bomb?

                                    selena
                   yes.

                                    gordy
                   where?

      she doesn't answer.

                                    gordy
                   where?

                                 selena
                   ... washington d.c.

                                 gordy
                   where in washington?

                                 selena
                   ... he had pictures of a
                   building...

                                 gordy
                   which building?

                                    selena
                   i don't know.

                                 gordy
                   we can't let it happen.

                                    selena
                   it's too late.     no one can stop
                   him now.

                                 gordy
                   we'd never make it.

                                 selena
                   i got down here from new york...

                                                         (continued)

                                                             101.

      beat.   she just looks at him, weighing her chances.

                                 gordy
                   how many more kids have to die?
                   and for what?

                                 selena
                   ... i'm his wife...

                                 gordy
                   if you don't stop it, you're as
                   much to blame as he is.

      beat.

                                 selena
                   i can't.

      she moves to the door and knocks. the door opens.
      selena's gone. off gordy, sagging...
