50   int. hospital emergency room - night                            50

     gordy's on a gurney on an i.v., his thigh heavily
     bandaged. junior and the rookie, ronnie, are with him,
     but there's no chatter -- gordy's shut down, oblivious to
     everyone around him.


     another angle

     mike is on a cell phone nearby as sal, the other veteran
     from the engine company, enters and approaches him. into
     the phone --

                              mike
               hang on.

     mike turns his attention to sal, who's clearly blown away
     by the bad news that brought him here --

                              sal
               dammit...

                             mike
               tell me about it.

                             sal
               how's he holding up?

                                                     (continued)

                                                                  18.

                                mike
                  he's shut down... we were hoping
                  they'd keep him here, and he
                  wouldn't have to go home right
                  away, but they're cutting him
                  loose.

                                sal
                  want me to stay at home with him?

                                mike
                  rookie's taking the first shift.
                  i'm just getting the schedule at
                  the firehouse rearranged now.

     mike goes back to the phone, and sal crosses to gordy.
     he puts a hand on gordy's shoulder, grips it firmly.

                                 sal
                  hey.   got here as fast as i could.

     gordy sees him, but says nothing.

                                sal
                  i know it sucks... it really
                  sucks...

     gordy can't go there.     beat.     sal releases his grip.

                                   sal
                  how's the leg?

                                ronnie
                  cut's deep, but no major vessels
                  were severed. he's got a load 'o
                  silk holding it all together.

     junior, who stepped off to talk to a cop, now comes back.

                                junior
                  just came over the police radio...
                  consulate surveillance cameras
                  caught the bomber in the act. he
                  was disguised as a cop.

     gordy looks over.     what junior just said has triggered
     something.

                                gordy
                  ... i saw him... i saw a cop.

     gordy yanks out his i.v., and starts to get up.

                                                         (continued)

                                                               19.

                                  sal
                  christ.    gordy...

     but gordy's already on his feet, already moving.

                                gordy
                  i gotta help 'em get the bastard.
