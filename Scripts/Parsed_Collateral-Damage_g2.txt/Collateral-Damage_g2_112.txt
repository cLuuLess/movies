      gordy slowly sits up.       beat.

                                   gordy
                   why feed me?    why not just kill
                   me?

                                 selena
                   are you so anxious to die?

      gordy doesn't have an answer.         beat.    he tastes the meal.

                                 gordy
                   ... thanks.

      selena watches him a moment, troubled by something.

                                 selena
                   the men in jail with you in
                   mompos... they say you talked to a
                   man from the c.i.a.

                                 gordy
                   i'm not one of them.   i'm here for
                   my own reasons.

      selena watches him another moment. decides he's telling
      the truth. she reaches into a skirt pocket, then extends
      her hand toward gordy. he looks up. she's holding the
      photo of anne and matt. beat. gordy takes the photo.
      looks at his wife and son. selena sits next to him.
      another beat. then, off the photo...

                                 selena
                   claudio used to be a teacher. i
                   was a medical aid worker. we met
                   in guatemala, in an indian village
                   called guamaunco. we were married
                   there. sophia, our daughter was
                   born there. claudio was kind and
                   loving, and we were happy... we
                   were there four years when the
                   civil war broke out... the
                   guerrillas were all around us, but
                   left us alone... then they made an
                   attack on the army nearby. the
                   next night, soldiers came to our
                   village. they were led by
                   american 'advisors'... they
                   accused us of helping the rebels.
                   our women were raped. our men
                   were tortured. our homes were
                   burned... we crawled out into the
                   fields, but they threw grenades,
                   and sophia...

      selena hesitates, choking back her emotions.

                                 selena
                   ... my baby girl was hit by
                   shrapnel... she bled to death in
                   claudio's arms.

      she looks into gordy's eyes. the look says she
      understands and shares gordy's pain because she's
      suffered her own painful loss. she looks away again.

                    claudio joined the guerrillas.
                    when that war ended, we moved to
                    the next war, and the next... each
                    fight has only deepened his
                    hatred. and poisoned his soul.
                           (beat)
                    he's unable to love anything
                    anymore...

                                  gordy
                    why are you still here?

                                  selena
                    because i know he was a good man,
                    who's been consumed by rage
                    because of what he lost... just
                    like you.

                                  gordy
                    i'm not like him.

                                  selena
                    not yet.

                                  gordy
                    he kills innocent people.
                           (then)
                    he's planning to kill more.

       beat. selena suddenly stands, uncomfortable, not wanting
       to discuss it. she goes to the door and knocks. off
       gordy, as the door opens, and selena exits...

                    at 2250, we get a large heat-and-

                    minutes later. we got a house
                    blown to shit and burning. we got
                    colombians in cammies, a gringo
