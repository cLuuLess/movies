                                gordy
                  is there a problem?

     the customs superior closes the door.      beat.

                                immigration superior
                  we know who you are, mr. pitt.

                                gordy
                  says so right there in my
                  passport.

                                immigration superior
                  we're aware your wife and child
                  were killed in the bombing in new
                  york.
                         (off gordy's look)
                  we have c.n.n. here, too.
                         (then)
                  it's better for you to visit
                  another country. for your own
                  sake.

                                gordy
                  ... you giving me a choice?

                               immigration superior
                  yes. but not about staying in
                  colombia.

     he opens the door, addresses two armed policemen in
     spanish. turning back to gordy --

                                immigration superior
                  these men will escort you onto
                  whatever flight you wish.

     he holds out gordy's passport.     beat.   gordy takes it,
     starts out. as he goes --

                                                        (continued)

                                                                 37.

86   continued:                                                        86

                                immigration superior
                  it's the wolf you're after, yes?

     gordy stops, turns back. he says nothing, but the look
     on his face speaks volumes.

                                immigration superior
                  ... then i've just done you a
                  bigger favor than you know.

     gordy doesn't respond.    just turns and goes.
