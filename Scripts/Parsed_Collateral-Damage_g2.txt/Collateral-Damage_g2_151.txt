      mauro, still sleeping, is buckled up in the far back
      seat between gordy and selena. phipps, dray and brandt
      crowd the second row. phipps extends photos to selena.

                                 phipps
                   these buildings best match what
                   you described to us.

      selena leafs through the photos of various washington
      monuments, government buildings, etc. she reaches the
      last photo.

                                 selena
                   i don't recognize anything... i
                   saw only parts of the building...
                   i'm sorry.

      phipps wants to keep her positive and willing.

                                  phipps
                   that's okay.   we'll keep trying.

                                   selena
                   i think   it's a public place. he
                   said he   wanted the people of
                   america   to feel the terror.
                   'terror   is all they understand.'
                   he said   it over and over...

                                 phipps
                          (to dray)
                   double up on public venues:
                   museums, theaters, transport...
                   put in all the extra undercover we
                   can.

      selena looks over at her son sleeping in gordy's arms.
      she lovingly brushes the hair off his forehead, rattling
      her seashells. the leather doll is about to fall from
      mauro's fingers. selena takes the doll and puts it into
      her bag. then looks out at the passing scenery. off
      selena, in the land of her husband's enemy --
