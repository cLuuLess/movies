      two plainclothes federales have been watching the ferry
      load and now relax their vigil. one man holds a xerox of
      gordy's passport photo. the other bites into an
      empanada, which breaks open and spills its contents down
      the front of his shirt. his partner finds it funny. he
      doesn't. and while their attention's occupied...

      gordy hurries by, oblivious to the federales' presence,
      and just manages to hop onto the ferry as it pulls away.
