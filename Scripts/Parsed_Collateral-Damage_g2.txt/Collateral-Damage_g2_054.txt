124   ext. jungle - day                                           124

      two colombian armed man wearing guerrilla uniforms
      bearing a distinctive elc patch are walking a trail, when
      the man in front notices something odd. he stops. leads
      the other man back a few steps. looks into the foliage
      along the trail. something doesn't seem right. he
      extends his ak-47. prods a hump of greenery with the
      rifle butt, and in a flash...

      the greenery suddenly transforms into two men wearing
      face-paint and full-body military camouflage gear and
      pointing twin cocked-and-locked car-15 assault rifles at
      the heads of the startled guerrillas.

                                                                52.
