309   ext. river                                                        309

      bullets whip the water around gordy, mauro and selena.
      they hide behind the cans. bullets ping off the metal.

      they're swept through some rocks, blocking them from the
      soldier, who fires anyway. bullets chip the stone.

      there's one more clear shot after the rocks. they're
      almost around a bend. the soldier aims. bangs! and...

      selena's hit.      gasps.   gordy looks over, calls.

                                   gordy
                   you okay?

      selena endures the pain.      hides it behind iron eyes.

                                 selena
                   your hired soldiers can't shoot.
