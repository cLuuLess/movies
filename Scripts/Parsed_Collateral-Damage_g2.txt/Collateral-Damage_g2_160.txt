      - day

      selena watches as phipps plays a surveillance video of
      union station. phipps suddenly freezes the image. zooms
      in on a man in the middle of the crowd. claudio.

                               phipps
                 that's him, isn't it?

                               selena
                        (hesitates, then)
                 yes.

                               phipps
                 he was there yesterday. just
                 stood there and left... so far,
                 the dogs haven't found anything,
                 so maybe we're ahead of him.

                               brandt
                 what's he waiting for?

                               selena
                 he takes his time. like he told
                 you, he enjoys it.

      beat. selena's overwhelmed by the experience of seeing
      her husband on the tape, by her betrayal of him. she
      grows queasy. leans on the table for support.

                                 phipps
                 are you okay?

                                                    (continued)

                                                                118.

343   continued:                                                       343

                                 selena
                   i'm sorry... i think i'm going to
                   be sick.

      brandt opens a door to a bathroom.

                                 brandt
                   in here.

      selena grabs her pack and rushes in. when the door's
      closed, phipps turns to dray, indicates monitor.

                                 phipps
                   get copies of this freeze frame to
                   all the undercover people and the
                   sniper teams.

                                 dray
                   you got it.

                                 phipps
                   and nobody caps him until we get
                   that bomb tagged. after that, i
                   don't give a shit what happens to
                   him.

      dray goes. there's a long beat.     brandt looks at the
      freeze frame.

                                 brandt
                   he always hid his face. why's he
                   giving us a clear picture now?

      beat.   the bathroom toilet flushes.   selena emerges.

                                 phipps
                   feeling better?

                                 selena
                   i think i'd feel better if i could
                   rest a little and see my son.

      phipps nods to brandt, who turns to two of his agents,
      one a female.

                                 brandt
                   escort her.
