     mike's channel-surfing again. gordy goes by the door,
     carrying his tools and looks in.

                               gordy
                 you ever stay on one channel long
                 enough to hear what they're
                 saying?

     whereupon mike lands on cnn.

                               cnn anchor (v.o.)
                 -- a surprise today --

     and then we're on another channel.

                                gordy
                 go back!   go back!

                                mike
                 what?

     but gordy has charged in and grabs the remote from mike,
     switches channels back to cnn.

     we see a cnn anchor with an over-the-shoulder graphic
     showing the still of the cop from the consulate
     surveillance camera with "the wolf" superimposed.

                               cnn anchor (v.o.)
                 ... videotape from the terrorist
                 who calls himself the wolf...

     on screen, we now see a homemade video of a masked figure
     wearing a camo floppy hat and a hunter's mesh face mask
     with a strange-smiling face painted on it in camo earth
     tones. the wolf's body is hidden shadow, the voice
     digitally altered to a deep bass growl.

                               the wolf (v.o.)
                 you thought you killed me. you
                 didn't. i'm still here...

     we see gordy's demeanor shift, retreating to the
     obsessive, seething hatred he showed before.

                                                     (continued)

                                 the wolf (v.o.)
                   ... i swear that for every freedom
                   fighter you killed, ten americans
                   will die. and i will pick the
                   time and the place. and i will
                   enjoy it...

      the wolf slaps his palm for emphasis.

                                 the wolf (v.o.)
                   ... venceremos.

      the tape ends.    mike shakes his head.

                                 mike
                   this guy, quaddafi, that bin
                   laden... we never get these
                   assholes.

      off gordy, his spark of life suddenly extinguished...


83a   ext. row of townhouses (washington, d.c.) - day                 83a

      the four connected townhouses sit behind gates on a tree-
      lined street in georgetown. a sign reads: latin
      american institute.


83b   int. latin american institute - brandt's office - day       83b

      brandt's on the phone.    he's pissed.

                                 brandt
                   ... senator, the failure of one
                   operation shouldn't cause your
                   committee to question financing
                   everything else we're doing down
                   there...

      donald updegraf, brandt's number two, enters.

                                 brandt
                   ... i know it looks bad, and i
                   appreciate your support.
                   together we'll get it done...
                   yeah. 'bye.
                          (hangs up; to
                           updegraf)
                   without his father's money, that
                   asshole'd be keeping bees for a
                   living... what?

                                   brandt
                   no.

                                 updegraf
                   he's called every day.

                                 brandt
                   i don't need it.

      beat.   updegraf picks up the phone.

                                 updegraf
                   mr. pitt, mr. brandt'll have to
                   get back to you.
