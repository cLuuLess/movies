     a bagpiper plays "amazing grace."

     reveal gordy holding matt's small coffin as anne's is
     lowered into the ground. gordy's men are around him,
     along with many other nyfd personnel, family and friends.

     a second bagpiper farther away in the cemetery, picks up
     the song, begins playing it in a round with the first.

     matt's coffin is taken from gordy.    as it is lowered...

     a third bagpiper, farther away still, begins playing the
     song with the other two. one by one the first and second
     bagpipers finish their rounds, until there is just the
     third -- a haunting, mournful wail off into the distance.
     and then...

     there's only silence.
