171   ext. mompos waterfront - night                                 171

      there's less chaos here.    the fires are in the distance.

      gordy arrives carrying armstrong.    sets him down.

                                 gordy
                   i'll find a boat to take us
                   upriver.

      he starts to go.    armstrong stops him.

                                 armstrong
                   no. i told you. the pass is only
                   good for one person. and you're
                   too dangerous to travel with.

      beat. gordy reaches over and takes armstrong's cap.     he
      looks inside. there's no pass.

                                 armstrong
                   it hasn't been there since we
                   landed.

      gordy's at a loss. he tosses the cap back.      just looks
      at armstrong. beat. armstrong sighs.

                                 armstrong
                   aw, hell... i was through with
                   this place anyway...

      he takes off a boot. shakes out some money and the pass.
      he hands the pass to gordy.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                 65.

                                 armstrong
                   i'll call ahead and tell felix i'm
                   not coming, and you're my
                   replacement. he'll meet you in
                   caguan and take you to the
                   plantation... what do you know
                   about diesel engines?

                                 gordy
                   all the fire trucks are diesels.

                                 armstrong
                   you'll have to be austrian, eh?
                   they hate americans. name's gotta
                   change, too, in case they're
                   watching the news.
                          (beat)
                   it'll buy you a little time to
                   look around caguan. but you'll
                   never find the wolf.

      beat.   gordy sticks out his hand.

                                 gordy
                   heinrich beckmann.

                                 armstrong
                   huh?

                                 gordy
                   my austrian name.

      armstrong shakes hands with gordy.     armstrong doesn't
      let loose right away. beat.

                                 armstrong
                   luck got you this far. but up
                   there, luck doesn't make it.
                   i hope you know you're gonna die.

      off gordy, about to step over another line...
