147   int. gordy and armstrong's cell - night                         147

      two or three a.m. armstrong's dozing. gordy's still
      listening to the murmuring of the rebels on the other
      side of the wall, when...

                                                        (continued)

                                                              60.

147   continued:                                                    147

      there's a flurry of activity outside the cell area.   the
      door opens. soldiers enter with some federales.

      gordy watches the soldiers move past his cell.    rocha is
      with them. and then...

      brandt appears at the bars, looks in at gordy.

                                 brandt
                   enjoy your trip?

      gordy stands, approaches.

                                 brandt
                   we asked you to leave it to us.

                                 gordy
                   and you guys still haven't got
                   him.

                                 brandt
                   it's not over yet... the guys next
                   door are in the wolf's elite
                   bodyguard unit. where he goes,
                   they go. we're gonna ask
                   questions. and we're gonna get
                   answers... and you're staying
                   right here till our bomber's dead.

      brandt goes. moments later, a tortured scream is heard
      on the other side of the brick wall, waking armstrong
      with a start.
