178   int./ext. land cruiser (caguan) - day                         178

      gordy and felix pull away from the supervisor's h.q.
      felix resumes his former tone of command.

                                 felix
                   the supervisor made you my
                   responsibility... you don't go
                   anywhere without me, you
                   understand?

                                    gordy
                   no problemo.

      gordy peers out the window intently as they drive,
      looking for a lucky break, looking for the wolf,
      searching the face of every man. he doesn't see the
      wolf, but what he does see surprises him. the elc
      supervisor was right: caguan's no mompos. it's a third-
      world town, armed troops are visible, and there's a lot
      of bad shit behind colombia's revolutionaries, but here
      the streets are calm and orderly. it's quiet, almost
      eerie, as people go about their business. off gordy,
      seeing another side of the guerrillas...
