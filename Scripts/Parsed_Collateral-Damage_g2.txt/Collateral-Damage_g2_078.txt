      they approach a hacienda and outbuildings. the
      accoutrements of agriculture are present -- tractors,
      sheds, cats, etc. -- but clearly, this is no family farm.
      there are lots of serious-looking men around. more elc
      guerrillas stand guard.


181   felix                                                       181

      stops the car. he and gordy get out. felix begins
      leading gordy toward two rows of long, open-walled sheds.

                                 felix
                   the problem's with the diesel
                   generators. the sons-of-bitches
                   keep breaking down.


182   new angle                                                   182

      they pass four very large pits, where green leaves steep
      in a thick, foul-smelling liquid.

                                 felix
                   we're using portables to keep
                   production going, but they don't
                   supply enough power to the heat
                   lamps, and we have to dry a lot
                   of... 'coffee beans.'


183   another angle                                               183

      they're now walking between the two rows of sheds, where
      portable gas generators thrum, and...

      gordy can see long, wide platforms inside. above the
      platforms are multiple arrays of powerful heat lamps.
      spread out and drying beneath them is a half-acre or two
      of converted cocaine.


184   in another shed                                             184

      workers pack and wrap one-kilo bricks of coke for
      shipment.

                                                               70.

185   gordy and felix                                                185

      approach the two giant diesel generators.

                              felix
                we can fix anything, but these
                keep dying on us... you'll start
                now. i'll have tools brought to
                you.
                       (beat)
                armstrong's a magician with them.
                let's hope you have his skill.

      felix walks over to a guerrilla with an ak-47 and speaks
      to him. then goes. whereupon the guerrilla crosses to
      gordy and takes up a sentry position over him.


186   same scene - later                                             186

      gordy has the diesels partially dismantled. the
      guerrilla sentry is still right there. felix returns.

                              felix
                well?

      gordy has to think of something fast.    beat.   he throws a
      machine part against a wall angrily.

                              gordy
                i can't work with these pieces of
                junk.

                             felix
                junk? these generators cost a
                fortune.

                              gordy
                then treat them that way.

                              felix
                       (beat, then)
                armstrong always fixes them.

                              gordy
                armstrong wants your money. he
                makes them work, but he doesn't
                fix them... to do this right, we
                gotta order parts from europe.
                in the meantime, i can make
                something temporary. there must
                be a machine shop in town.

                              felix
                ... yes.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                    71.

186   continued:                                                          186

      gordy stands.

                                 gordy
                   let's go.

      off felix, forced to acquiesce...
