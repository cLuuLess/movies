      gordy hands the bowl to mauro, who's playing in the front
      seat of the pumper. mauro tastes it. thumbs up. gordy
      smiles.

      mike and the other men on gordy's old shift are watching.
      to gordy --

                                 mike
                   it'll be good to get you back.

      gordy turns to them. looks into the faces of these men,
      the people closest to him in the world. beat. then --

                                 gordy
                   it's good to be home.

      gordy's still in pain, still missing the wife and son
      he'll never see again. but gordy's gonna be alright.

      mauro's gonna be with him. there'll be fires to put out
      and lives to save and basketball games and the multitude
      of miseries and joys the firefighters in spanish harlem
      see each and every day.

      as we pull back, out and away from the old brick edifice
      from which the big red truck will come, bringing help...
