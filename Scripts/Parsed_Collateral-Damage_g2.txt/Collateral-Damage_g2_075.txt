177   int. elc supervisor's office - day                              177

      the elc supervisor for caguan may be a marxist, but the
      clean, well-ordered office is nicely appointed, with a
      big-screen sony and leather furniture. the tv's tuned to
      cnn. a photo on the wall depicts him as a younger man
      wearing guerrilla cammies bearing with an elc patch and
      holding an ak-47. a brass nameplate reading "supervisor"
      rests on a neat desk, behind which stands the man himself
      -- a hardened, former guerrilla fighter proud of his
      position. he's not in cammies now -- his uniform now
      consists of casual but nice tropical clothing and a fat
      rolex.

      felix is a subordinate here. he and gordy stand across
      the desk as the supervisor examines gordy's travel pass.
      gordy's nervous about what could appear on the tv in the
      b.g., but tries not to show it.

                                 elc supervisor
                   your passport was stolen.

                                 gordy
                   in mompos.

                                 elc supervisor
                   ... mompos is a shithole. not
                   like caguan... why didn't
                   armstrong come?

                                 gordy
                   he was arrested in ecuador. he
                   got drunk and fooled around with a
                   police officer's wife.

      the supervisor just looks at him, assessing gordy's face
      for signs he's lying. gordy's expression stays the same.

      felix respectfully interjects.     it's almost a plea.

                                 felix
                          (in spanish)
                   we need to fix the equipment. we
                   have delivery deadlines to meet.

                                                        (continued)

                                                              68.

177   continued:                                                    177

      a long beat. the elc supervisor hands the travel pass
      back to gordy. in a hard tone to felix --

                                 elc supervisor
                          (in spanish)
                   he's your responsibility. don't
                   let him out of your sight.

                                    felix
                   si.   gracias.

      as felix leads gordy away...
