      felix yanks the dangling cord and turns on the lights.
      the room's a mess. all kinds of rubbish. there's a
      washtub sink. there's a cot.

                              gordy
                this where armstrong stays?

                              felix
                this is where you stay... a boat
                will take you down river at seven.

      felix closes the door. we hear a lock turning. gordy
      moves to the door and tries it. it's definitely locked.
      through a small window, he can see the lights in the
      sheds and the ever-vigilant nighttime elc sentries
      patrolling the grounds. the diesels roar in the b.g.

      gordy turns back. readjusts the grenade digging into his
      belly, then hooks it back inside his pants. he turns off
      the light. moves to the adobe wall opposite the door.
      through another small window, he can see it's dark in
      this direction.

      gordy rummages through the refuse lying around the room.
      we see some rubber tubing. we see some rope. gordy
      finally finds a piece of sharp metal. he moves to the
      wall with the window. with the diesels covering the
      noise, gordy starts chiseling away at the adobe.
