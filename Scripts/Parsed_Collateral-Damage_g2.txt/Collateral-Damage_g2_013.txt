19   int. bathroom - day                                               19

     gordy holds matt in his arms as water pours over them.
     it's the second child he's held in the last few hours.
     this one is his, this one is safe at home and unafraid:
     what a father wants for his child. we see the deep
     affection gordy has for his son. he holds matt tightly,
     skin to skin, and kisses the boy's wet head...

     anne opens the shower door.       she's on the phone.

                                                        (continued)

                                                               8.

                  dr. bob can squeeze him in at
                  twelve. i have a patient
                  relations meeting at twelve-
                  fifteen. can you take him?

                                gordy
                  i have a game. but yeah, if we do
                  the handoff at the doctor's.

                                 anne
                         (into phone)
                  yes, he'll be there... thanks.
                         (hangs up; to gordy)
                  five-of in front of dr. bob's.
                  don't be late.
                         (to matt)
                  let's get you out, sweetie. your
                  father just can't keep you dry.

     she leads matt out. closes the shower door. gordy
     sticks his face into the water. looks back, finds...

     two bare butts, anne's and matt's, are pressed against
     the shower door's foggy glass. off gordy, laughing --
