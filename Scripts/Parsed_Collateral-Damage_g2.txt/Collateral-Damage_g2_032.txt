     we see the president's national security advisor step up
     to a podium to give a statement.

                                national security advisor (v.o.)
                  today, at 0700 hours eastern
                  daylight time, a joint united
                  states/colombian strike force
                  launched a full-scale assault at a
                  base camp of the army of colombian
                  liberation, or e.l.c., in southern
                  colombia. the purpose of the
                  mission was to punish the people
                  behind the brutal bombing in new
                  york city ten days ago... we are
                  presently evaluating after-action
                  reports from special operations
                  group, but feel confident that we
                  have accomplished our mission...

     cheers throughout the bar.         mike quiets them.

                                national security advisor (v.o.)
                  ... at this time, we believe the
                  man responsible for carrying out
                  the new york bombing, the
                  terrorist known as the wolf, is
                  among the enemy dead.

     big cheers now. toasts all around. everyone in the
     place is happy for gordy, who sits there a moment trying
     to absorb the news, then buries his face in his hands.
