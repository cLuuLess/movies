     emergency personnel - ems, nypd, nyfd -- swarm the area.

     two white plastic sheets cover two bodies.

     across the street, paramedics work on gordy's leg.

                                paramedic #1
                  we're gonna give you a shot.

     gordy's oblivious to the pain.     shoves him away.

                                gordy
                  i need to see them!

                                paramedic #1

     fbi agent joe phipps ducks under the police tape.     reggie
     dray, a young agent, meets him. as they walk --

                  device functioned in front of the
                  colombian consulate just as a
                  motorcade full of brass arrived.

                                phipps
                  who were the brass, and why were
                  they here?

                                                      (continued)

                                dray
                  no one's talking yet, but it
                  smells high-level. there were
                  colombians and americans in the
                  cars. three of 'em ate it. guy
                  on the phone --

     he indicates brandt, talking on a cell phone.

                                dray
                  -- is one of the survivors.
                  name's brandt. c.i.a.

     that gets phipps' interest momentarily. then, as they
     continue toward the consulate, he notices security
     cameras on the building.

                                phipps
                  check the surveillance cameras?

                                dray
                  we're pulling up the video now.

                                phipps
                         (stops; looks around)
                  where's n.y.p.d. on this?

                                dray
                  they know it's ours. they're
                  helping with shoe-leather.

     phipps' eyes go to the white sheets up the street.

                                dray
                  we got two dead bystanders, a
                  mother and four-year-old son. the
                  father's over there with a leg
                  wound.
                         (indicates gordy)
                  guy's a lieutenant with the new
                  york f.d.

                                phipps
                  anybody talk to him yet?

                                dray
                  we've been giving him room.

     in b.g., mike, the veteran firefighter in gordy's engine
     company, looks under the sheets with a cop.

                                junior
                  gordy.

     gordy looks up him, meets his eyes.

                                junior
                  me and mike are here.

                                gordy
                  ... i was late... they shouldn't
                  have been there...

                                junior
                  it's not your fault.

                                gordy
                  i need to see them.

     mike has walked up, lays a comforting hand on gordy.

                                mike
                  no. you don't need to see 'em
                  that way, gordo.

     junior spots a news camera crew focusing on gordy's
     grief, calls at a cop.

                                junior
                  get those goddamn people outta
                  here!

     phipps, approaching with dray, addresses the same cop.

                                phipps
                  put that tape out fifty more
                  feet.

     the cop begins moving the camera crew back.     phipps
     continues to gordy.

     a paramedic looks up at mike.

                                paramedic #1
                  he needs to go to the hospital.
                  we can't take that glass out.

                                mike
                  if he's not bleeding to death,
                  leave him. he's not moving till
                  they do.

     phipps has heard and understands.      to dray, re:
     bodies --

                                phipps
                  chalk 'em and move 'em.

     dray goes. phipps turns to gordy and the two
     firefighters standing with him. addresses mike --

                                phipps
                  we gotta get on this quick.   i
                  need to talk to him.

     beat.   mike nods.   to gordy --

                                phipps
                  mr. pitt, if you can you tell
                  me... what'd you see?

                                gordy
                         (looks up; beat)
                  what'd i see? i saw my family
                  die.

     mike puts a restraining hand on gordy.

                                mike
                  this guy didn't do the bombing,
                  gordo. he's just trying to get
                  the people who did.

     beat.   gordy eases up.   then, after a moment, defeated --

                                gordy
                  i didn't see anything except the
                  explosion.

     beat.   phipps sees that's all he's gonna get.

                                phipps
                  i know this is hard. i'm sorry i
                  had to bother you.

     phipps goes. gordy looks over as the bodies of anne and
     matt are placed on gurneys and rolled away. chalk
     outlines are all that remain of his family. beat.

                                mike
                  we're gonna roll you to the
                  hospital now and get that glass
                  out.

                                                               17.

               we'll have this discussion
               somewhere else more secure, after
               i get your clearance.

                             phipps
               whatever it takes. but i got a
               bomber in the wind. i need
