51   int. underground garage - fbi incident center - night           51

     a well-lit, sectioned-off area of the garage secured by a
     chain-link fence.

     phipps enters.      as he passes dray, already there --

                                phipps
                  how long before we have a secure
                  computer network?

                                 dray
                  an hour.   they're building it now.

     phipps moves to a forensic expert hovering over a table
     of small fragments.

                                phipps
                  what do you got?

                                forensic expert #1
                  pieces of a pager oxidized with
                  trace elements of semtex.
                  probably the triggering device.
                  they dial it up, probably from a
                  cell phone, and boom...

     he picks up a microchip.

                                forensic expert #1
                  ... this is the memory chip. i
                  can build it into a working pager
                  and maybe get a number readout.

                                  phipps
                  do it.

     phipps moves to the next work area, where another
     forensic expert studies video from a consulate
     surveillance camera.

                                                             20.

52   on screen                                                     52

     in super slow-mo, we see a cop -- the one who later
     bumped into gordy -- in front of the consulate. his hat
     is pulled down over his eyes, almost concealing his
     tinted glasses. as the cop faces more toward the camera,
     the expert freeze-frames. to phipps --


53   forensic expert #2                                            53

                               forensic expert #2
                 that's as much face as we get. he
                 was careful to duck the camera.

                               phipps
                 run a total analysis. i want to
                 know if this asshole's right or
                 left-handed. i want everything
                 you can get outta this film.

     phipps keeps moving, enters an eerie recreation of the
     blast site. streets, buildings, etc. are marked out on
     the garage floor. pieces of the navigators rest in front
     of the area marked "consulate;" parts of an nypd traffic
     scooter rest in front of the navigators; "x's" mark where
     anne and matt were standing.

     phipps crosses to another agent.

                               phipps
                 any helpful information coming
                 outta colombia?

                               agent
                 not yet. sat-intel hasn't picked
                 up any related data-traffic,
                 either.

     dray walks up.

                               dray
                 gordon pitt's here. he says he
                 saw a cop at the scene.


54   same scene - later                                            54

     gordy, accompanied by mike and ronnie, sits in front of a
     video monitor. phipps and dray look on.


55   on screen                                                     55

     a police cart pulls up outside the consulate.

                                                     (continued)

                                                               21.

55   continued:                                                      55

                                phipps
                  the cart was stolen from the
                  central park precinct yesterday.

     the cop gets out of the scooter.

                                gordy
                  that's him. that's the son of a
                  bitch i bumped into.

     the cop tickets a vehicle, then walks west out of frame.

                                phipps
                  the bomb's in the cart.


56   phipps                                                          56

     reverses the video, freeze-frames on the cop.

                                phipps
                  we think the bomb was triggered by
                  a cell phone. the guy doesn't
                  have one in his hands here. did
                  you see a cell phone when you ran
                  into him?

                                gordy
                  ... no.

                                phipps
                  how much time passed between then
                  and the explosion?

                                gordy
                  ... seconds... five, ten...

                                phipps
                  we think maybe he got into the
                  brown ford. you see him then?

                                gordy
                  all i cared about was getting to
                  my wife and boy.

                                dray
                         (to phipps)
                  guy still had enough time to get
                  out a phone and dial it in.

                                                       (continued)

                                                               22.

56   continued:                                                      56

                                phipps
                         (beat, then, by way
                          of ending it)
                  we might need to call you in again
                  to look at some photos.

     beat.   gordy looks back at the grainy image of the cop.

                                gordy
                  ... i touched him...
