311   ext. river                                                     311

      gordy, mauro and selena are still floating, hanging onto
      the cans, when they hear the sound of a helicopter.
      gordy looks, sees the l.o.h. flying downstream ten feet
      off the river.

                                 gordy
                   under the water!
                          (to mauro)
                   uno, dos, tres...

      he takes a big breath and holds it. mauro understands
      and does the same. they go under. so does selena.
