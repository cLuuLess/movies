      in a field near mompos, a canopied truck backs into
      position. men in guerrilla uniforms with elc patches get
      out and pull back the canopy, revealing mortar tubes
      pointing skyward on a bed of sand.


149   elc guerrilla                                                 149

      (laws) infiltrates the town.

      sets up a single mortar position overlooking the town.
      one of the men checks his watch. beat. he signals. the
      other man drops a mortar down the tube. whump.

                                                               61.
