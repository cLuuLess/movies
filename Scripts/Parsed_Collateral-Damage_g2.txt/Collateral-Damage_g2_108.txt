228   ext. suburban (caguan) - night                               228

      as the truck blasts down back roads and through the
      darkened town...


229   gordy                                                        229

      continues to suffer underneath. even with the rope
      supporting him, he has to hold on with two hands.

      a vicious jolt suddenly loosens a grenade. it starts to
      slip free. gordy can't stop it without letting go. the
      grenade falls, and...

      gordy shoots out a hand and grabs it. barely. the spoon
      just hanging on the end of his fingertips. gordy can't
      use his other hand to get it. he needs the hand to hold
      onto the car. the grenade begins to slip. he's going to
      lose it. and just as it falls...

      gordy does the only thing left. he slips a finger
      through the loops of the grenade pin. just barely snags
      the grenade before it drops to the road. and then...

      carefully, slowly -- praying that each bump doesn't jar
      the grenade off the pin -- with his other arm shaking and
      screaming in pain as he maintains a grip on the transfer
      case -- gordy eases the grenade back onto his stomach,
      where he gets a better grip. jams the grenade back.
      then grabs onto the undercarriage once more, in time to
      relieve the muscle-tearing strain on his arm.


230   above gordy's world                                          230

      the suburban passes the "cine."   the movie's over, just
      letting out.
