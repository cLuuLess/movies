210   ext. caguan - various shots - night                              210

      gordy steals through town, hiding when he sees someone
      coming. he's re-tracing the route he took the night
      before, when he followed the beaten man's suburban.

                                                               80.

211   "cine"                                                         211

      he passes the "cine" in the storefront. a movie's
      beginning to play on the supervisor's big-screen tv.   the
      place is packed. no one sees gordy, who moves on.


212   gordy                                                          212

      continues to make his way through caguan, when...

      he rounds a corner, and there's a four-man elc patrol,
      two in a truck and two out. gordy turns, starts heading
      back, when...

      one of the guerrillas calls to him.

                              guerrilla
                alto!

      gordy stops. the two standing men walk toward him. the
      other two men get out of the truck to provide backup.

      one guerrilla approaching gordy stops short and stands
      off, cocked-and-locked, as the other comes up. gordy
      carefully produces the travel pass. the guerrilla looks
      it over. in butchered spanish --

                              gordy
                yo trabajo con felix. felix --
                       (indicates)
                -- la cantina. con berta.

      the attractive woman we saw earlier playing with the
      children now walks up holding the hand of a small boy.    a
      guerrilla waves them on. the woman and boy hustle by,
      glancing at the face of this big gringo in trouble as
      they pass. they hurry on toward the nearby "cine."

      off gordy, as the guerrilla indicates for him to start
      walking to the truck...
