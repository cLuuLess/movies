                  ... the bombing that left a mother
                  and son dead and new york city
                  numb took on a new dimension today
                  when a notorious latin american
                  terrorist took credit for the
                  attack.

               in an e-mail to the new york
               times, a marxist extremist known
               only as 'the wolf,' states that
               the bombing was, quote, 'not an
               act of terror but an act of war,
               aimed at stopping your c.i.a.

               from committing further acts of

               american military officer died
               in last thursday's blast. also
               killed were anne pitt, wife of a

               intelligence sources say the
               identity and whereabouts of the
               wolf remain a mystery. they
               believe he has worked closely with
               radical elements in latin america
               for more than twenty years and
               have linked him to numerous
               terrorist bombings, including the
               1983 downing of a peruvian
               airliner, which killed forty-two
               people, eleven of them
               americans... the head of the latin
               america indigenous people's

               i cannot speak for the wolf or his
               actions. i would only repeat that
               the leftist guerrillas in colombia
               are not terrorists but freedom
               fighters in a war being waged
               against them by the u.s. and
               colombian governments.
               governments who wish only to
               protect a system that lines the
               pockets of corrupt politicians and
               multi-national profiteers.
                      (jump cut)
               the deaths of the woman and little
               boy are regrettable, but your
               government inflicts them all the
               time. yugoslavia, iraq... you
               call it 'collateral damage'...
