402   ext. town house - roof/adjoining rooftops                      402

      this is where the woman was gardening, tending a rooftop
      flower bed. selena emerges, crushes plants as she runs
      to the next town house roof.

      gordy hits the roof behind her.


403   selena                                                         403

      as selena runs from rooftop to rooftop along the row of
      town houses, we see her warrior determination and
      discipline. she's thinking ahead and she never
      hesitates. her big problem is she's being pursued by an equally
      well-trained and determined firefighter. and
      he's not far back. one tumble, and he'll catch her.
      selena strains harder.


404   selena                                                         404

      vaults a gap.   moments later, gordy vaults it.

405   selena                                                         405

      finally runs out of roof. she looks down. a fire escape
      ladder leads down to an interior, ground-level courtyard
      of a small foreign embassy. still holding the crowbar,
      selena takes the ladder down.

                                                              128.

405a   moments later                                                 405a

       gordy reaches the ladder. selena's ahead of him by a
       floor, hurrying down two rungs at a time. gordy doesn't
       fuck with the rungs. just swings over the edge of the
       roof, grabs the side-rails lightly with his hands,
       squeezes the rails with the insides of his boots and lets
       gravity take over.
