169   int. gordy and armstrong's cell                                       169

      there's fire and smoke everywhere. gordy picks up the
      metal bunk and slams it against a wall. slams it again.
      breaks the metal apart. then levers a long side rail in
      the cell door. he heaves. heaves again. the fire's
      licking at him, but gordy's undeterred. he heaves again,
      and...

      this time, the door gives. gordy picks up armstrong's
      cap, then picks up armstrong, who's starting to come
      around. puts armstrong over his shoulders in a fireman's
      carry.

                                    gordy
                   don't breathe.

                                 armstrong
                          (weakly)
                   you're not running through the
                   fire, eh?

                                 gordy
                   close your mouth.

      because running through the fire is just what gordy's
      gonna do. as he disappears into the flames...
