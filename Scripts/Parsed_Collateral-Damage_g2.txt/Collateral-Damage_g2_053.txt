123   ext. ferry - day                                                123

      the ferry's the only means of travel south, and it's
      packed. gordy picks his way through. the only other
      gringo on the boat is a geek in a plaid shirt and gimme
      hat that says "deerborn." the geek, philip armstrong,
      looks like a talker, and gordy tries to avoid eye
      contact. he's too late.

                                 armstrong
                   hey, yo, dude, here's a seat, man!

                                 gordy
                   no, that's okay --

      but armstrong's already throwing a bag off the bench.

                                 armstrong
                   i was hoping for someone i could
                   communicate with.

      he sees gordy hasn't moved.

                                 armstrong
                   only room's at the back near the
                   bano, and i'd advise against it,
                   unless you like poop.

      beat.   gordy sits.   immediately --

                                 armstrong
                   philip armstrong. assiniboia,
                   sasketchewan, canada.
                          (indicates his hat)
                   deerborn heavy equipment.

                                 gordy
                   ... gordy pitt.

                                 armstrong
                   hey, howya doing? i love germany.

                                                        (continued)

                                                               50.

123   continued:                                                     123

                                  gordy
                   austria.   american now.

                                  armstrong
                   i love america. never been to
                   austria. where from in america
                   would that be?

                                    gordy
                   new york city.

                                 armstrong
                   i don't like new york city.
                   buildings're too big. what kinda
                   work you in?

                                 gordy
                          (hesitates, then)
                   coffee. i buy beans.

                                 armstrong
                   can't drink caffeine. makes my
                   stomach do the rumba. i like that
                   commercial guy with the sombrero
                   and the mule, though. headed
                   upstream, eh? where to?

                                    gordy
                   caguan.

                                 armstrong
                   ... you've never been to caguan,
                   eh?

                                 gordy
                   how do you know?

                                 armstrong
                   'cause no one in their right mind
                   would ever go back. caguan's in
                   the guerrilla zone run by the
                   e.l.c. e.l.c. as in 'extra
                   loathsome communists.' they don't
                   care, and they kill. i'm going
                   there myself. but i have a 'get
                   outta jail free' card.

      armstrong doffs his cap, undoes a safety pin securing a
      card inside the crown. shows it to gordy. sotto --

                                                       (continued)

                                                            51.

123   continued:    (2)                                           123

                                 armstrong
                   e.l.c. travel pass. i can go
                   anywhere i want.
                          (by way of
                           explanation)
                   everyone needs equipment fixed.

      armstrong carefully returns the card to the hat. and now
      his voice takes on a noticeably more measured tone --

                                 armstrong
                   if you don't have one of these,
                   you don't want to be up there,
                   gordy.

      beat. gordy's contemplating the warning, when his eyes
      go to a small, sleepy boy standing nearby on the cramped
      deck, leaning against his father. gordy reaches over and
      taps the boy. the boy looks over. shrinks away at the
      sight of the large gringo. the father notices and looks
      at gordy, who stands, indicates his seat.

                                   gordy
                   por favor.

      the father's also apprehensive, doesn't move.

                                 gordy
                   con mucho gusto.

      finally, the father accepts, sits down with the sleepy
      boy on his lap. nods his thanks at gordy, who then gazes
      down at the son. a kid about matt's age. armstrong
      recognizes the look of a caring dad.

                                   armstrong
                   got kids, eh?

      off armstrong, as gordy walks away...
