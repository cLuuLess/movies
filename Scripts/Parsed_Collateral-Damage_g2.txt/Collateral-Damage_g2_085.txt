195   ext./int. land cruiser (caguan) - night                          195

      gordy follows the suburban as felix rambles --

                                 felix
                   ... i'll take her to a small
                   restaurant... we'll have lobster
                   and drink lots of wine... i'll get
                   her drunk... we'll drive home...
                   i'll carry her inside... i'll kiss
                   her... and then, i'll screw her in
                   my bed...

      the suburban pulls up next to a house.       there are armed
      guerrilla guards outside.

                                 felix
                   ... and when i am done screwing
                   her, she'll never want to look at
                   another man again...

      gordy drives past the house as the beaten man and the
      guerrilla with him get out of the suburban and start
      carrying the beer inside. and a moment later...

      felix comes around with a start.

                                 felix
                   what the fuck are you doing?!

      he unholsters the 9mm and points it at gordy.

                                 gordy
                   hey, easy... what's the problem?

                                                         (continued)

                                                                75.

195   continued:                                                      195

                                 felix
                   you're going the wrong goddamn
                   way!

                                 gordy
                   i am?... looks different in the
                   dark...

                                  felix
                   turn around!

      gordy turns the car around.     felix keeps the gun on him.

                                 felix
                   you drive where i say... or the
                   supervisor will have us both shot.

      gordy drives back. they approach the suburban and the
      house once more. this time it's on felix' side. felix
      gives the guerrilla guards a wave as they go by, and...

      gordy's eyes go to something he couldn't see coming the
      other way: a large propane tank next to the house.
