      it's pouring here, too. in b.g., assault preparations
      are underway in spite of the rain. brandt checks his
      watch. then lights another butt from the one he just
      smoked. stares off into the distance, his thoughts
      intense and far away. updegraf emerges, crosses.

                              updegraf
                the weather system's intensifying.

                               brandt
                        (distracted; beat)
                what?

                              updegraf
                the storm's gonna be real bad for
                at least twelve hours. here's the
                data.

      he hands a paper to brandt. cops a puff off brandt's
      cigarette while brandt reads.

                              updegraf
                air ops says it's too heavy for
                the blackhawks. also, sat-intel
                is saying the clouds're too thick,
                and we're blind.

                              brandt
                       (beat; pissed)
                got any good news?

                              updegraf
                yeah. the creeks are rivers
                around caguan. unless the wolf's
                a fish, he's not moving... and
                there's fresh coffee.

                              brandt
                only good thing down here... put
                everyone on red till tomorrow
                night. and then, i don't care if
                there's a typhoon, i want those
                fucking rotors turning.

      beat. updegraf goes. brandt crumples the fax and
      pitches it. then sees he got fax ink on his hands. off
      brandt, holding his mitts out in the rain, trying to wash
      off the stains...
