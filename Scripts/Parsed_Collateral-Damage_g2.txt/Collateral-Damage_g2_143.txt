      gordy and selena float side-by-side, still holding onto
      the cans. mauro's asleep on gordy's back, his arms
      around gordy's neck. weakened by her wound, selena keeps
      bobbing below the surface. gordy pulls her up.

                                 gordy
                   hang on. we just have to keep
                   floating a little bit more...

      suddenly, in the growing light, gordy sees selena's blood
      in the water and realizes she's wounded.

                                    gordy
                   you were shot.

                                    selena
                   ... i'm okay.

                                 gordy
                   we gotta get you outta the river.

      kicks them all to shore.

                                                            (continued)

      he climbs out of the river carrying mauro. as gordy
      ascends the bank, mauro wakes up, terrified. gordy
      tries to soothe him.

                                  gordy
                   esta bien.   esta bien.

      but mauro squirms free, and immediately, mauro runs back
      to his mother. selena uses sign language to tell him
      everything's okay. off gordy's surprised look --

                                 selena
                   he can't hear or speak.

      gordy just looks at them a moment. then moves to selena.
      re: mauro, as gordy examines her arm --

                                 selena
                   he's a war orphan. i adopted him.

      beat.   gordy finishes checking the bullet wound.

                                   gordy
                   you're lucky.

      he uses part of his shirt to make a pressure bandage.   as
      he ties it around selena's arm, she looks around.

                                  selena
                   i know where we are. there's a
                   secret trail nearby that leads
                   toward mompos.

                                   gordy
                   can you walk?

                                 selena
                   it's just my arm.

      gordy admires this woman's bravery. selena stands.
      mauro's clutching her skirt. gordy looks at him.

                                 gordy
                   how do you say 'hello'?

      selena looks at gordy a moment. she signs "hello" for
      him, her seashells clacking as she does it.

      gordy taps mauro to get his attention. tries out the sign
      for "hello." the boy just looks at him... then reaches
      out and takes gordy's hand, shows him the correct way to
      do it. gordy tries again. mauro nods "yes" and smiles.
      gordy smiles back.

                                                               111.
