142   ext. mompos street - night                                    142

      gordy makes his way along the main drag of the frontier
      town. a noisy, neon-lit strip of bars and brothels.
      everyone's packing a gun. a new dodge city, where death
      squad sicarios cruise past in 4x4's blaring salsa.
