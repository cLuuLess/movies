145   int. mompos jail - cell - night                                   145

      the jail might be old, but the cells are secure enough.
      they're also unsanitary and thoroughly unpleasant.

      gordy and armstrong are led in by the federales. the fat
      federale has armstrong's hat. he looks it over,
      wondering why gordy wanted it. then decides he could
      give a fuck and tosses it to armstrong. clangs the cell
      door shut and locks it. leaves shaking his head.

                                 fat federale
                 gringos...

      armstrong's still unsteady on his feet and sits down on
      the metal bunk.

                               armstrong
                 that stun gun wasn't cool.

      armstrong looks down at himself.

                               armstrong
                 haven't peed my pants in a real
                 long time.

                               gordy
                        (beat)
                 you shouldn't have helped me.

                               armstrong
                 yeah, well, i guess all these
                 assholes down here are just
                 starting on my nerves.

      gordy's silent.   it's over.   he's come up short.   he's
      going home.

                                armstrong
                 so what the hell did you do to
                 land us in here? and don't jerk
                 me around, eh?

      beat.   gordy sits.

                               gordy
                 the wolf killed my wife and son
                 in new york.

                                                      (continued)

                                                                59.

                                 armstrong
                   ... oh, you're that guy, eh? i'm
                   sorry, man... and what, you came
                   down here to even things out?

      gordy just looks at him.

                                 armstrong
                   did you even have a plan?

                                 gordy
                   yeah. go to caguan, find the wolf
                   and kill him.

      armstrong just shakes his head.    beat.


146   door to cell area                                               146

      bangs open. federales lead in two men -- the two
      guerrillas surprised earlier by the heavy-camouflaged
      infiltrators. the federales are armed with batons and
      stun guns, taking no chances. it's clear the rebels
      weren't brought here without a struggle, either -- both
      are cut and bruised. the tougher-looking of the two has
      taken a real beating. this beaten man is jammed face-
      first against the bars of gordy's cell. he makes eye
      contact with gordy while the other rebel is unbound and
      put into a cell. then the beaten man is shoved into the
      cell. a solid, brick wall separates them from gordy and
      armstrong. armstrong's seen the patches on their
      uniforms. to gordy, sotto --

                                 armstrong
                   e.l.c.

      beat. armstrong sees the look on gordy's face.      by way
      of a warning --

                                 armstrong
                   if you can't kill them, don't even
                   talk to them.

      the guerrillas are murmuring in the other cell. one of
      them laughs. off gordy, listening to the laughing...
