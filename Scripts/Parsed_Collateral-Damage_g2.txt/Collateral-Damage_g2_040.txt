88   ext. pan american highway (panama) - day                          88

     the highway terminates here, far short of colombia. the
     idea is to inhibit the northbound migration of people and
     drugs. from this point south lies the darien gap, a
     thick rain forest traversed only by rough trail.

     a cab with a panama city logo pulls up at road's end.
     gordy gets out with the panamanian cab driver. the cab
     driver indicates a panamanian man waiting there with a
     .9mm on his hip.

                                cab driver
                  my cousin, ever.

     ever and gordy exchange nods.

                                gordy
                  how far's colombia?

     the cab driver indicates distant mountains.

                                                         (continued)

                                                             38.

88   continued:                                                    88

                                cab driver
                  beyond those mountains... the
                  trail is very dangerous, but do
                  not worry, ever will get you
                  there... you can pay him then...
                  you can pay me now.

     gordy pulls out his wallet, pays the cabbie.

                                cab driver
                  gracias, senor.

     the driver gets back inside the cab.    out the window --

                                cab driver
                  que la vaya bien.

     he drives off. gordy looks to ever. ever smiles,
     motions him to follow, then turns south and starts
     walking. as gordy falls in behind...
