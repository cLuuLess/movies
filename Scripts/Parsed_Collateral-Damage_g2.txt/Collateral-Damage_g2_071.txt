      the town's in complete chaos.         there are fires
      everywhere.
                                                              (continued)

      still stunned and bleeding, brandt looks from where he
      lies on the ground as...

      gordy bursts out of the inferno carrying armstrong.
      they're singed and smoking, but they're alive. gordy
      drops armstrong, pats himself and armstrong down,
      knocking out the burning embers on their clothes and
      hair, when...

      gordy's eyes meet brandt's. the two men hold the look
      for a moment. if brandt could speak, he'd be yelling at
      gordy to stop, not to go on. and gordy knows it. but
      gordy's not stopping. picks up armstrong again and moves
      off toward the waterfront.
