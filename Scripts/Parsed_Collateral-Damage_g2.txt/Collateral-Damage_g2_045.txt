94   ext. parque nacional los katios (colombia) - day/night         94

     where the rain forest of darien continues in colombia.

     darkness sets in as gordy follows the trail downhill.    at
     night, the jungle's even noisier. when...

     everything goes quiet. gordy slows. and suddenly,
     automatic weapons begin to pop somewhere. not close, but
     not far, either. a few bursts, some single shots -- the
     call and response of an ambush -- and then silence. and
     then the nighttime jungle noises return.

     as gordy walks on...
