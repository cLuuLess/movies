98    ext./int. chiva - night                                        98

      one of the colorful, wretchedly overcrowded buses that
      ply colombia's back-country roads.

      as the chiva jolts and shudders over the dirt road, gordy
      sleeps. he's an object of some curiosity -- not only a
      gringo, but a virtual gulliver in comparison to the
      small-statured colombians pressed in around him.
