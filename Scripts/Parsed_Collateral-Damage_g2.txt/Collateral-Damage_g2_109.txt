231   ext. guerrilla house - night                                 231

      the suburban pulls up to the well-guarded house gordy saw
      the night before. the men get out and go inside, leaving
      the suburban running, clearly planning to leave again
      right away.

                                                               86.

232   gordy                                                          232

      carefully lowers himself to the ground. slides out on
      the side away from the house. hides behind a large
      wheel. the brightly-lit house is surrounded by coconut
      trees. gordy watches the guards. when the guards aren't
      looking, he runs to the nearest tree. the sounds of the
      suburban's engine covers his footsteps.


233   trees                                                          233

      gordy moves from tree to tree when the guards aren't
      looking, when he reaches one tree, and...


234   new angle                                                      234

      thunk!   a coconut hits the ground next to him, and...

      one of the guards comes to investigate.

      the guard gets closer. gordy inches around the tree. he
      can't get away without being seen. he nudges the coconut
      with his toe. nudges it harder, causing it slowly to
      roll away, and...

      the guard picks it up. never sees gordy in the shadow of
      the tree, pressed against the trunk. the guard shows the
      coconut to a guard near the house, then walks back.


235   gordy                                                          235

      sneaks to another tree. then reaches the house. he
      moves to a window. peers into a room. no one's there.
      but we hear the sound of voices. gordy creeps along the
      wall. looks into another room, and...


236   inside                                                         236

      is a group of elc guerrillas, including the beaten man,
      packing suitcases, etc. leaving in a hurry.


237   gordy                                                          237

      scans the faces. except for the beaten man, no face is
      familiar. a man with his back to us stands, and there's
      nothing familiar about him, either. when...


238   another angle                                                  238

      directly in front of us, another man emerges from a room.
      he's also in elc guerrilla camo.

      off gordy, looking intently at the man.

      in the room.    his face looms larger as he advances
      towards us.

      in the room.    it's the same face.


243   back to gordy                                                243

      he's found the wolf, when...

      suddenly, a guard appears, and...

      gordy freezes. eases into the shadows. his dirty face
      and clothes blend in just enough. the guard moves past.


244   another angle                                                244

      when the coast is clear, gordy moves to the large propane
      tank. he takes out the grenade. puts the rubber bands
      around it, spoon and all. grips the grenade in his hand,
      holding the spoon down, and yanks the pin. and then...

      slowly, slowly, gordy begins releasing his grip, allowing
      the rubber bands to take on the pressure of the spring-
      loaded spoon. if they'll do it... if the spoon goes now,
      gordy's going up in the blast.

      gordy continues to relax his grip. the rubber bands
      stretch. stretch more. keep stretching until they're
      barely holding the spoon... but they're holding it.

      gordy quickly, carefully wires the grenade to the propane
      tank. then takes out the zippo, pulls it apart and
      removes the lighter fluid-soaked cotton. holds the
      cotton just above the grenade and squeezes with his
      fingers. and...
                                                    (continued)

                                                               88.

      lighter fluid drops onto the rubber bands.    gordy
      squeezes out as much as he can onto them.

      then gordy gets the hell out of there.   he finds cover.
      ducks down. and waits.

      the lighter fluid is dissolving the rubber bands.

      gordy suddenly hears a woman's gentle singing.    he looks
      in the direction of the sound, and...

      gordy sees the attractive woman and the boy approaching
      on the road. she's singing a gentle song in spanish.

      gordy's eyes flash with alarm.   he glances at the house.

      the lighter fluid continues dissolving the rubber bands,
      which are now beginning to lose their elasticity and
      stretch from the pressure of the spoon.


248   back to scene                                                  248

      gordy looks back at the woman and boy, closer now,
      walking toward the house.

      gordy bursts from his hiding place.

                                    gordy
                   no!    stop!   alto!

      the woman and boy look over in alarm, see gordy running
      toward them and yelling.

                                    gordy
                   get back!

      the woman sees gordy.       screams toward the house --

                                    woman
                   claudio!!

      see gordy running.       they open fire.


256   men                                                              256

      stop firing.       gordy's too close to the woman and boy now.


258   gordy                                                            258

      ka-boom! a gigantic explosion lights up the night and
      utterly destroys the house.

                                                               90.

      rains down for what seems like forever.    dust fills the
      air.


261   gordy                                                          261

      opens his eyes. gets to his hands and knees.     sees the
      woman and boy are safe, when...

      a vicious kick in the ribs lifts gordy off the ground,
      rolling him away from the woman and child.

                               the wolf
                you bastard!

      the wolf's alive and unhurt.     angrily punts gordy again.

                              the wolf
                you think you can kill the wolf?!

      a boot in the face this time.

                              the wolf
                you think you can kill the wolf?!

      a piece of paper has fallen from one of gordy's pockets
      and fluttered to the ground nearby. the woman picks it
      up, and we see...

      it's the photo of anne and matt.

      the woman stares at the photo a moment, as...

      gordy absorbs another blow.    he tries to stand.

                              gordy
                you killed my wife and son --

      whack! the wolf slams the butt of an ak-47 against
      gordy's skull. gordy drops hard. the wolf reverses the
      ak. points it at gordy's head, about to pull the
      trigger, when...

      the woman lays a hand on the wolf's arm.

                               woman
                claudio.

      the wolf doesn't take his eyes off gordy.    the woman
      squeezes his arm. implores him --

                               woman
                claudio.

      the wolf glances over. meets her eyes a moment. sees
      the photo in her hand. glances up into her eyes again.
      they hold the look. a whole conversation exchanged
      without words. then the wolf turns back to gordy, lying
      in a pile on the ground. beat. to gordy --

                                 the wolf
                   you were just saved by your
                   guardian angel.
