      felix is right there supervising for himself as gordy
      finishes working. gordy stands. he stares hopefully at
      the machine. then pushes the starter, and... vrroom!
      the heat lights in the second row of sheds brighten.

      gordy turns to felix.

                                 gordy
                   that make you happy?

      no response.

                                 gordy
                   where's my money?

                                 felix
                   you'll get it in the morning.

                                                               82.
