187   int./ext. land cruiser (caguan) - various shots - day               187

      felix is driving. again, gordy uses the opportunity to
      look for the wolf. it's a long-shot, and he knows it.
      but it's all he can do.


188   empty storefront                                                    188

      they pass an empty storefront. a sign on the large,
      front plate glass window says "cine" and "sabado."


189   bar                                                                 189

      they pass a bar. felix watches it go by with something
      like a look of desire. gordy registers the look and the
      connection to the bar.
