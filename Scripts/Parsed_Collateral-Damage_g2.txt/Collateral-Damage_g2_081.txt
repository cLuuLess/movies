                                 felix
                   let's get moving.

                                 gordy
                   i'm thirsty. how about you?   want
                   to get something to drink?

      felix pauses. we see the look of desire again. gordy's
      definitely struck a chord. but felix quickly stifles it.

                                 felix
                   we have to get back.

                                 gordy
                   i've been working all day out in
                   the sun. i need a drink... nice
                   cold beer? how about it? i saw a
                   bar in town.

      felix really wants to, but still hesitates.

                                 gordy
                   with the spare parts, i'll have
                   the generators running in two
                   hours... we have time for a
                   couple beers.

      beat.   finally --

                                  felix
                   okay.   just a beer. maybe two.
