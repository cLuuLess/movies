340   ext. union station - day                                       340

      a man sits on a bench. he's wearing sunglasses and a
      baseball cap. he puts a shoulder bag on the bench, takes
      something out, then gets up and walks away, when...

      suddenly, two tourists and a hot dog vendor are right on
      him. one of 'em jams a concealed gun jammed into his
      ribs, while the other two hustle him forcefully to a van.
      he's shoved inside. his bag's tossed in. the van drives
      away.
