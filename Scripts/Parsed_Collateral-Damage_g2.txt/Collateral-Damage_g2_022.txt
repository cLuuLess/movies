36   intense flash                                                  36

     suddenly lights up the intersection.

     in slow motion:


37   shock wave                                                     37

     wave rolls up 68th past madison...


38   huge ball of flame                                             38

     erupts behind anne and matt...

     we hear the enormous bang of the explosion...

                                                             12.

39   windows                                                       39

     are sucked into millions of fragments, a hailstorm of
     glass...


40   great chunk of metal                                          40

     -- an engine block -- flies from the ball of flame...


41   anne                                                          41

     instinctively pulls her child to her...


42   gordy                                                         42

     sees the engine block tumbling through the air toward his
     wife and son.

     his scream is lost in the thunderous roar all around.


43   gordy's pov - in slow motion                                  43

     the engine block is about to hit anne and matt, when...

     a fedex truck, windows shattered, skids past, wiping out
     gordy's line of sight. when the truck clears...

     anne and matt are gone. the corner's empty.   just matt's
     spaceship, slowly falling to the ground...


44   back to scene                                                 44

     there's a horrible screech. a taxi skids sideways to
     avoid the fedex truck and hits gordy. he's in the air,
     tumbling, then smacks to the ground.

     gordy looks up, through the smoke and falling debris.
     then struggles to his hands and knees.

                             gordy
               anne!

     he tries to stand, then falls down, screaming in pain, a
     large shard of glass embedded in his leg.

     people come to help him, but gordy only cares about
     finding anne and matt. he looks around desperately but
     can't see them, when...

     his eyes go to the spaceship, in pieces on the pavement.

                                                   (continued)

44   continued:                                                     44

     gordy screams out his agony --

                                gordy
                  noooooo!!!
