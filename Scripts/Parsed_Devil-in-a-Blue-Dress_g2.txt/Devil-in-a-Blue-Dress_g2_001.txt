1   int. champion aircraft - benny giacomo's office                1

    a battered wooden desk drawer groans open and light brown
    skinned hands with dirty fingernails twist the cap off a
    pint of rye whiskey and pour liquor into a coffee cup.

                             o.s. voice
                you know, when you fire somebody
                you have to stick to your guns.

    they screw the cap back on and lay the bottle in the drawer.

                             o.s. voice
                      (continuing)
                the men might get to thinkin' that
                i'm weak if i take you back.

    the cup rises to the face of benny giacomo, late forties,
    with salt and pepper hair that was once jet black. skin
    darker than a louisiana creole.

    he takes a sip and bares his teeth in a grimace from the
    whiskey. as he talks we gradually see more of him -- feet
    kicked up on the desk, fully in charge.

    a betty grable like pin-up girl is giving us background in
    more ways than one in a swimsuit and high heels on a
    calendar tacked to the wall: may, 1948.

                             benny
                      (continuing)
                and i didn't tell dupree that i'd
                give you your job back... all i
                said was that i'd be glad to talk
                to you if you said the right
                thing... do you have something to
                say?

    a stream of cigarette smoke snakes through as the back of a
    man's head and shoulder nudges in and shifts nervously.

                             man
                mr. giacomo, when one of the white
                guys has come off a double shift
                and says he's too tired to work
                overtime, you don't fire him.

                             benny
                fella, what'd i tell ya? if you're
                not willing to give a little extra,
                champion can't use you.

    easy rawlins, thirty, handsome and a much darker brown than
    giacomo, takes a drag off a chesterfield cigarette.

                                                                2.

    through the window behind him, a team of men pour over a
    partly assembled airplane, their voices echoing in the
    hangar that surrounds the office.

    benny measures out his words one at a time.

                              benny (o.s.)
                 now... do... you... have...
                 something... to say?

    easy swallows his frustration in silence and thinks about
    swallowing his pride as well. and then:

                              easy
                 i want my job back, mr. giacomo. i
                 need to work and i need a good job.

                                benny (o.s.)
                 is that all?

    easy looks down into the smoke and sits up straight to keep
    from bowing his head.

                              easy
                 no, that's not all... i need money
                 so that i can pay my mortgage and
                 eat... i need a house to live in
                 and a place to raise children... i
                 need to buy clothes so i can--

                              benny
                 i'm sorry, fella, but i gotta get
                 back to work...

    and he swings his feet down and stands up to go.   but easy
    is up too, blocking his way out the door.

                              easy
                 ezekiel, mr. giacomo.

                                benny
                 hunh?

                              easy
                 my name is ezekiel... ezekiel
                 rawlins.

    benny clinches his fists and focuses on easy's chest like a
    fighter. and easy rocks back on one foot ready to score a
    field goal with his right knee.

    slowly, giacomo's face creases into a plastic grin and he
    shrugs.

                                                                3.

                              benny
                 s'cuse me, ezekiel.

    and he walks around easy, shaking his head as if amused.

    easy watches him go as the low moan of the baritone sax from
    duke ellington's "absinthe" snakes up like sin and we

2   fade to black                                                    2

    and watch the titles, the last one reading "two weeks
    later"...

    fade in:
