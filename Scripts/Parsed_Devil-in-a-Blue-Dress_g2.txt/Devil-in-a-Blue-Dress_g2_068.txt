106   int. kitchen - coretta's house                                 106

      joppy points a finger in coretta's face, backing her against
      the counter. she grabs a knife from a rack of dishes left
      out to dry.

                                daphne (v.o.)
                   joppy said she pulled a knife and
                   tried to dump hot water on him...

      she swipes at joppy and he backhands her against the
      stove... she struggles to grab a pot of boiling water, but
      he wrests it from her and slings her across the room against
      the counter, her head striking the tile on the way down.

      daphne looks down at her hands.

      she stubs out her cigarette and sits on the bed.

                                daphne
                   god, i didn't mean to hurt
                   anybody... it's just that with the
                   pictures i can--

                               easy
                   what? marry carter?   be white
                   again?

                                daphne
                   don't judge me, easy! do you think
                   i like pretending that i'm someone
                   else? do you know how i've been
                   treated by people, colored and
                   white, when i've tried to live as a
                   colored woman in a colored
                   community. do you have any idea
                   what any colored man whose ever
                   been with me has had to go through?
                   don't you dare judge me!

      she sees easy hesitate and she stands up.

                                daphne
                         (continuing)
                   come on, easy. help me.

                                                              98.

107   continued:                                                     107

      she moves in close, caressing.

                                daphne
                         (continuing)
                   come on, you know it's the right
                   thing to do... you know if things
                   were different what would happen
                   between us.

                                easy
                   i'll tell you what can happen
                   between us. you get carter to
                   clear me up from all this and you
                   can have your pictures. that's all
                   that could have ever happened
                   between us.

                                 daphne
                         (genuinely hurt)
                   sure, baby. of course,
                   sweetheart...

      the sound of the front door pushing open startles them, and
      albright knocks on his way in.

                                albright
                   well i'll be damned. you found
                   her.

      and manny and shariff step in, too, carrying baseball bats.

                                easy
                   wait a minute, albright.

      daphne breaks for the back way and easy tries to bar shariff
      from going after her.

                                easy
                   hey!

      manny swings the baseball bat into easy's side. and easy
      yells and plows into him, wrestling him against the wall.

      albright grabs easy from behind and pries him free enough
      for manny to uppercut him to the chin with the fat end of
      the bat.

      easy sinks to his knees seeing double.

      shariff leads daphne back into the room, her face contorted
      into tears, her arm twisted up behind her in a hammerlock.

                                                              99.

107   continued:   (2)                                               107

                                albright
                         (to daphne)
                   where are the pictures?

                                 daphne
                         (terrified)
                   i don't know.

      smack!   he backhands her.

      easy grabs for the wall to get to his feet and manny swings
      the bat down into his kidney.

                                albright
                   where are they?

                                daphne
                         (indicating easy)
                   i wouldn't tell him! and i won't
                   tell you!

                                albright
                   sure you will.
                         (to shariff)
                   let's go.

      shariff leads daphne outside and manny draws his forty-five
      automatic and trains it on easy, cocking the hammer.

                                albright
                   what're you doin'? who are we
                   gonna give 'em to cover this shit,
                   hunh?... use your head.

      he shoves manny through the door and pushes easy onto his
      side with his foot and he's out the door.

      easy strains to get back to his knees as car doors slam and
      the sound of a car engine growls to life.

      he thrusts himself up from the floor and stumbles toward the
      front door like a boxer who should have stayed down for the
      count. he gets it open in time to see...
