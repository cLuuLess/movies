35    ext. malibu pier - night                                       35

      easy walks past the hamburger stand and on to the railing
      that looks out over the ocean.

                                 o.s. voice
                   hi.

      he spins around and sees a chubby 17-year-old white girl in
      a tight-fitting skirt.

      he nods respectfully and turns away to look out at the
      water, hoping she'll leave.

                                girl
                   it's pretty out here, huh?

                                 easy
                   yeah.   it's all right.

                                 girl
                   i'm from des moines in iowa.    where
                   are you from?

                                easy
                         (without looking back)
                   huh?... uh... texas...

                                girl
                   do they have an ocean in texas?

                                easy
                   the gulf, they have the gulf.

      she leans on the rail next to easy and he glances over his
      shoulder, seeing a couple of the young men looking around
      like they've lost someone.

                                easy
                   i think they're looking for you.

                                barbara
                   who cares? my sister brought me
                   'cause my parents made her. all
                   she wants to do is make out with
                   herman and smoke cigarettes.

                                 pimply-faced boy
                   hey, you!   what are you doing?

      the five-foot-six-inch twenty-year-old charges straight up
      to easy.

                                                                31.

35   continued:                                                       35

                                barbara
                        (yelling)
                  leave him alone, herman!   we were
                  just talking!

                                herman
                  you were, huh?
                         (to easy)
                  we don't need you talking to our
                  women.

     easy braces himself as five of herman's friends rush over,
     including one built like a football player.

                                football
                  hey!   what's wrong?

                               herman
                  nigger's trying to pick up barbara.

                               barbara
                  leave him alone! we were just
                  talking about the ocean!

                                barbara's sister
                  barbara!

     football gets right in easy's face.

                               football
                  hey, fella, what's wrong with you?

     a couple of the other boys have picked up sticks and are
     surrounding easy against the rail.

                               easy
                  i don't want no trouble.

                               football
                  you already got trouble, boy.

                               easy
                  listen... i was just being polite.

                               herman
                  no, you weren't. you were talkin'
                  about the ocean!

                                o.s. voice
                  excuse me.

     easy sees albright's panama hat appear behind football.

                                                                32.

35   continued:   (2)                                                 35

                               football
                  what do you want?

     and he whirls around to albright's smiling face, just in
     time to see him pull that rifle-like pistol from inside his
     coat, leveling it at his eyes.

                               albright
                  i want to see brains.    i want you
                  to die for me.

     albright cocks the hammer. it sounds like a bone breaking,
     and barbara starts crying in her sister's arms.

                               football
                        (quickly)
                  i'm sorry, sir.

     easy nods but albright is not satisfied.

                               albright
                  the question is: "are you sorry
                  enough?"

                               football
                  yessir.

                               albright
                  then prove it... show him... get
                  down on your knees and suck his
                  peter.

     football starts crying.

                               easy
                        (to albright)
                  i think he got the point--

                                albright
                        (to football)
                  you heard me.

     he presses the barrel to the boy's forehead and football
     goes down to his knees. the other young men look on in
     horror.

                               albright
                  son of a gun. you were gonna do
                  it, weren't you?

     thunk! he slaps the barrel of the pistol into the side of
     the boy's head. football screams and the others scatter.

                                                                33.

35   continued:   (3)                                                 35

                               albright
                  sick bastard.

     thunk!   he smacks him again, and blood is everywhere.

                               albright
                  get out of here. you call the
                  cops, i'll kill ya!

     football manages to stagger to his feet and stumbles away
     into the darkness back out toward the parking lot.

36   albright wipes his gun with a handkerchief and slides it         36
     back into the holster.

                               albright
                  i don't think they'd dare call the
                  cops.
                        (giggles)
                  but it'll cost me a few bucks if
                  they do.

     he claps easy on the back as if it's all been in fun and
     giggles like a kid on his way toward the hamburger stand.

     easy looks at him numbly and tags alongside, clutching his
     anger in tightly clenched jaws.

                               albright
                  what you got, easy?

                               easy
                  you sure no harm is gonna come to
                  that woman 'cause of me?

     albright doesn't break stride.

                               albright
                  course not. mr. carter wants to
                  buy her a gold ring and live
                  happily ever after -- what do ya
                  got?

     easy exhales, feeling trapped, but he's come this far...

                               easy
                  woman told me she's with a man
                  named frank green.

     albright stops; the charm gone, he's all business.

                               albright
                  where?

                                                             34.

36   continued:                                                    36

                               easy
                  he's got an apartment at the skyler
                  arms on skyler and eighty-third.

     albright scribbles it down on a note pad.

                               albright
                  anything else?

                               easy
                  frank's a gangster. a hijacker...
                  liquor and cigarettes. he's real
                  good with a knife.

     albright is unable to suppress a smile.

                               albright
                  ever seen him in action?

                                easy
                  naw.   i just heard about him.

     albright, still grinning, pulls out the brown "secretary"
     and counts out more bills.

                               albright
                  here's another hundred.

     he shoves the money into easy's hand.

                               albright
                  buy ya a burger, easy?

     he starts into the screen door of the hamburger stand but
     easy declines.

                               easy
                  no thanks, mr. albright.

                               albright
                  how come you let those boys get
                  around you like that? war hero
                  should have been able to pick 'em
                  off one by one before they got you
                  against the rail.

                               easy
                  i don't kill children.

     for some reason this is hilarious to albright. he throws
     his head back and wheezes out an almost silent belly laugh,
     then winds down.

                                                                35.

36   continued:   (2)                                                 36

                                 albright
                  take it easy.

     he disappears into the hamburger joint and easy walks away
     back toward his car.
