44   int. easy's house - bedroom                                     44

     the room is a mess; trousers strewn here, shirt and shoes
     over there. and from the corners are haunting, ghostly
     whispers.

                               coretta's voice
                  you be sorry if you go...
                        (heavy breathing)
                  i can't give up that much love,
                  daddy, not the way things is.

     a pint of bourbon, 3/4 full, sits atop the cherry wood
     nightstand. another empty bottle lies next to it on its
     side, in front of a water glass with 1/2 inch of liquor at
     the bottom.

     easy's head rests on a pillow on the bed behind it,
     sweating, tossing and turning as the ghost gets louder.

                               coretta's voice
                  oh yeah, daddy. you hittin' my
                  spot... oh yeah... oh yeah...

     the voice of the ghost is reaching closer for his ear.

                               coretta's voice
                  oh, that's just too good, easy.   oh
                  daddy... oh yeah...

     the voice is right up in his face.

                              coretta's voice
                  oh, baby. oh, daddy, yeah... oh
                  yeah!! oh yea-a-h!!

                                                              45.

     scream. he jerks up, awake, and the phone is ringing.    it
     jingles a couple more times and easy almost knocks the
     receiver out of its cradle reaching for it.

                                 easy
                  huh?

                               voice
                        (a woman's)
                  hello? is this mr. rawlins?

                                 easy
                  who is this?

                               voice
                  daphne... daphne monet...

     he sits straight up.

                               daphne
                  you're looking for me.

     a pause on the line.

                               daphne
                  i think you should come and talk to
                  me, mr. rawlins... alone.

                               easy
                  look, it's late--

                               daphne
                  mr. rawlins, coretta has been
                  killed...

     another pause.

                               daphne
                  and if you don't want any trouble
                  from the police then you'll come...
                  and you won't tell anyone that
                  you're coming.

                               easy
                  now wait a minute, daphne. i don't
                  know nothin' about all this
                  stuff...

                               daphne
                  i'm at the sunridge motel on 112th
                  and grand, room 102.

                                                                46.

44   continued:   (2)                                                 44

     easy holds his hands up, helplessly -- "what do you want
     from me?" -- but no one can see and she has hung up the
     phone.
