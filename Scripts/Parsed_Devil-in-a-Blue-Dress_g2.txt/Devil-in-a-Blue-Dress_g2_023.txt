28   ext. easy's house - day                                       28

     easy waters his lawn in deep thought.

                               easy (v.o.)
                  the letter from mouse was worrying
                  me in more ways than one... all i
                  had to do was call albright to earn
                  the hundred dollars i already had
                  in my pocket... but the last time i
                  got money that easy i got it from
                  mouse -- fifty dollars -- and the
                  next day i had to join the army to
                  leave town.
