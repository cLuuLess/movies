29   int. stolen car - night                                       29

     a younger easy is driving, his hair greased up high in a
     pompadour with a pencil line moustache framing his top lip.

     a man in a wide brim homburg hat looks away out the
     passenger window.

                               man
                  drive to the trainyard, easy!
                  let's dump this damn thing.

                               easy
                        (suddenly alarmed)
                  this ain't your friend's car?
                  what'd you do mouse?

                               mouse
                        (still looking away)
                  just drive this sumbitch!

     the drone of the engine takes us

30   back to scene                                                 30

     a truck with a whole family's belongings tied down onto a
     flatbed rolls up. a woman and a bunch of kids fill up the
     cab.

                               woman
                  bye, easy!

                                                                28.

30   continued:                                                       30

                                easy
                   where you goin', sophie?

                                woman
                   back to texas... it's too fast for
                   me out here.

     she waves and keeps on trucking.

     he watches her wistfully and then catches sight of

     the woodcutter across the street in a neighbor's front yard,
     axe in hand, about to swing on a lemon tree.

                                easy
                   get away from there!

     he picks up a rock and throws it, and then chucks another
     sending the scruffy vagabond wheeling his barrow off down
     the street.

     easy shuts off the water and walks back up on his porch.    he
     picks up a glass of lemonade that sits at the foot of a
     chair on top of

     a newspaper

     a front page heading reads "carter's withdrawal leaves teran
     on top." below it

     a photograph of a smiling matthew teran, with lips too thick
     for a white man, getting out of a limousine.

31   o.s. the phone is ringing.    it's                               31

     later - night

     easy is asleep on the porch. finally, he wakes up to the
     ringing and heads into the house.
