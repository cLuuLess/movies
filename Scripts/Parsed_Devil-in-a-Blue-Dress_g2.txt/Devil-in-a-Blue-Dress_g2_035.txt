     the limousine stops and easy pushes the door open and gets
     out.

                               teran
                  mr. rawlins, may i offer you cab
                  fare?

     teran's stubby fingers hold out crumpled bills.

                               easy
                  no thanks.

     easy closes the door and watches the long cadillac glide
     away.

                  there had been nights during the
                  war that i still had trouble
                  claiming as part of my life...
                  insane nights i wasn't sure ever
                  really happened. and here i was
                  again... had i really just gotten
                  out of a rich man's car who was
                  runnin' for mayor?.. running
                  against the man i was supposed to
                  be working for... was he really
                  lookin' for the same woman i was
                  trying to find? my ear was killin'
                  me and the buses had stopped
                  running. and i was feeling sick...
                  sick from wondering if i had really
                  hard that coretta was dead.
