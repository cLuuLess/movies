20    int. john's speakeasy                                          20

      easy looks around to see couples trying to dance; finding
      themselves wrestling between tables packed with five and six
      people each.

      he heads for the bar pointing a finger at a man in a black
      silk shirt and a foot-high pompadour hairdo.

                                easy
                   alphonso jenkins!

      alphonso flashes pearls.

                                 alphonso
                   hey, easy!

                                easy
                   hey, man, you seen a girl named
                   dahlia or somethin'... white girl
                   supposed to be somethin' to look
                   at.

                                                                19.

                                alphonso
                   naw, but if i see her i'm gonna
                   keep her to myself.

     easy claps him on the shoulder and waves at skinny rita cook
     who is sitting at a table with five men.

                                 rita
                   hey, baby.

                                easy
                   hey, rita!
                         (under his breath)
                   what do they see in you?

     finally, easy spots a fifty-year-old man in an old grey
     tweed jacket sitting in a corner at a table by himself.
     looking like the god fearing, all fearing baptist deacon
     that he is -- he is as out of place as a whore in church as
     he nervously gazes about the room and massacres a plate of
     barbecued ribs.

     easy leans over the counter to the bartender.

                                easy
                   hey, lewis. gimme a couple glasses
                   and a pail of ice and send a quart
                   of bourbon over there to odell's
                   table.

     lewis scoops up ice into a small bucket and plops it onto
     the bar with two short glasses.

     easy lays a dollar on the counter and carries the set up
     over to the corner as he watches...

     the band

     burn it up.

     back to scene

     easy stops at odell's table.

                                 easy
                   hey, odell.

                                 odell
                   easy.

                                easy
                   how's it going tonight?

     odell doesn't miss a bite as he scopes the crowd.

                                                             20.

20   continued:   (2)                                               20

                               odell
                        (slowly)
                  well... it's goin' alright.   it
                  sure is goin'.

                               o.s. voice
                  easy rawlins, is that you?

     easy looks up to see

     dupree, a big black man with a wide white grin in a white
     suite with blue pinstripes and a ten-gallon hat.

                               dupree
                  you ain't jumped outta no windows
                  yet?

                               easy
                  not yet, dupree.

                               dupree
                  miss you down at the plant... you
                  know coretta, don't ya?

     he has her in tow like a toy wagon and she offers a coy
     smile. short and roundish with cherry-brown skin, she leads
     with her bosom.

                               easy
                  hey, coretta, how are ya?

     coretta rests her sloe-eyes on easy and odell and the church
     going man almost chokes.

                               odell
                  oh, my goodness.

                               coretta
                  could we sit down with y'all?

                                  easy
                  sure.   sure.

     dupree and coretta settle in.

                               dupree
                  you know benny just wants you to
                  say you're sorry, easy. and he'll
                  give you your job back.

                               easy
                  i'm a sorry man, all right. any
                  man without his paycheck is sorry.

                                                                21.

20   continued:   (3)                                                 20

     dupree laughs, smacking the table so hard it rattles like an
     earthquake. and coretta's smile ignites like a slow fuse
     causing easy to feel it all the way down his spine.

     a man with his hair marcelled back swoops in and pulls a
     quart of old crow from his overcoat and sits it on the
     table.

     easy reaches for his wallet but dupree beats him to it.

                               dupree
                  i got it, easy. your money ain't
                  no good up in here.

                                 easy
                  naw, dupree.    this one's mine--

                                dupree
                  you sure?   you the one outta work.

     coretta frowns at dupree as easy counts out three dollars.

                               coretta
                  and you're the one ain't never got
                  no money.

                               dupree
                  aw, baby...
                        (to bootlegger)
                  get us another couple glasses.

     and he peels off a dollar and hands it off.

                               easy
                  either one of y'all seen a white
                  girl named dahlia or somethin' with
                  a 'd'?

     odell shakes his head "no," and coretta looks away as if
     insulted leaving silence until

                               dupree
                  hey, coretta got a new job at the
                  phone company.

     he squeezes his woman in close and coretta softens up and
     burns that smile again.

     easy grins and nods "congratulations."

21   the bottle                                                       21

     it's less than a quarter full now because it's three hours
     later.

                                                                22.

21   continued:                                                       21

     back to scene

     john's is only half full and the band is gone. the jukebox
     echoes lena horne's "prisoner of love" and dupree leans back
     in his chair, snoring -- mouth wide open.

     odell gets up and starts to amble off.

                               easy
                  hey, you goin' home, odell?

     concentrating totally on keeping his balance, odell waves
     feebly without looking back.

     easy is droopy-eyed from the booze but coretta just looks a
     little sexier. she straightens dupree's hat on his head and
     twists up her nose.

                               coretta
                  he used to play till the cock
                  crowed. but that ole cock don't
                  crow nearly so much now...

     she levels her perpetual "come on" onto easy and he nods
     sluggishly and lifts himself to his feet.

                               easy
                  think i'm gonna head out.

                               coretta
                  you be sorry if you go.

     she slides her hand inside her blouse and discreetly lifts
     her bodice to air her breasts.

                               easy
                  i think i'd be more sorry if i
                  stay...

     he turns to go.

                               coretta
                  daphne sleep by now. you can't get
                  none of that tonight.

     easy turns and coretta plays with the ice in her glass.

                               coretta
                  you been telling everybody dahlia,
                  but her name is daphne.

                               easy
                  you know her?

                                                             23.

21   continued:    (2)                                             21

     coretta leans back and fans her bosom.
