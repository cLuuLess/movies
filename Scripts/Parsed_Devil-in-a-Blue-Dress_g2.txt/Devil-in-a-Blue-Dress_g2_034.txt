42   int. limousine - night                                          42

     easy settles into the seat with his back to the driver.

     edith piaf's "parles moi d'amour" adds sugar to the strong
     smell of cologne and the portly form of matthew teran sits
     across from him with a small mexican boy in pajamas seated
     next to him holding a small elephant.

                               teran
                  i can see that the police roughed
                  you up a bit... that's a terrible
                  practice of theirs which has to
                  change, mr. rawlins... has to
                  change.

     he opens his gold cigarette case and offers easy a
     cigarette. easy accepts and teran lights them both up.

                               teran
                        (continuing)
                  she was beaten. and died from a
                  heavy blow to the back of the head,
                  mr. rawlins.

     easy begins to feel nauseous.

                               teran
                  the evening's events have caught my
                  adopted son and i quite off
                  guard... my household was asleep
                  when we got the call that the
                  police had a suspect in coretta
                  james' murder... did you know that
                  she was a friend of mine, mr.
                  rawlins!?

                               easy
                  no i didn't, mr. teran.

                                                             42.

42   continued:                                                    42

                               teran
                  oh, you know who i am?

                               easy
                  i read the papers.   you're runnin'
                  for mayor.

                               teran
                        (correcting)
                  i am the next mayor, mr. rawlins...
                  and luckily for you, a friend of
                  the negro... when i arrived at the
                  station i knew right off that you
                  were being improperly detained as
                  is coretta's boyfriend, dupree
                  brouchard. it's this sort of thing
                  that my administration will not
                  tolerate, mr. rawlins. absolutely
                  will not...

     he sits back in his seat self righteously and offers a nod
     of assurance and awaits easy's gratitude... then after a
     moment...

                               teran
                        (continuing)
                  yes... coretta answered phones for
                  a while in my campaign office on
                  103rd and western. in fact my
                  people got her a job in the phone
                  company. so when i heard what had
                  happened i got out of bed
                  immediately, personally because of
                  my concern... was anyone there with
                  you mr. rawlins besides mr. dupree
                  brouchard?... any... other friends
                  of coretta's?

                               easy
                  no, sir...

                               teran
                  no young lady perhaps?

                               easy
                  nobody...

                               teran
                  of course not, mr. rawlins. and
                  why should you tell a man whom
                  you've only just met. but, believe
                  me, mr. rawlins. you can trust me.

                                                                43.

42   continued:   (2)                                                 42

                               easy
                        (shrugging)
                  there was no one else.

     teran's face sags with disappointment and then...

                               teran
                  well don't worry, mr. rawlins... i
                  won't tolerate your being
                  harassed... you or any of my
                  constituency -- i was a city
                  councilman in the watts area for
                  two terms with a large contingent
                  of colored -- i value all of my
                  supporters equally... humble though
                  they may be -- where can we drop
                  you, mr. rawlins?

                               easy
                  you can let me out here.

                               teran
                  are you sure, mr. rawlins? this
                  must be quite out of your way.

                               easy
                  it's okay.

     the little boy stares up at easy through big, dark almond-
     shaped eyes in the silence that follows. and then, teran
     picks up the ivory horn that hangs next to his head.

                               teran
                  norman, pull the car over.
