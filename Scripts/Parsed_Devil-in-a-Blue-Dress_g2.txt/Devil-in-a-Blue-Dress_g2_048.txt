63   ext. battlefield - day                                         63

     dense black smoke masks everything but two vague figures in
     a struggle. the boom of heavy artillery gives way only to
     the deafening chatter of automatic fire.

     we are hurtling forward into a horror-stricken easy in
     combat gear, repeatedly stabbing an already lifeless german
     soldier. tears are streaming down easy's face, his mouth
     gaped open in an inaudible scream.

     he studies the glass and pushes it away.   then looks

                                                               59.

65    out the window                                                  65

      albright and his two goons get in the white caddy and cruise
      away.

66    bedroom                                                         66

      he dials the operator.

                               easy (v.o.)
                  i needed help... albright didn't
                  flinch at hearing that coretta was
                  dead and he seemed to know all
                  about richard mcgee too...

                               operator (o.s.)
                  number please...

                               easy
                  raymond alexander on...

      he pauses, speechless as

                                 operator (o.s.)
                  yes?

                               easy
                        (after a moment)
                  forget about it, operator.

      he hangs up, his eyes trained in thought.

a67   ext. joppy's bar - day                                         a67

      a crowd has gathered along the street to watch a three
      convertible car caravan: the first car bearing a four-place
      band playing "happy days are here again"; the second with
      someone who could be lana turner holding up a "teran for
      mayor" placard with a man in the front passenger seat
      announcing through a megaphone; and last, but hardly least,
      matthew teran blowing kisses and waving two small american
      flags.

      easy looks up for a moment as he closes the trunk of his car
      to watch the parade. then stuffs a ball peen hammer in the
      waistband at the small of his back, under his jacket.

      he walks with a purpose into the open door next to the
      butcher shop.

b67   int. joppy's bar                                               b67

      easy stops in the doorway, seeing

      joppy as usual buffing the marble top of his bar. t-bone
      walker's "they call it stormy monday" is on the jukebox.

                                                              60.

b67   continued:                                                    b67

      back to easy

      he scans the bar and sees that there are no customers, and
      walks in.

                                 joppy
                   hey, easy.

      easy stops at the bar and stares at joppy.

                                easy
                   that girl called me last night.

                                joppy
                   what girl is that?

                                easy
                   the one your friend is lookin' for.

                                 joppy
                   uh, huh.   that's pretty lucky,
                   hunh?

                                easy
                   no, joppy... wasn't no luck at all.
                   it was you.

      joppy inadvertently clenches his fists and notices easy's
      aggressive stance.

                                easy
                   you and coretta was the only ones
                   that had my phone number who knew i
                   was lookin' for her. and coretta
                   was busy scammin' daphne so she
                   wouldn't have done it... it was
                   you, man.

                                joppy
                   maybe she looked in the phone book.

                                easy
                   i ain't in the phone book, joppy...

      joppy's eyes narrow.

                                joppy
                   what the hell you mean, coming up
                   here all mad like you gonna do
                   something?!...

                                                              61.

b67   continued:   (2)                                              b67

                                easy
                         (yelling)
                   you damn right! coretta's dead!
                   your friend albright is on my ass.
                   the cops done brought me down once
                   -- why didn't you just tell
                   albright your damn self?

                                joppy
                         (yelling back)
                   what did i tell you? to just take
                   that man's money! i didn't tell
                   you to do nothin'! i call myself
                   trying to help you save your
                   house... don't come up in here
                   startin' no shit with me.

      and he pulls a baseball bat from behind the bar, but easy
      has pulled his hammer and smacks it down hard, cracking the
      beveled wood that frames the marble.

                                joppy
                         (continuing; panicked)
                   easy, wait! watch my marble! my
                   uncle left me that when he died!

                                easy
                   and goddammit, he's about to get it
                   back.

      he draws back for the downswing, and joppy drops the
      baseball bat, holding up his hands.

                                 joppy
                   let's talk.   let's just talk.

                                easy
                   what you got me into, joppy?!

      joppy inhales, forcing himself to be calm.

                                joppy
                   she asked me to help her 'cause i
                   told her that albright was lookin'
                   for her. and i figured i could
                   help you make a few bucks and throw
                   albright off the trail too. she
                   wanted to know something about you
                   so i told her... i guess i must've
                   give her your phone number...

                                easy
                   where is she, man?

                                                                62.

b67   continued:   (3)                                                b67

                                joppy
                   i don't know...

                                easy
                   don't lie to me, joppy!

                                joppy
                   i ain't lyin'... i don't even know
                   her that good. she just asked me
                   to help her. and she asked me not
                   to tell nobody... i guess 'cause of
                   her and frank green.

                                easy
                   what's she runnin' from joppy?

                                joppy
                   i swear i don't know. she didn't
                   tell me. i didn't mean to get you
                   into nothin', easy... i just... she
                   just... i mean you seen her,
                   easy... man, she's something else.

      easy can see "sucker" written all over joppy as he fumbles
      for a cigarette with one hand and shakes his head with
      disgust as he lights up.

                                easy
                   damn, joppy. is there any white
                   woman that ever gave you the time
                   of day that you wasn't a sucker
                   for?

      joppy frowns painfully and continues to wipe the bar.
