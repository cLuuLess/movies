      easy holds his kidney and lowers himself gingerly down the
      granite steps.

                                easy (v.o.)
                   i'd been thinking about daphne,
                   too... wondering if she meant what
                   she said about what could have
                   happened between us... but at the
                   moment i was wondering if there was
                   any such thing as a sprained chin.
                   but other than that and a headache,
                   a loose tooth and a kidney that a
                   doctor would need to look at, i
                   felt like five thousand, three
                   hundred dollars... and unless
                   albright was alive somewhere, that
                   feelin' was gonna last a while.

                                o.s. voice
                   hey, ezekiel.

      miller and mason are waiting outside their car at the curb.
      they come over.

                                miller
                   you got some mighty powerful
                   friends up there... mighty
                   powerful. but, see, we got a
                   problem.

      easy listens disinterestedly.

                                miller
                         (continuing)
                   with the chief sealing these things
                   up like this, it doesn't do much
                   for the morale of the men who've
                   been working on these cases.

                                 mason
                   yeah.   makes 'em feel like shit.

                                miller
                   there's a guy who's been callin' on
                   the phone. and we're pretty sure
                   that he was up there with mcgee.

                                 mason
                   a... uh... colored guy... sounds
                   kinda dumb...

                                miller
                         (correcting)
                   not very bright... but he said you
                   accused him of the murder. and he
                   swears you were up there, too...

                                mason
                   in fact, he's out and out pointing
                   the finger at ya.

                                miller
                   how about a name?

                                mason
                   he'd do it to you...

      easy waits to make sure they're finished, and...

                                easy
                   sorry, fellas. but i gotta go.

      he starts away.

                                                             116.

                                easy
                         (continuing)
                   why don't you go back to the
                   station and, uh... wait around for
                   my call.

                                mason
                   you son-of-a-bitch... you watch
                   yourself, you hear! don't you even
                   spit on the fucking sidewalk... i
                   better not even--

      mason's voice fades under.

                                easy (v.o.)
                   it might be the last moment of my
                   adult life spent free was walking
                   away from city hall.
