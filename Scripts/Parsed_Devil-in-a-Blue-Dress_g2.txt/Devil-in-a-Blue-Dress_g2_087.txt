      she gets in.

                                daphne
                   come on, easy. let's go.

      easy throws a look over at carter.

                                daphne
                         (continuing)
                   don't worry, you can give him the
                   pictures yourself.

      and she throws them down on the seat.

                                                             113.

131   omit                                                           131

132   easy fires up the engine and pulls away with daphne            132
      looking straight ahead.

                               easy
                  hey, i'm sorry.

      the slight twist of her head amounts to a shrug and then the
      tears flow. the sun is coming up over the city below...

                               easy (v.o.)
                  for the first time i felt that i
                  could fall in love with her, too...
                  i was even wondering if it was
                  starting to happen when i dropped
                  her off at 63rd and dinker where
                  her brother, frank, was waiting...
                  then it occurred to me that she
                  still had carter's money... and i
                  felt like a fool.
