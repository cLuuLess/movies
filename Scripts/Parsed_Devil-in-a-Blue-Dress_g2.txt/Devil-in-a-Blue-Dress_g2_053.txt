80   int. easy's house - living room                                 80

     easy slams to the floor but manages to roll out of the way
     of a lethal crack! of the board onto the floor.

     he grabs a lamp and hurls it at the oncoming figure who
     catches it on the arm and keeps on coming, snapping a blade
     from his fist which leaps out like a chrome-colored flame.

     easy scrambles back, his head butting up against the couch,
     his forehead streaming blood, his eyes wide with the sight
     of sure death advancing.

                               easy
                        (terrified)
                  frank! wait a minute!   i need to
                  talk to you!

     frank looms over him, his   sinister but handsome brown face
     framed by a short-rimmed,   black stetson hat and a black
     shirt and coat. he holds    the knife to easy's neck, letting the
     blade press into the skin   as he talks.

                               frank
                  you the reason why she told me to
                  lay low, hunh.

     easy buries himself back against the sofa.

                               easy
                        (machine gun quick)
                  naw. i got five hundred dollars
                  for you. rich man wants to talk to
                  a white girl you know. daphne...

     frank's eyes flame and he presses the knife, drawing blood.

                               frank
                  you a dead man--

     whap!   whap!   whap!

                                                             72.

80   continued:                                                     80

                               o.s. voice
                  easy, you in there?

     frank's head whips toward the door and easy knocks the knife
     away and comes up tussling.

     frank scrambles to get away and easy tackles him, straining
     to keep frank from reaching the knife.

     the front door springs open and spats on patent leather
     shoes clump in, the last one stomping down on frank's
     outstretched fingers. frank screams and cradles his hand in
     agony.

     easy scrambles up to his knees and gawks up at

     mouse, dressed in a plaid zoot suit with broadway suspenders
     down the front of his shirt, a long-barreled .41 caliber
     pistol held loosely in his hand.

                               mouse
                  want me to kill him?

                               easy
                        (exhaling relief)
                  mouse! aw, man naw, it's all
                  right...

                               mouse
                  well, what's happenin'?

     he holds out his hand and helps easy to his feet.

     frank makes a slight move towards the knife and mouse levels
     the pistol at his head, his gold-rimmed teeth glittering
     from a smile that wants frank to go for it.

                               mouse
                  i'll blow your goddamned nose
                  off...

                               easy
                  no, don't!
                        (to frank)
                  where's daphne monet?

     frank just stares up at easy, his eyes sharp and defiant.

                               easy
                  look, if you don't know where she
                  is, maybe we can help each other
                  find her.

     after a moment, mouse cocks the hammer.

                                                                73.

80   continued:   (2)                                                 80

                               mouse
                  nigga, you heard him.

                                 easy
                  no, mouse.    don't kill him.

     the phone rings next to mouse and he picks it up, eyes still
     on frank.

                               mouse
                  huh?... he's busy right now, you
                  gonna have to call back.

     he hangs up.

                               easy
                  frank, a rich man she knows is
                  willing to pay a thousand dollars
                  just to talk to her. a thousand
                  bucks, man.

     frank still won't talk and that does it for mouse.   he
     releases the hammer.

                               mouse
                  easy, lemme try.

     thunk!   he slaps frank upside the head with the pistol.

                                mouse
                  you better...
                        (thunk!)
                  talk...
                        (thunk!)
                  you stupid--

     easy grabs mouse's arm and frank slumps to the floor.

                                 easy
                  let him go!

                               mouse
                  get out of my way!

                                 easy
                  let him be!

     the two friends struggle, and frank rears up and plows into
     easy, sending him sprawling to the floor on top of mouse.
     then frank, covered in blood, hurls himself across the room,
     out the door.

                                                              74.

81   mouse gets to his feet and runs to the door aiming the       81
     pistol, but it's too late. easy stands up and mouse points the
     gun at him.

                              mouse
                 damn you, easy. don't you never
                 grab me when i got a gun in my
                 hand!

     easy silently eyes the pistol and gives mouse a chance to
     calm down. after a moment mouse looks down at his jacket.

                              mouse
                 look at the blood you done got on
                 my coat. why you wanna go and do
                 that?

     he looks out the door and grabs a small suitcase. then
     spots the bathroom and moves to it, taking off his jacket
     and hanging the pistol in his belt.

     easy holds his fingers to the bump on his forehead and
     catches his breath as mouse runs water in the bathtub.

                              mouse
                 now we got to find that girl so we
                 can get that money.

                              easy
                 no, we don't, mouse. i don't need
                 your kinda help or i would've
                 called you.

     mouse comes out of the bathroom, scrubbing at a spot on his
     jacket with a washcloth.

                              mouse
                 you standing there with a knot on
                 your head the size of a twelve-
                 year-old tittie and you "don't need
                 my kind of help"?

                              easy
                       (angrily)
                 this is the same shit you pulled
                 five years ago when you asked me to
                 drive you out to your stepfather's
                 house, then come to find out you
                 killed him and your stepbrother.

                              mouse
                 aw, easy, that was a long time ago.

     easy glares at mouse and dabs blood from his forehead with a
     handkerchief.

                                                              75.

81   continued:                                                     81

                               mouse
                        (after a moment)
                  come on, easy. cut me in on this.
                  i could help you. i let you run
                  the show. i swear i will.

     he ambles over to easy apologetically and holds easy's
     shoulders with both hands.

                               mouse
                  i swear, i ain't gonna do nothin'
                  you don't tell me to do.

     easy knows he can't believe this but

                               easy
                  everything i say?

                               mouse
                  everything you say.

     with no choice, easy nods and walks into

82   the bathroom                                                   82

     he runs cold water onto a washcloth and looks in the mirror,
     dabbing at his forehead.

                               easy
                  who was that called?

                               mouse (o.s.)
                  i don't know... sound like some
                  white girl.

     easy turns toward the door "aw man!"
