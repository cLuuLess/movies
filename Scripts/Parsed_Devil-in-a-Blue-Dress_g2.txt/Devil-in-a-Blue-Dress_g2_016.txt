18   int. john's bar                                                18

     easy sees his fifth white man that day in a disheveled but
     expensive dark blue suit staggering toward him, reeking of
     gin.

                               drunk
                  hey, colored brother. i need you
                  to do somethin' for me--

                               o.s. woman's voice
                  go on. what'd i tell you about
                  hair-assing my customers.

     easy looks over to see hattie parsons, the small, brown-
     skinned manager of the place, glaring daggers at the drunk
     man while watching the commotion out the window.

     easy starts over toward hattie and the drunk turns and tries
     to grab easy's arm. but his desperation causes him to trip
     and he winds up sitting against the wall.

     easy steps over him and joins hattie at the window.

                               hattie
                  i just paid these damn cops and
                  they still roustin' my customers.
                  well, that's what he gets for being
                  with that white woman.

                                                             16.

     she walks over to the cash register of this neighborhood
     corner store; and easy follows, the drunk beckoning him to
     bend down to talk as he passes.

                               drunk
                  come on, brother help me...

                               hattie
                  don't worry 'bout him. i rung
                  junior ten minutes ago to come get
                  him.

     easy pulls out two dollars and hattie deposits them into the
     till.

                               hattie
                  i ain't got nobody tonight but lips
                  and his trio -- holiday came
                  through here last tuesday.

                                 easy
                  yeah?

                                 hattie
                  yeah.

     heavy footsteps are heard pounding down a stairway in the
     back of the store and big burly junior fornay lumbers in
     with a cigarette hanging from his lips.

                               junior
                  where's he at?

     hattie points to the drunk man as he struggles to get to his
     feet.

                               hattie
                  over there. let easy in upstairs
                  and when these cops leave throw his
                  ass out.

                                 easy
                  hey, junior.    what's goin' on?

                                 junior
                  not too much.    but stick around.

     junior leads the way back up the stairs.

19   omit                                                           19

                                                                 17.

a20   int. john's speakeasy stairwell                                  a20

                               easy
                  you got a cigarette?

                                 junior
                  sure.

      he pulls out his pack and stops to light easy up.   easy
      starts coughing as they continue up the stairs.

                              easy
                  damn! how do you smoke these
                  things?

                               junior
                  don't you hafta work tomorrow?

                                 easy
                  naw.    i got fired.

      a hint of a smile appears on junior's face.

                               junior
                  the last time i heard these fellas
                  playin' tonight was back in
                  houston, the night your ole buddy
                  mouse had to pull me up off your
                  ass.

      easy grins and shakes his head.

                               easy
                  that's the way you remember it,
                  hunh?

                               junior
                  hell, that's the way it was.

      and he stops to unlock the door.

                               junior
                        (continuing)
                  when you gonna admit that you
                  helped mouse kill old man
                  navrochet?

                               easy
                  aw, man, get off that. i ain't had
                  nothin' to do with that.

      junior opens the door and lips' alto horn slaps easy in the
      face. half of houston, texas seems to be jammed into this
      place.

                                                              18.

a20   continued:                                                     a20

                                easy
                   boy, it's happenin' tonight.
                   where's all the white women at?

                                junior
                   i don't pay them white girls no
                   mind.

                                easy
                         (sarcastically)
                   yeah... i bet you don't.

      and he steps in.

                                junior
                   that's right. just like you didn't
                   help mouse kill his stepfather.

                                 easy
                   go on, man.

      and he starts away inside.

                                junior
                   hey, easy. did you help him kill
                   his stepbrother, too?

      easy turns to glare at junior and the surly field hand slaps
      his thigh and roars with laughter as he closes the door.
      after all these years the two men still hate each other.
