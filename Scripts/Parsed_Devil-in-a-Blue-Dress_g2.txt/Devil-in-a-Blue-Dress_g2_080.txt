      mouse pulls to a stop and kills the engine.

                               easy

      mouse gets out of the car and is heard opening the trunk.

                  easy, come on, man. that girl is
                  lying if she told you i killed them
                  folks.

                               easy
                  who said she told me?

      scream! it's muted and distant.     but it's a woman all
      right. scream!

      easy pushes out of the back door on the right as mouse opens
      the opposite door on the driver's side.

                                easy
                  stuff this in his mouth.    i gotta
                  get up there.

      he tosses mouse the stocking.

                                mouse
                   let's just shoot him.

                         (on the run)
                   no, mouse. and they'll hear it.
