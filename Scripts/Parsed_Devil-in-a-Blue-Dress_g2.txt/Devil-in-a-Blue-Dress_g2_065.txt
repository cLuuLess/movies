103   ext. easy's house - night                                      103

      easy's car pulls up and he gets out and looks around
      cautiously before starting up the walkway.

                                easy (v.o.)
                         (continuing)
                   for the first time i hated walking
                   up to my house... i still didn't
                   know if i could go to the police.
                   but albright was liable to be
                   showing up in a few hours asking
                   about frank green. i was thinking
                   i oughta forget the girl and leave
                   town, back to houston or galveston
                   where they didn't know me too good.

      easy gets to the door, still literally looking over his
      shoulder, and hears the phone ringing inside. he unlocks
      the door and bursts in.
