     easy's pontiac pulls to a stop in front and he gets out.

                               easy (v.o.)
                  it occurred to me that coretta had
                  found out a lot more about what i
                  was up to than i had wanted her to.
                  but i had found out that the rich
                  man's woman had a colored
                  boyfriend... it had cost me a
                  sawbuck to get coretta to give me
                  that information... well, let's
                  just say somethin' had cost me ten
                  dollars.
