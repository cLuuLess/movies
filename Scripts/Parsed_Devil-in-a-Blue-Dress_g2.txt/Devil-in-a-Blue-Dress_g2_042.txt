     the studebaker is parked at a deadend in the street.    easy
     pulls in behind.

     the cabin is so overgrown with ivy that all this is visible
     is the mailbox and address.

                  did you bring a gun or something?

                                easy
                  what?   no.

                               daphne
                  easy, that's not very smart.

                  search me sometime.   you'll find
                  it.

     she gets out of the car.

                                easy
                  damn...

     he frowns and gets out of the car.
