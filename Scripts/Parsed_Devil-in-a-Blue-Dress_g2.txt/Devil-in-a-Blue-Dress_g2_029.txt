37   ext. easy's house - night                                        37

     easy pulls in front of his house and notices a dark ford
     parked across the street as he gets out of his car.

     a tall, skinny white man in a dark blue suit gets out just
     ahead of his slightly shorter and heavyset friend.

     easy watches them as he moves toward his walkway.

                                 skinny man
                  mr. rawlins.

                                 easy
                  yeah.

     they approach fast but cautiously, the fat one with a hand
     in his pocket.

                               skinny man
                  mr. rawlins, i'm miller and this is
                  my partner, mason.

     they both hold out badges. mason is a slob with grease
     spots on his wrinkled tan suit.

                               miller
                  we want you to come with us.

                                 easy
                  where?

                                 mason
                  you'll see.

     and he takes easy by the arm.

                               easy
                  you arresting me?

                                 mason
                  you'll see.

     and he starts pulling easy toward the street.

                               easy
                  i got a right to know why you're
                  taking--

                                                               36.

37   continued:                                                      37

     whomp! easy takes one to the diaphragm, and as he doubles
     over the fat detective slips the handcuffs on behind his
     back.

                                mason
                  you got a right to fall down and
                  break your face, nigger. you got a
                  right to die.

     the two cops drag easy to the car and dump him into the back
     seat where he lies gagging as the car whisks away.
