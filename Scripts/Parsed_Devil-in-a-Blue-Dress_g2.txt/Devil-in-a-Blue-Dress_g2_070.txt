110   int. easy's car - night                                           110

      easy is ripping through the night, the streetlights flashing
      by in blurs of light. the windows down, he's coming to.

                                 easy (v.o.)
                    it had come to me in less time than
                    it takes to think that albright was
                    taking daphne someplace more
                    isolated than that office building
                    downtown... someplace where there
                    would be no witnesses... and i was
                    being left alive to take the fall.
