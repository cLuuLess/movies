     easy's head sags down as he's dragged through the front door
     past blurred blue bodies that talk.

                               policeman (o.s.)
                  you got 'im, huh, miller?

                               miller (o.s.)
                  yeah, we got him coming home.
                  nothing on 'im.

     a door opens and easy finds himself being flung inside.
