15   int. maintenance room                                          15

     a short and stocky kind of chinese-looking man stands
     against the door at the far end. the tall man ushers easy
     into the clutter of heavy metal tools, cans of paint and
     cleaning solutions. a card table with two chairs sits idly.
     the tall man closes the door and holds out his hand. easy
     reaches to shake it but the man starts to pat easy on his
     side and easy pushes him away.

                                                             11.

                                 easy
                  hey, man!    what's wrong with you?

     the chinese man slips a hand inside his coat and the tall
     man smiles.

                               tall man
                        (with an accent)
                  mr. rawlins, put your hands up a
                  little from your sides, please.

                               easy
                  keep your hands to yourself. i
                  don't let no man feel on me like
                  that.

     the chinese man pulls some kind of weapon halfway out and
     takes a step forward, and the tall man tries to put his hand
     against easy's chest but easy grabs his wrist.

                                tall man
                  don't worry, manny. he's okay.
                  just a little shaky.
                        (indicating the door)
                  let him know.

     manny pushes his weapon back in his coat and knocks on the
     door behind him.

     after a moment, dewitt albright opens up.

                                 albright
                          (smiling)
                  easy.

                               tall man
                  he doesn't want us to touch him.

                               albright
                  leave it, shariff. i just wanted
                  to make sure he was solo.

                               shariff
                  you're the boss.

                               albright
