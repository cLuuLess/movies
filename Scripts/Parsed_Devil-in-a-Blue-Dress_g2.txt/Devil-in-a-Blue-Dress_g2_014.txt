     easy follows albright inside and the big man goes behind a
     big wooden desk and puts his bone-colored shoes up next to a
     half full bottle of wild turkey. on the other end of the
     desk a small radio scratches out the glen gray orchestra's
     "gotta be this or that."

                                                             12.

     there is a paper calendar hanging on the wall behind him
     with a picture of a basket of blackberries, but other than
     that the room is bare.

                               albright
                  have a seat, mr. rawlins.

     easy takes a seat in a chair in front of the desk and tries
     not to stare at the tan leather shoulder holster under
     albright's arm with the muzzle of the pistol almost reaching
     his belt.

                               easy
                        (gesturing back)
                  your friends, hunh?

                               albright
                  like you, easy. i need a little
                  help? i give 'em a call... drink?

                               easy
                  sure.

     albright pulls another glass from the desk drawer and pours
     a fresh one for easy and fresher one for himself.

                               albright
                  one thing i like about working for
                  myself... i always have a bottle on
                  the table... you wanna drink with
                  me? fine. you don't? door's
                  right behind you... joppy tells me
                  you're a war hero... said you went
                  in with patton.

     easy nods, proud but polite, and albright pushes him a glass
     of whiskey.

                               albright
                  so, you want the job?

                               easy
                  depends on what kind of job. i
                  don't want to get mixed up in
                  nothing.

                               albright
                  walk out the door in the morning,
                  easy, and you're mixed up in
                  something. only thing that matters
                  is if you're mixed up to the top or
                  not.

                                                             13.

                               easy
                  i mean i don't wanna get mixed up
                  with the law...

                               albright
                  neither one of us wants to get
                  mixed up in that. that's just rich
                  people trying to keep me and you in
                  our place.

     he laughs and takes a healthy swig and easy takes a drink
     too.

                               albright
                  i'm looking for somebody for a
                  friend.

     he pushes a newspaper across the desk to easy and easy holds
     it up.

     newspaper

     it's the front page with the photograph of the wealthy todd
     carter and his beautiful bride-to-be... despite her smile,
     there's a sadness in the eyes.

                               albright (o.s.)
                  daphne monet... fianc√©e of todd
                  carter, one of the richest men in
                  town... been gone for two weeks...

     back to scene

                               easy
                  she leave him?

                                albright
                  evidently... you know how it is
                  with women, easy... happens to the
                  best of us...

     he rears back in his chair as if expecting a sign of
     recognition.

                               easy
                  i ain't never heard of her before.
                  i wouldn't know how to find a woman
                  like that.

                               albright
                  that's a shame.

     he laughs a conspiratorial, lecher's laugh and easy allows a
     smile.

                                                               14.

                               albright
                  see, daphne has a predilection for
                  the company of negroes. she likes
                  jazz and pigs feet and dark meat,
                  know what i mean.

     the insult takes easy off guard but he should've known.

                               easy
                  so you think she might be down in
                  watts.

                               albright
                  i'm sure of it. but i can't go
                  looking for her myself because i'm
                  not of the right persuasion, so to
                  speak. i've been asking joppy for
                  over a week, but all he could do
                  was introduce me to you.

                               easy
                  what do you want me to do?

                               albright
                  just get a location on her. mr.
                  carter wants to make up with her...

                                easy
                  that's all.

                               albright
                        (smiling)
                  that's all.

     he pulls out a brown secretary-type wallet and counts out 10
     ten-dollar bills into a neat stack next to the whiskey.

                               albright
                  one hundred dollars, and i pay in
                  advance.

     easy eyes the money.   all he has to do is pick it up.

                               easy
                  i just have to tell you where she
                  is?

                               albright
                  that's right. and keep it, you
                  know, confidential...

     he freshens easy's drink and easy eyes the money some more.

                                                             15.

16   continued:   (4)                                               16

                               albright
                  joppy tells me you used to frequent
                  an illegal club down on eighty-
                  ninth and central. somebody saw
                  daphne there a few nights ago. you
                  could start tonight.

     easy takes a drink and looks again at the money.
