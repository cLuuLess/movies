127   ext. route 9 - night                                           127

      mouse opens the back seat door of the car and easy sees that
      there's no one there.

                                easy
                   where's joppy?

      and then he looks around quickly, seeing

      joppy's body lying off on the side of the road.

                                easy
                   what happened?

      mouse shrugs.

                                mouse
                   i didn't have time to be tying him
                   up.

      daphne sees the body too and starts gagging. easy's face
      twists into helpless pain and he holds a handkerchief to
      daphne's mouth.

                                 easy
                   why, man?   why?

                                                                 110.

127    continued:                                                        127

                                 mouse
                    why what? you just said don't
                    shoot him. and i didn't... i
                    choked his ass...

       easy helps daphne into the car and closes the door.

                                  easy
                    damn mouse!   why?

                                 mouse
                    how i'm gonna help you back there
                    foolin' 'round with him?

                                 easy
                    he was tied up! why?!

                                 mouse
                    aw, man. if you didn't want him
                    kilt you shouldn't have left him
                    with me.

       and he goes around to the passenger side of the car to get
       in.

       unlike up at the house this was murder -- the same as it had
       been in texas with mouse's stepfather and brother. tears of
       rage well up in easy's eyes as he hears the car door close.

                                                  dissolve to:

a128   ext. glendale train station - night                              a128

       daphne sits in the car, her eyes staring straight ahead,
       still in shock.
