113   int. joppy's bar                                               113

      he charges through the raucous laughter of the half-full
      room right up to the bar.

      joppy nearly drops the glasses he is clearing away as he
      looks down the barrel of the pistol aimed at his face.

                                easy
                   come on, joppy. let's go!

      joppy hesitates, recognizing the voice.

                                easy
                   you heard me.  i'll blow your head
                   off!

      and he cocks the hammer, causing joppy to get a move on from
      behind the bar.

      easy shoves him through the door, calling back to the
      startled crowd on his way out.

                                                              102.

113    continued:                                                     113

                                 easy
                    don't follow me, goddammit!

       and he's gone.
