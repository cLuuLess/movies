102   int. easy's car - night                                       102

      the dim street lamps of easy's neighborhood streak past as
      easy scans the streets and sidewalks, wary for anybody who
      might be staking him out.

                                                              91.

                                easy (v.o.)
                   the pictures were burnin' a hole in
                   my pocket... i had no doubt that
                   albright had killed mcgee... and
                   that he had done it for matthew
                   teran... but teran hadn't known who
                   killed coretta. i was sure of
                   that, too.
