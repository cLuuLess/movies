      easy is cautious, checking the rearview mirror more often
      than usual.

                                easy (v.o.)
                   i wasn't used to going to white
                   communities, like malibu, to
                   conduct business. champion
                   aircraft was in santa monica but i
                   drove out there in the daytime, did
                   my work and came home. i never
                   loitered nowhere except among my

a35   ext. malibu pier - parking lot - night                           a35

      the lights from the   pier can be seen in the distance as easy
      parks his car. and    the voices of teenagers in raucous
      conversation can be   heard above glenn miller's big band
      playing "silhouette   in the moonlight" on the jukebox.

                                                               30.

      easy gets out and starts toward the pier.
