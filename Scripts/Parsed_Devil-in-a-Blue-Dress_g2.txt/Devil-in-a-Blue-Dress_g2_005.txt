    duke ellington's "mood indigo" plays on the radio as easy
    heads for home in thought.

                 dewitt albright reminded me of
                 somebody i knew back in houston.
                 his name was raymond alexander but
                 we called him mouse... mouse called
                 hisself a businessman too. and i
                 found out that i shouldn't be
                 nowhere around when mouse got down
                 to his business... i learned that
                 the hard way.

    a neighbor sweeps out her front porch and waves at easy as
    he slows down in front of his house.
