93   int. junior's apartment - day                                    93

     filthy and junky, with old car parts scattered amongst old
     furniture, the room is unpleasant with only the benefit of a
     dim light -- just like junior.

                               junior
                  y'all want a beer?

     he nods at a card table with one folding chair and throws
     two others into place on his way to the refrigerator.

     easy and mouse sit down and junior brings over a quart of
     pabst blue ribbon beer and two glasses that he wipes out
     with a rag.

                               easy
                  what ya smokin'? zapatas?

                                                             83.

     junior tosses his pack onto the table and pours beer into
     the glasses for easy and mouse, and drinks from the bottle.

     easy unfolds the handkerchief in his pocket on the table,
     uncovering the cigarette butt from richard mcgee's house.

                               easy
                        (to junior)
                  this is one of yours, ain't it?

     junior looks at the butt and shrugs.

                               easy
                  you the only one i know cheap
                  enough to smoke this shit... why'd
                  you kill richard mcgee?

                                junior
                  huh?   what you talkin' 'bout?

                               easy
                  ain't no time to play, junior.    i
                  know you the one killed him.

                               junior
                  you crazy, man. you crazy!

     and he stands up to emphasize his indignation.

                               mouse
                  sit down, junior.

     junior shifts awkwardly from side to side and then sits back
     down.

                               easy
                  tell me what happened, junior.

                               junior
                  i don't know what you talkin'
                  'bout.

                               easy
                  well, the police will. when they
                  find out that they got your
                  fingerprints up there in that man's
                  house.

                               junior
                  what fingerprints? what house?

                                                              84.

                               easy
                  hattie had you pull that man out of
                  john's the night i was there. and
                  he was laying up there dead with
                  the same suit on and a knife in his
                  chest.

                               junior
                  i ain't killed nobody.

                               easy
                  quit lyin', you big ole sweaty-
                  thick headed-cornbread eatin'--

     mouse can't keep from laughing and junior starts up after
     easy.

                               junior
                  you thick-headed, ya damn self!!

     but mouse is up, still laughing with the pistol in his hand.

                               mouse
                  sit down, man... 'fore i blow your
                  brains out.

                               junior
                  what kinda shit y'all trying to
                  pull here?

                               mouse
                        (last warning)
                  sit down.

     junior sits down and throws himself around in the chair like
     a child throwing a fit.

                               easy
                  you better tell it the way it
                  happened. and maybe i'll forget
                  what i know... otherwise, i'm gonna
                  tell mouse to shoot ya 'cause you
                  know i don't like your ass and he
                  don't like you either.

     mouse slaps the table, laughing so hard he's in tears.

                               mouse
                  aw, man...

     and he aims the pistol and cocks the hammer, causing junior
     to throw himself around some more.

                                                               85.

                  didn't ya?

                               junior

                  in his house!

     silence. but it's in the open now and junior frowns and
     shakes his head.

                               junior
                  hattie had me take him out to his
                  car. and he say he give me ten
                  dollars to drive him home.

     mouse is busy working a toothpick between his front teeth.

                               mouse
                  i know you took that.

                  you seen her with coretta?

                                junior
                  naw.   to deliver a letter.
