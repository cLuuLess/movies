                  i had moved to los angeles right
                  after the war with three hundred
                  dollars and the g.i. bill... and i
                  liked coming home to a place that
                  was mine... according to president
                  truman i had that comin' to me
                  'cause i had fought in 'the good
                  war' against hitler in europe...
                  but that didn't mean a damn thing
                  to a lotta white folks including
                  the foreman on my job... so, here i
                  was out of work needin' thirty-two
                  dollars to pay the mortgage... that
                  was three days pay on my old job --
                  and i had about three days to get
                  it.
