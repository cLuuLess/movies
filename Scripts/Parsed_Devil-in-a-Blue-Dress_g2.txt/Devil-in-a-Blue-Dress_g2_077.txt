117   int. easy's car - night                                       117

      easy, with the gun on joppy, strains to see the dimly lit
      road in front of them.

                                easy
                   is that it up there?

                                joppy
                   yeah, that's it.

118   through the windshield                                        118

      the headlights bounce off a signpost: "route 9."
