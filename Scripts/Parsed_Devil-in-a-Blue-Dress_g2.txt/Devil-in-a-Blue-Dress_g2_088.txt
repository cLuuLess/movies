      easy walks onto the rotunda holding a hand to his aching
      kidney. a secretary comes out to meet him and as she
      leaves, todd carter and a group of men in business suits
      converge on him, shaking hands.

                               easy (v.o.)
                  evidently carter had told all his
                  cronies about the pictures because
                  they were all smiles and handshakes
                  and "how do ya do"... the mayor,
                  the police chief... the newspaper;
                  land developers. all the men who
                  ran the city, and who really stood
                  to gain by who was the mayor for
                  the next six years.

      the group fans out leaving carter and easy alone to walk off
      down a hallway.
