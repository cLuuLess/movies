52   int. easy's car - night                                         52

     ben webster's "i've   got it bad" plays on the road as easy
     shifts nervously in   his seat, his eyes searching in the
     rearview mirror and   all around for headlights that might be
     unfriendly. daphne    leans back against the passenger door,
     taking him in.

     easy passes a police car pulled over to the side.

     he looks in the rearview mirror and its headlights go on.
     he takes a deep breath, bracing for the worst and daphne
     looks back concerned.

     but the lights arch a u-turn and head back the other way.

                              daphne
                 they must not have seen us that
                 well... god, frank and i have been
                 pulled over so many times i
                 thought--

     she catches herself and looks over at easy.

                              daphne
                       (continuing)
                 easy, i'm sorry... don't be mad at
                 me.

     easy keeps his eyes on the road.

                              daphne
                       (continuing)
                 come on.

     she tries to touch his arm and he pulls away.

                              daphne
                       (continuing)
                 you really hate me, don't you?

                              easy
                 how much further is it?

                               daphne
                 around the next bend...
                        (she grins)
                 you remind me of frank when he gets
                 angry.

                              easy
                 ain't nothin' about me like frank.

                              daphne
                 your jaw sets just like his when--

                                                               52.

52   continued:                                                      52

                               easy
                  i don't get no kick outta risking
                  my life for some white woman's
                  entertainment.

                               daphne
                        (sighing)
                  just park behind the studebaker.
