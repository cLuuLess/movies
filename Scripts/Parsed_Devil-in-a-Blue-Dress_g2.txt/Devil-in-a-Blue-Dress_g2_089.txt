136   int. mayor's office                                            136

      spacious and heavy in leather and wood with a not-so-
      spectacular view of the mountains. it's cold and official
      like the job itself.

      carter pulls a brown envelope from inside his coat pocket,
      not unlike albright.

                                                             114.

136   continued:                                                    136

                                carter
                   here's the remaining eight hundred
                   that i owe you... in cash... and
                   another thousand which i hope will
                   keep this whole thing... you know.

      easy nods a tentative "sure."

                                carter
                         (continuing)
                   and i've taken care of your
                   problems with the police. you'll
                   have no more trouble there. and
                   that's a promise.

      easy nods and starts to go, but...

                                carter
                         (continuing; to easy)
                   mr. rawlins... did daphne ever
                   say... she loved me?

      easy shrugs, not knowing how to answer.

                                easy
                   would it really matter if she did,
                   mr. carter?

      carter nods sadly and easy walks away leaving him a lonely
      figure amidst all his power.
