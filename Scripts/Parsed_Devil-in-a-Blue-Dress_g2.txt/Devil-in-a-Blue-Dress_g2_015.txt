17   ext. john's place (market) - night                             17

     stripped down to its dark, naked self, central avenue has
     drawn a crowd from all over town. neon glistens off slick
     pomade and silk clings to the contours of simmering flesh.

     an outrage to police even before the era of police chief
     parker's personal crusade, a squad car sits idling while two
     dicks in blue manhandle a brother in a grey sharkskin zoot
     suit, prodding and whapping with nightsticks, searching for
     something -- anything -- because his date is a young white
     woman. a few onlookers stand back watching, but since this
     white woman is not daphne monet, easy only glances and walks
     inside.
