      the blurred white form of albright's caddy screaming away,
      shattering the dark, shrieking in flight.

      dogs are barking and a baby is screaming somewhere in the
      neighborhood while lights are going on up and down the
      block.

      easy stumbles back inside and into

                                                                 100.

109   the bedroom                                                       109

      where he manages to dial the phone.      it rings several times
      on the other end, and finally:

                                   mouse's voice
                            (groggy)
                    yeah.

                                   easy
                    mouse...

                                   mouse's voice
                    hey, easy?

                                 easy
                          (slurring)
                    get dupree's car. drive it to 78th
                    and central... the butcher shop.

                                   mouse's voice
                    you alright?

                                   easy
                    hurry up.

      he puts down the receiver, missing the cradle, and staggers
      out of the room.
