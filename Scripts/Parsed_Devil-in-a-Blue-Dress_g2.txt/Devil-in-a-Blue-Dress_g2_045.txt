     a pink studebaker whips backward out the driveway. easy
     runs alongside trying to stop daphne as she screeches into
     the street.

                                easy
                   hey, wait a minute!

     she speeds off down the canyon.

                                easy
                   dammit!

     he stands in the middle of the street, watching her go.
