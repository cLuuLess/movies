111   ext. butcher shop/joppy's bar - night                             111

      the street is still alive. a couple of late night juke
      joints are coughing up the last drunken bits of the party
      onto the sidewalk to straggle home. easy's car screams
      around the corner, and then skids in, sending a heavy-hipped
      young sister, about to cross the street, scrambling for
      cover.

      he jumps out just as mouse scorches the tires on dupree's
      '38 packard in behind him.

                                                              101.

111   continued:                                                     111

                                easy
                         (to the woman)
                   sorry, baby... lemme give you
                   twenty bucks for them stockings you
                   got on.

      it takes a moment to register, but when she sees him pull
      a twenty from his pocket, she gets busy.

      he runs back to mouse.

                                easy
                   gimme one of them guns you got.

      mouse smiles, loving this side of easy, and trades him a set
      of car keys for a .32 automatic.

                                easy
                         (continuing)
                   start up my car. i'm comin' out
                   fast.

      he runs back to the woman he almost hit and hands off the
      twenty, grabbing one of the nylons, leaving her still
      stripping as he runs into
