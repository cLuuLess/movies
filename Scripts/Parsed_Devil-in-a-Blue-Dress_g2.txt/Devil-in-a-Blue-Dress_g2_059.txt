92    ext. portland court - day                                        92

      it's a horseshoe of tiny apartments with over a dozen little
      porches and doorways staggered in a semi-circle around a
      small yard that has a half-dozen stunted magnolia trees
      growing in brick pots.

      easy and mouse step into the courtyard, passing elderly
      tenants sitting inside screened doors. jimmy lunceford's
      "i'm walking through heaven with you" floats out into the
      yard.

      they arrive at the closed door of number eight. easy knocks
      and then knocks again, hard. something crashes on the
      inside and heavy footsteps pound to the door.

                                 voice behind door
                   who's that?

                                                                82.

92   continued:                                                       92

                                easy
                  easy!

     the door opens and junior fornay stands there behind the
     screen door in blue boxer shorts and a white t-shirt.

                               junior
                  what you want?

                               easy
                  it's private, junior.   lemme in.

     and he reaches to pull open the door, but junior throws the
     latch.

                               junior
                  i ain't got time now.   i'm tryin'
                  to get some sleep.

                               mouse
                  why don't you open the door,
                  junior, 'fore i have to shoot it
                  down.

     mouse steps out into the doorway, in plain view.

                                junior
                  mouse.

                                mouse
                  open up.   we ain't got all night.

     junior forces a smile and lets them in.
