     ext. iraqi desert - day

     wide shot -  hundreds of iraqis walking in the desert, hands
     raised above their heads.

                         translator (megaphone)
               hasnala shi aluno quibaan --

                         captain van meter
               we will not hurt you. lay down
               your weapons, get on the ground --

     two iraqis with bad face wounds get medical help.

     five iraqis

     on their knees, plead for mercy in arabic as they disrobe.
     they grab and kiss troy barlow's hand, as he holds his m-16
     on the begging iraqis.

                         troy
               it's cool, no one's gonna hurt
               you --

     vig whips out his big thunder 5 pistol and points it in their
     faces.

                         vig
               did you rape and torture anybody
               in kuwait, abdul?

     the iraqis wail for mercy. troy pushes vig's pistol away.

                         troy
               you're making them all hysterical.

     vig points the big pistol at an older iraqi officer who is
     the only one not taking his clothes off.

                         vig
               take your fucking rags off, take
               this off. no comprende english,
               motherfucker?

                         troy
               what is your fucking problem,
               conrad?

                         vig
               i'm trying to git him to obey the
               spirit of things but he won't take
               his rags off.

                         troy
                      (leans down)
               sir? we need you to disrobe like
               all the other towel heads, ok?

     the officer does not move, troy punches his head once. vig
     and walter forcibly pull the iraqi officer's pants off. troy
     takes out a bottle of aspirin, eats two.

                         vig
               whoa, it's a freaky thing, troy.

     vig points to the officer's bare buttocks, where a rolled up
     piece of paper is sticking out --

                         troy
               there's a document in that guy's
               ass, conrad.

                         vig
               that's the freaky thing.

                         walter
               do you think he ate it?

                         troy
               it wouldn't come out perfect like
               that if he ate it.

     troy pulls out a latex glove out of his pocket.

                         troy
               go get it, private.

                         iraqi officer
               hasa man timal!

     the officer screams in protest and is forcibly subdued by
     walter as vig, wearing the glove, slowly pulls the rolled up,
     greasy paper from the officer's ass -- troy looks disgusted.

                         troy
               open it up.

                         vig
               you only gave me one glove.

                         troy
               i'm sorry i don't have another,
               but you gotta open it up. that's
               how the chain of command works.

     vig takes out a u.s. army pen and uses it to unroll the
     greasy paper and lie it flat on the sand.

     close up - the rumpled paper

     is a handwritten map, with scant arabic writing, a few spare
     roads, numbers, and three small boxes.

                         vig
               what the hell is that?

                         troy
               important enough to squeeze your
               cheeks for.
