     int. bunker garage - day

     it is dark. with a click, several bare ceiling lights come
     on. archie, doc, vig, stare in amazement: it's an underground
     garage filled with nine luxury cars: a rolls royce, a jaguar,
     a mercedes, an infiniti convertible, four cadillacs, a white
     stretch limousine. the friendly iraqi smiles.

                         friendly iraqi soldier
               from kuwait.

     doc stops at the convertible.

                         doc
               could i ask a question?

     the iraqi deserters look at him.

                         doc
               does lexus make this model?

                         friendly iraqi soldier
               no. infiniti convertible only.

                         friendly iraqi 2
               no lexus convertible.

                         doc
               exactly what i said.

                         archie gates
               listen. we use these cars to go
               fight saddam soldiers.

     the friendly iraqi looks at doc and laughs.

                         doc
               what's so funny?

                         friendly iraqi soldier
               cannot take.

                         doc
               what do you mean, cannot take? we
               kicked saddam's ass. we definitely
               take.

                         archie gates
               we are the united states military.

     the iraqi laughs.

                         imam
               you're three guys with a bunch of
               shiites and no humvee.

                         friendly iraqi soldier
               need money. have no money. to eat.
               to live. kish falan azar yat imal
               tanat.

                         imam
               he says the americans have many
               tanks, many airplanes. we have
               nothing.

     the iraqis do not look happy. imam does simultaneous
     translation as archie holds forth.

                         archie gates
               we will rise up together.

                         imam
               jihala vamat.

                         archie gates
               rise up together.

     doc and vig look taken aback as archie goes messianic.

                         archie gates
               look at us. working together. many
               races, many nations. tell him, doc.

                         doc
               we are united.

     they raise their joined hands together.

                         archie gates
               united. george bush wants you --

                         doc
               to stand up for yourself.

                         friendly iraqi soldier
               george bush.

                         archie gates
               he wants you --

                         doc
               you.

                         vig
               praise jesus.

                         archie gates
               make the fight for freedom on your
               own.

                         doc
               oh, yes, you can.

                         vig
               go, baby, go.

     archie walks around, looking into the eyes of each iraqi
     soldier, touching them on the shoulders.

                         archie gates
               then america will follow.

                         imam
               jahal yaqat.

                         doc
               jahal yaqat, brothers.

                         archie gates
               god bless america, and god bless
               a free iraq.

     iraqis burst into cheers.

                         archie gates
               what do you say now, my friend?

                         friendly iraqi
               cannot give car.

                         archie gates

               them.
