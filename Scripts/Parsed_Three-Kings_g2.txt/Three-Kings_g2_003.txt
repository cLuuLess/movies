     ext. iraqi desert road - american soldiers in combat gear

     dance on a road in the desert. "i just want to celebrate"
     blares as the camera dollies through the soldiers.

     dolly into tent town, past bare chested soldiers pumping free
     weights; jogging in formation; sunbathing on big water
     storage mattresses; dolly out of the tent town, past a
     soldier taking a makeshift foxhole desert bath, past a dead
     iraqi on the road, a chopper hovering in the distance, to
     more dancing soldiers, as music continues --

                         bill smithson (o.s.)
               spirits are high and the music is
               boisterous as these young troops
               celebrate -- shit. let me try that
               again.

     dolly around the dancing soldiers to see: hundreds of
     stripped iraqi soldiers lying face down in undershorts.

                         bill smithson (o.s.)
               spirits are high and the music is
               fucking motherfucking sand in my
               eye --

     pan past cnn reporter bill smithson, 45, in white safari
     jacket over desert storm fatigues, cleaning his eye; nearby
     a cluster of rowdy soldiers who are mugging into the camera.

     dolly to archie gates, 55, lieutenant colonel, special
     forces, wearing sunglasses, talking to havichon, a french
     special forces captain on crutches with a broken leg.

               gold, man.

               for chrissakes?

                         archie gates

               be the problem?

                         bill smithson
               i'm trying to do a story here and
               the fucking sand is blowing in my
               face --

                         archie gates
               you want me to stop the sand? i
               can't do anything about that.

                         bill smithson
               no, you're too busy talking about
               the fucking gold, which by the way
               makes a great story if you'd get
               me a goddamn lead on it --

                         archie gates
               i think the saddam story goes more
               for the jugular, journalistically
               speaking, i mean, he's still here
               beating the shit out of his
               country.
