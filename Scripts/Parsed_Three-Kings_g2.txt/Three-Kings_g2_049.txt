     vig turns the speeding humvee off the road. archie jerks the
     wheel back.

                         archie gates
               stay on the road.

                         vig
               i don't wanna get hit.

     slow motion: doc looks straight up with the binoculars.

     slow motion: a rocket streaks a squiggly white line of smoke
     across the sky.
