     ext. deserter's bunker - day

     archie now walks among shiites toting old rifles. there are
     bomb craters, destroyed cars, a few mud dwellings nearby.

                         shiite
               america!

                         shiite #2
               america! friend!

                         shiite
               freedom! thank you to america!

     shiites cheer and pat archie, doc and vig on the back as they
     walk to a bunker built into the side of a small hill. two
     iraqi soldiers come out smiling to embrace a disoriented
     archie and doc.
