     int. room of bunker 2 - day

     bright white cement, many overhead lights and a high ceiling.
     empty but for 15 brand new, jumbo-sized louis vuitton
     suitcases standing neatly in a row in the center of the room.

     archie stands looking at the suitcases with troy and doc.

     several of the big vuitton suitcases are laid on their sides
     by archie, troy and doc.

     the iraqi captain paces frantically punching and kicking the
     walls and talking (subtitled in english).

                         iraqi captain
               it's saddam's gold.

                         interrogator
               shut up, he signed the treaty.

     the suitcases are quickly unzipped. one suitcase is full of
     gleaming antique silverware. one suitcase is full of jewelry.

     archie opens one full of hundreds of gold cartier watches.

     troy and doc slip a handful of jewelry into their pockets.

     the iraqi captain goes nuts, throwing himself on doc's back,
     choking doc, who flails about. troy punches the iraqi in the
     head and rips him off doc.

     archie puts his pistol in the man's face.

                         archie gates
               listen to me: we leave you alone
               to kill your shiites, but
               everything you took from kuwait,
               that belongs to us now, understand?

     he turns to doc.

                         archie gates
               put it back.

                         doc
               why?

                         archie gates
               stick to the plan. the plan is for
               gold.

     doc and troy, out of breath, empty their pockets of jewelry.

     archie opens another vuitton suitcase and pushes it aside -
     it's full of kuwaiti passports.

     when doc opens the next suitcase, he freezes. archie looks
     over and freezes. troy closes cuffs behind the captain's back
     and looks over his shoulder -- wide-eyed.

     the very large vuitton suitcase is filled with five-kilo
     bricks of gold. they all stare. troy picks one up.

                         troy
               is this five kilos?

     archie holds another brick.

                         archie gates
               yeah, that's five kilos.

                         troy
               five, six, seven, eight, there's
               sixty bricks in this suitcase.

                         doc
               times 50k each --

                         troy
               three million dollars.

     archie opens another large vuitton suitcase, and it is also
     filled with sixty bars. troy opens another suitcase, there's
     another sixty bars. doc opens another, another sixty bars.
     they frantically check all of the suitcases. the handcuffed
     captain is crying.

                         archie gates
               ten suitcases; sixty bricks each.
               that's thirty million dollars.

     archie, doc and troy look at each other in shock.

     with effort, doc and troy help archie pick up the heavy,
     jumbo-sized suitcase sideways, like a table top.

                         troy
               i'm gonna get a fleet of lexus
               convertibles in different colors.

                         doc
               i told you lexus doesn't make a
               convertible.

                         troy
               i'll bet you a lexus they do.

                         doc
               ok, you're on for a lexus, but it
               won't be a convertible.

     suddenly the suitcase rips apart and gold bars fall to the
     floor; one lands on troy's foot. he jumps in pain.

                         troy
               shit.

     archie, troy, and doc hoist another suitcase sideways and the
     bricks rip through and fall to the floor --

                         archie gates
               they didn't get it here in these
               bags.

                         doc
               the tensilary strength goes to 200
               pounds.

                         troy
               the what?

                         doc
               tensilary strength, it's what the
               suitcase can hold.

                         archie gates
               why would you know that?

                         troy
               he works at an airport.

                         doc
               60 bars, 13 pounds each is like --
               800 pounds. the smaller vuittons
               handle 65.

                         archie gates
               you got any more luggage here?

     the interrogator looks at him.
