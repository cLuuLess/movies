     ext. desert day

     no more music. troy, doc, and vig stand spread apart. they
     wear white anti-gas suits and hold pistols and drink from
     plastic water bottles. a bomb crater is nearby, a wrecked,
     burned truck to the side, a skinny cow meanders.

                         archie gates
               when we pull up to the bunker, the
               approach is something called
               violence of action, which is
               standard in special operations. it
               means your movement is so fast and
               decisive that the guards are
               frozen and we haven't fired a
               single shot.

     troy kicks at something in the sand -- and a decayed human
     arm springs out, attached to a body with a half-rotted face.

                         troy
               shit.

                         archie gates
               we dropped a lot of bombs out here
               and we buried some guys alive --

                         vig
               what do you mean?

                         archie gates
               bradleys with big plows cut
               through the berms and covered the
               trenches --

     fantasy - a huge plow

     on the front of a bradley pushes sand right toward the camera

                         archie gates (o.s.)
               they had the option to surrender,
               but they chose to die for their
               country.

     dolly into five terrified iraqis, eyes open with fear, as the
     sand rolls over them.

     back to the scene

                         archie gates
               let's rehearse.
