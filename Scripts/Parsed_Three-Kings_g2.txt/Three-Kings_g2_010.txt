     ext. van meter's tent - day

     cathy daitch stands next to a cameraman filming van meter
     while another man holds a boom over van meter's head.

                         captain van meter
               how about if i lean on it, like
               this?

                         cathy daitch
               very dashing.

                         captain van meter
               does it look too posed?

                         cathy daitch
               would you ever stand like that?

     van meter tries a couple of poses.

                         captain van meter
               i think i might, jesus, this feels
               stupid.

                         cathy daitch
               you'll get used to it. first
               question: did you dream as a boy
               you'd be commanding an infantry
               company in a desert war?

                         captain van meter
               as a boy, i wanted to be either a
               veterinarian or a cia
               sharpshooter --
