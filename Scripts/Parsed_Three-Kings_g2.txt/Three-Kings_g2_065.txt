     ext. open desert - day

     archie climbs out of a small mound in the desert, squints in
     the light and looks around.

     a strange minaret stretches skyward from the flat desert, 200
     yards away. the minaret is made of yellow stone, it twists
     150 feet into the air, like a twisting wedding cake.

     archie leads the others toward the minaret. no one is around,
     except for a few black robes. archie, doc, and vig enter the
     old wooden doorway of the ancient minaret.
