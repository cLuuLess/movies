     int. tv room of oasis bunker - day

     a mortar rocks the room; soldiers frantically exit.

     'cnn' is left playing in the empty room with bill smithson's
     report from the previous day. "i just want to celebrate"
     plays:

                         bill smithson
               spirits are high and the music is
               soaring as these young troops
               celebrate --
