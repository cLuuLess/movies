     ext. desert - near archie and doc

                         archie gates
               does anybody see barlow?

     archie and doc circle through the thick haze carrying a
     vuitton hat case and cover their mouths and noses.

                         doc
               i can't even see the truck.

     about five shiites wander around, confused.

                         vig
               look out.

     archie spins around, drops the bag and points his pistol.

     two black robed figures pick up vuitton hat cases.

                         archie gates
               don't move.

     a black robed figure walks right past archie, takes a scared
     shiite man by the arm and leads him to the side.

     more black cloaked figures appear. there are thirty in all.

     archie, doc, and vig look disoriented, point their pistols
     around as black robes appear and lead the shiites away.

                         vig
               what's going on?

     the robes lead the shiites to a 4 foot high tunnel entrance
     in a mound of desert earth and disappear into it.

     vig stands and rubs his one good eye. doc grabs vig by the
     arm and pulls him back toward the tunnel.

                         doc
               get in the tunnel.

     vig jerks his arm away.

                         vig
               troy.

     doc grabs vig.

                         doc
               you're gonna die.

     vig punches doc in the side of the head. doc punches vig in
     the stomach. they fall to the ground, fighting.

     archie searches for troy in the brown haze.

                         archie gates
               barlow.

     two black-robed figures pull vig off doc and drag him to the
     tunnel. another robed figure pulls doc to the tunnel.

     archie walks, looks for troy, chokes, vomits into the sand.
     a black robed figure takes him by the arm and pulls him back
     to the tunnel, where they disappear inside.
