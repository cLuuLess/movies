     captain van meter, general horn, and two radio decoders stand
     looking at logs of transmissions.

                         captain van meter

                         general horn
               narrow it down to what sounds like
               archie gates and a humvee.

     a humvee with havichon and walter drives by behind the
     oblivious general, leading a convoy of several trucks.

                         general horn
               i want a direction, we're not
               gonna comb the whole goddamn
               desert --

     a private runs up and hands general horn a paper.

                         private
               this is from barlow's c.o. at fort
               bragg, something with his wife.

                         general horn
                      (reads)
               fort bragg? i'll be damned.

     walter and hash drive past smithson and paco and cathy.

                         bill smithson
               where the hell is he going now?

                         cathy daitch
               i say we keep watching the general.

     she takes off and smithson follows her.
