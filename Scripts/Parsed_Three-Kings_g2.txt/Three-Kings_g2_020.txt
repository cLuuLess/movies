     ext. desert marsh - day

     raging oil fires, 50 feet high -- billowing black smoke.
     walter drives the motorcycle through the smoke. paco the
     cameraman sits on back. bill smithson sits in the sidecar.

                         bill smithson
               this is boring, i already did this
               damn story, goddamn it, where the
               hell is the gold?

                         walter
               how about rare pelican migration
               out by the marshes?

                         bill smithson
               what?

                         walter
               these brave pelicans are migrating
               in spite of massive pollution --

                         bill smithson
               fuck that. stop the bike.

     walter keeps driving.
