     ext. bunker number two - day

     archie, doc, and the interrogator charge out of the bunker
     with vuitton luggage and put it onto the ox cart troy has
     rigged. archie and doc stop and stare in shock --
     soldiers 6 & 7 drag and beat shiites; 5 wounded men and women
     lie on the ground bleeding. a cuffed iraqi guard kneels with
     a bleeding head. five soldiers continue to encircle someone
     (the shiite woman). the man in glasses and the little girl
     pray in arabic as they bow on the ground.

     troy and vig stare back at archie, looking tense.

     the iraqi major greets the interrogator warmly and they
     embrace. then the major salutes archie.

                         iraqi major
               you take the kuwaiti gold, yes?

                         archie gates
               we take the kuwaiti gold. yes.

                         iraqi major
               saddam cannot keep.

                         archie gates
               no, saddam cannot keep.

                         iraqi major
               saddam have too many problem today.

                         archie gates
               he certainly does.

     shiites run past throwing rocks at iraqi soldiers 6 & 7 who
     tackle and pummel them to the ground.

                         iraqi major
               you need help to load?

                         archie gates
               we can do it ourselves.

     the major turns and shouts --

                         iraqi major
               hazal jarat finan.

     iraqis 6 & 7 jog over. the soldiers are out of breath.

                         iraqi major
               these man help you.

                         interrogator
               you go away fast from this
               bullshit.

     archie looks at one soldier's hands.

     close up: blood on the iraqi soldier's knuckles and wrists.

     pan up to the faces of the iraqi soldiers.

                         archie gates
               let's load up and get out of here.
