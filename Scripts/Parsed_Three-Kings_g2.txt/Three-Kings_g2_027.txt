     int. inner room, second iraqi bunker - day

     archie and troy burst in, pointing their guns aggressively.

                         troy
               freeze.

     a large room; walls lined with shelves full of brand new
     appliances: blenders, cuisinarts, cd players, small tvs. a
     huge portrait of saddam hussein covers one wall.

     a television plays a rerun of 'happy days' in arabic.

     another tv: cnn's first reports of the rodney king beating.

     an iraqi captain sits in a chair in front of the tvs.

     two iraqis sit loading rifles. two others sit at a radio.

     they all jump to their feet when archie bursts in, except for
     the officer watching 'happy days' and cnn..

                         archie gates
               by order of the cease-fire signed
               in safwan, march 3, the united
               states marines hereby confiscate
               all material stolen by iraq from
               the emirate of kuwait --

     one of the rifle-loading iraqis tries to run. troy heads him
     off with his pistol --

                         troy
               down.

     the other rifle-loader stands looking scared.

                         iraqi rifle-loader
               isnam panan fatwa aznir --

     whip pan to doc, who turns the shortwave radio off, pushes
     the two iraqis to the ground. one goes peacefully, the other
     resists; doc smacks him in the side of the head with his
     pistol, which fires accidentally. everyone grabs their heads
     and ducks -- except archie.

                         archie gates
               never hit anyone with your pistol,
               doc.

                         doc
               sorry about that.

     archie is offered a cuisinart by the iraqi captain.

                         iraqi captain
               for wife.

                         archie gates
               i've been divorced three times.

     troy has one rifle iraqi on the ground, but the second is on
     his knees, putting a cd into a mini-stereo.

                         rifle iraqi #2
               newest and best.

                         troy
               no, newest and best has better
               noise reduction.

     the iraqi looks puzzled.

                         troy
               less distortion. get down on the
               floor, ok?

     he pushes the man face down, cuffs his hands. olivia newton-
     john's "i wanna get physical" plays.

                         troy
               this is bad music, understand?
               it's bad for you.

                         doc (o.s.)
               hey --

     whip pan to the resistant iraqi struggles to break away and
     doc punches him in the head twice, the iraqi starts crying.

                         archie gates
                      (to iraqi captain)
               where's the gold, captain? tell us
               so we don't have to kill you.

                         troy
               there's another room over here.

     pan to troy pointing to a narrow door in a corner of the
     room. archie kicks it open.
