     int. iraqi bunker - day

     they pass through a cluttered room with six cots, down a
     hallway, to a larger room where two more young iraqi soldiers
     sit watching cnn. there is a defaced poster of saddam, two
     peacocks and three monkeys in the room, and the half-eaten
     carcass of a zebra. the soldiers rise and half-bow to archie.

                         friendly iraqi soldier
               food? you give food?

                         archie gates
               we don't have any food.

                         doc
               where'd you get these animals from?

                         imam
               this is for you, my friend, to eat
               if you are hungry.

     the iraqi soldier offers a live monkey to archie.

                         archie gates
               no, thank you.

                         imam
               they're not barbarians, they're
               starving.

                         doc
               i'm getting really dizzy, man.

     vig sticks out a white tongue and nods.

                         archie gates
               we need water.

                         friendly iraqi soldier
               water all gone. no one have water.

                         archie gates
               no radio, no water, but yes cnn.

     the other iraqis nod their heads and laugh nervously.

                         friendly iraqi soldier
               george bush get rid saddam.

                         archie gates

                         friendly iraqi soldier
               congratulation!

     he embraces archie, who looks at imam.

                         archie gates
               would you explain to these
               gentlemen that we need a vehicle
               of some kind?
