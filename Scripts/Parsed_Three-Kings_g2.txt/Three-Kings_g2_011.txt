     ext. desert - moving humvee - morning

     bach's gloria, from mass in b minor plays as

     pow pow pow, vig fires his big pistol into the desert.

                         doc
               pull.

     troy throws a painted football into the desert. doc fires the
     m-16 and blows the ball to pieces.

     archie drives and moves his hand to the bach.

     the convertible humvee is loaded with weaponry and gear, a
     mounted 60 mm machine gun, a bart simpson doll on the grill.

     the humvee rolls into the vast desert, littered with burned
     out tanks, black craters, overturned vehicles, no people.

                         doc
               pull.

     troy throws another ball, doc blows it away.

                         troy
               pull.

     doc throws a football from the moving humvee, troy fires a
     pistol and misses the ball as it bounces to the desert.

                         troy
               i gave you a better arc, doc.

                         doc
               what are you talking about?

                         troy
               i threw the ball in a higher arc
               that was easier for you to hit.

                         doc
               bullshit.

                         vig
               blacks make better receivers than
               quarterbacks.

                         troy
               stop speaking right now, conrad.

                         doc
               warren moon is an excellent
               quarterback.

                         vig
               the oilers have gone nowhere
               behind warren moon.

                         doc
               randall cunningham.

                         troy
               don't get down in the mud with
               him, doc.

                         vig
               the eagles will never get to the
               superbowl with him.

     archie moves his hand to the bach.

                         doc
               doug williams took the redskins to
               the superbowl and won, ok?

                         troy
               we can all agree there are many
               excellent black quarterbacks.

     doc throws a ball. vig fires his giant pistol twice and
     misses.

                         doc
               hit it, you sorry-assed cracker --

                         vig
               this gun's too heavy to shoot
               one-handed like a movie star --

     vig fires: blam, blam, bam. the humvee stops abruptly.

                         archie gates
               shut the fuck up.

     they sit in embarrassed silence; the joyous bach choir plays.
