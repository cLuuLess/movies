     ext. infiniti

     vig and the shiite bail out of the moving infiniti. wads of
     plastic explosive are taped to the grill of the car as it
     speeds towards the bunker, then drifts to the side --

                         vig
               go straight, go straight --

     he jumps up and down and points, but the infiniti goes far to
     the side of the bunker and explodes into some ruins. the two
     guards point their guns at vig and the shiite and they run
     into the desert as bullets pop around them.
