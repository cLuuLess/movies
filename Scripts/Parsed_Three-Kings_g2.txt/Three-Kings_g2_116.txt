     ext. bunker

     slow to freeze frame mid-stride -- with just the sound of the
     chopper: archie, doc, troy, three abreast, mid-stride.

     resume regular speed -- doc unleashes the football.

     pan to - slightly slow motion -- the ball hits the chopper
     broadside and the chopper explodes into a ball of fire.

     slightly slow motion: the chopper comes crashing to the
     ground in a heap of metal. the rotary spins off, whips over
     archie, troy, and doc's heads and smashes into the bunker.

     silence.

     troy and doc look at each other, and punch their fists
     together. troy notices that he's wet his pants.

                         archie gates
               we're not done. check every iraqi
               here.

     archie rolls over bodies lying on the ground, pulls out their
     weapons. troy and doc take rifles from wounded iraqis.

                         troy
                      (agitated)
               where's conrad?

                         archie gates
               don't let your guard down.

     doc nervously scans the area with his pistol pointed.

     50 shiite prisoners start streaming out of the bunker.

                         archie gates
               stay there, don't move.

     imam directs the shiites to stay clustered near the bunker.

                         imam
               jakar yizam ut naral --

                         troy
               how are we getting back?

                         doc
               we got the rolls.

     an iraqi soldier jumps up just as archie knocks him to the
     ground from behind and twists the gun away. doc binds the
     soldier's hands with a plastic cuff.

                         troy
               you got a rolls?

                         archie gates
               it's been a busy day.

     archie pulls pistols from the bloody bodies of the two iraqis
     in the chopper.

                         troy
               hey. that's a convertible.

     he points to the flaming wrecked infiniti.

                         archie gates
               keep your fucking guard up.

                         troy
               is that leather interior?

                         doc
               i think he's in shock.

                         troy
               it's a fucking infiniti
               convertible, isn't it?

                         doc
               yes.

                         troy
               ok. so i owe you a car. i'm not in
               shock.

                         archie gates
               we can talk about cars later, ok?

                         troy
               freeze --

     he points his pistol at imam.

                         imam
               take it easy.

                         troy
               who is this guy?

                         archie gates
               he's with us.

     troy and imam look at each other a moment, troy still points
     his pistol at imam.

                         troy
               you're the guy with the little
               girl.

                         imam
               that's right.

                         troy
               what are you doing here?

                         archie gates
               he helped us find you.

                         troy
               all right. you're all right.

     he hugs imam.

                         troy
               how's your girl?

                         imam
               she's safe. for the moment.

                         troy
               all right. excellent. how can we
               help?

                         doc
               calm down, man.

                         troy
               i'm calm. don't i look calm?

                         imam
               we had a deal to get us to the
               border, but we need more vehicles
               for these people.

     troy moves nervously.

                         troy
               we're gonna work it out. we can do
               it. we have to work it out.

                         doc
               i'm not sure how. this is a lot of
               people.

                         troy
               ok, you choose who we take. you
               tell the others it's not
               convenient, they'll have to die.

                         doc
               take it easy, man.

                         troy
               you think i don't know what i'm
               saying. i know what i'm saying.
               we're gonna do more than steal,
               that's what i'm saying. we're
               gonna help these people out.

                         imam
               this guy was worth saving.

                         archie gates
               he's a soldier.

     troy and archie look at each other, smile slightly.

                         vig (o.s.)
               yes. yes. all right.

     they all turn to look.

     wide shot -- vig pops up in the desert, 150 yards away.

                         vig
               you made it.

     vig comes running.

                         vig
               i thought that was you. yeah.

     troy smiles as he steps in the direction of vig. suddenly a
     rifle shot rings out, troy jumps.

     slightly slow motion -- vig is hit in the collar bone, only
     the sound of the bullet smashing his flesh and bone. he is
     jerked, falls to his knees, but gets up, keeps staggering
     toward troy, 125 yards away.

     troy looks stunned.

     archie turns sharply to his right and fires a rifle.

     an iraqi soldier, 150 yards to the side, drops to the ground
     as archie and doc continue to hit him with gunfire.

     troy runs as hard as he can toward vig.

                         archie gates
               cover him.

     doc looks around frantically with his pistol pointed. archie
     scans the area and directs 3 shiite riflemen to spread out.

                         archie gates
               lock it down. shoot anything that
               moves.

                         imam
                      (translates)
               haza janav yasat.

     troy runs, catches the staggering vig in his arms and
     embraces him. blood runs from vig's mouth, onto troy's
     shoulder, as vig tries to talk.

                         vig
               you made it, man --

     troy cries as he runs with vig in his arms.

                         troy
               help him.

     doc takes vig from troy's arms and carefully lays him on the
     ground, cradling his head in his lap. vig spits blood.

                         vig
               what happened to the jesus fire,
               doc?

                         doc
               it's around you right now, man, it
               works on this side or the other
               side.

                         vig
               you never told me that part. i
               guess i could go to one of them
               shrines that erase the bad you
               did --

                         troy
               we made the right choice today,
               conrad.

                         vig
               we did good, right?

                         troy
               we made the right choice.

     the hole in vig's collar bone is pumping out blood. troy puts
     his hands over it. doc looks sad and scared as he tries to
     turns vig's head to help him breathe.

                         doc
               dear lord watch over this man,
               help him if you can. our father
               who art in heaven --

     50 shiites -- children and adults -- sit on the ground near
     the bunker watch from afar.

     troy stands up looking around helplessly.

                         troy
               help.

                         doc
               -- hallowed be thy name, thy
               kingdom come, thy will be done --

     a gunshot rings out and -- slightly slow motion -- hits troy
     in the lower right chest -- and comes out again three inches
     over, piercing a thin piece of his side -- with only the
     sound of tearing tissue. troy looks stunned as he is spun
     around by the shot.

     archie spins around in the desert and looks at troy.

                         archie gates
               goddamn it.

     he runs hard across the desert toward troy.

     troy falls next to vig and they look at each other.

     troy's eyes are wide with pain as he breathes with great
     difficulty -- rasping.
