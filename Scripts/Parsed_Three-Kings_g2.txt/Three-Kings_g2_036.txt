     ext. bunker - day

     troy runs out the front door.

                         troy
               conrad, we need a trailer --

     the iraqi major stares coldly at troy. troy stares at the two
     soldiers beating shiites; five others clustered around the
     woman on the ground.

                         vig
               did you get it? troy, did you get
               it?

                         troy
               yeah, we got it.

                         vig
               is it a lot?

                         troy
               yeah, it's a lot.

     later

     troy and vig untangle, with difficulty, an ox cart from a
     messy pile of old ox carts against a bombed out building.
     troy looks troubled --

                         troy
                      (under his breath)
               'little deuce coupe with a fiat
               head mill, she'll walk a
               thunderbird like it's standin'
               still --'

     close up a shiite man is smashed in the face with a club.

     close up troy pulls a heavy chain from the humvee.

                         troy
               'she'll do a hundred and forty
               with the top end floored --'

     the little girl with arm casts is screaming while her father,
     the man in glasses, tries to hold her.

     troy and vig quickly chain the ox cart to the humvee.

                         troy
               'she's my little deuce coupe --'
