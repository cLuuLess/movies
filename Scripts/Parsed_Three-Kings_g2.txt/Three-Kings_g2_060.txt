                         troy
               how's she doing?

                         darlene
               she hasn't been sleeping good, and
               mamma had to go back to work, so
               i'm real, real tired, baby.

               date yet. listen --

                         darlene

                         darlene
               what was that?

                         troy
               the wall just exploded.

                         darlene
               i thought the war was over, honey.

                         troy

               do me a favor and call the c.o. on

                         troy

               near 223 north outside karbala --

                         darlene
               what do you mean 'stuck'? i
               thought the war was over.

                         troy

               want you to worry, i tried to do
               something for the family,  and i

     another mortar smashes through the wall, covers troy in dust.

                         troy
               that i love you.

                         darlene
               what's happening, troy?

                         troy
               tell krystal --

     soldiers push at the door, trying to open it.

                         darlene
               troy?

                         troy
               tell krystal i'm a rich man and if
               things work out she'll be taken
               care of no matter what --

                         darlene
               what are you talking about?

     the door is kicked open and soldiers enter.

                         troy
               gotta go, gooney-bird, i love you--

     the soldiers punch troy in the face, drag him from the room.

                         darlene
               troy?

     she waits for a moment, tears in her eyes, and hangs up.
