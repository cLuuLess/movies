     ext. right side of bunker

     archie skids the mercedes to a halt on the right side of the
     bunker, jumps out, slams the door, followed by imam and the
     two other shiites.

     they run toward the bunker, archie with a wad of plastic
     explosive and nails in one hand and a cigarette lighter in
     the other. he hears the chirp of a car alarm being activated
     as he runs to the bunker.

     imam finds a vent hole on the low facade of the bunker, pulls
     off a grill. archie lights a fuse sticking out of the plastic
     explosive, and drops it into the vent.
