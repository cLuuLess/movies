     int. front door of bunker - day

     archie's in great pain. he grimaces as he tightens the
     bandage around his forearm. troy is shaking uncontrollably.
     doc grabs troy's shoulders firmly.

                         archie gates
               we're gonna get out of here alive,
               just do what i say, do you hear me?

     troy nods. archie pulls one of the football bombs wrapped in
     c-4 from his small pack, and hands it to doc.

     archie pretends to throw with nothing in his hand.

                         archie gates
               step, throw, one-two -- i'm gonna
               give it a five second fuse. that
               gives you two steps out the door.

     pan across troy and doc listen intently.

     archie cuts the fuse on the ball with his knife.

     the three of them stand at the door, ready. archie holds his
     pistol ready. doc holds the football, troy holds the lighter.

                         archie gates
               wait --
