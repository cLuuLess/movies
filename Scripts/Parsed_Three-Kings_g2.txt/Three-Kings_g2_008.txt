     int. captain's tent - day

     splash -- rubbing alcohol is poured over vig's extended hand
     by doc elgin, 25, stocky, black, no nonsense.

                         troy
               you've washed your hands like a
               thousand times, conrad.

                         vig
               lord knows what vermin live in the
               butt of a dune koon.

                         doc
               why do you let this cracker follow
               you around?

                         troy
               he's a good kid.

                         doc
               he's a wall-eyed cracker.

                         troy
               he's got no high school, man, he's
               from a group home in jackson --

                         doc
               i don't give a shit if he's from
               johannesburg. i don't want to hear
               dune koon or sand nigger from him
               or anybody.

                         vig
               captain uses those terms.

                         troy
               the point is, conrad, 'towel head'
               and 'camel jockey' are perfectly
               good substitutes.

                         doc
               exactly.

                         vig
               i'm sorry, man, it's a little
               confusing is all.

                         doc
               what can i do for your headache?

     doc elgin opens a case full of pill bottles.

                         troy
               got any vicadan?

                         doc
               all gone. how about caffergot?

                         troy
               excellent. let's translate my
               iraqi ass map.

     troy pops the pills, doc pulls a document from a folder and
     opens it as he hovers over a table with troy and vig.

                         troy
               van meter's at the big pow wow?

                         doc
               we're cool for at least three
               hours, but keep walter on the door.

     walter stands by the door wearing night vision goggles.


                         troy
               would you take those fucking
               things off?

                         walter
               i never got to use night vision.

                         troy
               they don't work during the day and
               stand outside the tent.

     doc unfolds a big aerial-photo map of the iraqi desert, next
     to the rumpled ass map.

                         doc
               these are definitely saddam's
               bunkers near karbala.

                         troy
               what's inside?

                         doc
               according to intelligence --
               picasso, armani, rolex, mercedes,
               sony you name it --  kuwait was
               muslim beverly hills and saddam
               sacked it.

                         vig
               man, get an awesome stereo system
               with like ten bos speakers  --

                         troy
               silver lexus convertible.

                         doc
               lexus doesn't make a convertible.

                         troy
               yes, they do.

                         doc
               infiniti has one coming.

                         troy
               you're wrong.

                         doc
               you can't get a car home from here
               anyway.

                         troy
               if i get enough rolexes i could
               buy one when i got home.

                         vig
               one gold rolex, i get a very fine
               split level outside jackson.

                         troy
               my one problem, see, is the risk
               here --

                         doc
               what risk? we already did the
               risk. i signed up last year to
               bank some computer training--

                         troy
               tell me about it.

                         doc
               next thing i know i'm sitting here
               waiting to get hit by a scud. i
               put my life on the line for what
               purpose i'm not sure, and now the
               good lord puts this map in my
               path --

                         troy
               he could put a land mine in your
               path if we try to find this
               place --

                         doc
               you're safe with me.

                         troy
               cuz you have a galactic plutonium
               forcefield.

                         doc
               i don't talk about it. but i do
               have a ring of jesus fire.

                         troy
               you have a ring of jesus fire.

                         doc
               i was fire baptized.

                         vig
               i was baptized in water.

                         doc
               i'm fire baptized.

                         troy
               i don't even know what water
               baptism means.

                         doc
               for those who understand, no
               explanation is necessary; for
               those who don't, no explanation
               will suffice. you can benefit from
               my jesus ring if you do right by
               me, you got that?

                         troy
               ok.

                                              cut to

     pov walter's night vision --

     blurry image of archie walking right up to walter.

                         walter
               this tent is restricted --

                         archie gates
               get the fuck out of my way.

                         walter
               may day, may day --

                                              cut to

     troy and doc scramble to put the maps under the table.

                         archie gates
               good afternoon.

     he walks up to them.

                         archie gates
               would this be the proctology tent?

                         doc
               yes, sir, i mean, no, sir.

                         archie gates
               then maybe it's the urology tent.

                         troy
               captain's at a staff meeting.

                         archie gates
               that's ok, i'm not looking for a
               proctologist or a urologist i'm
               looking for sargeant barlow.

     archie fixes his gaze on troy, walks up, reaches under the
     table, and takes the map, smells his fingers.

                         archie gates
               you're on the path to truth when
               you smell shit, isn't that what
               they say?

                         vig
               i don't recognize you, sir. are
               you in this division?

                         doc
               he's not in this division. he's
               special forces.

     troy and vig are impressed.

                         doc
               he's the guy taking bill smithson
               around.

                         archie gates
               and you would be the three wise
               men, right, mappy, slappy, and
               pappy -- 

     he points in order to doc, vig, and troy, who picks up his
     family photo button.

                         archie gates
               that leaves cappy outside.

                                              cut to

     walter, outside the tent, practices blocking positions.

                         walter
               damn. freeze. do not pass. hold
               it, freeze. stop. freeze.

                                              cut to

                         vig
               his name is walter.

                         archie gates
               did you good soldiers present this
               map to captain van meter?

                         troy
               not yet.

                         archie gates
               then i'll take it to him.

     troy stands and grabs the map.

                         troy
               we'll take it to him. sir.

                         archie gates
               it won't do either of us any good
               then, will it?

                         troy
               he's our commander, sir. we'd have
               to tell him you took it.

     both troy and archie hold the map, staring at each other.
     everyone is tense.

                         archie gates
               it could be nothing but a sandy
               love letter from one eye-raqi to
               another --

                         troy
               it's a series of bunkers near
               karbala.

                         archie gates
               maybe.

                         troy
               not maybe, definitely. recon
               photos match the map.

                         archie gates
               may i look at the goddamn map?

     troy lets go. archie holds the map up to the light. he then
     pours some of doc's rubbing alcohol on the map, and holds it
     to the light again. he puts the map on the table, turns the
     light off and clicks on an infra-red flashlight he pulls out.
     a completely different map appears in green markings.

                         vig
               dag.

                         archie gates
               that's what makes rangers badass,
               we get the best flashlights.

     they stare at the new map in the infrared glow, captivated.

                         archie gates
               still looks like a series of three
               bunkers in three villages. a bit
               farther to the west.

                         doc
               seventy-five klicks north.

                         archie gates
               more like 65.

                         troy
               much closer to karbala.

                         archie gates
               leave at dawn, back by lunch, not
               a big deal. of course --

     he turns the overhead light back on.

                         archie gates
               -- there could be nothing inside
               but starving arabs and stolen
               watches, but i think it's worth
               checking out, even if i have to do
               it with clueless reservists like
               you.

     they look at him.

                         archie gates
               i mean, i could take the map, but
               you could talk, it starts to
               become a pain in the ass for me,
               so we'll do the gold together.

                         doc
               what gold?

                         archie gates
               you don't even know what's inside
               these bunkers, do you?

                         vig
               rolexes.

                         archie gates
               rolexes are swell, but i'm talking
               about kuwaiti bullion.

                         vig
               you mean the little cubes you put
               in hot water for soup?

                         archie gates
               no. not the little cubes you put
               in hot water for soup.

                         troy
               gold bricks.

                         archie gates
               5 kilos each, $50,000 in today's
               market.

                         vig
               for one gold brick?

                         archie gates
               i'm sure mr. hussein has divided
               his bricks. into many different
               hiding places, but just one hiding
               place should be easy to take, and
               that would be enough to get us out
               of our day jobs. unless the three
               kings are in love with their day
               jobs.

               humvee and all that --

                         archie gates
               we do this shit all the time.

                         vig
               what else did you do, sir?

                         archie gates
               in panama we went sailing in
               noriega's boats.

                         troy
               wow.

                         archie gates
               in vietnam, we got a big gold
               buddha, which we unfortunately
               dropped in a swamp by accident.

                         doc
               what about iraqi soldiers?

                         archie gates
               let's see. they had the shit
               bombed out them for two months,
               they're deserting all over the
               place, and they've completely
               surrendered to us. that's a beaten
               army in every sense of the word.

     he looks at them.

                         archie gates
               you are now under my command,
               salute --

     they salute him. he straightens troy's salute.

                         archie gates
               what's the guy's name outside?

                         troy
               walter.

                         archie gates
               cappy.

     walter comes in.

                         archie gates
               you will take bill smithson on a
               special mission to find the gold
               story, but it will be a
               meaningless ride that lasts all
               morning and takes him nowhere near
               karbala, is that clear?

                         walter
               how am i gonna get out of the
               company?

                         archie gates
               your captain will be detained by
               a friend of mine.

                         vig
               is it true you got to take an
               enemy ear to be special forces?

                         archie gates
               no, but if you talk to anybody
               about this, i'll kill you.

     vig smile fades as he looks into archie's cold stare.
