     int. oasis bunker - day

     close on -- head of a golf clubdriver: "made in usa."
     interrogator holds the golf club near the head, paces.

                         interrogator

               make good living for family, good
               car, good house, and now my son is
               dead.

               i signed up for the extra cash,
               too.

               got training and guns from america.

                         troy
               not from america.

                         interrogator
               oh, yeah, specialist guys come to
               iraq, train us when we fight iran.

                         troy

               weapons, sabotage. interrogation.

                         troy
               great.

     the interrogator lights a marlboro, exhales.

     push in to close up on troy's face as the smoke envelopes him.

     fantasy -- int. troy's bedroom - torrance

     darlene looks up and beams as troy walks into the room, they
     embrace on the bed.

                         interrogator (o.s.)
               so what we get from this dirty
               iraq war you and me, huh?

     fantasy - troy

     holds the naked baby against his naked chest.

                         troy
                      (whispers)
               i don't know.

     back to scene

                         interrogator
                      (laughs)
               you don't fahking know, right?! we
               all scahmbag soldier who get
               fahked, right?

                         troy
               right.

     interrogator laughs and takes a practice golf swing.

                         troy
               so why are you doing this to me?

                         interrogator
               it's my job, man, for saddam, just
               like your job when you bomb my
               house.

                         troy
               it's not just a job, it still
               matters what you do.

                         interrogator
               bullshit. it's all a job.

                         troy
               it still matters what you do, what
               you're doing right now matters.

                         interrogator
               bullshit.

                         troy
               the art of war is not for killing
               people, it's a stratagem to give
               life to many with minimum
               violence, minimum --

                         interrogator
               then why you bomb my fahking house
               and kill my son? can you think how
               it feels inside your heart if i
               bomb your daughter?

     fantasy - slow motion - a missile

     silently destroys troy's suburban house.

     back to scene

                         troy
               worse than death --

                         interrogator
               it feels like this --

     holding the driver at the head, he raps the bridge of troy's
     nose.

                         troy
               don't --

                         interrogator
               everyday, inside my heart --

     he raps troy's nose repeatedly to make his point.

                         interrogator
               like this, like this, like this --

     he breaks troy's nose with a crack.
