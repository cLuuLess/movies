     ext. desert - day

     the six iraqis who took oft from the bunker are still
     running. their conversation is in arabic and subtitled in
     english.

                         tough iraqi
               let's go back and get them.

                         iraqi #2
               fuck a donkey, no way.

                         tough iraqi
               there's a chopper, we can do it.

     he and another iraqi stop while the other two keep running.

                         tough iraqi
               they killed your families, you
               fucking cowards.

     the tough iraqi and his partner, sweating profusely, out of
     breath, split up and head back toward the bunker.
