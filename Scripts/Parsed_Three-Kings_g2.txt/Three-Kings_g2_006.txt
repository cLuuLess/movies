     int. television truck - day

     in the half-light of dozens of tv monitors playing iraqi news
     from around the world, archie gates madly humps cathy daitch
     on a lawn chair which is slamming into the monitors.

                         cathy daitch
               you are a trained warrior, trained
               warrior, trained warrior, jesus
               christ, colonel!

     tv monitors crash to the floor as she climaxes. archie lays
     on the floor catching his breath, stares at a sideways
     monitor of soldiers celebrating; she stands, dresses.

                         cathy daitch
                      (breathless)
               what's bill got?

                         archie gates
               just the celebration story.

                         cathy daitch
               that's it?

                         archie gates
               that's it --

                         archie gates
               how about you? did you find
               anything?

                         cathy daitch
               it could be another bullshit lead
               but i need you to help me find a
               guy who might have something on
               the gold --

                         archie gates
               who's the guy?

                         cathy daitch

               b--

                         archie gates
               barlow.

                         cathy daitch
               got a map out of a prisoner's head.

                         archie gates
               out of a prisoner's head?

                         cathy daitch
               or his ear, or his ass, or his
               dick, and they got like a fifty
               page full-color mini atlas of
               saddam's bunkers --

                         archie gates
               out of a guy's dick?

     the door explodes open and two mps grab archie, pants around
     his ankles, and drag him from the truck.
