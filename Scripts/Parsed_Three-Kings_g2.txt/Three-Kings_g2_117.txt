     int. troy's rib cage

     his breathing creates an air pocket, crushing his organs to
     the left side.

     troy's pov

     looking up at doc, who is saying something to troy, but
     there's no sound except troy's labored breathing

     the pov turns to the side -- vig is no longer breathing.

     flashback to the opening scene, but with weird, muffled
     sound

                         soldier #5
               take my picture.

                         vig
               do you still want to sell pictures?

                         troy
                      (distracted monotone)
               for twenty.

                         soldier #5
               twenty bucks?

                         vig
               war's been over five days, ain't
               gonna be any more of this, jim.

                         soldier #5
               twenty dollars, man, what's the
               meaning of life?

                         troy
               you're lucky you got to see
               anybody shot in this war.

                         soldier #5
               bobby, take my picture.

     he holds the camera out.

                         soldier #4
               if he shot the guy, it's up to him.

                         soldier #5
               it's not like he shot a fucking
               deer. it's the enemy.

                         vig
               it's troy's enemy, yours for
               twenty.

     back to the scene - close up

     troy lies on the ground, trying to breathe, eyes wide.

     troy's pov

     archie and imam step into frame. archie looks down at troy,
     opens his waist pack, pulls out a sterile wrapped scalpel.

     troy's pov turns to the side --

     fish eye lens - the jaguar pulls up in slightly slow motion.

     imam's little girl gets out of the passenger side, slightly
     slow motion, no sound. imam scolds her and gesticulates,
     indicating she should be back with the others where it is
     safe. the little girl embraces imam and stares down at troy
     over her father's shoulder.
