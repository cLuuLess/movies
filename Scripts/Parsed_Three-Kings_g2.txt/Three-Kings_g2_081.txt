     int. interrogation room - oasis bunker - day

     the interrogator finishes putting tissue in troy's bleeding
     nose.

                         troy
               your son wouldn't be dead if
               saddam didn't invade kuwait.

     fantasy - iraqi soldiers

     smash the windows of a benneton store, then a cartier store.

                         interrogator (o.s.)
               i know.

                         troy (o.s.)
               i heard about some bad shit that
               happened there.

     fantasy - iraqi soldiers

     drag patients from their hospital beds and an iraqi soldier
     dives on top of a crying nurse and starts to rape her while
     a baby is taken from an incubator, which is stolen.

     back to the scene

                         troy
               who's got the sick country?

                         interrogator
               maybe saddam is very crazy, right?
               and then you are crazy to bomb all
               of iraq.

                         troy
               too much bombing is crazy, but not
               saving kuwait.

                         interrogator
               you come here to save kuwait
               people?

                         troy
               yes.

                         interrogator
               really?
                      (to the second iraqi)
               jahaza fan.

     the second iraqi dips a bucket into an oil drum.

                         interrogator
               lots of people in trouble around
               this world, my man. you don't
               fight no fahking war for them.

                         troy
               you invaded another country. you
               can't do that.

                         interrogator
               why not, dude?

                         troy
               it makes the world crazy. you got
               to keep it stable.

                         interrogator
               for what? your pick up truck?

                         troy
               no, for stability. stabilize the
               region.

     the interrogator pulls a cd from troy's pocket and jams it
     into troy's mouth.

                         interrogator
               this is your fahking stability, my
               main man.

     the interrogator uses the cd as a funnel to force-feed the
     crude oil into troy's mouth as he pours it from the bucket.
