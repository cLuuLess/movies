     archie crouches low to the ground, moving quickly,
     secretively. he turns and makes a hand signal to, doc, 20

     high wide shot: a lone iraqi military truck, mint condition.'

     archie, vig, and doc form a semicircle, surrounding the

               this is the united states army.
               come out of the truck with your
               weapons in the air.

     no response. suddenly vig's pistol fires.

                         vig
               shit. sorry.

     his gunshot blows a hole in the iraqi truck -- which deflates
     like a huge beach ball, circling wildly until it lies in a
     heap of collapsed camouflage canvass while 50 yards away --

     desert to look. doc lifts the limp canvass of the deflated
     truck.

               deserters. maybe they got
               something.

     high wide shot: they walk in a single file line in the
     desert.  archie in front, carries a vuitton bag.
