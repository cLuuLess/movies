     troy is thrown onto the floor of a cluttered cement bathroom
     with two crude toilets. his clothes are thrown on top of him.

                         iraqi soldier
               get dress.

                         troy
               ok.

                         iraqi soldier
               get dress.

                         troy
               i said ok.

     the door is slammed. stolen blenders, radios, cds, stacks of
     new levis litter the floor. troy kicks all the crap angrily
     and hundreds of cell phones tumble from a box.

     troy looks at the pile of cell phones, picks one up, tries it
     for a dial tone, drops it, tries another, until he gets one
     that gives him a tone and dials.

                         operator (o.s.)
               jalam nafad.

     troy looks stunned.

                         troy
                      (into the cell phone)
               um. do you speak english?

                         operator (o.s.)
                      (british accent)
               yes.

                         troy
                      (into cell phone)
               can you -- i need --

     he frantically pushes stuff on the floor to block the door.

                         operator (o.s.)
               what number, please.

                         troy
               operation desert storm.

                         operator (o.s.)
               i'm sorry?

                         troy
               the big army in the desert, come
               on, it's an emergency.

                         operator (o.s.)
               i don't have that number.

                         troy
               maybe you could -- hello?

     the phone is dead.

                         troy
               fuck.

     he throws it to the ground, tries another, no dial tone,
     throws it, tries another, no dial tone, throws it.

                         troy
               come on, come on, come on.

     he tries another, chucks it, another, gets a dial tone,
     dials, and waits. troy dials a number.

     he waits while the phone rings.
