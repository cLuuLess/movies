     ext. the iranian border

     50 yards ahead -- a low wall of razor wire.

     100 yards beyond it, dozens of iraqi tanks are lined up along
     the border, 100 feet apart, stretching into the distance
     either way. there are 50 iraqi ground troops standing at the
     border station, marked by razor wire on the one-lane road.

     on the far side of the border, iranian soldiers with relief
     workers wearing red crescents wait by white school buses and
     stare at the american convoy.
