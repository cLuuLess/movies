     ext. desert - day

     walter drives the motorcycle, nude, wearing his helmet with
     radio attachment. smithson and paco ride along.

     archie is heard in a crackling radio transmission inside
     walter's helmet. walter speaks into the small mouthpiece.

                         walter
                      (into radio)
               this is tar baby, come in.

                         archie gates (o.s.)
               where are you?

                         walter
                      (into radio)
               about two clicks outside camp.

                         archie gates (o.s.)
               we're about ready for the briar
               patch, over.

                         walter
                      (into the radio)
               right.

     he looks uncertain, worried.

                         archie gates (o.s.)
               you got me, tar baby?

                         walter
               i think so -- who handles the
               briar patch?

                         archie gates (o.s.)
               you do.

                         walter
               oh, ok, and the tar baby goes to
               the briar patch if everything's
               ok, right?

                         archie gates (o.s.)
               no, the other way around.

                         walter
               shit, i'm sorry, sir, i don't
               remember how the code goes --

     intercut with archie, who looks exasperated. he is sweating
     with a fever and his arm hurts.

                         archie gates
               six personnel trucks and a humvee.

                         walter
               wow. that's a tall order for a
               secret operation, sir.

                         archie gates
               talk to my friend hash. each
               driver will get 100k.

                         walter
               did you say 100k?

                         archie gates
               roger. brer rabbit at 239 north.
               add one medavac pack to the order,
               and dump the reporter.

                         walter
               roger. give me two hours.
