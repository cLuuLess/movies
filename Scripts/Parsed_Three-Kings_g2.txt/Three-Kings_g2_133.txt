     ext. iraqi side of the border

     archie stares at the border, thinking.

     imam helps troy down from the truck. doc carries the little
     girl.

                         havichon
               what are you seenking?

                         archie gates
               i see an opening we can walk
               through. but it's not wide enough
               for a truck.

     archie gets out of the humvee and looks at the border.

                         archie gates
               we'll walk them to the border. the
               iranians will take them. we'll
               walk back to the trucks and get
               out of here.

     doc turns and signals to the drivers to come up.

     troy takes the safety off his m-16.

     5 u.s.drivers get out with their rifles ready. they release
     the safeties. havichon, with his leg in a cast, stays back to
     man the mounted machine gun on the humvee. iraqi soldiers on
     the border nervously watch the americans and the shiites,
     holding their machine guns.
