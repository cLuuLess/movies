     ext. bunker - day

                         vig
                      (into the megaphone)
               we are here for your protection
               and safety.

     iraqi women and children kiss vig's feet.

     the five iraqi soldiers exit the bunker with their hands
     raised, and the starved shiite civilians spit and throw
     stones at them while 'i get around' keeps playing.

                         vig
               ya'll be cool now, this is the
               u.s. marines in charge here.
