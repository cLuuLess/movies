     ext. desert

     troy's eyes are wide, staring up at the girl as he has great
     difficulty breathing. archie rolls troy's shirt up, exposing
     troy's chest, with the bullet wound. archie points to a spot
     on troy's upper chest, near the collar bone --

     doc squeezes a small tube of brown disinfectant gel onto this
     spot -- the only sounds are the squirt of the ointment and
     troy's breathing.

     archie looks nervous, then focussed as he brings the shiny
     metal scalpel down. troy is in great pain as he watches
     archie plunge the scalpel into his upper chest. archie twists
     the scalpel to open the incision wide --

     there is a pronounced hissing as trapped air rushes out. huge
     relief comes over troy's face as he breathes normally.

     regular sound fades back in, the first sound is the girl's
     thin, intermittent humming --

     troy's pov from the ground, looking up

                         archie gates
               i've been waiting 18 years to get
               that right.

     he tears open a short i.v. tube and plunges the i.v. into the
     scalpel hole. there is a small valve on the end of the tube,
     which he tightens.

     a gunshot sounds -- archie turns and looks over --
