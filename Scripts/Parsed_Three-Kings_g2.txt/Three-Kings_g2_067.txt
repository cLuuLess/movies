     int. interrogation room, oasis bunker - day

     close up: the hands of an iraqi soldier carefully wrap a bare
     wire around troy's right ear.

                         interrogator
                      (heavy accent)
               what is your rank, bro?

                         troy
               master sargeant.

                         interrogator
               your company?

                         troy
               b company, infantry, united states
               army.

     the wire is wrapped under troy's chin around his other ear.

                         interrogator
               my main man. tell me something,
               ok? what is problem with michael
               jackson?

                         troy
               what do you mean?

                         interrogator
               the king of pop. 'i'm bad, i'm
               bad, you know it --'

                         troy
               yeah, michael jackson.

                         interrogator
               he is fahking the small boys, man.

                         troy
               what are you talking about?

                         interrogator
               he come to egypt with the small
               boys. i see picture in newspaper,
               always he is with the small boys
               in the hotel window. hello with
               the white glove. i am king of pop
               in my hotel with the small boys.
               no girls. just the boys.

                         troy
               he likes kids.

                         interrogator
               yeah, he like to fahk them up the
               ass.

                         troy
               bullshit.

     troy is smashed in the face with a clipboard.  he looks
     angry, and like he could cry at the same time.

                         interrogator
               you are the blind bullshit, my
               main man.  it is so obvious he
               like the small boy so he all the
               time travel with them.

                         troy
               fine.

                         interrogator
               and if it really true? you say --

                         troy
               i say it's sick.

                         interrogator
               that's because you got a sick
               country, bro, you got no respect
               for the children. that's why you
               bomb them over here, right?

                         troy
               i don't think so.

                         interrogator
               michael jackson is pop king of
               sick fahking country.

                         troy
               wrong.

     troy is smashed in the face with the clip board.  blood drips
     from his nose.

                         interrogator
               bullshit wrong, dude. a black man
               make the skin white and the hair
               straight. you know why?

                         troy
               no.

                         interrogator
               your sick fahking country make the
               black man hate hisself, just like
               you hate the arab and the children
               you bomb.

                         troy
               i don't hate children.

                         interrogator
               do they care, buddy?

                         troy
               does who care?

                         interrogator
               do your army care about the shiite
               children? do they come to help?

                         troy
               no, they're not coming.

     the interrogator signals someone o.s. and suddenly voltage
     races through the wire, causing troy to gnash his teeth
     together so hard they chip. he writhes in pain.

                         interrogator
                      (in subtitles)
               that seemed like too much volts.
               you got to build it up slow.

     a second iraqi gestures defensively at a console that is
     connected to the wire around troy's jaw.  a third iraqi
     reaches forward and turns a dial.  the second iraqi murmurs
     defensively and turns the dial back.

                         interrogator
               just figure it out.

     the interrogator turns back to troy.

                         interrogator
               are they coming to help the shiite?

                         troy
               no.

     he is jolted again -- his face contorts, he bites his lip.

                         interrogator
               tell the truth, dudesky. save us
               the big bummer.

     troy starts to cry, represses it. his lip is bleeding.

                         interrogator
               does it hurt?

     troy says nothing.

                         interrogator
               i ask you question, bro.

                         troy
               yes, it hurts.

                         interrogator
               you bomb my family. do you know
               that?

     troy starts shaking slightly.

                         interrogator
               you blow up my home. the whole
               street. my wife is crush by big
               fahking block of concrete. she
               lose her legs, bro, and she got
               nice legs, too. those legs cut off
               now.

     emotion comes into the interrogator's voice as he says this.

                         troy
                      (whispers)
               that's horrible.

                         interrogator
               what?

                         troy
                      (whispers)
               i said, that's horrible.

                         interrogator
               oh, my god, buddy. i didn't even
               told you the horrible part yet.

     the other two guards listen sadly.

                         interrogator
               my son was kill in his bed. did
               you heard that, dude?

                         troy
               yes.

                         interrogator
               he is one years old. he is
               asleeping with his toy doll when.
               the bomb come. you see that guy
               over there?  he lose his daughter
               same way: big usa bomb.

     close up the two guards -- one of them wipes away a tear.

               i have a daughter.

                         interrogator

               safe in ohio without the bombs and
               concrete and all this shit--

                         interrogator (os)
               how old is she?

                         troy (os)
               ten days old.

                         interrogator (os)
               what's her name?

     back to the scene

               krystal.

                         interrogator
               what makes you decide to tell me
               about krystal, my main man?

                         troy
               because we're both fathers.

                         interrogator
               i'm not a father no more, dude,
               remember? my son is dead now.
