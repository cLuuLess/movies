     ext. desert - day

     shiites finish passing 92 vuitton suitcases into a trench.
     the bags are buried. archie drives a stake to mark the spot.

                         archie gates
               we get our man, we come back to
               pick up the gold --

                         imam
               and my people.

                         archie gates
               my gold isn't here, and i mean all
               of it, your people will not
               survive.

     doc and vig pull off distributor caps from the cadillacs and
     limousine (but not the jaguar) and put them in doc's pack.

                         imam
               i understand.

                         archie gates
               ok. let's load and go.

     imam hugs and kisses his daughter goodbye and tries to put
     her, crying, into the arms of an older woman.

                         vig
               wait a second, i want to talk
               about this plan some more --

                         archie gates
               we're going to drive in and get
               troy, exactly like we discussed.

                         vig
               i have a bad feeling like we're
               gonna get wasted.

                         archie gates
               you're scared. it's good to be
               scared when there's guns around.

     vig looks uneasy. archie hums bach's 'gloria' and moves a
     hand in the air, then puts his hands on vig's shoulders and
     sings the bach loud. vig eventually joins in the chorus.

                         doc
               i'm cool. i'm all right.

     he lies down and breathes with a hand on his chest as archie
     and vig keep singing.
