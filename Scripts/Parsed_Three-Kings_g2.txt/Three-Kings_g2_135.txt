     ext. border

                         archie gates
               make a close group.

                         imam
                      (translates)
               jihad yamat -- yamat.

     105 shiites empty the trucks and gather in a crowd that walks
     toward the border. two shiite men carry vig's body, wrapped
     in arabic cloths.

     archie, troy, doc, lead the crowd single file through a
     narrow opening in the razor wire. on the other side, the
     crowd spreads out and keeps walking. archie, troy, and doc
     walk three abreast, 7 feet apart, rifles ready.

     imam and walter are behind, flanking them.

     faces: close dolly - shiite children, women, men, as they
     fearfully walk toward the border. the five u.s. drivers flank
     the shiites on either side, rifles ready.

     pan to - troy suddenly drops to one knee.

                         doc
               let the air out.

                         troy
               it's not the air, i don't know
               what it is --

                         doc
               stay back.

                         troy
               i'm all right. i'm just dizzy or
               something --
