     ext. bunker - day

     the shiite crowd curses and spits on the iraqi soldiers. the
     sargeant is beaten.

     suddenly an iraqi armored truck with a mounted machine gun
     races up and seven iraqi soldiers pour out swinging clubs,
     followed by an iraqi major, about 45. the iraqi soldiers
     savagely beat the shiites.

     vig looks horrified as he watches.

     two soldiers grab the woman from the man with glasses, and
     drag her into a circle with three other soldiers; the ten
     year-old girl with dirty casts on both arms, screams and
     punches at them.

     the man with glasses is held down at knife point.

                         vig
                      (into the megaphone)
               this is the united states military.

     the iraqi major glances over at vig, but the soldiers do not
     stop brutalizing the shiites -- they round up eight more
     shiites and make them lay face down.
