     int. large army tent - night

     "proud to be an american" blasts on as

     troy, wearing a checked arab headdress is paraded on
     shoulders. he holds up a coke can in one hand and a bud can
     in the other, like torches.

                         troy
                      (screaming the song)
               and i'm proud i to be an american,
               where at least i know i'm free.
               and i won't forget the men who
               died, who gave that right to me.
               and i'd gladly stand up; next to
               you and defend her still today.
               cause there ain't no doubt i love
               this land, god bless the u s a --

     soldiers scream and go nuts.

     beer is sputtered from soldiers' mouths.

     "i can't do nothing for ya man" by public enemy blasts.

     walter wogoman, 19, quiet, tall, southern operates two
     parallel boom boxes like a dj.

     a soldier rapidly peels down one bruce lee poster on top of
     another, like a flip-book animating bruce lee. vig wearing
     a bandage across his nose from the fight on the berm does a
     series of cheerleader-like karate arm movements.

     soldiers whip brightly painted toy footballs at troy. he
     whips the balls back, is tackled over a table, crashes.

     soldiers -- vig, walter, others -- scream viscerally as the
     music blasts.  two soldiers fire their fingers like pistols
     at troy on the floor screaming like a fierce animal.

                         troy
               rahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

     vig screams into troy's face at point blank range.

                         vig
               rahhhhhhhhh.

                         troy
               rahhhhhhhhhhhhh.

                         captain van meter
               goddamn it, where the fuck did
               this beer come from we gotta take
               more iraqis prisoner tomorrow.
