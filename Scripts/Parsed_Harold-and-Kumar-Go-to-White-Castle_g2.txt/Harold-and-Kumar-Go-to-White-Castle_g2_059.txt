          65   int. car                                                  65
               harold finally gets the raccoon off of him. he holds it as
               far away from his face as possible. the raccoon's arms and
               legs are scurrying around-- trying to escape.

                                   kumar
                      how the hell did that get in here?

                                   harold
                      shit! it bit my neck! i probably have
                      rabies now or something!

                                 kumar
                           (looking at harold's neck)
                    don't worry. he didn't even break your
                    skin. you'll be fine.

          suddenly, the raccoon coughs up blood onto harold's shirt.

                                 harold
                    oh, that's not good!

          harold turns the raccoon away from him.          the raccoon coughs

          up blood onto kumar.

                                 kumar
                    ahh! dude, get that fucking cancer
                    raccoon away from me!!!

          kumar swerves the car in a panic, as harold opens his window.

          kumar watches as harold chucks the raccoon out the window.

                                 kumar
                    thank christ!
          kumar looks back onto the road, where he sees a pair of

          headlights heading straight for him!

                        harold                                kumar
          shit!!!                                shit!!!
          kumar quickly hits the brakes, as does the other car. harold
          and kumar look at each other, breathing heavily. they watch
          nervously as the other driver exits his car and begins
          walking over to them.

                                   harold
                    uh-oh.
          kumar rolls down his window.         the driver peers inside...

                                 goldstein
                    what the hell do you think you were
                    doing? you almost killed us!
          goldstein sees that it's harold and kumar.

                                   goldstein
                    holy shit!

                                   kumar
                    goldstein?
          harold breathes a sigh of relief.

                                 goldstein
                           (to his car)
                    dude, it's rold and kumar!

               rosenberg gets out of the car and walks over.     harold and
               kumar get out of their car.
