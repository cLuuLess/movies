               kumar takes the first puff of a joint.

                                   kumar
                      i can't believe you were gonna ditch me
                      for the joy luck club. you know what
                      their parties are like.

                                   harold
                      look, what do you want me to say?     i was
                      under pressure.

                                   kumar
                      just say "no"! that's all it takes.      now
                      take a hit of this.
               kumar hands harold the joint...suddenly, a nearby door opens
               and a security guard enters the hall. he sees harold and
               kumar with drugs.

                                   security guard
                      hey, what are you two doing?!
               harold and kumar start running down the hallway.

                      hey, get back here!
               harold and kumar duck around the corner.     they see a door to
               the women's bathroom.

                                     kumar
                      quick.    in here.
               the guys rush into the women's bathroom.
