          94   int. jail cell - continuous                                 94
               harold and tarik are now left all alone in their cell.

                                   harold
                      that was strange.
               suddenly, a loud banging sound is made from a ventilation
               shaft on the ceiling, above one of the officer's desks.

                                   harold
                      what the hell was that?

                                  kumar (o.c.)
                            (from inside the shaft)
                      rold? is that you?

          although his voice is muffled, we can hear kumar's words.
          tarik is very confused.

                              harold
                        (shouting out)
                 kumar?! what the fuck are you doing?!

                              kumar (o.c.)
                 are the cops still there?

                               harold
                 no, they...   wait a second, did you...

                              kumar (o.c.)
                 i called and made up some story about a
                 shooting in millbrook park...

                              harold
                 jesus christ! what did you do that for?!

                              kumar (o.c.)
                 i'm fucking starving! i figured i'd bust
                 you out, and we'd get over to white
                 castle.

                              harold
                 forget it! i don't want to get in any
                 more trouble! i'm already in here because
                 of you!

                              kumar (o.c.)
                 hey, fuck you! what did you want me to
                 do? stand there and take the hit? you
                 know, i've never taken a swing at you
                 before. never.

                              harold
                 well, i never got your car stolen!

                              tarik
                 hey, i'm trying to read here.

                              kumar (o.c.)
                 look, rold, i'm sorry. but you're not
                 the only one dealing with shit. my dad's
                 cutting me off, remember?

                              harold
                 hey asshole, i'm in jail! don't bitch to
                 me about your problems! just leave me
                 alone. i don't want your help.

                              kumar (o.c.)
                 you don't want my help? fine!    i'm outta
                 here!

          we hear a couple banging sounds from the ventilation shaft.
          then a couple more. then a couple more. pouting, harold
          pretends to ignore it.

                                kumar (o.c.)
                 uh...rold?    how do i get out of here?
          tarik rolls his eyes in disbelief.

                              harold
                 how the hell should i know?

                              kumar (o.c.)
                 this isn't good.
          we hear the banging noise again. and again. suddenly, the

          ventilation shaft breaks off the ceiling and kumar falls out

          onto the ground...

                              harold
                 jesus christ.
          tarik shakes his head.

                                kumar
                 ow...my ass.
          kumar gets up and walks over to the cell.

                              kumar
                 you sure you don't want to get out?

                              harold
                 and become a fugitive? are you nuts?
                 the guy has all my information.
          harold points to palumbo's desk, which has the police report,
          harold's i.d., and his laptop.

                               kumar
                 so what? we'll take everything he wrote
                 down about you and leave.
                        (beat)
                 unless you want to stay here all night
                 and not be able to hand your work in
                 tomorrow.
          harold thinks about this for a second.

                                harold
                 fine.    hurry up.
          kumar smiles.   he begins searching for a key.
