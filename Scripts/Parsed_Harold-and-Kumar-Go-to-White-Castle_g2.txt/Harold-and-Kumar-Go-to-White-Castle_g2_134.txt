          151   int. white castle - moments later                            151
                harold and kumar have put three tables together, on which we
                see sixty white castle hamburgers-- each one steaming hot.
                two good-looking guys (jon and hayden) stare at harold and          
                kumar's orders, amazed by their size. they then look at             
                their own orders and realize how worthless they are.                
                harold and kumar are sitting across from one another, looking
                at the smorgasbord in front of them. harold is about to dig

                in, but kumar stops him...

                                    kumar
                       wait...let's do it together.

                harold nods. the guys are having a moment. harold and kumar

                each pick up a burger. slowly, they bring the burgers to

                their mouths...closer...closer...closer...

                harold and kumar take their first bite.   they savor it in

                their mouths as they chew slowly.

          they finish the rest of their first burgers in one bite, and

          then quickly eat two more...

                we see a brief montage of harold and kumar scarfing down the

                burgers and fries. they're crying tears of joy!
