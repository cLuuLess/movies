               the ugly man is driving. kumar is in the front seat, on the
               passenger side. harold is sandwiched between them.

                                   harold
                      thanks for helping us out.

                                   freak show
                      no problem at all. saw you boys stranded
                      there and thought to myself, "what would
                      jesus do?"
               harold and kumar look at each other. they then notice a
               jesus christ bobble-head doll on the dashboard...

                                   freak show
                      so, you boys worship christ?
               the guys look at each other again, not sure how to respond.

                            harold                           kumar
               uh...yeah.                        sure, he's great.

                                   ugly man
                      great. good to hear it. the name's
                      randy...but everyone calls me freak show.

                                   kumar
                      i'm kumar. this is harold.     good to meet
                      you, mr...freak show.

                                   freak show
                      pleasure's all mine.
               after a while, harold starts to notice that they're driving
               in the middle of a dark woods. it looks very sketchy.

                                   harold
                      so where exactly are we going?

                              freak show
                 don't worry. my place isn't too far from
                 here. once we get there, i'll have your
                 ride fixed up in a jiffy.
          the guys silently continue driving, until kumar notices a

          rash of boils on freak show's neck.

                              kumar
                        (whispering to harold)
                 eww-- check out those boils on his neck!
          harold nudges him to be quiet. kumar looks back over at
          freak show and sees that one of the boils is pulsating.

                              kumar
                        (whispering)
                 oh my god! you gotta look!     one of
                 them's actually pulsating!

                              harold
                        (whispering)
                 will you shut up? he's right next to me!
                 he can hear you!
          kumar sees that a white puss is now oozing from the boil.

                              kumar
                        (whispering)
                 now there's some sort of puss! it's the
                 most disgusting thing i've ever seen!

                              harold
                        (whispering)
                 what's the matter with you? you think
                 that just because you're whispering, he
                 can't hear what you're saying? he's two
                 feet away from us. he can hear this
                 entire conversation. he can hear me
                 talking right now.

                              kumar
                        (whispering)
                 don't worry, he can't hear anything.    not
                 with all that crust in his ear.
          harold gives kumar a hard elbow to the stomach. he then
          looks nervously at freak show, who doesn't seem to have heard
          a thing. harold seems relieved.

                              freak show
                 i heard every word you said.
          freak show doesn't say anything else. harold and kumar don't
          know how to react. they feel really uncomfortable. the fact
          that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them.
