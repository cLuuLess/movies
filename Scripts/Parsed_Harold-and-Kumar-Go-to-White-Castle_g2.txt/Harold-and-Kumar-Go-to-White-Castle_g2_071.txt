          83   int. freak show's house                                      83
               harold and kumar walk inside and see the hottest chick of all
               time (liane) walk out of the kitchen. she is dressed daisy
               dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates her chest.

                                     liane
                        hi. i'm freak show's wife, liane.    would
                        you boys like some pink lemonade?
               harold and kumar can't move.   they're awestruck.

                                     liane
                        let me go bring in a pitcher.
               liane   leaves to go into the kitchen. along the way, she
               turns   on a record player, which starts playing a creepy song
               about   jesus christ. harold and kumar look around the house.
               there   are crosses and bible verses on the walls, along with
               freak   show and liane's wedding picture...

                              harold
                 okay. it's official.     we've entered the
                 twilight zone.

                              kumar
                 dude, liane is fucking hot!

                              harold
                 she's not ugly.
          liane comes in with the pitcher of lemonade.    she pours them
          drinks and hands them the glasses...

                               kumar
                 thanks.
                        (beat)
                 so, tell me liane-- how are things
                 between you and freak show presently?

                              liane
                 oh, never been better.    we love each
                 other very much.
          kumar looks disappointed.    harold, however, is intrigued...

                              harold
                 can i ask-- how does a guy...like freak
                 show...end up with a woman like yourself?

                              liane
                 well, i met him at choir practice `bout
                 four years ago. freak show was very shy
                 back then-- you know, because of all the
                 hideous boils on his face and neck. but
                 he had the most amazing voice -- like a
                 baby canary.
          harold and kumar look at each other in disbelief -- "are we
          talking about the same freakshow?"

                              liane
                 well, one day after easter service, i
                 told him how much i enjoyed his solo, and
                 he just mustered up some courage and
                 asked me out. the rest is history. and
                 we've been in love ever since.
          harold ponders this for a moment.    he and kumar begin
          drinking their lemonade.

                              liane
                 so you boys gonna fuck me or what?
          harold and kumar spit the lemonade out simultaneously. they
          look at each other in complete shock. kumar turns to harold.

                              kumar
                 rock, paper, scissors to see who goes
                 first?

                              harold
                 wait a second-- what about freak
                 show...and this whole christian thing you
                 guys have going on?

                              liane
                        (a little offended)
                 oh, so just because we're passionate
                 about our lord, you assume we don't know
                 how to have a good time?

                              harold
                 no, i just...
          liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. harold and
          kumar stare unabashedly. harold looks outside the window,
          where he sees freak show changing the tire, apparently busy.

                               harold
                 nevermind.
                        (to kumar, swinging his
                         hand)
                 okay, rock, paper, scissors...

                              liane
                 sorry-- if you boys want me, you gotta do
                 me at the same time.

                              harold
                 huh?

                               liane
                 come on.   give me the double stuff.
          harold and kumar look at each other confused.

                              kumar
                 i'm not sure we quite understand...

                              liane
                 i want you both inside me simultaneously.
          harold and kumar look at each other again, more confused and
          kind of disturbed. kumar turns to liane...

                              kumar
                 um, are we talking about one hole or two?

                              liane
                 however you want to do it.

                              harold
                 sorry, no thank you.

                               kumar
                        (to harold)
                 shh! two holes it might not be that bad.
                        (beat)
                 shotgun anus!

                              harold
                 forget it! i don't want our balls
                 rubbing against each other. no way!
          kumar turns to liane in desperation...

                              kumar
                 what about blow jobs?! can we get blow
                 jobs!?

                              liane
                 well...okay.
                        (to harold)
                 can you help me with this...?
          liane walks over to harold, seductively. harold is nervous
          and doesn't know what he should do. she takes his hand and
          puts it on the knot in her shirt. harold looks over to kumar,
          who gives him a reassuring nod. harold then pulls on the
          cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her
          shirt. the shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her
          breasts.

                              liane
                        (to harold, re: breasts)
                 do you want to play with them?
          harold looks over to kumar, then back at liane...

                              harold
                 okay, let's do that.
          liane takes harold's hands and places them on her breasts.
          kumar looks on enviously. liane moans in pleasure as harold
          starts to massage her chest.
          at that moment, freak show enters the room, holding a
          particularly threatening tire-iron...

                              freak show
                 hey boys-- i changed your tire...
          freak show sees harold with liane...

                              freak show
                 what the hell are you doing with my wife!

                                   harold
                             (scared shitless)
                      uhh...you said outside that we can have
                      sex with her!
               freak show runs over to harold and grabs him by the collar!

                                   freak show
                      i most certainly did not say that!

                                    kumar
                      no.   you did. we both heard you.

                                   freak show
                             (calming down)
                      are you sure?

                                    kumar
                      positive.
               freak show ponders this.

                                   freak show
                      oh...my mistake then.

                                    kumar
                      no problem.

                                   freak show
                      well, since we're all here, why not make
                      it a foursome?

               freak show pulls his pants down and puts his arms around

               harold and kumar...

                                   freak show
                      who wants the first reach-around?
