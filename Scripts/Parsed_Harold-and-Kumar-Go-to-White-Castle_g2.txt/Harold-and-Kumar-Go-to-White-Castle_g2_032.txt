          40   ext. martin luther king blvd                                40
               directly in front of harold's infiniti, a basketball game is

               going on between a bunch of huge black dudes, right in the
               middle of the street! (there are hoops on both sides.)
               the basketball players briefly look over at harold's infiniti
               before continuing their game.
