                harold and kumar are laughing and slapping five.

                                    kumar
                       victory is sweet! nice job, roldy!

                                    harold
                       i had to do something.
                kumar begins sniffing something in the air...

                                     kumar
                       wait.   do you smell that?
                kumar keeps sniffing. he turns around to the back seat. he
                reaches back and picks something up from off the floor. it's
                a white castle bag. he pours out the contents and we see
                empty white castle hamburger cartons fall onto kumar's lap.

                                    harold
                       this world is so unfair.

                                    kumar

                       have a car now. we're back in the game.

                       castle. want me to drive?

                                    harold

                       should be able to get there with enough
                       time for me to get my work done after our
                       feast. just find us some tunes.
                a tape is resting in the tape deck.   kumar pushes it in...
                harold and kumar look at each other amazed that cole has some
                lame chick song on his tape.

                                    kumar
