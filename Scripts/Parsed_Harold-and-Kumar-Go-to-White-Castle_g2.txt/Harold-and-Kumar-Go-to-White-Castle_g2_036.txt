               the basketball players watch the car speed away. after a

               couple seconds, they all look at each other, and start

               laughing hysterically! a random basketball player turns to

               the hugest angriest black man...

                                   random basketball player
                      man, you scared the shit out of them!
                      make that face again!

                                   hugest angriest black man
                      okay, okay, okay...
               the hugest angriest black man suppresses his laughter and
               tries to make the face. he bursts out laughing again.

                                    hugest angriest black man
                      shit.   i can't do it.
               his friends laugh harder.      he tries to regain his composure.

                                    hugest angriest black man
                      hold up.   hold up...
               he manages to make his angriest face for two seconds, before
               bursting out laughing again.
