                              burger shack employee
                 i'm sorry. you have to order at the
                 drive thru menu...

                              kumar
                 what happened to the white castle?

                               burger shack employee
                 excuse me?

                              kumar
                 there used to be a white castle right in
                 this spot. where is it?

                              burger shack employee
                        (remembering)
                 oh yeah. there was a white castle here.
                 look guys, i hate to be the bearer of bad
                 news, but burger shack bought this
                 location four years ago.
          harold and kumar look at each other, devastated.

                              kumar
                 please tell me there's another white
                 castle in town.

                               burger shack employee
                 nope.

                              harold
                 are you sure?

                              burger shack employee
                 do i look like the type of guy who would
                 be unsure about something like this?
          harold and kumar are freaking out.

                               kumar
                 shit.   what are we gonna do?

                              harold
                 i don't know. should we just eat here?

                              kumar
                 do you really think that'll satisfy us?
          the burger shack employee senses their desperation.

                              burger shack employee
                 there's a 24 hour white castle in cherry
                 hill, about forty-five minutes away.

                              kumar
                        (to harold)
                 i can make the trip if you're willing to.

                              harold
                 kumar, i have a shitload of work to
                 finish. and you have that med school
                 interview in the morning.

                              kumar
                 forget about the med school interview.
                 it's a non-issue.

                               burger shack employee
                 if i may interject for a moment...
                        (beat)
                 i've been an employee here for three
                 years now, and if there's one thing i've
                 learned, it's that when you're craving
                 white castle, the burgers here simply
                 won't cut it.
                        (in his own little world)
                 in fact, just thinking about those tender
                 little white castle burgers and those
                 grilled onions makes me want to burn this
                 place to the ground and re-build a white
                 castle in its place.
                        (back to reality)
                 if i were you, i'd suck it up and make
                 the trip.
          kumar looks at harold. the guy makes a convincing case.
          harold is clearly torn. we sense that this is an important
          moment for the guys...

                              kumar
                        (enticing harold)
                 you can always do your work in the car.
          harold thinks for a moment, then licks his lips.

                                harold
                 let's do it.

                              kumar
                 then it's settled. no matter what, we're
                 not ending this night without white
                 castle in our stomachs. agreed?
          kumar puts his hand out.   harold shakes it.

                                harold
                 agreed.

                                   burger shack employee
                      wise choice. besides, you wouldn't want
                      to go near our special sauce tonight.
                      some of the guys and i added an extra
                      ingredient, if you know what i mean.
               harold and kumar look confused.

                                   burger shack employee
                      i'll give you a hint...
                             (whispering)
                      it's semen.
               we hear harold and kumar scream in disgust as harold's
               infiniti zooms out of the drive thru...
