          157   int. hallway by the elevator - 9:02 am                      157
                the elevator doors open. harold and kumar exit. kumar gives
                harold a pat on the back...

                                    kumar
                       good luck, dude.
                kumar stands behind, while harold approaches maria's door.

                harold takes a deep breath and then knocks on the door...

                there is tension as harold waits. then, finally, the door

                knob begins to turn and the door opens--

                a good-looking, muscular hispanic man (luis) is standing

                behind the door wearing only his boxers. he has lipstick all

                over his neck and chest...

                                    luis
                       what do you want?

                a look of extreme disappointment goes over harold's face.

          

          

                                    harold
                              (lying)
                       oh...uh...nothing...wrong room.

                                    woman (o.c.)
                       come back to bed!

                                    luis
                              (calling to woman)
                       hey, papi's coming! hold on!
                              (to harold, laughing)
                       this girl is crazy, man.

                              luis (cont'd)
                 she seemed so sweet at first, but it
                 turns out she's into some pretty freaky
                 shit. she even did this thing where she
                 took a lollipop and shoved it...

                              harold
                        (grossed out/depressed)
                 look, i really don't need to hear it. i
                 guess i just made a mistake. sorry for
                 interrupting you guys...
          harold starts to walk away, almost crying. sad, depressing
          music begins to play. kumar feels sorry for his friend.
          just then, luis leans his head out the door...

                              luis
                 hey-- if you're looking for maria, she
                 left for europe this morning.
          harold quickly turns around and runs back over.

                               harold
                 huh?

                              luis
                 she's going to amsterdam for ten days.
                 i'm luis -- maria's brother.
          luis shakes harold's hand.    harold suddenly feels better.

                                harold
                 oh!    maria's brother!

                              luis
                 you must be that chinese guy maria keeps
                 talking about.

                              harold
                 actually, i'm kor...wait a second-- she
                 talks about me?
          a hot black chick (aisha), wearing only a bra and g-string,
          walks over to luis and wraps her arms around him...

                              aisha
                 are you coming or what?

                              luis
                 hey, i'll be there in a second, baby. do
                 me a favor-- make me that omelette you
                 were talking about. you know, with the
                 sun-dried tomatoes.
          aisha kisses him, and walks away to the kitchen. luis gives
          her a little a slap on the ass. harold doesn't quite know
          how to respond to this.

                              luis
                        (to harold)
                 so you want me to leave her a message or
                 something?

                              harold
                 uh, no thanks. i'd rather do it in
                 person.

                              luis
                 then take it easy, hermano.
          luis shuts the door.    kumar runs over to harold...

                              kumar
                 dude...we gotta go!

                                 harold
                 huh?   where?

                              kumar
                 to amsterdam! we can pack up right now
                 and take the next plane.

                              harold
                 what are you talking about? are you out
                 of your mind? what about your interview
                 with the med school guy?

                              kumar
                 whatever. i'll tell my dad to reschedule
                 it. he won't have a problem, as long as
                 i'm taking it seriously for a change.
                 now, let's fly to europe and find maria!

                              harold
                 she's coming back in ten days! it's not
                 like i'm never gonna see her again.

                              kumar
                 for a hot chick, ten days in europe is
                 the kiss of death. there are gonna be
                 suave, sophisticated guys all over her.
                 by the time she gets back, she may not be
                 available.
          harold feels a little nervous about what kumar is saying.

                               harold
                 forget it.   i'll just wait till she comes
                 back.
          harold starts to walk away from kumar...

                               kumar
                 hey, rold!   wait!

                harold stops.

                                    kumar
                       you do realize what's legal in amsterdam,
                       right?

                harold turns around. kumar has a big smile on his face.

                slowly, but surely, harold starts to smile as well.

                the screen goes black.    "to be continued..."
