               kumar gets into the car and shuts the door.     he hits the gas
               and continues driving down the dark road...

                                   harold
                      do you even know where you're going?

                                   kumar
                      i'll be honest, i'm a little lost. but
                      don't worry. once we get on the highway,
                      we'll be there soon.

                                      harold
                      we better.                                                     
               it starts to rain...                                                  

                                   harold                                            
                      shit, now it's raining.                                        

                                   kumar                                             
                      what's the big deal?                                           

                                   harold                                            
                      look, i'm completely on edge right now,                        
                      okay? after all the shit we've been                            
                      through tonight, i don't know how much
                      more of this i can take.

               at that moment, the raccoon jumps out from under harold's

               seat, crawls over the laptop, onto his chest, and starts

               biting his neck...

                                      harold

                      ahhhhh!!!     fuck!!!!
               kumar turns and sees the raccoon on harold.

                                      kumar
                      holy shit!
               harold tries to pry the raccoon away from his neck.     kumar
               tries to help him.
