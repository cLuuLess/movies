          37   int. harold's infiniti                                       37
               kumar pulls up to an exact change toll booth.

                                   kumar
                      dude, give me thirty-five cents.
               harold sorts through some change in his hand and gives kumar
               the money. kumar tosses the change into the basket and waits
               for the toll booth stoplight to turn green. it doesn't.

                                    kumar
                      what's going on? it didn't register.
                             (beat)
                      dude, give me thirty-five more cents.

                                   harold
                      i don't have anymore change.

                                   kumar
                      should i just go through?

                                    harold
                      no.   i don't like breaking the law.
               harold licks the joint as he puts the finishing touches on.

                              kumar
                 i can see that.
          a car honks behind them. kumar turns around and sees a
          number of cars lining up behind them. right behind them, a
          big burly guy leans his head out of a car...

                                big burly guy
                 hey!    move your ass!

                              kumar
                        (to harold)
                 i'm going through.

                              harold
                 just hold on. i'll walk over to one of
                 the manned booths and tell them what
                 happened.
          the honking continues as harold starts to open the door...

                              big burly guy
                        (over the honking)
                 move, you fucking twat!
          kumar can't take it anymore. just as harold is about to get
          out of the car, kumar hits the gas and screeches away.

                              harold
                 are you crazy?

          a loud alarm goes off behind them...

                              harold
                 oh shit, we're dead!
          harold throws the joint out the window.

                              kumar
                 what the fuck is wrong with you?!

                              harold
                        (paranoid/looking back)
                 you just tore out of there! the cops are
                 gonna catch us!

                              kumar
                 no they're not!

                              harold
                 take this exit!

                               kumar
                 what?

          harold grabs the wheel and turns it!
