                harold and kumar exit the elevator...

                                    kumar
                       dude, it's only awkward because you're a
                       pussy. just talk to her once and i
                       promise you it won't be weird anymore...

                                    harold
                       it doesn't matter. the only girls
                       interested in me are girls i have no
                       interest in. like cindy kim.

                                    kumar
                       speaking of cindy, she called earlier.
                       one of those 58 asian clubs she's in is
                       throwing a party at her dorm tonight.

                                    harold
                       god, she invites me to everything.

                                    kumar
                       so what? she's fucking cute.     let her
                       touch your penis.
                they exit the front door of the building...

                harold and kumar walk down the steps, where they see cole and
                the extreme sports punks doing lame skateboard tricks on the
                sidewalk near their jeep. they're about to get back in the
                jeep, when cole sees harold and kumar walking near them.

                                    cole
                       hey look, it's the brother's mcfag!
                              (to harold and kumar)
                       let me guess, the yellow one's the
                       catcher!

               cole and the punks laugh hysterically. harold is
               uncomfortable. kumar just ignores them.

                                   cole
                             (to the punks)
                      come on, guys! let's get ourselves some
                      fucking mountain dew!

                      extreme!
               they take off, driving by harold and kumar.   harold gives
               them a pissed off look as they drive away.

                                   harold
                      why do i have to be the catcher?

                                   kumar
                      dude, forget about those pricks.    let's
                      just go.
               they continue walking...
