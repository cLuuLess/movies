          23   int. rosenberg and goldstein's apartment                     23
               harold and kumar walk into an apartment that looks almost
               identical to theirs. (instead of a "billy madison" poster,
               there's one of "happy gilmore.")

          sitting on the couch is rosenberg (a seemingly "nice jewish
          boy," wearing khakis and a sweater) and goldstein (a more
          depraved jewish boy, wearing a t-shirt with a picture of the
          olsen twins-- underneath the picture we see the words,
          "finally legal on june 13, 2004"). both of them are taking
          bong hits (out of a shofar bong) while watching tv as harold    
          and kumar enter...

                              kumar
                 rosenberg, goldstein-- get up.    we're
                 going to white castle.
          rosenberg and goldstein continue staring at the tv...

                              rosenberg
                 wait-- we're watching the gift on hbo.

                               kumar
                 no waiting.   we're starving...
          out of the corner of kumar's eye, he notices harold grabbing
          a piece of beef jerky from rosenberg & goldstein's coffee
          table.

                              kumar
                        (scolding harold)
                 ...put that down! we're not eating `til
                 we get to white castle.
          harold acts like he's going to put the jerky back, but as
          soon, as kumar turns his attention back to rosenberg and
          goldstein, he slips it his pocket.

                              kumar
                        (to rosenberg and
                         goldstein)
                 now come on guys, let's go.

                              goldstein
                 sorry man! we're not going anywhere.
                 supposedly, katie holmes shows her milk                  
                 paps in this movie!                                      

                              harold
                 is that all you jews ever think about?
                 tits?

                              rosenberg
                 we're talking about katie holmes here.
                 you would never think a sweet, innocent
                 girl like her would ever take her top
                 off. which is precisely why we have to
                 watch her do it.

          dude, the things i'd eat out of her ass,
          you have no idea.
                 (beat)                                           
          bacon, shellfish, milk with meat, you                   
          name it...

                             (to goldstein)
                      that's a very vulgar statement.

                                   goldstein
                      so is "i want to pound britney spears in
                      the pussy." but it's true.

                             (to harold and kumar)
                      anyway, if you guys want to wait till the
                      movie's over...
               harold and kumar have already shut the door.
