          54   int. women's bathroom                                          54
               harold and kumar try to decide where to hide.

                                     harold
                      shit!    what if he finds us?

                                   kumar
                      dude, chill out. he's not gonna look for
                      us in the women's bathroom.
               harold and kumar hear two female voices outside the bathroom.

                                     kumar
                      shit!    get in that stall!
               there's a line of three bathroom stalls on one wall. harold
               runs into stall number two (the middle one). kumar sees the
               bathroom door start to open. he also runs into stall number
               two and shuts the door behind him.
               the guys struggle to stand on the toilet bowl.    harold's
               laptop bag keeps smacking kumar.
               christy and clarissa (the twins) enter the bathroom.       they're
               in mid-conversation.

                                   christy
                      hurry up, i want to go smoke pot with
                      that cute indian bloke.

               intercut:
               in stall number two, kumar's ears perk up, as we see harold
               and kumar both standing on the toilet bowl. from kumar's pov,
               he sees christy and clarissa through the crack of the door.

                                   clarissa
                      it'll be a few minutes, i'm about to have
                      the worst case of the taco shits.
               kumar is clearly upset to hear this.

                              harold
                        (whispering)
                 ew...gross.
          clarissa runs into stall number one and shuts the door.
          the sound of the door shutting causes harold and kumar to
          look over at that stall.

                               christy
                 oh great.   now i think i have to go.
          christy enters stall number three and shuts the door.
          the sound of the door shutting causes harold and kumar to
          turn their attention to the other stall. they then look at
          each other grossed out.
          from above, we see harold and kumar struggling, while the
          girls have taken their places in the surrounding stalls.

          we hear the sounds of diarrhea hitting the bowl.

                                clarissa
                 ahhhhh!
          harold and kumar look horrified.      there is silence for a few
          seconds until....

                              christy
                 hey clarissa. do you wanna play battle
                 shits?
          we see harold quizzically mouth "battle shits?"

                              clarissa
                 oh my god. we haven't played that since
                 back in camp!
          harold and kumar look confused.

          we hear a loud farting noise, then the sound of shit hitting

          the water...

                                christy
                 wait for it.    wait for it.    ahhhhh!

                                clarissa
                 hit!
          harold and kumar look terrified.
