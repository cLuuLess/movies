          39   int. harold's infiniti - 9:00 pm                            39
               harold and kumar drive through the dangerous streets of
               newark. they're very quiet, until kumar breaks the silence.

                                   kumar
                      that was the last of our weed.

                                   harold
                      look, i get a little paranoid sometimes.

                                   kumar
                      now we're in newark of all places.    you
                      know we're gonna get shot.

                                   harold
                      maybe it's not as bad as they say.    it's
                      probably just a bunch of hype.
               they look out the window and see another asian and indian guy
               (daniel and shankar) walking down the street. suddenly,
               three hoods jump out from an alley and start beating the
               living shit out of daniel and shankar.
               kumar gives harold a dirty look.

                                   harold
                      let's get the hell out of here.
               kumar continues driving. he makes a turn. all of a sudden, he
               stops short, causing he and harold to jerk forward quickly.

                                    harold
                      what the...
