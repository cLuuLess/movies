          82   ext. freak show's house - 1:30 am                            82
               harold (with laptop in tow) and kumar stand by their car, as
               freak show brings out some tools and a new tire from his
               house, which is run-down and in the middle of nowhere.

                                     freak show
                        now it's gonna take me a little while
                        here, so if you boys like you can go
                        inside, wash up, fuck my wife, have
                        something to drink, watch tv-- anything
                        you want. mi casa es su casa. just
                        don't do anything jesus wouldn't do.
               freak show gives harold a pat on the back and starts changing
               the tire. kumar and harold look at each other. slowly, they
               walk towards freak show's house...

                                     kumar
                        am i deaf or did he just say we can fuck
                        his wife?

                                     harold
                        he couldn't have said that.

                                     kumar
                        but he did! it may have been in mid-
                        sentence, but it was still clear as day.
               they reach the front door and are about to enter...

                                     harold
                        who cares? you've seen freak show. what
                        do you think his wife is gonna look like?
