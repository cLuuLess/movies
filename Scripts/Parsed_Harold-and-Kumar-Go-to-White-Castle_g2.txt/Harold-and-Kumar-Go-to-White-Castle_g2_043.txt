          51   int. cindy kim's dorm room - 11:oo pm                        51
               harold is sitting on a bed, next to cindy kim (very cute,
               prim and proper, korean girl). sitting on the floor are a
               dozen asian students-- pure stereotypes (glasses, nerdy
               clothes, etc). harold is kind of creeped out by them.

                                   cindy
                      i'm so glad you showed up, harold!

                                  harold
                            (unenthusiastic)
                      yeah. me too.

                                   cindy
                      did you like the hibiscus petals i glued
                      to the envelope i sent you?

                                     harold
                      uh, yeah.    they were...nice.
               suddenly, one of the nerdy asian students (kenneth) raises
               his hand. harold looks at him strangely, and then over to
               cindy. "does this guy think i'm a teacher or something?"
               harold sits there and stares at kenneth for a while...

                                   harold
                             (to kenneth)
                      uh, yes?

                              kenneth
                 kenneth park. class of 2004. is it true
                 you're an analyst at brewster keegan?

                              harold
                 yeah, i'm a junior analyst.

                               kenneth
                 awesome!
          kenneth high-fives with the nerdy asian student next to him.
          he then raises his hand again. harold rolls his eyes...

                               harold
                 yes?

                              kenneth
                 uh, this is actually a two-part question.
                 i'm applying for a summer internship at
                 brewster keegan, and i was wondering a)
                 what it's like being an investment banker
                 and b) if you would write me a
                 recommendation.

                              harold
                 what it's like being an investment
                 banker? well kenneth, to be honest, it's
                 pretty...
          harold looks into the eyes of the young, eager, asian
          students. he can't bear to tell them the truth...

                               harold
                 ...awesome?
          all the asian students start high-fiving with each other.

                              harold
                 as for the recommendation, i may be able
                 to make a call or two...
          cindy looks at her watch...

                              cindy
                 actually harold, we should be getting to
                 the party. we can discuss all this stuff
                 there. it's just down the hall.
          all the asian students get up...

                              harold
                 sorry, cindy. i can't go. i have to wait
                 for kumar...

                                    cindy
                       you'll see him when we're done. trust me,
                       you're gonna love this. kenny's mom
                       dropped off a big jar of kimchi jigae.
                kenneth looks proud of himself.

                                     harold
                       nice.
                cindy grabs harold's hand and drags him away.
