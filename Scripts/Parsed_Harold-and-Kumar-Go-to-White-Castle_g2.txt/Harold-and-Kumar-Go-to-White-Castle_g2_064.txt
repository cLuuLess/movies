          78   int. harold's infiniti                                       78
               harold is very excited. kumar is proud of himself, but
               playing it cool.

                                   harold
                      i'm telling you. that was amazing!    even
                      your dad would've been impressed!

                                   kumar
                             (nonchalant)
                      yeah. it wasn't bad.

          this is perfect! we're back on the road.
          we have directions now. the rain let up.                
          and guess what...

          harold clicks on the "save" option on his laptop...

                               harold
                 i'm officially done with my work.
                        (beat)
                 i'm telling you, things are finally
                 starting to go our way.
          while they're stopped at a red light, kumar takes in his
          surroundings and notices something...

                              kumar
                 hey, check it out!     your movie's playing.
          outside, to kumar's left, on the marquee of a movie theater
          we see: "john hughes retrospective. curly sue - 9:00.

          sixteen candles - 11:00.

                              kumar
                 and look who went to see it...
          harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees maria
          standing outside, all by herself. he can't believe it.

                               harold
                 holy shit.

                              kumar
                 you see? you thought you two had nothing
                 in common. but it turns out you both
                 have the same lame taste in movies. hey,
                 you wanna see if she wants to come with
                 us to white castle?

                                harold
                 no way.    forget about it.   just drive.
          kumar puts his hands on harold's shoulders to get his
          undivided attention.

                              kumar
                 harold. it's one in the morning. we're an
                 hour from home. and who do we see, but
                 your dream girl standing outside a
                 theater playing your favorite movie. i
                 mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic
                 comedy, and i was your annoying gay
                 friend, this would be the moment i'd tell
                 you "this is a sign."

                               harold
                 stop it.

                              kumar
                 come on. just pretend you're a nerdy
                 asian tom hanks and she's a hot latina
                 meg ryan...with bigger tits. besides, you
                 yourself said things are starting to go
                 our way...

                              harold
                 let's just go!
          kumar presses a button causing harold's window to go down.

                              harold
                 what are you doing?!

                              kumar
                        (calling out)
                 hey maria!
          maria looks up. harold quickly ducks in his seat. he then

          reaches down with his hand to hit the gas peddle. the car

          starts peeling out...

                              kumar
                 hey, get your hand off the gas!
          kumar tries kicking harold's hand off the gas.   just then,

          the car begins shaking intensely...

                              kumar
                        (looking up)
                 oh shit!
          harold's infiniti has driven off the road and is speeding

          down a dirt and rock covered hill.
          kumar grabs control of the wheel and tries to steer the car
          safely. harold is bumping around on the way down the hill.
          finally, they reach the bottom of the hill, near a dirt road.

                              harold
                 you asshole! my car's probably all
                 scratched up now!

                              kumar
                 don't blame me. you're the one who ran us
                 off the road!

                              harold
                 i told you i didn't want to speak to her!
                        (composing himself)
                 whatever. let's jut get back on the
                 highway.

                      fine.
               kumar presses the gas. suddenly, we hear a "pop!"   harold and
               kumar look at each other-- angry and frustrated.
