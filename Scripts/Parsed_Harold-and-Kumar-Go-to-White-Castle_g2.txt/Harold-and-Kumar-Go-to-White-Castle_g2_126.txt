          139   ext. near the cliff - 6:45 am                                139

                harold and kumar are about fifteen yards from the cliff,

                holding the hang-glider. the sirens are getting louder...

                                    harold
                       hurry up...they're almost here!

                                    kumar
                       grab onto the end of the bars and hold on
                       tight.
                harold does as he's told. they are both holding onto the
                bars (harold behind kumar).

                                    kumar
                       okay. here's how this is gonna work. on
                       the count of three, we're gonna run to
                       the edge of the cliff. when i say
                       "jump," launch yourself forward as if you
                       were diving into a pool, got it?

                                    harold
                              (nervous)
                       i think so.

                                    kumar
                       don't worry-- everything's gonna be fine.
                       are you ready?
                harold's too nervous to speak.   kumar gets into position.

                                    kumar
                       okay, here goes. one...two...three!
                harold and kumar start running towards the cliff.

                                    kumar
                       good job, rold! keep running!

                they're getting closer...

                                    kumar
                       rold, there's something i gotta tell you.
                       i've never hang-glided before.

                                    harold

                       what???

                                    kumar

                       jump!!!

                harold and kumar jump off, just as the cop car arrives.

                 the hang glider coasts through the air for a couple seconds.

                 then, suddenly, the guys start going down at a sharp angle!

                             harold                            kumar

                 ahhhhhh!!!!!!!!                   ahhhhhh!!!!!!!!

                 just then, the hang glider catches onto the wind and starts

                 gliding through the sky.

                                       harold
                        oh my god!    oh my god!   oh my god!

                                     kumar
                        dude, it's working!

                                     harold
                        i can't believe you lied to me!

                                     kumar
                        hey, how else was i gonna convince you to
                        jump off a cliff?
