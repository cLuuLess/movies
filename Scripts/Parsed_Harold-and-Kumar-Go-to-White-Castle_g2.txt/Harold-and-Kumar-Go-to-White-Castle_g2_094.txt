          106   ext. forest - 3:20 am                                     106
                harold and kumar have stopped running.   they start catching
                their breath.

                                    harold
                       jesus christ! that place was a fucking
                       mad house! thanks for getting me out of
                       there, dude.

                                    kumar
                       hey, man, the burgers wouldn't taste as
                       good if you weren't there.
                              (beat, re: weed)
                       dude, look at this. it's like we went
                       from being broke to being millionaires.
                suddenly, they hear what sounds like a coyote's howl.

                                    harold
                       what was that?

                                    kumar
                       just a coyote. don't worry.

                              harold
                 aren't people supposed to be scared of
                 coyotes?

                              kumar
                 that's only because they sound scary. in
                 one on one combat, either one of us can
                 take a coyote down.

          suddenly, a cheetah jumps out from behind a bush and lets out

          a monstrous roar!

                              kumar (cont'd)
                 now cheetahs, they're another story.
          the cheetah stares harold and kumar down.

                              harold
                 we're gonna die.

                              kumar
                 just calm down. cheetahs are used to
                 eating zebras and shit. they're not
                 known for eating humans.

          with that, the cheetah walks over to a nearby bush and drags

          out a half-eaten human corpse it's obviously been devouring.

                              harold
                 we're gonna die.

                              kumar
                 okay, i'll admit, that's not a good sign.
                 but i'm sure if we just stay calm he'll
                 probably leave us alone.
          harold and kumar stand silently. slowly, the cheetah begins
          walking directly over to harold...

                              harold
                        (whispering)
                 this isn't working.

                               kumar
                 shhh.
          suddenly, the cheetah opens his mouth wide and chomps down on

          what appears to be harold's groin area.

                              harold
                        (eyes closed, screaming)

                 he's mauling me! he's mauling me!
          harold continues screaming for the next ten seconds.
          eventually, he calms down and looks at the cheetah.

                the cheetah is not eating harold.    he's eating the beef jerky

                that harold had in his pants.

                                    kumar
                              (annoyed)
                       i thought i told you not to take that
                       jerky!
                harold simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't
                been eaten. the cheetah walks over to harold and begins
                licking harold's face in friendship.

                                      harold
                       he likes me.
                suddenly, kumar's eyes light up...

                                    kumar
                       dude, i think i have an idea.

                                      harold
                       what is it?

                                    kumar
                       i'll tell you, but first we have to get
                       really high.
                kumar opens the bag of weed.
                pan up to the night sky for a time lapse.   we see smoke
                coming up from below. pan back down...
