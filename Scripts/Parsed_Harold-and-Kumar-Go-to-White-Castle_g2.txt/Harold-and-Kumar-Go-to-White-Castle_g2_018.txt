          17    int. harold's bedroom                                        17
                harold turns on his laptop and is ready to start working.

                                    harold
                              (calling out)
                       one of the senior analysts asked me to do
                       a bunch of his work for him tonight.
                kumar walks back into harold's room...

                                    kumar
                       i assume you gave him the appropriate "go
                       fuck yourself."

                                    harold
                       if by "go fuck yourself" you mean "no
                       problem sir" then yes, he got the message
                       loud and clear.
                kumar shakes his head in disgust...

                                   kumar
                      oh, no wonder you tried cancelling on me
                      today. dude, you gotta learn how to say
                      "no" once in a while. now lets get high.

                                    harold
                      no.   i got a lot of work to finish.
               kumar shuts harold's laptop.

                                   kumar
                      fuck that! you'll have plenty of time to
                      get that shit done later. come on, let's
                      smoke a couple joints.
               harold thinks for a moment and then caves...

                                   harold
                      one joint.

                                   kumar
                      one and a half. now let's do this...
               kumar exits the room...
               harold hangs his jacket up in his closet, which we see
               organized in rows of suits and button downs.
