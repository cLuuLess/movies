          12    int. elevator                                                12
                harold and maria are standing silently as the elevator goes
                up. eventually, harold gets the courage to speak...

                                    harold
                       so maria, what's been going on?

                                    maria
                       oh, nothing. it's just been a long week.
                       how about you?

                                    harold
                       my week was great. work wasn't too bad. i
                       caught up on some sleep. plus, the guy
                       who works next to me decided to bathe for
                       a change.

                                      maria
                       really?

                                    harold
                              (deadpan)
                       oh wait, i meant the exact opposite of
                       that. work sucked. i barely slept. and
                       the guy next to me still smells like
                       crap. but a man can dream, right?

               maria laughs.   harold's pleased that his joke worked.

                                   harold
                      so what are you up to tonight?

                                   maria
                      actually, i'm probably gonna work out a
                      little bit, clean up the apartment, and
                      then go over to my boyfriend's place.
                      he's cooking me a really nice dinner.

                                   harold
                             (disappointed)
                      really?

                                    maria
                             (smiling)
                      oh wait, i meant the exact opposite of
                      that.
                             (beat)
                      i'll actually probably just sit on my
                      ass, eat a pint of hagaan daz, and watch
                      blind date.

                                   harold
                             (playful)
                      that sounds awful.
               harold laughs, as does maria.    they smile at each other...

                                   harold
                      well, if you want some company, maybe you
                      could sit on your ass at my place.

                                     maria
                               (flirty)
                      maybe.

          
               we hear the "bing" of the elevator...
