          104   int. jail cell                                                104
                kumar walks away from the cell, goes over to the desk, picks
                up the bag of weed and caresses it...

                                    harold
                       what the hell are you...
                suddenly, all six police officer come back into the room,
                pushing a black man wearing pajamas (nathaniel banks).
                nathaniel seems very gentle. he's even wearing a turtleneck
                sweater.

                                    officer palumbo
                              (to nathaniel)
                       you thought you could get away with this,
                       huh?

                                    nathaniel
                       where am i? i was in bed.         i didn't fire
                       any gun, i swear...
                suddenly, officer reilly looks over to the jail cell...

                                       officer reilly
                                 (pointing)
                       look!
                all the cops turn to the cell. kumar is still holding the
                weed. he doesn't know what to do. harold is scared shitless.

                                   officer palumbo
                             (re: tarik)
                       shit! jackson's trying to escape!
                tarik looks up from his book...

                                       tarik
                       what?     oh, not again!
                the cops handcuff nathaniel to the leg of a desk, and run
                over to the jail cell, ignoring kumar and the weed.

                                    officer palumbo
                       stop trying to escape!

                                    tarik
                       i'm not trying to escape!        look at me,
                       i'm sitting down!
                they turn the key that is already in the keyhole and storm
                into the room. harold stands back, confused. tarik leans
                against the wall, ready to be handcuffed. the cops grab him
                and throw him down against the bed.

                                    officer reilly
                       he's trying to break free! hold him
                       tight!
                in the midst of all the action, kumar grabs harold and pulls
                him out of the cell. harold goes over to palumbo's desk and
                picks up his wallet and laptop, along with the police report.
                they start running out of the room. kumar's still clinging
                to the weed.

                                    harold
                              (to kumar)
                       wait-- shouldn't we do something about
                       this?

                                    nathaniel
                              (to harold)
                       if i were you, i'd get out of here as
                       soon as possible.
                with that, harold and kumar run out...
