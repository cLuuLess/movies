                from officer brucks's pov, we see that he has a long stretch
                ahead, with no cars in sight.

                                    officer brucks
                       what the hell?
                he puts his foot on the brakes, bringing the car to a
                screeching halt.
                officer brucks gets out of the car and looks around wondering
                where the yellow jeep went. he then hears the sound of

                branches cracking in the woods...
