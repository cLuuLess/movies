                      so, neil, i have to ask you-- did you
                      ever get it on with wanda off the set?

                                   neil
                      dude, i humped every piece of ass ever on
                      that show.

                                   kumar
                      even the chick who played the hot nurse?

                                   neil
                      no, i didn't go all the way with her.

                                   harold
                      hey, you don't know how to get back on
                      the highway, do you?

                                   neil
                      i don't even know where the fuck i am
                      right now. i was at this party earlier
                      tonight, and this dude hooked me up with
                      some killer x. somehow i ended up
                      getting thrown out of a moving car, and
                      i've been tripping balls ever since.
               harold and kumar both find this to be quite strange.

                                   kumar
                      well, our night's been pretty crazy too.
                      we've been driving around for hours,
                      trying to get to white castle, but we
                      keep getting sidetracked.

                                   neil
                      dude, forget white castle.   what we need
                      is some pussy.

                                   harold
                      huh?

                                   neil
                      it's a fucking sausage fest in here.
                      let's get us some poon-tang. then we'll
                      go to white castle.

                                   kumar
                      you don't understand, neil. we've been
                      craving these burgers all night.

                                   neil
                      i've been craving burgers too.   fur
                      burgers, that is.

                      let's pick up some trim at a strip club.
                      the doogie line always works on
                      strippers.
               harold and kumar look at each other-- weirded out.

                                   kumar
                      hey, there's a gas station! let's stop
                      and get directions.
               kumar quickly makes a turn onto a normal-looking street
               leading up to a gas station in the distance...
