                on the television:

                                    female anchor
                       police have made the following sketch of
                       the two fugitives, which they believe to
                       be quote "extremely accurate."

                on the screen, we see a horrible police sketch of "harold"
                and "kumar"-- it is basically an asian man in his seventies

                who looks like confucious; the kumar sketch is an old indian

                man with a jewel on his forehead, wearing a turban.
