          112   ext. street                                                 112
                harold and kumar stand there, speechless, as neil drives
                right past them, splashing a puddle in harold's face!
                they stand there, watching silently as neil drives off.
                harold is now drenched. muddy water drips from his hair and
                clothing. he gives kumar a dirty look. kumar knows he
                shouldn't push harold any further.

                                    kumar
                       fine...we'll find a pay phone and get a
                       cab back to your office.
                harold, furious and almost in tears, simply nods "yes."

                 kumar, disappointed, walks down the road with a miserable
                 harold. when they reach the corner...

                                     kumar
                               (pointing)
                        look, there's a krispee kreme.     we'll
                        call from there.
