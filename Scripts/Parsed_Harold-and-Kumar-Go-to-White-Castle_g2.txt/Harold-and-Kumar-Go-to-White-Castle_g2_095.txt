          108   ext. forest - day                                           108
                harold and kumar are now sitting on top of the cheetah,
                smoking joints. kumar has a belt around the cheetah's neck
                like reigns on a horse.

                                    harold
                       has it come to this?    are we really gonna
                       ride this cheetah?

                                    kumar
                       hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on
                       the planet. it's as good as a car.
                kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away.

                                    harold
                       this is either a really smart move, or by
                       far the stupidest thing we've ever done.
                harold puts his arms around kumar to hold on.    kumar puts the
                bag of weed under his shirt...

                                    kumar
                       well, we'll soon find out.
                              (like to a snow dog)
                       mush! mush!

                suddenly, the cheetah darts out like lightening with harold

                and kumar on it's back. even though it makes absolutely no

                sense, we see the cheetah zooming past streets and forests.

                harold and kumar are bouncing up and down as it races across

                a major highway...

                                    harold
                       dude, am i just really high or is this is
                       actually working?!

                                     kumar
                       both!

                                    harold
                       this is great! we'll be at white castle
                       in no...

                smack! a branch hits harold in the face, knocking him off the
                cheetah. harold lands on the ground-- his head bleeding.
                his eyes slowly close as he goes unconscious...
