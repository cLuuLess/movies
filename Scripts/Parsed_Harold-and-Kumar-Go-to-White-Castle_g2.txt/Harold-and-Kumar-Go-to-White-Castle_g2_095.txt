                              harold
                 what the hell are you doing?!!!

                              kumar
                 i'm sorry! you've been out cold for the
                 past half-hour! i figured that maybe if
                 i did some gay shit you'd wake up.
          harold wipes his face with his sleeve. he then gets up-- he
          sees that they are by a random road, all by themselves.

                              harold
                 what happened to the cheetah?

                              kumar
                 it ran away. but forget about that. i
                 have some bad news and some worse news.

                              harold
                        (nervous)
                 tell me the worse news first.

                              kumar
                 i checked out some road signs. the
                 cheetah took us in the wrong direction.

                                harold
                 that sucks.    what's the bad news?

                              kumar
                 your laptop is completely destroyed.
          kumar points to the laptop, which is outside of it's bag,
          broken in pieces.

                                harold

                 what????????

                              kumar
                 it smashed against a tree when you fell
                 off the cheetah.

                              harold
                 why the hell didn't you say that that was
                 the "worse news"?

                              kumar
                 well, the laptop really only effects you.
                 whereas the white castle situation
                 effects both of us equally.

                              harold
                 oh no! no! no!

                              kumar
                 don't worry, dude. your laptop's insured.

                       it's not that! all my work was saved in
                       there! now i gotta go back to the office
                       and re-do everything!

                                    kumar
                       exactly. first, we'll take a cab over to
                       white castle, then we'll...

                                    harold
                       forget white castle.   there's no time!

                                    kumar
                       come on, rold! you can get that shit done
                       in a couple hours. we can't quit now!

                suddenly, they hear loud rap music playing in the distance.

                harold and kumar slowly turn around and see...

                harold's car airborne as it scales a hill!    the car lands,

                causing sparks to fly from the shocks.
