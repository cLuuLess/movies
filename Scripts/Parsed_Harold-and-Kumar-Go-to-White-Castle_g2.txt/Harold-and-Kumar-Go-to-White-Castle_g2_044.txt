          50   int. harold's infiniti                                       50
               kumar is driving with determination in his eyes.

                                   kumar
                      white castle, here we come. i just wish
                      we had some more pot. i'm almost
                      completely sober right now.
               harold ignores this. he's typing feverishly on his laptop--
               trying to get his work done. meanwhile, kumar notices a sign
               on for the princeton exit.

                                   kumar
                      nice. princeton. we're getting off here.
               kumar takes the exit.

                                     harold
                      why?

                                   kumar
                      we're gonna sweet talk cindy kim into
                      finding us some weed.

                                     harold
                      oh no.    i'm not seeing cindy.

                                   kumar
                      why the fuck not? you talk to her on the
                      phone all the time.

                                   harold
                      she calls me. then she rambles on about
                      her east asian students club or whatever.

                      and i have to pretend like i actually
                      give a shit, or she'll call me a twinkie.

                                    kumar
                      a twinkie?

                                   harold
                      you know, yellow on the outside, white on
                      the inside.

                                   kumar
                      look you twinkie bitch, you threw our
                      weed out the window, so now it's your
                      duty to make sure we're high as shit by
                      the time we're eating those burgers.

                                   harold
                      well, i can't help you out there. cindy
                      doesn't smoke. she's not gonna help us.

                                   kumar
                      as long as she buzzes us into a dorm,
                      we're set. give me ten minutes in there
                      and i guarantee i'll find some hizzy.

                                   harold
                      no, forget it. i'm not seeing cindy kim.
