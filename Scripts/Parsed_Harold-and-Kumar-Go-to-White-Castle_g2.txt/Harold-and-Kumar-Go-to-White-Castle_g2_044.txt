          52    int. dorm hallway - 11:15 pm                                 52
                kumar is standing in the hallway, accosting random students.
                he sees one random student walk by...

                                    kumar
                       hey! you know where i can get some
                       chronic?
                the random student doesn't respond. kumar is frustrated...

                                    kumar
                       what kind of ivy league school is this?

          52a   ext. princeton dorm - 11:16 pm                             52a
                kumar exits the dorm, and walks throughout the quad, asking
                random students for drugs. eventually, a hippie-looking
                student (phish t-shirt, birkenstocks) taps kumar on the back.

                                    hippie asshole
                       heeey, man. lookin' to toke up?
                kumar breathes a sigh of relief...

                                    kumar
                       thank christ! look, just give me a dime
                       of your finest herb.
                the hippie asshole opens his backpack. inside, kumar sees a
                giant plastic bag filled with weed. he's awestruck...

                                    kumar
                       oh my dear sweet lord...
                kumar reaches for the weed, but the hippie asshole knocks his
                hand away...

                                     hippie asshole
                       yo, man!   not cool! this is my baby,
                       man!

          hippie asshole sizes kumar up and then gives kumar him a
          measly dime bag...

                              hippie asshole
                 that'll be eighty bucks.

                              kumar
                 eighty bucks?! it's worth forty tops,
                 bro!
          the hippie asshole grabs the baggy back from kumar.

                              hippie asshole
                 i'm not your bro...bro. and if you feel
                 like staying sober, go ahead, don't buy
                 it. that's cool with me. i can find lots
                 of people who want to get high. i can
                 smoke it myself, man.

                              kumar
                 jesus, what the hell kind of hippie are
                 you?

                              hippie asshole
                 one who understands the concept of supply
                 and demand, dude.
          kumar and the hippie asshole stare each other down. after a
          couple seconds, kumar shakes his head, pissed off. he takes
          out his wallet and hands all his cash to the hippie asshole.

                              hippie asshole
                        (laughing like a prick)
                 dumbass.
          suddenly, christy and clarissa (two gorgeous twins, blonde,
          blue eyes, big breasts, british accents) approach carrying
          take-out bags. they see kumar and the hippie asshole making
          their deal.

                              christy
                 hey, you guys about to smoke?
          kumar and hippie asshole turn and see the twins.   they're
          both floored by their hotness.

                             hippie asshole
                       (to the twins)
                 yeah. wanna come back to my place?

                              kumar
                 please. like they want to go listen to a
                 bunch of phish records while you read
                 your lame ass poetry.

                                     kumar (cont'd)
                               (to the twins, showing his
                                bag of weed)
                        ladies? wanna get high and have some fun?
                christy and clarissa look at each other. they like this dude.

                           christy                           clarissa
                sure!                           sure!

                                     hippie asshole
                               (butting in)
                        hey, my poetry isn't lame! it's actually
                        quite good.
                the girls clearly aren't convinced. the ignore him and turn
                to kumar. hippie asshole is oblivious to the fact he's not
                part of the crowd.

                                     christy
                               (re: bag of food)
                        we're just gonna eat before this gets
                        cold. what do you say we meet you back
                        in our room in twenty minutes?

                                     clarissa
                        we're in room 109.

                                      kumar
                        109.   got it. i'll see you later.

                                     hippie asshole
                        yeah, see you there.
                the twins walk away. kumar's excited. hippie asshole tries
                to pound fists with kumar like they're all of a sudden
                friends. kumar snubs him and runs off.

                                     hippie asshole
                        not cool, man.

          52b   int. dorm hallway                                        52b
                kumar runs down the hall and finds harold walking with cindy
                and the asian students. he runs over to them...

                                     kumar
                        rold! rold! you gotta come quick!
                        there are these two filthy pussies who
                        are just aching to get boned by us.
                kumar notices that cindy is appalled by his choice of words.

                                     kumar
                        uh...i mean...there are two very lovely,
                        young pussies who would like to have a
                        chat with you and i.

                                     cindy
                      sorry.    harold's coming with us.

                                   kumar
                      that's bullshit. he's coming with me.
                      isn't that right, rold?
               cindy gives harold an evil eye-- he's intimidated by her.

                                   harold
                             (to kumar)
                      let's go to the party for a little while.

                                     kumar
                      fuck that!
               kumar notices an open dorm room nearby. he enters the room,
               and returns a few moments later dragging an asian freshman in
               his pajamas. he pushes the asian freshman over to cindy...

                                   kumar
                      here-- this is harold's understudy.     you
                      can do whatever you want with him.
                             (to harold)
                      let's go.
               kumar grabs harold by the arm and drags him away. cindy
               looks pissed as she watches harold being taken away from her.
