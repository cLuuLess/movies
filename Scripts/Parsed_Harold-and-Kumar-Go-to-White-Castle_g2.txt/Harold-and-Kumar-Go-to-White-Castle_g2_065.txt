          79   ext. side of the road - 1:15 am                               79
               harold examines the flat tire. kumar is standing nearby.
               there's not another car in site.

                                   harold
                      godammit. you know how to change a flat?

                                   kumar
                      please. only hicks and italian guys know
                      how to change a tire.
               harold looks in his trunk for the spare.    it's missing.

                                   harold
                      where's my spare tire?

                                   kumar
                      i don't know.

                                   harold
                      shit, where the hell is it?
               kumar suddenly remembers...

                                   kumar
                      oh yeah! don't you remember that time we
                      got baked and started throwing shit off
                      that bridge to see if it would float?

                                   harold
                      what bridge? what the hell are you
                      talking about?

                                   kumar
                             (realizing)
                      oh shit. that's right. i was with
                      goldstein. we borrowed your car that day.
                      my bad.

                                    harold
                      your bad?   what are the hell are we gonna
                      do now?!
               suddenly, they see an old pick-up truck driving in their
               direction. harold and kumar wave it down. the truck stops
               in front of them. the door opens and a shadowy figure begins
               walking towards them. harold and kumar are nervous. as soon
               as the figure reaches them, lightening strikes.

               it's the ugliest man of all time-- he's in his fifties,
               wearing a crappy mesh cap, but most notably, he has large
               bumps and boils all over his face. harold and kumar jump
               back in fear as they catch their first glimpse of him.

                                   ugly man
                      you boys need some help?
               the ugly man takes off his mesh cap. even his haircut is
               freaky. he has a skullet (a mullet but with no hair on top).
               harold and kumar look at each other, freaked out.
