               harold and kumar get out of the car.   neil is still in the
               backseat. the car is still running.

                                   harold
                      we'll be right back, neil.
               neil shakes his head, disappointed. harold and kumar start
               walking over to the convenience store.

                                   harold
                      what's the deal with neil patrick harris?
                      why's he so horny?

                                   kumar
                      i don't know. but we can't let him
                      interfere with our quest.
               suddenly, cole's yellow jeep drives right by them. they have
               to jump out of the way. cole parks the jeep and exits with

               two of the extreme sports punks.

                                   cole

                                   harold
                             (upset)
                      oh shit. these idiots.
               cole and the two punks push past harold and kumar and walk
               into the store. harold and kumar enter after them...
