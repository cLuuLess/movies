               as harold and kumar enter, we hear a door slam behind them.
               they turn around and see maria locking her door. she hasn't
               noticed harold and kumar yet.

                                   kumar
                      hey, there's your girlfriend. you
                      actually gonna talk to her this time?

                harold's answer becomes clear as he pushes the "door closed"
                button repeatedly. the door closes before maria sees them.

                                    kumar
                       what the hell are you doing? that was a
                       perfect opportunity! you could have asked
                       her if she wanted to go to white castle.
                harold doesn't say anything.   he looks down in shame.

                                    kumar
                       you're worthless.

                                    harold
                       i'm not worthwhile.
