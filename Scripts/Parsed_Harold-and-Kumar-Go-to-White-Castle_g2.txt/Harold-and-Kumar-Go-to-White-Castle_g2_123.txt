          138   ext. cliff - 6:40 am                                        138
                we see the jeep stop just short of the cliff. harold and
                kumar get out of the jeep and walk over to the edge of the
                cliff and look down. it's a very steep drop.

                suddenly, kumar sees something out in the distance...

                                    kumar
                              (pointing)
                        rold! look out there!

                harold looks to where kumar is pointing-- it's a white castle

                way down below, about a mile away.

                they then hear a police siren coming from back in the woods.

                                      harold
                        oh shit!   we're trapped!
                kumar notices something...

                                     kumar
                        not necessarily.
                kumar walks over to the jeep and points to the hang-glider...

                                     harold
                        no. no way. not a chance.       i'd rather
                        turn myself in than die.

                                     kumar
                        dude, it's okay. i used to hang-glide
                        with my dad all the time when i was kid.
                        i know how to do it.

                                     harold
                        you hang-glided? i don't remember that.

                                     kumar
                        we did it on our trips   to india. i
                        swear. i know exactly    what i'm doing.
                        i've even done it with   two people at the
                        same time. my brother    and i did it.

                              kumar (cont'd)
                 just hold onto the outside bars and let
                 me take care of the rest.

                              harold
                 no, kumar. i'm not risking my life over
                 a bunch of hamburgers.
          kumar walks over to harold and stares him in the eye...

                              kumar
                 you think this just about the burgers,
                 huh? well, let me tell you-- it's about
                 far more than that.
          kumar walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto
          the early morning horizon. the sun is still rising. the
          scene is very picturesque...

                              kumar
                 our parents came to this country,
                 escaping persecution, poverty, and
                 hunger. hunger, harold. they were very,
                 very hungry. and they wanted to live in
                 a land that treated them as equals. a
                 land where their kids could study and get
                 into good colleges. a land filled with
                 hamburger stands. and not just one type
                 of hamburger. hundreds of types-- with
                 different sizes, toppings, and
                 condiments. that land was america.

          the police siren is getting louder...

                              kumar
                        (turning to rold)
                 you think this is just about the burgers?
                 no. this is about achieving what our
                 parents set out for. this is about the
                 pursuit of happiness. this is about the
                 american dream.
          kumar walks over to harold.

                               kumar
                 and so we've reached this point. the
                 point which all men eventually have to
                 face. the point of no return.
                        (beat)
                 we can stay here, get arrested and end
                 our hopes of ever going to white castle.
                 or we can take the hang-glider and make
                 our leap towards freedom. i leave the
                 decision up to you.
          from the sound of the sirens, it seems that the police are
          getting closer. harold turns back, facing kumar...

                                    harold
                       i hate you, kumar.
