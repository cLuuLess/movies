                      dude, we are not driving through that
                      basketball game!

                              kumar
                 we have to if we want to get out of here.
          kumar points to a sign indicating that the highway is ahead.

                              harold
                 forget about it. no way.

                              kumar
                 come on. how do you know they're not
                 peaceful gregory hines-like black guys?
          with that, the hugest angriest black man of all time roars as
          he completes a monster dunk. in celebration, he violently
          bumps chests with his teammates.

                              harold
                 turn the car around.

                              kumar
                 why? are cars not allowed to go through
                 when a game's going on? when we were
                 kids, we used to move to the side when we
                 were playing in the street.
          the hugest angriest black man stares harold and kumar down.

                              harold
                 for some reason, i don't think this is
                 the same thing.

                              kumar
                 i'm going through.
          kumar begins inching forward.

                                harold
                 don't!
          the basketball players slowly begin moving aside.

                                kumar
                 look.    they're moving.   i told you.
          even though the players are making way for harold and kumar,
          they're still no more than a foot or two from the car at all
          times. harold is scared shitless. he then notices the
          hugest angriest black man holding the basketball.

                              harold
                 shit, he's gonna throw the ball at us.

                              kumar
                 how do you know?

                                     harold
                      look at him!
               the hugest angriest black man has an especially angry face.

                                     kumar
                      oh fuck.
               kumar puts the pedal to the metal and zooms away from them.
