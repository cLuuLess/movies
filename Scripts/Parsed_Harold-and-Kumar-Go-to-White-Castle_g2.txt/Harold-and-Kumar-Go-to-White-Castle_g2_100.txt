          113    ext. krispee kreme donuts                                    113
                 harold and kumar walk over to the parking lot. unfortunately,
                 they notice a familiar yellow jeep covered in stickers.

                                        kumar
                        oh great.     here we go again.
                 cole and the extreme sports punks are hacky-sacking in the
                 parking lot. their skateboards are sitting nearby.

                                     cole (o.s.)
                               (to kumar)
                        hey apu!
                 cole laughs.   kumar tries to ignore him...

                                     cole
                        who's running the quik-e-mart while
                        you're gone?
                 cole pounds fists with his friends.

                                     kumar
                               (to rold)
                        fucking asshole.
                 suddenly, harold stops in his tracks. he's noticed something
                 through the krispee kreme window. he stops kumar and
                 points...

                                        harold
                        look!
                 through the window, we see rosenberg and goldstein inside,
                 sitting at a booth. they both have a dozen donuts and five
                 cartons of milk. it looks like they just sat down...
                 goldstein savors his first bite of his powdered blueberry
                 filled donut and rosenberg licks his fingers after his first
                 bite of his chocolate cream filled donut.
                 harold and kumar watch through the window longingly...

                              harold
                        (yearning)
                 i want that.

                                kumar
                 what?    a chocolate cream filled?

                               harold
                 no.  i want that feeling.
                        (beat)
                 the feeling that comes over a man when he
                 finally gets exactly what he desires.
                        (beat)
                 i need that feeling.

                              kumar
                 are you saying what i think you're
                 saying?

                              harold
                 we gotta go to white castle.
          kumar gives harold a hug.

                                kumar
                 yes!    i knew you had it in you!
          suddenly, kumar notices something else inside. someone else
          is sitting down at rosenberg & goldstein's table...

                              kumar
                 is that cindy kim?
          harold watches as cindy kim sits down next to goldstein.
          goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of
          donut. it looks like goldstein and cindy are "an item."

                              kumar
                 you should have boned her when you had
                 the chance.
          before harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head
          by a hacky sack! cole and the punks laugh at harold.

                              harold
                        (to cole)
                 hey, why don't you just leave us alone?

                             cole
                 oh yeah? what are you gonna do about it,
                 mr. miagi?
          cole gets in the crane position a la the karate kid...
          harold is quiet for a moment as he looks at cole's little
          racist routine. he then lets out a little laugh...

                                    harold
                       nothing.
                harold turns around and starts walking towards the krispee
                kreme entrance. kumar follows. in the background cole and the
                punks are laughing about what a "pussy" harold is.

                                    kumar
                              (pissed off, but
                               powerless)
                       fuck! i'm so sick of their bullshit!

                                    harold
                              (totally calm)
                       don't worry. the universe tends to
                       unfold as it should.
                kumar gives a "what the fuck is he talking about?" look.

                                    harold
                       besides, i have a plan.   follow my
                       lead...

                                    kumar
                       your lead?
                harold walks past the krispee kreme entrance and heads
                towards the yellow jeep at a brisk pace. kumar follows.

                suddenly, harold snatches cole's keys from the hood of the

                jeep and rushes inside the driver's side.
                one of the extreme sports punks sees harold doing this...

                                     extreme sports punk #1
                       hey, cole!   look!
                cole turns to see harold in his car. kumar is about to get
                in the passenger's side. cole and the punks start running
                towards the car! kumar sees this and quickly gets inside.
                harold puts the car in reverse, nearly hitting the punks.
