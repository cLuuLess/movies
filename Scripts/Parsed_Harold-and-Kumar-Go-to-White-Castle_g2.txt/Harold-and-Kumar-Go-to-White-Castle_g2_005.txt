              kumar patel (22, indian, funky hair) is answering questions
              from his nyu medical school interviewer, dr. woodruff (middle
              aged, erudite, very professional). kumar has no accent.
              he's american.

                                  kumar
                     mononucleosis or mono is an infection
                     caused by the epstein-barr virus.
                     symptoms may include fever, sore throat,
                     headaches, white patches on the back of
                     your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness
                     and loss of appetite.

                                  dr. woodruff
                     excellent, kumar. i have to say you're
                     one of the best applicants i've ever
                     interviewed. not that it's a surprise.
                     your father is very respected in his
                     field. you know he and i had some pretty
                     wild times when we were in med school.

                                    kumar
                     really?

                                  dr. woodruff
                     yeah. we started our own basketball team--
                     the hemoglobin trotters...
                            (cracking up)
                     yeah, we were crazy.
              kumar nods and smiles.   woodruff finally stops laughing...

                                  dr. woodruff
                     anyway-- just one more question.
                            (reading from a clipboard)
                     what are some potential symptoms of
                     pancreatitis?

                                  kumar
                     let's see. there might be epigastric
                     tenderness, diffuse abdominal
                     tenderness...
              suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a
              gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody
              smoking from a bong. dr. woodruff is confused. kumar pulls
              out his cell phone. it's his personalized ringer.

                              kumar
                        (to dr. woodruff)
                 i'm sorry. can you hold on one second?
          kumar stands up and answers his cell phone.

                              kumar
                        (into the phone)
                 kumar's phone. kumar speaking.
                        (listening)
                 oh, hey.
                        (listening)
                 nothing important. i can talk. what's up?
          dr. woodruff is offended. he takes a sip of from a mug of
          coffee and watches as kumar begins pacing around the office.
          intercut:
