          int. harold's cubicle - simultaneous
          harold is talking on his office phone...

                              harold
                 i'm not gonna be able to partake in our
                 usual friday night ritual. i've gotta
                 stay late at the office.

                              kumar
                        (into the phone)
                 fuck that shit! we had plans!
          dr. woodruff can't believe kumar's choice of words.

                              harold
                 i know, but i gotta get this work done.

                              kumar
                 oh come on! when has getting high ever
                 prevented you from finishing your work?
          dr. woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply
          slips out of his hands. hot coffee goes all over his shirt.
          woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin.

                              harold (o.s.)
                 listen, i'd love to go home, but...

                              kumar
                 no fucking buts! i just bought a quarter
                 of the finest herb in new york city, and
                 i'm not smoking it alone.

                              kumar (cont'd)
                 so you're just gonna have to chill the
                 fuck out, bring your work home, and
                 prepare to get blazed, because in a
                 couple of hours i expect both of us to be
                 blitzed out of our skulls. got it?...okay
                 good. see you later.
          kumar hangs up the phone and sits back down.      dr. woodruff is
          stunned.

                              kumar
                        (to dr. woodruff)
                 okay, where was i? oh yes. more
                 symptoms of pancreatitis. um...decreased
                 bowel sounds, possibly fever,
                 dehydration, and sometimes even shock.

                              dr. woodruff
                        (livid)
                 mr. patel. this is supposed to be a
                 proper interview. do you actually believe
                 after the way you've behaved that i would
                 ever even consider recommending you for
                 admission?

                                kumar
                 no.    i'd actually be pretty surprised.
          dr. woodruff is flustered.   he doesn't know how to react.

                              kumar
                 look, i'm just interviewing so my dad
                 will keep paying for my apartment. i'm
                 not really planning on going to med
                 school.

                              dr. woodruff
                        (confused)
                 but...you have perfect mcat scores!

                              kumar
                 well, i'm not an idiot.
          dr. woodruff is at a loss for words.
          kumar notices a framed picture of a hot teenage girl on dr.
          woodruff's desk. he picks it up.

                                kumar
                 wow!    is this your daughter?
          a disturbed dr. woodruff grabs the portrait out of kumar's
          hands.
