               the cell door slams.    harold is behind bars.

                                   harold
                             (calling out)
                      hey, are you gonna do something about my
                      car? hello?
               palumbo is in the main office area, dealing with hippie
               asshole and his mom. the mom hands officer palumbo a check.

                                   officer palumbo
                      thanks, mrs. ogelthorpe. your donation
                      to our police charity is very
                      appreciated.

                              hippie asshole's mom
                 well, thank you for being so
                 understanding about bradley. i promise
                 you he won't ever do it again.

                              officer palumbo
                 oh, i'm sure he won't. not after the
                 talk we had, right brad?
          officer palumbo gives hippie asshole a threatening look.

                              hippie asshole
                        (shaken)
                 mom-- please take me home...
          the mom leaves, with hippie asshole clinging to her like a
          frightened child.
          palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we
          see hippie asshole's big bag of weed, along with harold's
          wallet and laptop. he then starts filing a report on
          harold...
          harold looks at officer palumbo through the bars...

                              harold
                 can i at least give you my car's licence
                 plate number?
          ignoring harold, palumbo turns up the volume on his radio...

                              radio   announcer
                 the search for the   escaped cheetah
                 continues tonight.   it was last spotted in
                 randolph township,   heading south...
          harold turns around and examines his cell. inside with him
          is a black man (tarik) sitting down, reading a book. harold
          sits down, across from tarik.
          while harold isn't looking, we see officer palumbo take the
          cash out of harold's wallet and pocket it.

                              harold
                 so what are you in here for?

                              tarik
                 for being black.

                               harold
                 come on.   seriously.
          tarik sits up. he looks at officer palumbo who, with his
          walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation.

                              tarik
                 i am serious. you wanna know what
                 happened?
          harold nods.

                              tarik
                 i was walking out of a barnes and noble,
                 and a cop stops me. evidently, a black
                 man robbed a store in newark. therefore,
                 since i'm black, it was probably me,
                 right?
          harold shrugs his shoulders.

                              tarik
                 well that was the logic the cop used. i
                 told him i haven't even been to newark in
                 months. then he pointed a gun at me and
                 told me to stop resisting arrest. i
                 said, "hey, i'm not resisting anything."
                 so he starts beating me with his gun,
                 screaming at me, telling me to stop
                 resisting.

                               harold
                 holy shit.   what did you do?

                              tarik
                 i kept saying, "i understand that i'm
                 under arrest. please stop beating me."
                 but that didn't work. then another cop
                 showed up. then another. when it was
                 all said and done, it took nine cops to
                 bring me in here.

                              harold
                 that fucking blows!
          tarik nods and continues reading his book.    harold sees that
          tarik is remarkably relaxed.

                              harold
                 i don't understand how you're able to be
                 so calm about all this.

                               tarik
                 son, i'm fat. i'm black. i can't dance.
                 and i have two gay fathers. i've had
                 people messing with me my whole life.
                        (beat)
                 i learned a long time ago, there's no
                 point in getting all riled up every time
                 a bunchy of idiots gives you a hard time.
                 because in the end, the universe tends to
                 unfold as it should.

               harold takes this all in.

                                   tarik
                      so what are you in here for?

                                   harold
                      assaulting an officer.

                                   tarik
                      they tried to pin that shit on you too?

                                   harold
                      no. i actually did hit the cop. but
                      only because i was trying to hit my
                      friend. well, ex-friend.

          
               suddenly, officer reilly hangs up the phone on his desk. he
               shouts out to the other officers in the room:

                                   officer reilly
                      hey, listen up guys! multiple gun shots
                      fired in millbrook park! it sounds bad!

                                   officer palumbo
                      finally, some action! i'm going!
               another cop, officer martone, gets up...

                                   officer martone
                      no-- i'm going!
               all six officers in the room jump out of their desks and run
               for the door. harold and tarik can't believe it.
