          angle - television
          it's an anti-marijuana commercial. two teenagers are
          listening to rock music in a house without parents. one
          teenager (blonde) passes a joint to the other (brown haired).

                                 blonde haired kid
                    come on, dude. just take one hit.       don't
                    you want to be cool?
          nervously, brown haired kid takes a hit of the joint. right
          after he exhales, he walks over to his dad's gun rack and
          takes out a long rifle...

                                 blonde haired kid
                    hey man, what are you doing?

                                   brown haired kid
                    i'm so high!    nothing can hurt me!
          the brown haired kid puts the end of the rifle in his mouth.
          we see blonde haired kid in slow motion go "nooooo!" bang!

          we hear a gunshot as the screen turns black...

                                 announcer (v.o.)
                    marijuana kills.

          angle -    harold and kumar
          they're laughing their asses off at the commercial.

                                 kumar
                    i love that shit!
          harold continues flipping channels...

          angle- tv
          we see a news report

                                 newscaster
                    tonight...a cheetah escaped from the

          harold's not interested.       he continues flipping...

                                  harold
                    nice.   sixteen candles is on.

                              kumar (cont'd)
                        (mock opening an envelope)
                 ...harold lee! come on down! take a bow!

                              harold
                 oh come on. it's a john hughes movie!
                 it's a classic! it's a beautiful story
                 about someone who feels unnoticed,
                 unappreciated, unloved...

                               kumar
                 hey look!   it's you!
          kumar points to the tv where we see a clip from sixteen
          candles--[long duk dong talking about quiche/round pie]
          kumar laughs.   harold isn't amused.
          we see another clip [long duk talking about the chores he
          does for the grandparents].

                              kumar
                 hey, when are you gonna start doing some
                 chores around here?
          harold gives kumar a "don't even joke" look. he then
          violently grabs the bong from kumar and lights it. kumar
          laughs as harold exhales a lot of smoke...

                              harold
                 we're so high right now.

                              kumar
                 we're not low.

                              harold
                 i don't know about you, but i'm hungry as
                 balls.

                                kumar
                 no shit!    let's eat!
          harold bends down and picks up a bunch of delivery menus that
          have been left on the floor...

                              kumar
                 nah, i don't feel like delivery tonight.

                              harold
                 what about kfc?

                               kumar
                 nah, we've been there too many times.
                        (beat)
                 i want something we haven't had in
                 awhile. something different. something
                 that'll really hit the spot. i want the
                 perfect food...

                      are you hungry?
               harold and kumar turn their attention to the tv, where they
               see a white castle commercial taking place. in the
               commercial, we see dozens of tiny burgers lined up in a row.

                                   voice on tv
                      then come to white castle and try our
                      slyder special-- six burgers, fries, and
                      a soft drink for only 2.99.
               harold and kumar start salivating, as they see the steam rise

               from the burgers on the t.v.

                                   voice on tv
                      imagine all those burgers in your stomach
                      right now. mmmmmh....
               harold and kumar move closer to the tv to smell the burgers.

                                   voice on tv
                      don't you like food that's tasty and
                      delicious?
               almost in a trance, harold and kumar nod agreeingly.

                                   voice on tv
                      then what are you waiting for? head over
                      to white castle. it's what you crave.
               the commercial ends. harold and kumar look at each other--
               this is clearly an emotional moment for both of them.
