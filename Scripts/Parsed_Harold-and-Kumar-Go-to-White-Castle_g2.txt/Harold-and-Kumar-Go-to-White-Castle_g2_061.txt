          75    int. hallway                                                75
                harold and kumar (now wearing blue jackets and doctors masks)
                walk out of the lounge and head down the hallway...

                                    harold
                       if we get caught, you're taking the
                       blame. this wasn't my idea.

                                    kumar
                       we're not gonna get caught. we're gonna
                       get toasted and then we're gonna eat
                       delicious white castle-- just like we
                       planned.
                all of a sudden, a hand grabs kumar from behind. freaked
                out, they turn around and see a male nurse (frazzled, touchy
                feely).

                                    male nurse
                       dr. patel, thank god i found you!    i need
                       your help immediately!
                the nurse drags them to a nearby emergency room...
