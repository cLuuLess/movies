     int. the apartment - continuous

     they spread out, searching the well-decorated condo for
     the target.

     they near the room with light. using a mini-mirror,
     hicks looks around the bend to see--

     a bedroom. there's a briefcase on the bed.

     they enter.

     from the bathroom they hear sounds of running water.
     they slowly approach. wood again creaks beneath them.

     dean's voice is heard through the locked door.

     hicks signals "on three".

     he counts, and they smash the door open to see--

     --a cellular phone taped to a baby-monitor. dean's
     nowhere in sight.

                        hicks
            the fuck is this?
