     ext. high-rise rooftop - night

     eight stories up and deserted. the lit dome of the
     capitol building shines like a beacon in the d.c. skyline.

     dean suddenly slams against a wall--

                        dean
            hey!

                        man
            forget me, forget what i did for
            you. don't ever mention my name or
            try to contact me again. get it?

                        dean
            i don't know you, i don't know your
            name, i don't know what the hell
            you did for me except hang up on my
            wife and slam me into a wall, but
            i'm getting pretty fuckin' sick of
            this! get it?!

                        man
            seat 74.

                        dean
               (pause)
            you're brill.

                        brill
            you knew the deal. no contact.

                        dean
            who was that other guy?

                        brill
            one of many people who would live a
            word with you.

                        dean
            who are they?

                        brill
            you've heard of the national security
            agency?

                        dean
            what do they have to do with this?

                        brill
            that's who they are.

                        dean
            the nsa?

                        brill
            yes.

                        dean
            you're crazy.

                        brill
               (starting to leave)
            okay.

                        dean
            wait.

                        brill
            you drive a black bmw, license
            plate srk1339?

                        dean
            yeah.

                        brill
               (reaching in his pocket)
            i clipped this from your wheel well
            just before they towed your car away.

     brill pulls out a disk-shaped object the size of a
     walk-man.

                        dean
            what is that?

                        brill
            it's a sat-tracker.

                        dean
            i don't know what that means.

                        brill
            like a lowjack, but two generations
            ahead of what the police use. it
            pulses at 230 giga-hertz.

                        dean
            i don't know what that means.

                        brill
            230 giga-hertz. they use that band
            for the aquacade spy-sat uplinks.

                        dean
            i don't know what that means.

                        brill
            it means the nsa can read the time
            off your wristwatch.

                        dean
            why are they after me?

                        brill
            if i knew, they'd be after me.
            which they probably are right now.
            'bye.

                        dean
            wait. what do i do?

                        brill
            pal, you're cooked. it's over. what
            you did, who you were...that's done.
            i'd find a quiet job somewhere
            shoveling snow.

     a helicopter hovers near the washington monument. brill
     eyes it cautiously.

                        dean
            why don't they just identify
            themselves and tell me what they want?

                        brill
            they're spooks.

                        dean
            i don't know what that--

                        brill
            exposure. they can't have it. they
            wanna learn what you know and then
            deal with it.

                        dean
            i don't know anything.

                        brill
            no shit.

                        dean
            what am i gonna do?! i mean, like,
            for the rest of my life?!

                        brill
            hey, if you live another week i'll
            be impressed.

                        dean
            what if--

                        brill
            look, you gave me some work over
            the last year. we'll call it even.

     brill turns to leave--

                        dean
               (blocking the exit door)
            what if i find out what they're
            after. you know these people, i don't.

                        brill
            and you won't. now move--

                        dean
            i'll pay you.

                        brill
               (taking out his pistol)
            they froze your accounts. get outa
            my way.

     dean continues blocking the door, maintaining calm even
     as brill's pistol is pressed firmly to his forehead.

                        dean
            i've got a hundred-thousand dollars
            in jewelry in a safe-deposit box
            under a third party name.

     brill looks at the ground. torn.

                        dean (cont'd)
            how many years have you been hiding
            from them? how many years have you
            been running?
               (beat)
            what'd they do to you?

                        brill
               (pause)
            if you find something, chalk the
            baltimore sheraton mailbox and go
            to temperanceville. it's south of
            salisbury.
               (giving dean his pistol)
            and take this.

     and with that, he's gone.

     dean eyes the gun. he walks to the ledge, looking at
     the city.

     dean's pov: several vehicles quietly pull up to the
     building. men storm out an move inside.

     dean quickly backs away.
