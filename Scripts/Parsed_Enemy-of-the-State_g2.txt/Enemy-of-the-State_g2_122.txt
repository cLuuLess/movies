     int. warehouse - night

     brill and dean enter the 2nd story of a large, empty
     structure. dean is carrying a crumpled, brown paper bag.

     in the center of the cavernous space, a windowless,
     cinderblock room built on 5-foot supports.

                        brill
            i call it the jar. no phone or
            utility lines going in.

     brill opens a side door revealing a mini-generator. he
     pushes the start button. the generator hums to life.

                        brill
            self-contained. unplugged from the
            world.
               (opening jar door)
            nothing for a wire bug to piggy-
            back in on. that leaves only
            transmitters and signal sweep for
            those.
               (turning on the light)
            now let's see what we got.

     dean tosses the paper bag to brill, who empties its
     contents (the pieces of the gameboy) on to the table.
