     int. conference room - day

     dean sits in the conference room by himself. he waits.

     after a moment, silverberg and blake stride in.

                        dean
            listen--

                        silverberg
            i got a call this morning from a
            source i trust. the post is running
            a lead this afternoon about your
            involvement in the bellmoth
            investigation.

                        dean
            i don't under--

                        blake
            we've also been informed that the
            grand jury is going to call for an
            investigation into your affairs.

                        dean
            why?

                        blake
            they want to hold you in contempt
            for ethics violations.

                        silverberg
            they claim you helped create a
            shell company for sam vollotti in
            zurich and that through your
            continuing relationship, the
            gambino family's been able to exert
            influence and provide false
            witnesses to discredit our case.

                        dean
            oh, well, that's true.

                        blake
            it is?

                        dean
            except for the part about my
            setting up a company in zurich and
            knowing anyone named sam vollotti
            and having any relationship
            whatsoever with the gambino family.

                        silverberg
            robert--

                        dean
            gimme a week and four guys from
            litigation and i'll have the post
            pleading with us not to sue for libel.

                        blake
            tell us about rachel banks.

                        dean
               (stunned)
            rachel banks?

                        silverberg
            the attorney?

                        blake
            have you two been having an affair?

     dean is speechless...

                        dean
            what kind of a question is that?

                        blake
            a direct one.

                        dean
            i have a professional relationship
            with rachel banks. she's the go-
            between for a private investigator
            i use.

                        silverberg
            what's his name?

                        dean
            brill.

                        blake
            why don't you just call brill directly.

                        dean
            i don't know who he is.

                        blake
            i'm told you had an affair with
            rachel banks four years ago.

                        dean
            told by whom?

                        blake
            considering the enormous exposure
            to which you've subjected this firm,
            i'd think you'd do best to simply
            answer my questions.

                        dean
            really?

                        blake
            yes.

                        dean
            well considering what a colossal
            douche bag you are, david, maybe
            i'd do best to simply kick your ass
            all over the capitol.

                        silverberg
            gentlemen--

                        dean
            this is bullshit. someone's mixing
            up a bunch of half-truths to ruin
            me and to ruin my case.

                        silverberg
            who would do that?

                        dean
            maybe bellmoth. maybe the unions. i
            don't know.

                        silverberg
            well until we find, you're gonna
            have to take a leave of absence.

                        dean
            you're firing me.

                        silverberg
            a leave of absence. until we've
            sorted this all out.

                        dean
            put david on it. he seems anxious
            to clear my name.

                        silverberg
            bobby--

                        dean
            fuck off.
