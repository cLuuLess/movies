     int. black town car - continuous

     in the backseat of the car sit hamersley and reynolds,
     each well-kept and in his early 50's.

                        reynolds
            "i know thy works and thy labour
            and how thou canst not bear them
            that are evil. and thou hast tried
            them who say they are apostles and
            hast found them to be liars".
            revelations ii.

                        hamersley
            what the hell does it mean?

                        reynolds
            it means who's side are you on?

                        hamersley
            you didn't ask me to meet you 30
            miles from my office for a bible
            study class.

                        reynolds
            it's a bi-partisan issue. everyone
            needs to swallow hard. no one,
            including you, wants to be fingered
            as the one obstructing efforts to
            crack down on terrorism, and--

                        hamersley
            fuck you.

                        reynolds
            what?

                        hamersley
            i said fuck you.

                        reynolds
            is that anyway to talk to an old
            school chum?

                        hamersley
            you're gonna finger me as soft on
            terrorism? terrorism, you
            unconscionable asshole?

                        reynolds
            there are planes falling out of the
            sky, buildings blowing up. american
            buildings. americans getting bombs
            in the mail. what are we gonna do!?

                        hamersley
            we're not gonna hand you and your
            band of lunatics the keys to the
            kingdom. i'm not gonna sit in
            congress and write a law that
            allows the nsa to point a camera
            and a microphone at anything they
            damn well feel like. and the next
            time you have something to say to
            me, we do it above-board, in my
            office, like everyone else. now get
            outa my car, i've got a committee
            meeting on the hill.

     reynolds regards hamersley a moment, then opens the car
     door--
