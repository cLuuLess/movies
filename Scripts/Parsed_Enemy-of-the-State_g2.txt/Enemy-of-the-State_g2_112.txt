     ext. street - continuous

     unmarked cars of various descriptions rapidly appear
     from nowhere giving chase.

                        another agent (o.s.)
               (radio effect)
            502 to 501, i've got the eyeball.
            he's approaching ridgeview, we'll
            take him at the intersection.

     the range rover speeds through the neighborhood.
     suddenly, two cars are out in front, blocking the way.
     the range rover swerves and breaks as two more cars rip
     up behind, boxing it in. an un-marked trans-am lags
     behind, keeping reporters at bay.

     doors fling open. jones and three men, all in plain
     clothes, pistols and mac-10 aimed at the range rover.

     nothing happens.

     the men move closer--

     jones grabs the door and rips it open, revealing dean's
     piss-frightened nanny behind the wheel in dean's trench
     coat and hat.

     jones yanks her out, puts her hard to the ground, gun
     jammed to her head, as other search the range rover for
     dean.
