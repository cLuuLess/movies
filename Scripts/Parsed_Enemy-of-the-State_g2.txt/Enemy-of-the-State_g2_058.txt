     guests mill about. dean and stacy are standing by the
     reception table where name tags and seating assignments
     are laid out. dean picks up a card that reads: mr. and
     mrs. robert dean - table 122.

     jerry steps over and puts his hand on dean's shoulder--

                        jerry

            about?

                        dean
            i wrote a check for a thousand
            dollars. you guys didn't have a
            table that was in the kitchen?

     jerry gently pulls dean to a quiet corner...

                        jerry
            the congressman's very happy to
            have your support, but he's heard
            that there's an investigation.

                        dean
            an investigation? it was a bus
            accident.

                        jerry
            he's heard that it's escalated.

                        dean
            into what?

                        jerry

            there might be mob ties.

                        dean

            always mob ties.
