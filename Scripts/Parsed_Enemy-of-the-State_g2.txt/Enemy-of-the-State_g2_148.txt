     int. christa's hotel room - night

     a clock reads 1:28 am. the lights are on and the bed
     unslept in. christa's not seen. then the connecting
     door opens--

     christa steps from the senator's adjoining suite in a
     silk robe, nothing underneath. she turns in the doorway,
     revealing albert, naked in a towel.

     christa closes the door, climbs in bed and grabs the
     remote. she clicks on the tv.

     feedback screeches from the set.

     she tries changing channels but the screeching
     continues. she tries turning off the set, but it won't
     turn off. she grabs the phone and dials.

                        christa
               (into phone)
            can you send someone up right away.
            i'm having a problem with my tv...
            it's screeching and i--
               (beat)
            it's screeching and i--

     christa is noticing that her voice is causing the tv
     image to distort in sync.

                        christa (cont'd)
            it's screeching and i can't turn it
            off.
