     int. tech room - night

     we hear a recording of the conversation between dean,
     pratt and bingham while we're close on an ink needle
     measuring dean's voice stress levels.

                        dean (v.o.)
            he didn't give me--

                        pratt (v.o.)
            --otherwise we may have to--

                        dean (v.o.)
            otherwise you may have to what?

                        pratt (v.o.)
            we'd rather not--

                        dean (v.o.)
            fuck you. you may have to--

     hicks turns off the recorder. standing with him is
     reynolds, the dean file and voice stress graph laid out
     before him.

                        hicks
            he's arrogant and threatening.
            voice stress points suggest he's
            worrying.

                        reynolds
            hiding something?

                        hicks
            it was in his bag. now it's not.

                        reynolds
            destroy his credibility before he
            goes public. neutralize him. i
            don't want anyone listening to a
            word he has to say. tell me about
            rachel banks.
