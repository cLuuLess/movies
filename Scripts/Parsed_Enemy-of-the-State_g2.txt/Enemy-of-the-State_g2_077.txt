     ext. harbor center - day

     close on a surveillance camera on a pole, sweeping,
     making automatic lens corrections.

                        rachel (o.s.)
            there's a lot of people asking
            questions about you and me.

     we drift down to the harbor walkway, a greenbelt with
     quaint hotels and bars on one side, chesapeake bay on
     the other. dean and rachel are strolling the walk.

                        dean
            i know.

                        rachel
            the irs contacted me this morning.
            they say my lifestyle and receipts
            exceed my income.

                        dean
            you being audited?

                        rachel
            for the last four years.

                        dean
            my firm'll represent you. free of
            charge.

                        rachel
            you don't work there anymore, bobby.

                        dean
            that's temporary.

                        rachel
            bullshit.

                        dean
            rachel--

                        rachel
            we're screwed.

                        dean
            i'm gonna fix it.

                        rachel
            how?

                        dean
