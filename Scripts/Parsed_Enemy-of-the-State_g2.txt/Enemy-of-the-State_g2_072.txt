     thread-bare chairs and a couch. sal and frankie, both
     meaty guys in shiny shirts, sit facing dean, who stands
     before them.

                        sal
            i'm sorry. i'm not sure i understand.
            you wanna fuckin' what?

                        dean
            i'd like to speak to someone about
            what's happening to me.

                        frankie
               (to sal)
            what'd this guy say his name was?

                        sal
            this is bobby dean, the jew lawyer
            who squeezed depinto.

                        dean
            actually, that's not true.

                        sal
            you didn't squeeze depinto?

                        dean
            no, i meant i'm presbyterian.

                        sal
            oh.

                        dean
            my wife's jewish. but that probably
            doesn't matter right now.

                        frankie
            what is it you want?

                        dean
            someone's trying to destroy my life,
            and i'd like to find out who.

                        sal
            and then what?

                        dean
            i'll see if i can, you know, work
            things out.

                        frankie
            well we'd sure like to help you.

                        dean
            you would?

                        frankie
            yes. but we can't.

                        dean
            why not?

                        frankie
            because we, and our associates,
            have paid out hundreds of thousands
            of dollars to shyster lawyers like
            you, because of shyster lawyers
            like you, and we'd just as soon sit
            back and sip a beer while you get
            ass-banged by as many people as
            possible.
