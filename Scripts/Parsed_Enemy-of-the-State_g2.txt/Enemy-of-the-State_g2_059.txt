     int. dining room - night

     close on and old matron carefully chewing her food near
     a table card declaring: 122. the gala swings everywhere
     but here. dean and stacy are the only other diners at
     the table.

                        stacy
            i don't understand why jerry
            couldn't clear this up.

                        dean
            well, you know--

                        stacy
            he's got his priorities?

                        dean
            there's just, clearly, some
            administrative snafu. i'm sure this
            is the worst of it.
