     int. racquetball court - morning

     a black ball slams against a wall. pull back to dean,
     who's angry, frustrated and drenched in sweat. he's
     embroiled in a hard, fast game with his friend, jerry.

                        dean
            they took the espresso machine. the
            espresso machine, jerry! which
            makes sense, you know, because the
            crooks probably wanted to make
            themselves a latte before fencing
            the stereo.

                        jerry
            did they take your clothes?

                        dean
            no.

                        jerry
            you've got a bunch of armani suits,
            they didn't take 'em?

                        dean
            no.

                        jerry
            usually they take clothes.

                        dean
            why don't you give 'em a call.

                        jerry
            what about jewelry?

                        dean
            they didn't take the jewelry. they
            took the computers. they took the
            big-screen tv, they took my blender.

                        jerry
            the blender?

                        dean
            i love my blender.

                        jerry
            they didn't take the silverware?

                        dean
            no, but they took my blender.

                        jerry
            sounds like they didn't want
            anything that wasn't electric?

                        dean
            what?

                        jerry
            they only took electrical appliances.

                        dean
            serve the ball.
