     int. hotel lobby - continuous

     dean stands at a pay phone--

                        dean
               (into phone)
            stacy, don't hang up.

                        stacy

                        dean
            stacy--

                        stacy
            i'm looking at a picture of you and

                        stacy
            was that doctored-up, too?

                        dean
            no, i was with her yesterday. i
            want you to take eric and go to our
            parents house. i want you to do it
            right now.

                        stacy
            i went to the grocery store. my atm
            and credit cards didn't work. i
            couldn't buy food.

                        dean
            i know.

                        stacy
            i went to the bank to see why. they
            said you emptied our accounts--

                        dean
            it wasn't me.

                        stacy
            this is science-fiction robert! the
            manager showed me the transfer
            notice with your signature on it.

                        dean
            stacy, somebody's trying to kill me.
            now goddamit--

                        stacy
            my father's put me in touch with an
            attorney. he'll be--

     a hand suddenly clicks down the phone hook. dean turns
     to see a man, late 50's, gruff and alert. it's the guy
     driving the chevy.

                        man
            put the phone down. do as i say.

     dean does nothing, temporarily frozen. a pistol jabs
     him hard.

                        dean
            alright, alright--

     dean replaces the phone. the man removes dean's gun.
     nearby, two people chat at a restaurant hostess desk,
     unaware.

                        man
            move to the elevators.

     dean does but is suddenly redirected through a roof-
     access door.
