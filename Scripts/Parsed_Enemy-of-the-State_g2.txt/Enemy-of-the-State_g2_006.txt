            how's the trout?

                        dean
            it tastes like fish.

                        rachel
            it is fish.

                        dean
            i mean it tastes like every other
            fish i've ever had. every fish
            tastes the same.

                        rachel
            do you like fish?

                        dean
            not that much.

     dean dines in a booth with rachel banks, 30's. rachel
     opens her briefcase, removing an 8x10 envelope.

                        rachel
            here's what you asked for. brill's
            note said it was everything you'd
            need to, shall we say, coax depinto--

                        dean
            when do i get to meet him?

                        rachel
            depinto?

                        dean
            brill.

                        rachel
            never.

                        dean
            that wasn't the answer i was hoping
            for.

                        rachel
            what answer were you--

     dean is reaching inside his jacket pocket. he removes
     an envelope marked "brill".

                        dean
            "soon". or at least sooner than never.

                        rachel
            it's how he works.

                        dean
            brill?

                        rachel
            yes.

                        dean
            so you've said.

     dean hands her the envelope.

                        dean (cont'd)
            ten thousand cash. i don't know if
            it's brill's prices going up or
            your commission.

                        rachel
            i take a straight 15 percent.
            brill's fee varies with risk.
            perhaps you'd be more comfortable
            using someone else.

                        dean
            other than brill.

                        rachel
            other than me.

                        dean
            why would i--

                        rachel
            someone with whom you don't have
            quite so personal a--

                        dean
            i like our history. and i like you.
            i'd probably like brill if i ever
            got to--

                        rachel
            he doesn't work that way.

                        dean
            i just want to make sure i'm not
            breaking the law.

                        rachel
            you're not.

                        dean
            how can i be sure.

                        rachel
            i wouldn't let you. good luck with
            depinto.

                        dean
               (pause)
            thank you.

                        rachel
            eat your fish.

                        dean (v.o.)
