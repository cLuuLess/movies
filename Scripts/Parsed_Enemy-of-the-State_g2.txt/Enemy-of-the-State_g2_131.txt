     int. nsa/corridor - day

     reynolds and hicks walk down a white hallway three
     football fields in length, filled with bustling
     employees conservatively dressed.

                        hicks
            we found two sets of latent prints
            in the rubble of brill's studio.
            one was dean's. the other, we
            believe, belongs to brill.

                        reynolds
            we believe?

                        hicks
            well...his real name's edward lyle.

                        reynolds
            lyle?!

                        hicks
            yes sir.

                        reynolds
            you're kidding me.

                        hicks
            no sir.

                        reynolds
            dean's with lyle.

                        hicks
            and they have the video. that's
            confirmed.

                        reynolds
            so they know everything.

                        hicks
            if they've looked at the video.

                        reynolds
            oh, let's assume that they have.

                        hicks
            if he's with lyle it means he's got
            resources.

                        reynolds
            resources, that's a good point.
            he's got resources. all we've got
            is a six-hundred billion dollar
            organization! now goddammit, hicks,
            you find 'em. you find 'em and you
            end it now!

     reynolds walks off leaving hicks to ponder his fate.
