     int. pantry closet - continuous

                        dean
               (barely a whisper)
            listen to me. the house is bugged.
            so we gotta be quiet, okay?

     stacy nods understanding. dean slowly removes his hand.

                        dean (cont'd)
               (whispering)
            is eric in school?

                        stacy
            yes.

                        dean
            has anyone been by? police? fbi?

                        stacy
            just reporters.

                        dean
            i wish you'd gone to your parents
            like i asked you.

                        stacy
            this is my house. nobody's kicking
            me out of my house. i picked those
            drapes.

                        dean
            i don't think anybody wants the
            drapes, stacy, i think the drapes
            are okay.

                        stacy
            what happened to your head?

                        dean
            i was in a car chase and a small
            explosion. now listen to me: the
            nsa is behind this. they think that
            guy i told you about, daniel zavitz,
            they think zavitz gave me a tape or
            computer chip of some kind that
            could be damaging to them. so
            they're doing all these things
            electronically. the bank records,
            the surveillance. they're the ones
            who broke into the house. now i
            know there's no reason to believe
            me. but i love you. and i love our
            son. so just believe me anyway.
               (pause)
            please.

     stacy gently touches his forehead where he's been cut...

                        stacy
            does that hurt?

                        dean
            well...yeah.

                        stacy
            good.

                        dean
            stacy--

     she grabs him and kisses him. the kiss lasts a good
     long time before stacy smacks him on the arm--

                        stacy
            i told you they could do this. i
            told you they had this kind of
            capability and that with this anti-
            terrorism it would be just another--

                        dean
            stacy...stacy...maybe now isn't the
            best time for the i-told-you-so speech.

     she kisses him again.

                        stacy
            i'm sorry i didn't believe you.

                        dean
            that's okay.

                        stacy
            i opened the present you got me
            from harrison's.

                        dean
            you opened the thing?

                        stacy
            the lingerie.

                        dean
            that was for christmas.

                        stacy
            i was missing you.

                        dean
            you're as bad as eric. i've got an
            entire family of people who root
            through--

     it dawns on him...everything starts coming together...

                        dean (cont'd)
            ...who root through...uh...presents,
            and...

                        stacy
            what is it?

                        dean
            oh christ.
