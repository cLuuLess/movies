     int. senator albert's rv - day

     brill stands in front of senator albert.

                        brill
            well, sir, i'm afraid it's not as
            simple as that. your average
            newspaper guy or hard copy lady or
            whatever, they can't buy this stuff.

                        senator albert
            well then who can?

                        brill
            ah, sir, you know, it's not for me
            to say.

                        senator albert
            what do you mean? who can buy this
            kind of equipment.

                        brill
            the thing is, senator, and i don't
            want to get in the middle of
            nothing, but--

                        senator albert
            what are you saying?

                        brill
            most of this stuff's only available
            to law enforcement.

                        senator albert
            law enforcement?

                        brill
            fbi, cia, nsa, local cops.

                        senator albert
            are you sure about this?

     brill unwraps a towel revealing the grease-covered nsa
     tracker he removed from dean's bmw.

                        brill
            i yanked this off your rv. it's a
            global positioning tracker.

                        senator albert
            oh my god.

                        brill
            tracks your location to the inch
            and works directly with--you know...

                        senator albert
            with what?

                        brill
            with spy satellites. i don't like
            saying these things senator...

                        senator albert
               (shaking brill's hand)
            neil, thank you for your help.

                        brill
            anytime.

     patrick escorts brill out of the rv.

     the senator, fuming, opens a book, looks up a phone
     number and punches it into his phone.

                        senator albert
               (into the phone)
