            listen to you, "directly". you're
            not gonna get near the news
            department. and if you did, it'd
            never get on the air. time-life
            buried the zapruder film for 15 years.

                        dean
            what about newspapers and magazines?

                        brill
            same thing?

                        dean
            so what do we do now?

                        brill
            i was thinkin' about asking for my
            hundred and fifty grand and calling
            it quits.

                        dean
            what if we do a mailing to congressmen.

                        brill
            it'd never get through. all
            packages are screened, x-rayed and
            then hand-searched for explosives.
            you didn't like my "give-me-my-
            money" idea?
