     int. image enhancement lab

     two techies huddle by a monitor overseen by fiedler, a
     computer expert. the monitor displays the harrison's
     surveillance tape of the zavitz/dean meeting.

                        fiedler (cont'd)
            - and two atm cameras. the one
            showing promise, though, is this
            security camera from the department
            store.
               (to techie)
            freeze there.

     the techie hits a command. zavitz and dean freeze on
     screen.

                        fiedler (cont'd)
            times ten.

     the techie boxes the area to be enhanced. he types
     commands. the boxed area increases ten-fold.

                        fiedler (cont'd)
            focus on the drop.

     the enlarged view shifts to dean's gift bags. the
     picture's fuzzy. someone passes by, blocking the view
     at a crucial moment.

                        fiedler (cont'd)
            enhance, then forward, frame by
            frame...

     more keystrokes. the computer takes over, clarifying
     the image with passes of resolution.

     hicks leans in closer as the image of the bag inches
     forward.

                        fiedler (cont'd)
            just before the view's blocked,
            zavitz reaches in his jacket for
            something. when the view returns,
            there's a shape change in dean's
            bag. see the shadow variance? we
            reverse imaged it--

     fiedler points to another screen displaying a digitally-
     enhanced image of the shadowed object and its
     approximate shape.

                        fiedler (cont'd)
            something's definitely been added.
            it's not a video cassette, the
            shadow's wrong.

     reynolds steps forward. his eyes are red. it's been a
     long night.

                        reynolds
            what's your opinion?

                        fiedler
            it's hard to say for certain, these
            things are--

                        reynolds
            i'm not asking you to say for certain.
            this is what you're trained to do,
            right?

                        fiedler
            yes sir.

                        reynolds
            then what's your goddam opinion?

                        fiedler
               (beat)
            zavitz had digital compression
            equipment. he could've downloaded
            into something. a disk, a chip,
            anything small enough to put in his
            pocket and run with. whatever he
            put it in, he dropped it in that bag.

                        reynolds
               (to hicks)
            get it.

     reynolds heads for the door.

                        hicks
            we'd have to--

                        reynolds
            get it.
