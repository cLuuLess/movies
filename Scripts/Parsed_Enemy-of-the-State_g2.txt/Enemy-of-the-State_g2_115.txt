     ext. school building - day

     dean stands at the edge of the playground in clean,
     casual clothes. eric runs over, face glowing.

                        eric
            dad!

                        dean
            do i know you?

                        eric
            where've you been?

                        dean
            having an adventure. i can't tell
            you about it right now, but i'll
            tell you about it soon.

                        eric
            are you and mom getting a divorce?

                        dean
            no. we're never getting a divorce.
            we were having a fight. it happens
            sometimes.

                        eric
            who won the fight?

                        dean
            men don't win fights with women,
            son, i'll tell you about that
            sometime, too. in the meantime,
            i've got a question for you, and
            it's incredibly important that you
            tell me the truth. under no
            circumstances will i be angry with
            you. this is a total get-out-of-
            jail-free card. ready?

                        eric
            yeah.

                        dean
            did you take anything--anything at
            all--out of those christmas bags i
            brought home last week.

     eric hangs his head...busted...then shouts to a group
     of kids on the playground...

                        eric
               (shouting)
            dylaaaan!!

     dylan comes trotting over, carrying his backpack...

                        dylan
            hey, mr. d., what's happenin'?

                        dean
            dylan, i was just asking eric if--

                        dylan
            oh, god, i knew it was stupid, i
            knew we'd get caught. but the
            gameboy was just sitting there.
            right on top of the bag. yes. yes.
            we took the gameboy out of the bag,
            but with every intention of putting
            it back.

                        dean
               (pause)
            you're a tough nut to crack, dylan.

     dylan hunts through the backpack as dean and eric looks
     on. all kinds of junk flies out--candy, comics, game-
     cartridges--

                        dylan
            it was broken when we found it, i
            swear. i tried fixing it for you. i
            even put in new batteries.
               (pulling out the gameboy)
            the screen scrambles whenever you
            boot up. i'd try to get your money
            back.

     dean eyes the pieces of the gameboy, knowing that
     somewhere in the puzzle of plastic and chips is the key
     to his problems.
