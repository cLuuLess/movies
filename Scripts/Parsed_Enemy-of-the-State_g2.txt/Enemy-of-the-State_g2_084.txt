     int. men's room - continuous

     empty. dean stands at a sink, water running. he glances
     at the door. he splashes water on his face. suddenly--

     --dean's slammed forward, a silenced pistol is shoved
     into his ear, pinning his face to the mirror.

                        dean
            jesus! what?! you want money?!

                        man
            shut the fuck up.

     hands frisk dean. up and down the legs, behind the back
     and chest. a wallet is removed, id's looked at - then
     returned. dean turns to see--

     a man, early 50's. he sweeps a signal frequency locator
     over dean's body. the needle reacts at dean's foot.

                        man
               (gesturing)
            your shoe.

                        dean
            my shoe?

                        man
            gimme the shoe.

     dean complies with the strange request as the man flips
     out a knife.

                        dean
            brill?

                        "brill"
            brill's dead. he died of small pox
            when he was two and he was buried
            in a kansas field.
               (prying away dean's heel)
            my name doesn't matter.

     close on dean's heel - a hollow compartment reveals a
     miniature tracking device. the man removes it, then
     returns the shoe.

                        "brill" (cont'd)
            a tracker. thousand yard range.
            they're close.

     the man reaches in a trash can, removes a potato-chip
     bag, wraps it around the tracker and flushes it down
     the toilet.

                        "brill" (cont'd)
            c'mon.

     "brill" goes through the window. dean eyes the window,
     not sure. he eyes the door. same feeling.
