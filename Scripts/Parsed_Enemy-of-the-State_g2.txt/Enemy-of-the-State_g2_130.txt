     int. dodge - continuous

     a grunge-dude blasts his car-stereo as he enters the
     tunnel, unaware of the mayhem behind him.

     he slows, seeing a smoking wreck ahead.

     closer, he sees dean waving him down. he slows more.
     bad move.

     brill opens the rear door, leaps in, and points his
     pistol at the grunge-dude's face.

     dean leaps in front.

                        brill
            drive.

                        dean
            we're not gonna hurt you.

                        brill
            drive.

                        dean
            tell him we're not gonna hurt him.

                        brill
            drive or i'll blow your fuckin'
            head off.

                        dean
            no he won't.

                        brill
            goddammit--

                        dean
            we're honest people and we need
            your help. i'll give you two-
            hundred dollars if you--

                        grunge-dude
               (leaping out)
            take it!

                        dean
            actually, i don't have two-hundred
            dollars.

                        brill
            drive the damn car!

     dean slides into the driver's seat, drops it in gear
     and goes.

     the dodge erupts from the tunnel.

     up ahead, the saturn and another car approach fast in
     the opposite lane, speeding toward the tunnel's opening.
     the car's fly by, unaware of dean and brill passing in
     the dodge.

     the dodge continues on, fading into the fog.
