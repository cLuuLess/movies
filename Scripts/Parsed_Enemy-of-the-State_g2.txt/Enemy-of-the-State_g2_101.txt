     ext. terrace - continuous

     the lincoln memorial is seen in the distance. reynolds
     has broken off party guests and paces in his tux, an
     encrypted cellular phone pressed to his ear.

                        reynolds (cont'd)
            i sit on top of the greatest
            intelligence gathering organization
            in human history. why can't i bring
            in a man whose name is in the
            fucking phonebook?!

            he's clever. he had help.

                        reynolds
            he's clever? he had help?
               (beat)
            oh.

                        hicks
            sir--

                        reynolds
            no, no, i'm sorry. i didn't realize
            you were hoping to be transferred
            to a weathership outside greenland.

                        hicks
            i just meant--

                        reynolds
            i don't care if he's solomon with
            saint joseph sitting in his lap. i
            want the tape and i want him. now is--

     a waiter with a tray steps out onto the terrace...

                        reynolds (cont'd)
               (to the waiter)
            yes?

                        waiter
            puffed cheese?

                        reynolds
            no thank you.

                        waiter

            mushrooms stuffed with--

                        reynolds
            do i look like i want a tiny pizza?

                        waiter
            no.

                        reynolds
            then let's assume i don't.

                        waiter
            yes sir.

     the waiter goes back inside.

                        reynolds
               (into phone)
            now is that clear?

                        waiter
            yes sir.

     reynolds disconnects, breathes deeply, and goes back to
     the party.
