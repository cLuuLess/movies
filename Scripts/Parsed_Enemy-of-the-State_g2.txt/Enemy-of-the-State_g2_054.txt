     int. courtroom - day

     a busy morning as attorneys wait their turn to present
     motions before the judge.

     dean is seated next to levin, making notes.

                        levin
               (whispering)
            dick burns got a phone call this
            morning from someone wanting
            information on you.

                        dean
            the police?

                        levin
            no. he said they were doing a
            credit check. are you refinancing a
            loan?

                        dean
            you remember daniel zavitz?

                        levin
            yeah.

                        dean
            he got hit by a bus.

                        levin
            what does that have to do with you?

                        dean
            i honestly don't know.

     another attorney sits several rows back, watching the
     proceedings, briefcase in his lap.

     close-up on the attorney's ear with a mini-receiver.
     from it drift snippets of the dean/levin conversation.

                        levin (o.s.)
            was zavitz in trouble?

                        dean (o.s.)
            i don't know.

     a pulled back leather flap on the attorney's briefcase
     reveals the tip of a concealed microphone.

                        levin (o.s.)
            you think there was a connection to--

                        dean (o.s.)
            jesus! i just told you. i don't know.
