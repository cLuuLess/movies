     ext. boston streets - continuous

     through alleys, down streets, under an overpass, down a
     one-way street, barely missing a head-on as they roar
     into a rail-yard traversing the waterfront. brill's at
     his best, putting distance between himself and the cops
     at every turn.

     finally, it looks as if they've made it as they race
     down an alleyway, only to realize it's a dead-end.

     brill slams into reverse. they screech backward, tires
     smoking.

     too late. the squad car rips into the alleyway, boxing
     them in.

     brill hits the brakes. he looks back at the dead-end
     and sees an empty flat-bed trailer with a ramp. brill
     gives it everything. if they can get enough speed and
     hit the ramp right, maybe they can clear the obstructing
     wall.

                        brill
            feeling lucky?

                        dean
            not particularly, no.

     they hit the ramp full speed. the front end bottoms at
     the taurus bounces skyward. tires clip the wall as the
     car flips and smashes into a parked rail-car filled
     with coal.

     they aren't going anywhere.

     back in the alley, the squad car skids to a stop.

     a rookie climbs from his car, leaps the wall, draws his
     gun and nears...

     inside the taurus, the windows are shattered. steam
     hisses, gasoline drips and coal is everywhere.

     dean shimmies out through a broken side window. he
     barely gets to his feet as he stumbles 20 yards or so.

     his foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal,
     which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him.

                        dean
            shit.
               (to brill)
            i'm stuck. help me out.

     he looks back to see that brill is hanging out the
     driver's side, bleeding badly and covered in gas.

                        cop
               (on waist radio)
            one-lincoln-nine, suspects ta'd
            into a coal car at the fullbright
            rail-yards. requesting back-up,
            fire and ambulance.

     an unmarked car with red-flashers races up the rail-
     yard and stops. the rookie turns as jones and krug hop out.

                        jones
               (flashing id)
            fbi. what do you got?

                        cop
            two murder suspects. one's wounded,
            the other's maybe dead.

                        jones
            thank you.

     krug draws his silenced pistol and matter of factly
     shoots the cop dead.

                        jones
               (to krug)
            check inside.

     dean is watching this all unseen, helplessly trying to
     dig himself out of the coal.

     krug inspects the taurus interior for anything of
     interest. jones scans the area.

                        krug
               (to brill as he searches.)
            i hate doin' cops, i really do. you
            i won't mind. didn't mind that
            rachel banks. didn't mind doin' her
            one bit.
               (seeing dean's shoe)
            your lawyer friend buried over there?

     brill can only gurgle blood. jones pops the taurus's
     trunk had looks inside.

     krug digs quickly through the coal pile, searching for
     dean. then brill sees him--

     brill's pov: dean down off the side of the coal-car,
     lodged in the coal pile. he's safe, but not once krug
     discovers he's not in the car.

     brill pushes in the cigarette lighter.

     jones dumps everything from the taurus into the
     unmarked car. sirens suddenly fade in.

     krug digs faster, looking for dean, as jones approaches
     with his pistol, clambering around for brill.

                        krug
            fuck him, he's dead in two minutes.
            find dean.

     jones starts to back out, just as the taurus's
     cigarette lighter pops out. brill grabs it.

     krug eyes the glowing lighter. then he eyes brill.

     shit.

     brill ignites the gas. wa-woomff!! a fireball explodes,
     consuming all - the car, brill, krug. jones is blown
     off his feet from the concussion.

                        jones
               (scrambling away)
            fuck--

     jones wipes prints off his pistol and silencer and
     tosses it into the flames as the police cars approach.

     dean watches from the shadows as flames incinerate
     everything.

                        marshal (v.o.)
            i just came from my office at
            langley. senator albert called me
            there.
