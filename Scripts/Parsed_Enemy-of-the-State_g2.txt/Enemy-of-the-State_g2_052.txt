     int. men's room - continuous

     two more maintenance men kneel in a stall adjusting a
     portable monitor and oscillator. they aim a directional
     antenna using slow, sweeping motions.

     close on the monitor displaying the intercepted signal.
     it's dean's computer screen with text being typed in.
     the words are hard to read due to horizontal drift.
     after adjusting the antenna, the signal smooths.

     we push closer. the signal shows the current display of
     dean's computer screen. we see dean's o.s. command pull
     up his e-mail. a prompt asks for a password.

     xxxxxxx appears.

     a switch is flipped. xxxxxxx becomes puccini. dean's
     "secure" file opens. entries appear.

                        man #1
            402, this is 401. password's "puccini."
