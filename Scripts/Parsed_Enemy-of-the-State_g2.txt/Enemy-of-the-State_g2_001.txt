     ext. shenandoah national park, scenic view lot - morning

     shenandoah mountains. a cold dawn. two black town cars
     sit side by side, facing a view of a farming valley below.

     two men in dark suits and long coats stand near the
     cars, casually on the lookout. if we caught a glimpse
     underneath the coat of the taller of the two, we'd see
     that he was carrying a 9mm. glock.
