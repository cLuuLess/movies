     int. dean's kitchen - continuous

     stacy has c-span on the tv while she makes breakfast
     for eric. senator albert is addressing the senate.

                        eric
            these guys are always making speeches.

                        stacy
            it's an important speech, eric.
            there's gonna be a vote today.

                        senator albert
               (on tv)
            today we face a threat to that
            creed. certain individuals in our
            intelligence community believe
            they're entitled to examine lives
            in minute detail, and claim to do
            it in the name of the common good.

                        eric
            if they're voting today, hasn't
            everyone pretty much made up their
            minds.

                        stacy
            actually, this man appears to have
            changed his mind dramatically.

                        eric
            why?

                        voice (o.s.)
            he saw the light, my son.

     eric and stacy whip around--

                        eric
            dad!

     stacy and eric run to dean...

                        stacy
            is it over?

                        dean
            it's over.

                        eric
            how long can you stay?

                        dean
            i'm not goin' anywhere, eric. i
            live here.

     eric and dean hug.

                        stacy
            get ready for school, you're gonna
            be late.

                        eric
            is it okay to use the phone now?

                        dean
            it's okay to use the phone.

                        eric
            alright!

                        dean
            no "900" numbers.

     but eric has disappeared up the stairs...

                        stacy
            it's really over?

                        dean
            albert's gonna get me my job back.

                        stacy
               (pause)
            i'm sorry about rachel.

                        dean
            yeah.
               (beat)
            i wish you could've met...

                        stacy
            who?

                        dean
            a friend of mine. i don't know his
            real name. he's dead now.

                        stacy
            you did good.

     stacy points to the tv and dean watches for a moment...

                        albert
               (on tv)
            i've lived through the dark ages of
            hoover's watch-list and mccarthy's
            witch hunts - men who used moral
            crusades, fired by fear, to lay
            waste to our freedoms.

                        stacy
            c'mon upstairs. i've got a
            christmas present from harrison's i
            want to show you.

     dean arrives as stacy takes him by the arm. they head
     upstairs as albert continues on...

                        albert
               (on tv)
            our intelligence communities
            presently monitor our phones,
            computers, financial transactions,
            medical histories...all this and
            more. some of you may say, "fine.
            i'm not a criminal and i have
            nothing to hide." well god forbid
            we ever edge to tyranny. god forbid
            george orwell's version of america
            becomes a reality. we are that close.

     albert's speech continues as we...

     roll end credits.
