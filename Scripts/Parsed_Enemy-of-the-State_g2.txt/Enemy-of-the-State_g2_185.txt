     int. senator albert's private study - continuous

     dean sits with a drink in his hand. across from him are
     christa and patrick.

     they sit in uncomfortable silence for a moment before
     senator albert enters in bathrobe and pajamas.

                        albert
            i understand we have a problem.

                        patrick
            senator--

                        christa
            senator, there were some things i
            couldn't tell you over the phone.

                        albert
            what kinds of things?

                        patrick
            mr. dean has a video tape from the
            hotel room in boston.

                        albert
               (pause)
            i see.

                        dean
            it's actually dh-1 digitech
            pinpoint scanning with a frequency
            modulator.

                        albert
            i don't know what that means.

                        dean
            me neither, but the upshot is i've
            got color live-action footage of
            you and ms hawkins and it doesn't
            look good.

                        albert
            so...how much money do you want in
            exchange for not ruining my life?

                        dean
            i don't want any money. and believe
            me, i have no interest in ruining
            your life. i'm not interested in
            this tape.

                        albert
            you're not.

                        patrick
            then what do you want from the senator?

                        dean
            i want him to look at a different
            tape. people have been killed.
            lives have been ruined.
               (dean takes the computer
                chip from his pocket)
            senator, i want you to look at this.
            and i want you to bring the fury of
            god himself upon this man.

     dean tosses the chip to albert.
