     stacy stares blankly, eyes red. a copy of the post is
     beside her. a picture of dean and rachel, arm in arm,
     accompanies a headline.

     dean walks in--

                        dean
            stacy?

                        stacy
            how could you let me find out like
            this?

                        dean
            stacy, i found out like this. this
            is the first i'm hearing of--

                        stacy
            robert--

                        dean
            it's not true.

                        stacy
               (reading)
            "sources revealed an fbi
            investigation into a possible money
            laundering scheme that may have
            sent millions of dollars--

                        dean
            i've seen it.

                        stacy
               (reading)
            "at the center of the investigation
            are well-known washington-area
            attorneys robert dean and rachel
            banks."

                        dean
            yeah...look--

     stacy whips the paper at him--

                        stacy
            you swore!

                        dean
            i have lunch with rachel once a
            month. she's my connection to an
            investigator.

                        stacy
            i told you i didn't want you seeing
            her.

                        dean
            i know.

                        stacy
            you had an affair with this woman,
            robert, we went to a fucking
            counselor for a year.

                        dean
            i see her for business.

                        stacy
            you told me you weren't seeing her
            at all.

                        dean
            i didn't want you to be upset. i
            shouldn't have lied. stacy, there's
            nothing between me and rachel banks.

     stacy grabs another paper and shoves it across the
     table. dean picks it up.

     dean's pov: a black and white surveillance photo of
     dean and rachel on a hotel balcony.

                        stacy (o.s.)
            the date stamp on the picture is
            last month. is that where you and
            rachel conduct business.

                        dean
               (shaking his head)
            it's not real...
               (to stacy)
            that's not me.

                        stacy
            oh, please--

                        dean
            it's not a real picture, stacy,
            it's been doctored-up.

                        stacy
            i think you should leave now, robert.

                        dean
            stacy--

                        stacy
            leave this house.
