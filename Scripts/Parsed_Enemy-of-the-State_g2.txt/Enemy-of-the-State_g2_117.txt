     int. motel room - night

     dean's asleep. there's a soft shuffling sound. the
     camera explores for the source, moving by the windows,
     flashing neon, a tv and finally, the door.

     we push closer as a mule tool snakes under the door.

     the tool pops upright against the door's inside. the
     strap drapes over the doorknob and tightens. the
     doorknob turns and opens.

     someone slips in--

     close on dean asleep. a hand covers his mouth. dean's
     eyes go wide.

     then he sees it's brill...

                        brill
               (whispering)
            get dressed. we're leaving.

                        dean
               (whispering)
            you could knock on the door, you
            know, and i'd open it.

                        brill
            move it.
