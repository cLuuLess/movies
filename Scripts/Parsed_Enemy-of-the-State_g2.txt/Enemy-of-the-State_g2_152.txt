     int. senator albert's hotel room - day

     close on a frequency counter sweeping a chest of
     drawers. the device starts buzzing, indicating a
     transmitter.

     brill, disguised, is on hands and knees, searching
     under a chest where he 'discovers' a bug he planted
     earlier.

                        brill
               (removing the transmitter)
            oh yeah. got another one here.

     brill shows it to patrick, a very embarrassed hotel
     manager and a very serious head of hotel security.

                        brill (cont'd)
            nasty fella. a tx-703. remote on-
            off, three-thousand foot range.
            shit, you could listen from a
            shopping mall across the street.
