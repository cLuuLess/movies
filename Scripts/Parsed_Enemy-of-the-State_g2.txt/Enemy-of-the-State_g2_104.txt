     int. rachel's kitchen - night

     dean enters. the place is still.

                        dean
            rachel?

     no answer. dean drifts through the living room. a lamp
     is knocked over on the floor. dean keeps moving into
     the bedroom. he stops in the doorway - eyes fixed inside.

     dean's pov: rachel lies on her stomach, naked in bed.

                        dean
               (approaching)
            rachel?

     she doesn't respond. he touches her.

     nothing.

     he turns her over. her face is frozen, eyes open, neck
     purpled and bruised with signs of strangulation.

                        dean
            oh god--

     dean wants to throw up but holds it down.

     then, under a night table, he sees a shirt. he grabs it.

     dean's pov: an oxford button-down. the inside collar is
     stamped with a dry-cleaner's marker reading: r. dean.

     panic overtakes horror as dean quickly searches for
     anything else of his that may have been planted inside
     the apartment.

     under the bed - a cufflink.

     in the bathroom - a hairbrush.

     on the desk - documents with his name on them.

     dean shoves everything into a garbage bag. grabbing a
     towel, he retraces his steps, wiping his prints from
     everything he touched.

     exiting, he wipes off the doorknob as--

     a neighbors door opens. a couple stumbles out, laughing,
     kissing...and noticing dean leaving rachel's condo.
