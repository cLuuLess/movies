     ext. loading deck - moment later

     dean crawls through the window to a loading dock.
     "brill" motions him to follow as he moves off into the
     shadows.

     the sounds of the window opening behind them, followed
     by footsteps. "brill" shoves dean behind a dumpster and
     removes his gun as two men run by. the steps fade.
     "brill" looks. they're gone.
