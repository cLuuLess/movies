     int. hamersley's car - continuous

     hamersley makes verbal notes concerning the reynolds
     meeting into his memo-recorder as he drives. he picks
     up his cellular phone and punches in a number.

                        voice (o.s.)
            senator albert's office--

     the line goes dead.

     hamersley tries again but can't get a dial tone. then,
     in the rear-view mirror, a brown sedan gains fast.
     whoever the guy is, he's flying. then a man with a
     rifle leans out the sedan's window. aims.

     hamersley flies into a blind curve. tires screech as he
     rounds the bend to see

     a propane truck. blocking both lanes of the road.

     hamersley's eyes widen. he stomps the brakes, skids and
     slams into the truck. the explosion engulfs everything.
     hamersley and the car are consumed. the pursuing sedan
     slows to a stop. the men watch. the car's an inferno.

     the men pull a 'u' and drive away.
