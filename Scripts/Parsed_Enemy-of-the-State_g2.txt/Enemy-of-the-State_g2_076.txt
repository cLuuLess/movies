     int. bar - continuous

     sunlight slashes blinds revealing a place that is wrong
     during the day. jimmy, a beefy bartender, takes stock
     of the liquor while rachel sits in a dark booth.

                        dean (o.s.)
            rachel?

     rachel looks up...

                        rachel
            good. you're just what i need right
            now.

                        dean
            you got a minute?

                        rachel
               (getting up)
            it's really not a good idea for me
            to be seen with you.

                        dean
            who's doing this?

                        rachel
            i gotta go.

                        dean
               (blocking the door)
            will you hang on just a second.

                        jerry

                        rachel

               (to dean)
