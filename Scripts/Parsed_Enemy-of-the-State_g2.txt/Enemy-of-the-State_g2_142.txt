     int. taurus - day

     dean drives while brill sits with his open pc lap-top
     connect to his cellular phone.

                        brill
            a 'modified' oki 900 interfaced
            with a lap-top creates an enormously
            powerful tool.
               (referring to the cell-phone)
            i got into the software, did some
            code re-writing and turned it into
            one of the best scan-looking
            systems around.

     close on screen - a street map appears with positions
     of the network's relays. lines appear indicating all
     in-progress cellular calls along with their locations.

                        brill (cont'd)
            this is every call on the grid. i
            can lock and position any one i
            want and follow the hand-offs in
            real time.

     brill punches a number into the cellular and the phone
     locks on the signal. through the lap-top, we hear
     ringing and then an answering voice.

                        woman's voice (o.s.)
            super shuttle.

                        man's voice (o.s.)
            this is dr. jonathan phillips, 102
            stern drive in brockton. i need an
            airport ride on friday at 6 pm with
            a return pick-up monday at 5.
            there'll be two of us and--

                        brill
               (disconnecting)
            need a place to stay for the
            weekend? a new tv?
               (brill has repeated the process)

                        another man's voice (o.s.)
            triple-a emergency road service.
            may i have your name and membership
            number?

                        young woman's voice (o.s.)
            colleen crane. card number 020-113--

                        dean
            unbelievable.

                        brill
            all from a hundred dollar scanner
            at radio shack. but it's time for
            business.

     brill dials his computer into a new line. tones and
     commands fly quick as brill's computer modems into another.

                        dean
            what are you dialing?

                        brill
            ameritech's data-base.
               (pointing on the screen)
            there's albert's d.c. office
            address and his phone's identity
            code. now we just reprogram out
            phone with his id code and you know
            what we've got?

                        senator albert (o.s.)
               (mid-conversation)
            --don't think it could've gone any
            better. tell me, how's deb? how're
            my grandchildren?

                        brill
            a receiver tuned permanently to the
            senator's phone.
