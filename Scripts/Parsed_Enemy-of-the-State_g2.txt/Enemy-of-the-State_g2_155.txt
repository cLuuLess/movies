     ext. street - day

     dean and brill run down the street, through an alley
     and over a fence to another street. they slow as they
     approach the parked taurus. brill takes the wheel with
     dean beside him.

     they pull into traffic. things look good, but then the
     unmarked car and a squad car scream up behind, lights
     flashing.
