     int. harrison's department store - evening

     an upscale store packed with christmas shoppers.

     at a fashion ramp, a small crowd of mostly women have
     gathered to watch leggy models feature a particular
     line of lingerie. mixed in among this group is dean, a
     shopping bag in each hand, his briefcase tucked under
     one arm, trying his best to affect an air of the
     studious shopper.

                        woman's voice (o.s.)
            may i help you?

                        dean
               (startled)
            hm?!

     the woman is sales clerk who's been in this situation
     before.

                        sales clerk
            do you see anything you like?

                        dean
            i'm married.

                        sales clerk
            that's fine.

                        dean
            i'm married to my wife...of several
            years...and i'd like to buy...as a
            christmas present...

                        sales clerk
            you'd like to buy your wife some
            lingerie as a christmas gift.

                        dean
            yes. i have her permission.

                        sales clerk
            it's okay. i think it's a wonderful
            gift.

                        dean
            can you help me?

                        sales clerk
            how 'bout christian dior?

                        dean
            is that good?

                        sales clerk
            very good.

                        dean
            i don't know anything about this.
            well, i mean, i know a little
            about--from a certain perspective.
            my point is, i don't want to do
            anything foolish.

                        sales clerk
            it's a little late for that.

                        dean
            i'll say.

                        sales clerk
            what size?

                        dean
            pardon?

                        sales clerk
            what size?

                        dean
            eight.  size eight.

                        sales clerk
            i'll be right back.

                        dean
            thanks.

                        sales clerk
            remain calm.

                        dean
            okay.

     the sales clerk goes around the counter to the rear
     area. dean glances at the fashion show when he glimpses--

     zavitz, hurrying through the women's dressing area,
     desperately looking for an exit. no luck. zavitz moves
     toward dean, about to break for the front, but hicks is
     there searching. trapped, zavitz ducks behind a display.

     dean watches, unaware of zavitz's pursuers. then it
     clicks...

                        dean
            daniel?

     zavitz turns, frightened....

                        dean (cont'd)
            it's me, robert dean.
               (beat)
            from seth, silverberg. i worked on--

                        zavitz
            bobby--

                        dean
            it's been a few years.

                        zavitz
            yeah.

                        dean
            i'm just doing some christmas
            shopping. it's for my wife, no
            kidding. though, this isn't the
            main present, it's just, you know,
            a little--

                        zavitz
            i need help.

                        dean
            tell me about it.

                        zavitz
            how can i reach you?

                        dean
               (beat)
            are you okay?

                        zavitz
            are you still in crystal city?

                        dean
            yeah, what's going on?

                        sales clerk (o.s.)
            i think she'll like this very much.

                        dean
            listen, daniel, hang on one second.

                        sales clerk
            for that matter, i think you will too.

                        dean
               (to the sales clerk)
            could you give me just a moment to
            talk to a friend of mine here? not
            about this, but...daniel?

     dean looks around...

     ...zavitz is gone.
