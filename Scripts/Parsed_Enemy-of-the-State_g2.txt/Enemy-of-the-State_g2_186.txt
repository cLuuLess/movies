     int. reynolds bedroom - night

     reynolds is asleep when the phone wakes him up. once
     again, he reaches for his scrambled phone heads into
     the bathroom.

     after waiting for the signal that the line's clear...

                        reynolds
            yeah.

                        technician (o.s.)
            sir, we've just intercepted an fbi
            communication.

                        reynolds
               (into phone)
            well...what is it?

                        technician (o.s.)
            well, sir, it seems there's a
            warrant out on--

     the doorbell rings. reynolds is alarmed.

     now there's banging at the door and doorbell rings again.

                        reynolds wife (o.s.)
               (from the bedroom)
            who is that, dear?

     reynolds snaps the phone shut and goes downstairs to
     the door.

     when he opens the door he sees two fbi agents with
     their id's flapped open and six uniformed policemen
     backing them up.

                        fbi agent
            john reynolds?

                        reynolds
            what the hell--

                        fbi agent
            you're under arrest. you have the
            right to remain silent. anything
            you say--

                        reynolds wife (o.s.)
               (from upstairs)
            honey...?
