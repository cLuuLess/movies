     ext. street - night

     dean climbs from the wreck as bystanders approach.

                        woman
            look out! he's got a gun!

     they back away as dean gets to his feet and looks
     around. off to the side he sees the chevy, waiting like
     a coiled snake.

     dean limps into the crowd. he rounds the corner to
     another street and now he's running with all he's got left.
