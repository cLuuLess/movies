     int. pick-up - continuous

     brill drives with dean riding shotgun.

                        newscaster (o.s.)
            police are seeking--

     brill ejects as cassette from the dashboard and hands
     it to dean.

                        brill
            i taped it off the 11 o'clock news.

                        dean
            and you were worried about me.
            that's nice, i appreciate--

                        brill
            i was worried about my hundred and
            twenty 'k'.

                        dean
            we said a hundred.

                        brill
            the price rises with the temperature
            and right now you're smokin'. but
            you're right, you should shop
            around and get the best price. i'll
            just let you out here.

                        dean
               (agreeing)
            one-twenty.

     brill checks the rear-view mirror.

     brill's pov: car headlights following in the distance.

                        brill
            did you call anyone?

                        dean
            what do you mean?

                        brill
            i mean did you call anyone.

                        dean
            look, my wife is understandably--

                        brill
            jesus!

                        dean
            i called my wife!

                        brill
            what'd i tell you?

                        dean
            i didn't use my name.

                        brill
            what'd i tell you?

                        dean
            i called from a payphone!

                        brill
            what'd i tell you?

                        dean
            you told me no calls.

                        brill
            i told you no calls.

     brill does a bootleggers u-turn. several cars pass by
     in the opposite direction.

                        dean
            sorry.

                        brill
            you don't get it. they go through
            your phone records. they fuckin'
            monitor everyone you called in the
            last--

                        dean
            i didn't use my name.

                        brill
            oh, i'll bet that threw 'em off the
            scent. i sure hope you covered the
            mouthpiece with a handkerchief and
            used a funny voice!

     brill turns off the headlights, does another u-turn,
     pulls off on an emergency road and stops.

     he turns off the engine, rolls down the window, looks
     up into the night sky and listens.

     brill's pov: a cloudy night. silent except for the
     water and a distant fog-horn. no sounds of aircraft.

                        dean
               (looking up as well)
            i don't hear anything.
               (on brill's silence)
            maybe you're wrong.

     brill is staring upward...

                        brill
            a hundred and fifty.
