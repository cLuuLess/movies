            i got a call from my firm this
            morning saying don't come in.

                        dean
               (into phone)
            why?

                        rachel
            there are reporters wanting to know
            about my relationship with you and
            how long i've worked for the mob.
            the mob, bobby!

            all right, look--

     before dean can respond, there's a knock at the door.

     peers sticks his head in--

                        peers
            blake and silverberg want you in
            the conference room.
