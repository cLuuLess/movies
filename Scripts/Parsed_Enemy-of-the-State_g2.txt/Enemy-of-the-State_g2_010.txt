     int. old car - continuous

     dan zavitz, looks older than he is, balding with a
     weight problem, sweats behind slapping wipers of a
     beater car plastered with environmental issue stickers.
     npr drones on the radio as a police car crawls behind
     him, siren yelping, lights flashing, trying to get by.

                        zavitz
            alright, alright already, i see you.

     zavitz pov: wreckage surrounded by squad cars,
     ambulances and media circus. something's happened.
     something big.
