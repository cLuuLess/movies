     int. dean's home/entry foyer - night

     the dean's enter the doorway. eric and stacy are first.
     they stop, faces shocked. dean hasn't noticed yet. his
     hand automatically goes to the alarm key pad.

     close on the pad - the led reads: armed. dean punches
     the code -

                        stacy
            oh my god -

     dean turns.

     the house is ransacked. the alarm suddenly blares,
     adding mayhem.

     close-up on the ceiling vent - the camera pushes in
     tight revealing a concealed, fiber-optic video lens the
     size of a pin-head.
