     int. cab - night

     "brill" sits in the driver's seat, eyes flickering to
     all views, as dean climbs in the back. "brill" flips on
     the meter and guns into traffic.

                        "brill"
            what happened?

                        dean
            it started with the information you
            gave me on depinto. after we talked,
            he agreed to resign. next, a phony
            detective asked me about daniel
            zavitz. then an investigator
            questioned me about an extortion
            scheme they claimed zavitz was
            behind. the fbi started looking
            into mob connections. a doctored
            picture in the paper. overnight,
            i'm ruined. wife. job, bank
            accounts, everything gone.

     "brill" eyes the mirror. a black chevy appears several
     car lengths behind.

                        "brill"
            depinto's dead.

                        dean
            oh jesus.

                        "brill"
            they found him yesterday folded
            neatly in a car trunk. what about
            zavitz?

     "brill" starts to weave in and out of traffic. he looks
     in the mirror - the chevy's also weaving several cars
     behind.

                        dean
            i don't know anything about zavitz.

                        "brill"
            you said he was behind an extortion
            scheme.

                        dean
            they said he was behind an
            extortion scheme.

     "brill" whips the cab around a corner, accelerating.

                        "brill"
            and you were the last one to talk
            to him.

                        dean
            yes.

                        "brill"
            what'd he say to you?

                        dean
            nothing.

                        "brill"
            what'd he give to you?

                        dean
            nothing.

                        "brill"
            don't bullshit me, i can save your
            life.

                        dean
            i'm telling you, i--

     the ride from hell gets worse as "brill" screeches
     another turn. the car ahead stops and "brill" screeches
     past on two wheels.

                        dean (cont'd)
            i just gave him my card.

                        "brill"
            he didn't give you an address? he
            didn't give you a phone number?

                        dean
            nothing. two nights later i was
            robbed. i'm pretty sure they were pros.

     "brill" takes an impossible left into another alley.
     the chevy follows. "brill"'s good. the guy in the
     chevy's better.

                        dean (cont'd)
            um...who's that?

                        "brill"
            don't know. did you check everywhere?
            maybe it was hidden in something.
            maybe there was someone else--

                        dean
            someone else?

                        "brill"
            maybe you bumped into someone who
            took it and you didn't even know.

     the cab is rear-ended hard by the chevy. their necks
     snap back from the force.

                        "brill" (cont'd)
            shit!

     wham! they're hit again. "brill" pulls out a communicator.

                        "brill" (cont'd)
            209 to anyone! i need some help here!

                        dean
            who are you calling?!

     whack! "brill" back-hands dean with his fist, knocking
     him silly as wham!--the cab's rear-ended again.

                        "brill"
               (trying again)
            this is 209! does anyone copy?!

     then "brill" sees that the alley empties into a busy
     street, then a bakery shop.

     he slams the brakes. tires screech smoke but it's no
     use. the powerful chevy pushes the cab, bumper to
     bumper, toward the street. "brill" grips the wheel.
     it's all he can do as the cab rockets into cross
     traffic and--

     blam! they're broad-sided by a delivery truck. the cab
     is shoved sideways along the street and into a fire-
     hydrant, finally stopping under jetting water from the
     broken main.

     dean slowly opens his eyes. water pours in everywhere.
     "brill" is sticking halfway through a window, not
     moving. seeing "brill"'s pistol, dean grabs it and
     crawls from the wreckage.
