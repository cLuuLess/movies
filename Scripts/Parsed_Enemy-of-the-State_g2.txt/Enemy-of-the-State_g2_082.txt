     int. ferry - day

     dean takes a seat. across the deck is seat 74. rachel
     takes the seat and casually slides an envelope behind
     it, her actions obscured by a bag she carries. the
     ferry blows its departure horn.

                        rachel (v.o.)
            the drop's behind seat 74. i leave
            something, he picks it up later.

     the ferry churns water. rachel moves to a wind
     protected seat, leaving seat 74 empty. dean keeps watch
     on the seat as he scans the paper.

                        dean (v.o.)
            any idea what he looks like?

                        rachel (v.o.)
            my guess is male, somewhere in his
            40's or 50's.

     a montage of different people occupying seat 74.

     a middle-aged drunk passed out in the seat. a teen-aged
     boy with glasses chats with friends.

                        rachel (v.o.)
            race, height, weight, you're on
            your own.

     an old lady reads a book. she sees dean eyeing her and
     smiles nervously. dean returns to his paper.

                        rachel (v.o.)
            now i don't know how he's gonna
            feel about someone tracking him
            down. he's reclusive. i'm sure he
            has his reasons.

     dean's alone now. the ferry docks for the night. the
     last passengers, two nuns, disembark. dean rises to go.
     brill's a no-show.
