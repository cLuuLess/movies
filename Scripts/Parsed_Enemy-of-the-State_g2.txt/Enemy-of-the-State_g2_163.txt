     int. church - continuous

     a crowded catholic mass. the priest delivers a sermon
     from an altar decorated with christmas candles and
     evergreen.

                        priest
            the lord said: i leave you peace,
            my peace i leave you. let us now,
            in the spirit of these holidays,
            turn to our neighbors and offer
            them a sign of peace.

     reynolds stands in a pew beside his two daughters and
     his wife. he turns to those immediately around him,
     shaking their hands.

                        reynolds
            peace be with you...peace be with you.

     a disguised dean takes reynolds hand and shakes it...


                        dean
            merry christmas. it's me.

                        reynolds
            do i know you?

                        dean
            i'm robert dean. within twelve
            hours, you're gonna be in jail.
            peace be with you.

     reynolds is dumbstruck...

                        priest
            let us now offer up thanks to the
            lord our god in the words our
            father gave us.

                        congregation
            our father, who art in heaven,
            hallow'd be thy name--

                        stacy (v.o.)
            robert, is it safe to be talking on
            the phone like this?
