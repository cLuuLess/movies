     int. dean's office building/lobby - morning

     a busy lobby for a major complex. dean, freshly
     showered, steps from a door marked: to parking levels.

                        male voice (o.s.)
            robert dean?

     dean turns to see morelos, 40's, an obsessive man with
     a terminal smile.

                        dean
               (beat)
            yes?

                        morelos
            i didn't want to bother you during
            your racquetball game.

                        dean
               (beat)
            thanks.
               (beat)
            who are you?

     morelos shows him his badge.

                        morelos
            i'm sorry. detective morelos.

                        dean
            hey, did you guys find my stuff?

                        morelos
            your stuff?

                        dean
            the robbery.

                        morelos
            no, sir, i'm not involved with that.
            i'm doing a quick follow-up on a
            bus accident took place a few
            nights ago. your name keeps coming up.

                        dean
            oh...yeah, i didn't see the accident.

                        morelos
            witnesses said you were there, but
            i notice you didn't file a report.

                        dean
            a report?

                        morelos
            a police report.

                        dean
            that's 'cause i wasn't there.

                        morelos
            you weren't at harrison's department
            store the night before--

                        dean
            i was in the store, the accident
            was outside. it was a bus.

                        morelos
            someone said you spoke to mr.
            zavitz before he died. i thought
            you might know something.

                        dean
            about what?

                        morelos
            about the accident.

                        dean
            i'm no expert, but i'm assuming
            that the impact of a moving bus
            against his body caused--

                        morelos
            mr. zavitz was in trouble.

                        dean
            what kind of trouble.

                        morelos
            you tell me.

                        dean
            i can't.

                        morelos
            are you invoking attorney/client
            privilege.

                        dean
            i'm not his attorney.

                        morelos
            than why can't you tell me.

                        dean
            because i don't know.

                        morelos
            i'm just trying to determine if mr.
            zavitz was involved in something
            more than a simple bus accident.

                        dean
            than why don't you talk to the bus
            driver?

                        morelos
            why so edgy, mr. dean?

                        dean
            somebody took my blender.

                        morelos
            we'd appreciate your cooperation.

                        dean
            i'm happy to help you all i can.
            but i didn't see the accident and i
            barely knew daniel zavitz. i've
            gotta go to work.

     dean starts walking--morelos follows him.

                        morelos
            did he give you anything?

                        dean
            no.

                        morelos
            anything at all?

                        dean
            no, sir.

                        morelos
            was he with anyone?

                        dean
            not that i could see.

                        morelos
            nobody gave you anything?

                        dean
            no.

                        morelos
            why'd you go to harrison's?

                        dean
            to buy lingerie.

                        morelos
            for your wife?

                        dean
            yes, for my wife, what the hell
            kinds of questions are these.

                        morelos
            i thought maybe it might be for
            rachel banks.

     dean stops short and turns to morelos. he stares.

                        dean
            i don't know what's goin' on with
            zavitz, but that was way, way outa
            line.
               (beat)
            you understand?

                        morelos
            yes sir.

     dean steps into the elevator.

                        morelos
               (into concealed sleeve-mic)
            403 to 401. he's coming up.
