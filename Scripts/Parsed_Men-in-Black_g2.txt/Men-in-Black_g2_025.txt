int. mib building - interview room - day

this back room is every bit as mysterious and unfamiliar as the entryway.
standing at the front of the room is zed, a wire-haired career g-man, an
old school bureaucrat, wearing the exact same kind of suit kay had on last
night. six other hot recruits sit in egg-shaped chairs, staring at
edwards.

one chair is empty.

				zed
		you're late. sit down.

edwards takes the remaining chair. the elevator doors slide shut. zed
continues addressing the recruits.

				zed (cont'd)
		my name is zed. you're all here because
		you're the best of the best. marines, navy
		seals, army rangers...nypd.

they all turn and regard edwards a little smugly. he gives it back.

				zed (cont'd)
		and we're looking for one of you. just one.
		what will follow is a series of simple
		tests designed to quantify motor skills,
		hand-eye coordination, concentration,
		stamina -- i see we have a question.

edwards's hand is, indeed, up.

				edwards
		why, uh -- i'm sorry, it's just no one
		really asked this, but -- why, exactly, are
		we doing this?

silence. then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand. zed calls
on him.

				zed
		son?

				ambitious recruit
			(loud and formal)
		jake jensen, west point, graduate with
		honors. we're here because you're looking
		for the best of the best of the best, sir!

edwards tries to stifle a laugh, but can't.

				zed
		what's so funny, edwards?

				edwards
		i -- i don't know, sir. this guy. "best of
		the best of the best of the best of the --"
			(realizing nobody is with
			him on this)
		it just struck me as --
			(totally serious)
		humorous. sir.

short pause. then zed continues.

				zed
		okay. let's get going.
