ext. morgue - day

kay's ltd pulls to a stop in front of the morgue and jay and kay jump out.

				jay
		i'll handle this one, you wait outside.

				kay
		what the hell for?

				jay
		because all we have to do is walk in and
		get a cat, it's not that hard. but if you
		go in, you're gonna lay your jack webb on
		her and flash your brain ray in her face
		and she's gonna end up with leukemia or
		some shit. the woman's a doctor, she
		doesn't need you erasing half her med
		school classes. take me five minutes.

and he continues into the morgue, leaving kay waiting outside.

				kay
		two minutes!
