jay falls from his seat with a clunk, onto the upside down ceiling of the
car. balled up on the back of his neck, he peers out the window as they
tear through the tunnel, zooming over the bottlenecked traffic underneath.

as they race through the tunnel, they have a minute to kill.

				kay
		mind if i smoke?

				jay
		what?!?

				kay
		in the car, i mean.

				jay
		i don't care!!

				kay
		hey, just a common courtesy. it bothers
		some people if you smoke in a car.

he lights a cigarette and blows the smoke out leisurely, one hand on the
wheel, just waiting out the tunnel. jay gives up struggling to right
himself and closes his eyes, suffering through this.
