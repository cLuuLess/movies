int. interrogation room -- later -- night

a woman sneaks into the room. doctor laurel weaver, thirtyish,
dark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above
him. laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and
saw a spaceman (which she did).  she looks over her shoulder once, then
whispers to him.

				laurel
		laurel weaver. deputy medical examiner. i
		believe you. i opened him up. find me at
		the morgue. on 26th. i'll tell you what i
		found.

				edwards
		hey...wait a minute. wait a minute.

				laurel
			(turning at the door)
		you have really pretty eyes.

she hurries to turn the corner, but is stopped by someone who remains just
offscreen.

				voice (o.s.)
		dr. weaver, from the coroner's office?
		working on the john doe?

edwards twists in his chair, to get a better look. all he sees is laurel,
facing whoever it is in the hallway.

				laurel
		yes. that's right.

				voice (o.s.)
		would you look right here, please.

the someone says something else and laurel steps forward, now also out of
edwards's line of vision.

				laurel (o.s.)
		look where?

edwards stretches even further in his seat, when there is a blinding flash
from the corridor. really curious now, he starts to get up --

-- when kay steps into the room and closes the door behind him. edwards
rolls his eyes.

				kay
		some night, huh?

				edwards
		oh, yeah, some night.

he crosses to the door.

				kay
		they were gills.

edwards stops.

				kay
		not eyelids.

				edwards
		who are you?

				kay
		did he say anything to you?

				edwards
			(scoffing)
		yeah, sure. he said the world was coming to
		an end.

				kay
		did he say when?

				edwards
		you're kidding, right?

				kay
		would you recognize his weapon if you saw
		it again?

				edwards
		absolutely.

				kay
		let's take a ride.

				edwards
		wait a minute. i got a ton of paperwork.

				kay
		it's all done.

at that point, the inspector sticks his head in, smiles and gives edwards
the thumbs up.

				inspector
		good work, edwards.

edwards looks at the inspector, then at kay. as they leave.

				kay
		you ran that guy down on foot? that's tough.
		that's double tough.
