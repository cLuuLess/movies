ext. world's fair - night

jay and kay hit the ground with loud grunts.

				jay
		that did not go at all like i had planned.

they look up to see the bug moving for the second tower -- and the second
flying saucer. kay gets to his feet.

				kay
		this guy's really starting to bug me.

kay starts walking after the bug.

				kay
		whatever happens, jay, don't let him get on
		that ship.

				jay
		where are you going?

				kay
		getting my gun back.

				jay
		what!?

kay steps forward and yells at the departing bug.

				kay (cont'd)
		hey, bug!

the bug just keeps moving toward the ladder.

				kay (cont'd)
		i'm talking to you, bug! you know how many
		of your kind i've swatted with a newspaper?

the bug turns toward kay. kay steps up to him, the small human facing off
against the giant alien hug.
