ext. garage - day

a six-by-ten sheet of plywood thuds to the driveway outside the garage.
edgar raises one end of it so it's hanging off the back end of the orkin
man's van -- now it's a ramp.

he walks off and we hear that familiar scraping sound again. edgar,
grunting with the effort, slowly pushes his spaceship up the ramp and into
the back of the orkin truck.
