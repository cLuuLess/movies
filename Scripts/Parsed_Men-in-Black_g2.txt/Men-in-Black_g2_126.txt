ext. world's fair - on jay and the bug - night

jay watches as the bug continues its howl of triumph...he feels totally
defeated. but...

he can hardly believe his eyes as he looks down at the bug's stomach...

close on bug's stomach. through the leathery pouch of the bug's stomach,
we can just make out the distended outline of the two atomizers...and just
a few inches from it, a human hand is reaching toward the gun... kay!
