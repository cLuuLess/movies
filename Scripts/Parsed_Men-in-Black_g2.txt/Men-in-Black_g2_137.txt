ext. mib building - night

kay's ltd is parked outside men in black headquarters. laurel leans her
back against the car.  we see jay and kay walking away in the distance.

				jay
		look, i know we got rules, but she did just
		bust the bug for us.  and so maybe you
		don't have to flashy thing her.

kay pulls out the neuralyzer.

				jay
		who's she gonna tell, anyway? she only
		hangs out with dead people.

				kay
		not her. me.
			(looking up at the sky)
		they're beautiful, aren't they? the stars.
		i never just look anymore and they're
		beautiful.

				jay
		kay, you're scaring your partner.

				kay
		i haven't been training a partner -- i've
		been training a replacement.

				jay
		oh no, i can't do this job by myself.

				laurel
			(walking towards them)
		hey, guys, we're nowhere near my apartment.
		we're not even on the right island.

				kay
		maybe you won't have to.

kay starts dialing back the neuralyzer.

				kay
		days. months. years. always face it
		forwards.

he hands the neuralyzer to jay. taps his pocket. indicates for him to put
his glasses on. jay resists.

				kay
		i've just been down the gullet of an
		interstellar cockroach. that's one of a
		hundred memories i don't want.

jay takes the neuralyzer. slips on his glasses.

				kay
		see you around, sport.

jay raises the neuralyzer. with a brilliant flash, the screen turns white.

				jay
		no, you won't.
