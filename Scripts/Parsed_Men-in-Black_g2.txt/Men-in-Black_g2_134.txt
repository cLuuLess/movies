int. mib headquarters - night

zed is standing at the console, a smile on his face. he glances over at
the console that displays alien arrivals and departures on the earth. the
red lights are coming back on.

				zed
		i think the word's already out. our friends
		are coming back.
			(then)
		got an authorized landing at times square.
		you and jay check it out on the way back...
		and pick me up one of those soft pretzels,
		while you're at it. extra salt. i feel like
		celebrating.
