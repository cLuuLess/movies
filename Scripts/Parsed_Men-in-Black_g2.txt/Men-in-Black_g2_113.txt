ext. world's fair - landing tower - night

edgar climbs the outside of the landing tower of one of the space ships,
pushing laurel up ahead of him, headed for the saucer at the top.

				laurel
		come on, let me go, you don't want to eat
		me. i'm a very important person on my
		planet. like a queen. a goddess, even.
		there are those who worship me, yes. i'm
		not trying to impress you with this, i'm
		just letting you know. it could start a
		war.

				edgar
		good. war means food for my family, all
		seventy-eight million of them. that's a lot
		of mouths to feed, your highness.

				laurel
		you're a wonderful dad.

and with that she kicks him squarely in the face. he reels, momentarily
losing his grip on her. she takes advantage of the moment and flings
herself out, into the air.

edgar flails, but she is beyond his reach. she falls, tumbling through the
air --

-- and lands in the branches of a tree. she hits hard, the branches
rattling, and reaches out and hangs on for dear life, high above the
ground.

above, edgar just keeps climbing.
