kay flips the phone closed.

				kay
		you were saying?

				jay
		getting eaten!? that was your plan!?

				kay
			(shrugs)
		worked.

as they argue, behind them, unseen, the front half of the bug raises
itself up on its forearms, eyes gleaming with hate, jaws dripping -- ready
to lower itself onto kay and jay.

				jay
		after i got the shit beat out of me!

				kay
		and i almost got digested. it goes with the
		job.

				jay
		you coulda told me what you were doing.

				kay
		there wasn't time, sport!

hisss! the bug attacks, swinging its head down on them. they turn to see
it, and just before the jaws snap down on their heads...

boom! the bug's head explodes into a million bits. bug juice showers down
everywhere, bucketsful of goo drenching kay and jay even further.

they turn to see...

laurel standing behind the dead bug, the other atomizer in her hands, the
barrel smoking, the weapon and laurel dripping the bug innards.

				laurel
		interesting job you guys got.

on the sky. bits of bug juice still flying through the air.
