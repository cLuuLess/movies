int. gem and jewelry store - day

smash! the window in the front door of rosenberg's jewelry shop collapses
in a shower of glass. edgar reaches in and fumbles with the locks, undoing
them one by one. he gets them all and steps inside. out the window behind
him, we can see his orkin van, double parked in the street in front.

all the gems and jewels are under glass counters. edgar starts smashing
the glass, grabbing great handfuls of jewels and tossing them aside.

outside, a new york city tow truck pulls up to the front of the orkin van
and starts to hitch up.

edgar, in his rage, starts to smash anything breakable, even the framed
pictures on the walls. he stops at one particular picture, staring
intently at it. it's a glamor shot of rosenberg's cat, provocatively posed
on a satin pillow. there are a half dozen more pictures of the cat, some
posed with rosenberg, some by itself. this animal was important to
rosenberg.

from outside, the roar of an engine distracts edgar. he turns around, in
time to see the orkin van lurch as the tow lifts its front wheels off the
ground.
