int. leshko's diner - kitchen - day

in the kitchen, the russian cook slaps two orders of pirogi up on the
stainless steel counter --

				cook
		table six is up!

-- and turns away, back to the grill.

a hand reaches in, takes the plates, and sets them on a tray. we follow
the tray, but see only the right arm and aproned midsection of the waiter
carrying it. he carries the tray along the counter toward a pair of
swinging doors that lead out into the restaurant.

the doors swing in as another waiter sweeps into the kitchen, and our
waiter heads out into the dining area. as the doors swing closed behind
him, they reveal storage shelves crammed with bags of rice, cans of stewed
tomatoes --

-- and a dead waiter, literally folded in half and stuffed in among the
shelves.
