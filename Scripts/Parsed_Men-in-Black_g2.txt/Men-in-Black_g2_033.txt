int. garage - day

the next morning. a door opens on a garage and an orkin man steps inside,
carrying a tank of toxic gas. the morning light spills on an abundance of
spiders, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them
have moved in and taken over this dusty place.

the orkin man sighs and sets down his tank.

				orkin man
		well, well, well. movin' right in, are we?
		think we own the place?

he unfurls a hose from the side of the tank.

				orkin man (cont'd)
		got a little eviction notice for you, boys.

he raises a mask to his face and unscrews the handle on the top of the
tank. lethal gas starts to hiss from the end of the hose.

				voice (o.s.)
		just what exactly do you think you're doing?

the orkin man turns around. edgar stands in the doorway to the garage,
staring at him disdainfully.

				orkin man
			(shrugs)
		takin' care of your pest problem.

				edgar
		"pest" problem? "pest?"

				orkin man
		yeah. you got a hell of an infestation.

edgar advances on him, slowly.

				edgar
		you know, i have noticed an infestation
		here. everywhere i look, in fact. nothing
		but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious
		pond scum. so convinced of their own
		superiority as they scurry about their
		short, pointless lives.

				orkin man
		well -- yeah. don't you want to get rid of
		'em?

				edgar
		in the worst way.

edgar lashes out quickly, jerking the mask off the orkin man's face with
one hand --

-- and shoving the gas hose down his throat with the other.

the orkin man's car keys drop to the garage floor, and edgar picks them
up.
