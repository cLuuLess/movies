ext. gem and jewelry store - day

edgar doesn't bother sticking around to continue his fight. he jumps
behind the wheel of the tow truck, starts it up, and hits the gas. the
engine roars.

jay sprints after him, firing his noisy cricket. he is thrown back into
some pedestrians, while his shot...

hits the rigging between the orkin van and the town truck, separating the
two. jay pulls himself up and sprints after the tow truck, but it
accelerates too quickly.

edgar is just about to turn the corner when jay leaps onto a parked car to
try and get some height. as jay prepares to shoot, edgar disappears around
the corner, and a hugh truck backs into his line of fire.

jay fires, the truck explodes and jay flies backwards, hurtling through
the air and crashing through the window of a car, his rear end right in
the woman driver's face.

when jay looks up, kay is standing before him. he yanks jay out of the
car.

				kay
		we do not discharge our weapons in view of
		the public.

				jay
		can we drop the cover-up bullshit?! there's
		an alien battle cruiser that's gonna blow-up
		the world if we don't...

				kay
		there's always an alien battle cruiser...or
		a korlian death ray, or...an intergalactic
		plague about to wipe out life on this
		planet, and the only thing that lets people
		get on with their hopeful little lives is
		that they don't know about it.

kay gestures to a group of onlookers, drawn by the curious blasts from the
store. there's smoking rubble everywhere.

				kay
		don't worry about the bug. he's not leaving
		town. we've got his ship.

after gesturing to the back of the orkin van, where edgar's spaceship is
neatly stowed, kay pulls out his cell phone.

				kay
			(into phone)
		zed, we're gonna need a containment crew
		down here at mcdougal, south of houston.
