ext. road -- texas/mexico border -- night

the van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government-issue
four doors with "ins" stenciled on the sides. seven or eight ins agents
stand in front of the cars imposingly. their apparent leader steps forward
and comes to the window.

the driver rolls it down. agent janus, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, also
government issue, looks at him and sighs.

				agent janus
		well. nick the dick. what a surprise. where
		you comin' from?

				driver
		i was fishing in cuernavaca.

				agent janus
		sure you were. what do you say we have a
		look at your catch?

at the back of the van,

the agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a dozen frightened
mexicans, hopeful immigrants without official permission. agent janus
looks at the driver, who's now held by two other agents, and shakes his
head.

				agent janus
		me, i woulda thrown 'em back.
			(to the passengers, in spanish)
		vamanos. fuera. hagan una lina!
			(let's go. out. form a line!)

they pile out of the van. some are parents with small children.

				agent janus (cont'd)
		what do you get, nick? hundred bucks a
		head?  two hundred? i hope you saved it all
		for your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna
		need --

he stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching,
fast, its engine whining as it barrels down the road toward them. several
agents pull their weapons.

the new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the ins
cars, and squeals to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their
headlights. it's a boxy, black 1986 ford ltd.

two men get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple
black ties, shiny black shoes. kay, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of
world-weary; his partner, dee, mid-sixties, is just weary. they approach
the ins agents.

				kay
		we'll take it from here.

				agent janus
		who the hell are you?

kay and dee flash some form of id.

				kay
		ins division 6.

				agent janus
		division 6? i never heard of division 6.

				kay
		really?

kay and dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants.

				kay (cont'd)
		what're we thinking, dee?

				dee
		tough call, kay.

he walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in
spanish.

				kay
		!oye! que pasa, coma estas? hey!
			(what's up, how are you?)
		no se preocupe, abuela. bienvenida a los
		estados unidos.
			(don't worry grandma.
			welcome to the united
			states.)
				(next)
		a donde vas? san antonio? buscando trabajo,
		no? buena suerta.
			(where are you going? san
			antonio?  looking for
			work, aren't you?  good
			luck.)
				(next)
		es un placer verle aqui.
			(it's a pleasure seeing
			you here.)

one by one, their faces relax, reassured by kay's calm demeanor. when he
reaches the fifth guy, he keeps the same cheery tone, but:

				kay (cont'd)
		que dices si te rompo la cara?
			(what do you say if i
			break your face?)

the guy smiles and nods. kay stops. his own smile broadens and he drops a
hand on the guy's shoulder.

				kay (cont'd)
		no hablas ni una palabra del espanol,
		verdad, amigo?
			(you don't speak a word
			of spanish, right, friend?)

again, the guy smiles and nods. kay looks back at dee.

				kay (cont'd)
		we got a winner.
			(to the others)
		los restos estan libres a irse. largense!
			(the rest of you are free
			to go. scram!)

				agent janus
		sir!

				kay
		tomen el camion, y vayeuse.
			(get on the road and go.)

				agent janus
		sir, you can't just --

				kay
		don't "sir" me! you have no idea who you're
		dealing with!

silence on the road. the driver grins, jumps back in the front seat of the
van. the others pile into the rear and they tear out of there.

				kay (cont'd)
			(to janus)
		we're gonna have a little chat with our
		friend here. you boys can hit the road ...
		and keep on protecting us from dangerous
		aliens.

kay and dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise,
leaving the stunned ins agents standing alone in the roadway.

				agent janus
		you ever heard of division 6?

				2nd ins agent
		there is no division 6.

				3rd ins agent
		who are those guys?
