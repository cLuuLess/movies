int. pawn shop - night

jack jeebs is the sleazy, sarcastic proprietor of the pawn shop. he's not
easily intimidated.

				jeebs
		officer edwards. oh, hey, geez, how'd these
		get here? i thought i turned 'em in to the
		proper authorities.

he casually brushes some rolexes off the counter.

				edwards
		way i hear it, jeebs, you into something a
		little hotter than some stolen rolexes.

				jeebs
		sure -- i'm a big crack dealer now. i just
		work here because i love the hours.

this pisses edwards off. he grabs jeebs by the collar.

				edwards
			(getting angry)
		i'm talking about guns, jeebs. high-tech
		stuff.

				jeebs
		c'mon, edwards, whatcha see is what i got.

				kay (o.s.)
		why don't you show him the imports, jeebs.

at the sound of kay's voice, jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming
over his face.

				jeebs
		h-hiya kay, how are you?

				kay
		the imports, jeebs. now.

				jeebs
		you know i got outta that business a long
		time ago, kay.

				kay
		why do you lie to me? i hate it when you
		lie.

he pulls his own gun and aims it at jeebs' forehead.

				jeebs
		whoa, whoa, kay, hold on a minute here...

				kay
		i'm going to count to three.

edwards, seeing that kay is getting somewhere, joins in the routine.

				edwards
		he'll do it, jeebs.

				kay
		one.

				edwards
		i've seen him do it.

				kay
		two.

				edwards
		talk to me, jeebs, he's crazy when he's
		like this.

				jeebs
		he's always crazy.
			(to kay)
		take a cruise. get a massage --

				kay
		three.

ka-boom! kay blows jeebs' head off and jeebs' body collapses to the floor.
edwards is shocked.

edwards pulls his own weapon and points it at kay's head.

				edwards
		put down the gun and put your hands on the
		counter!

				kay
		i warned him.

				edwards
		drop the weapon!

				kay
		you warned him.

				edwards
		you are under arrest. you have the right to
		remain silent.

				kay
		will you relax?

				jeebs (o.s.)
			(irritated)
		don't do that.

edwards whirls around to see jeebs' body, growing another head. only takes
four or five seconds. kay calmly shoves his gun up against jeebs'
baby-soft new cheek.

				jeebs (cont'd)
		do you know how much that hurts?

				kay
		show us what you got, jeebs. or i'll use up
		another one.

jeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which
promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with
junk --

-- but this is all alien junk. weapons, mostly, bizarre, otherworldly
weapons of all shapes and sizes.

				kay
		edwards?

edwards, still dazed by jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the
weapons.

				edwards
		uh, this. this is what i saw.

kay looks at jeebs, pissed off.

				kay
		you sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity
		to an unlicensed cephlapoid.

				jeebs
		he looked all right to me.

				kay
		a carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, jeebs.
		who was the target?

				jeebs
		i don't know.

kay raises the weapon again, threatening.

				kay
		jeebs!

				jeebs
		i don't know!

kay lowers his gun, gestures to the shelf full of weapons.

				kay
		this is all confiscated. all of it. i want
		you on the next transport off this rock. or
		i'll shoot you where it doesn't grow back.

jeebs nods, point taken. kay leaves.

				edwards
		yeah. i'll be by tomorrow for those rolexes.

shaken, edwards follows.
