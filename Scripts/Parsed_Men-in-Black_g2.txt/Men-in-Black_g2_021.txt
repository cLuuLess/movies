ext. farmhouse - night

stillness. silence. a loud scraping sound comes from the pit left by the
spaceship.

the nose of the ship itself rises up out of the pit, wavers, keeps moving,
and finally crunches to the ground outside the pit.

edgar climbs out of the pit, breathing heavily. he dusts himself off and
continues pushing the ship, along the ground, off into the darkness.
