int. mib building - interview room - later - day

the recruits scribble away at the written test. it's a thick document --
reasoning skills, general knowledge, diagrams.  the recruits seem to be
really powering through it, filling in answer after answer.

but no desks have been provided for them, and they're all still in their
chairs, writing uncomfortably on their thighs or knees.

edwards is really struggling. he writes two words on one answer, then
decides to erase it. the lack of a writing surface is driving him crazy;
his pencil even tears through the page.

he looks up. in the middle of the tile floor, there is an unused table.
edwards gets up, goes to it, grabs hold --

-- and drags it, screeching deafeningly, back to his chair. everybody
looks up, wincing at the horrible sound that fills the room.

edwards sits back down, now writing on the table.  that's better.

zed raises an eyebrow. he stares at edwards, then looks up, toward a
smoked glass window. behind the dark glass, a figure stands, staring,
unemotional.
