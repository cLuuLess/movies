ext. pawn shop -- night

edwards staggers out of the shop, trying to get the day's events straight
in his head.

				edwards
		the eyelids, fine ... and the jumping thing
		... and the gun ... okay, but the head?

				kay
		searching for a handle on the moment here?
		a place to file all this.

				edwards
		see a head doesn't do that, it doesn't just
		grow back.
			(looking up)
		what's going on?

				kay
		can't help you, kid. only comfort i can
		offer is that tomorrow, you won't remember
		a thing.

				edwards
		oh, no. this i'm gonna remember for a long,
		long time.

kay pulls the neuralyzer from his pocket. he hesitates for the briefest of
moments -- as if this particular neuralyzation is different than all the
others.

then he puts on his sunglasses.

				kay
		ever see one of these?
