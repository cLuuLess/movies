ext. uptown newsstand - day

the tow truck squeals to a halt at a curb.  edgar gets out and walks away,
fast, cursing under his breath. he rants, livid, thinking hard. as he
passes a newsstand, he grabs the news vendor by the collar.

				edgar
		where do you keep your dead?

				vendor
			(thinks)
		i don't have any dead.

				edgar
		where?!

				vendor
		i don't know, the city morgue!

edgar shoves him away roughly. but before he leaves, his eye catches a
postcard display marked "landmarks of the new york city area." edgar
stares, fascinated, but we don't see what he's looking at. he reaches out
and picks up a color postcard.

he raises it to his face, thinking, then shoves it in his pocket and
hurries off.
