ext. farmhouse - day

kay is in the hole where the ship landed, investigating. he holds a pocket
spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth.  the analyzer shifts
colors.  red. then yellow.

				jay
			(from up outside the hole)
		hey. kay...when am i gonna get one of those
		memory things?

the spectral analyzer turns blue.

				kay
		when you're ready.
			(re: analyzer)
		please -- not green.

purple. and then green.

kay closes his eyes and sits back, leaning against the dirt. above him,
jay leans over, staring down. kay looks up at him.

				kay (cont'd)
		do you know what alien life form leaves a
		green spectral trail?

				jay
		wait -- don't tell me -- that was the
		question on final jeopardy last night.

at the car, kay snatches up the radio handset and keys the microphone.

				kay
			(softly, into mic)
		zed, we have a bug.

he turns off the radio and sighs. jay stands next to him.

				jay
		i'm gonna jump way past you and just guess
		that this is bad. right?

				kay
		bugs thrive on carnage, tiger.  they
		consume, infest and destroy. they live off
		the death and decay of other species.

				jay
		so basically you have a racial problem with
		all insect-based life forms?

				kay
		listen, kid -- imagine a giant cockroach
		five times smarter than albert einstein,
		four times stronger than an ox, nine times
		meaner than hell, strutting his stuff
		around manhattan island in his brand new
		edgar suit. does that sound like fun?

				jay
		what do we do?

				kay
		with a bug in town? watch the morgues.
