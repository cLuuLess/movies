ext. road -- texas/mexico border -- night

a million stars wink in the night desert sky. down here on earth, an
insect, one of those big, beautiful, multicolored four-winged jobs, glides
effortlessly on the breeze, wafting along through the crisp texas air.

the insect dips, it banks, it does loop-the-loops -- and then splats
unceremoniously against the windshield of a white van that's tearing down
the road.
