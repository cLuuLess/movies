int. mib building - headquarters - night

jay and kay rush in from the door under the world's fair mural, and head
toward the main display screen; all around them, the mib staffers are in
frenetic activity in response to the threat from above.

				kay
			(to tech at a desk)
		come with me. put up a bio-net all the way
		around manhattan; if it's not human, it's
		not leaving the island.

				kay (cont'd)
		what've we got from our friends upstairs?

				zed
		same thing: "deliver the galaxy."

				kay
		yeah, well the bug's got the galaxy, but
		we've got his ship. he's got to be looking
		for a way out.

just then, a loud alarm wails.

at the main viewing screen, a green line shoots out from the arquillian
ship, striking a region of planet earth.
