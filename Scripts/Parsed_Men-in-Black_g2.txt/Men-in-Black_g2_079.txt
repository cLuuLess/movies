int. morgue - day

in the morgue, laurel is working at a desk when suddenly rosenberg's cat
leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the
middle of the file she's studying.

laurel jumps.

				laurel
		boy, when you want attention --

she pets the cat. as she does, the cat's collar shines in the light.
laurel turns the name tag to face her.

close on a precious jewel, and the word "orion."

as it is written across the collar of the cat.

				laurel (o.s)
		"orion." that's a pretty name.

from out in the corridor, a bell rings -- ding, ding.

laurel notices something dangling from the cat's collar -- a circular icon
of a strange and beautiful metal. the center is some sort of hardened,
translucent material, light green in color.

				laurel (cont'd)
		what's this?

she peers into the jewel, and her face washes over with amazement.
