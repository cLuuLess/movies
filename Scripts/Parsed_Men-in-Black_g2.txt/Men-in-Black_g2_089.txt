int. morgue - day

jay is thoroughly enjoying himself, but laurel seems to be going crazy.

				laurel
		i have something i need to show you.

she looks down, pointedly, in the direction of her waist.

				jay
		now slow down, you don't have to hit the
		gas like that.

she leans in and lowers her voice.

				laurel
		you don't understand. you really need to
		see this.

				jay
		and i will. but we gotta get something
		straight here -- i'm gonna drive. it's not
		some kind of macho trip, it's just the way
		i'm used to doing things, okay?
