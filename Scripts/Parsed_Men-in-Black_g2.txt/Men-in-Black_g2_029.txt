int. mib building - hallway - day

the recruits follow zed out of the shooting gallery and into a long
hallway. zed motions them off to the left. edwards is the last one out of
the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway.

kay is outside the door, waiting for him. edwards recognizes him from last
night.

				edwards
		you! hey, what's goin' on?

the other recruits continue down the hall with zed. kay doesn't answer,
just gestures to edwards to follow him down the hall, which he does.

				kay
		back in the mid-fifties, the government
		started a little underfunded agency with
		the simple and laughable purpose of making
		contact with a race not of this planet.

as they pass an alcove, edwards notices the six other recruits, who have
been herded into a corner. zed, addressing them, pulls a neuralyzer from
his pocket.

				zed
		now, if you'll look directly at the end of
		this device.

he holds a neuralyzer up in front of them, and the recruits stare
obediently at it as zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses.

edwards stares, fascinated, but kay's hand reaches in and yanks him away,
just as zed's neuralyzer flashes white.
