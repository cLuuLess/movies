int. morgue - day

jay comes into the morgue. laurel is in there, standing right up next to
an examination table, but there is no corpse on the table, just a sheet
draped over it. she just stands there, in the middle of the room, staring
at jay.

				jay
		uh, hi.

				laurel
			(oddly)
		hello.

				jay
			(flashes a badge)
		i'm sergeant friday, from the twenty-sixth
		precinct. they brought a cat in here with a
		corpse the other day, might have said
		"orion" on the cat's name tag?

				laurel
		yes. that's right.

				jay
		right, well, the cat is, uh -- the cat's a
		witness in a murder case and i'm going to
		need to take it with me.

				laurel
		i don't know where the cat is at the moment.

				jay
		you don't?

				laurel
		no.
			(lowers her voice to a
			whisper)
		maybe you could take me with you instead.

jay looks at her.

				jay
		excuse me?

				laurel
		i said, maybe you could take me with you
		instead.

				jay
		damn, you do start fast, don't you?

				laurel
		i'd really like to go with you. now.

jay just looks at her, amazed at the power he seems to have over this
woman. he looks over his shoulder, to make sure he has a few more seconds
alone.

				jay
		and, uh, why exactly is that?

laurel rolls her eyes. she seems irritated with him, but it doesn't go
with what she's saying.

				laurel
		i just do.
