the bug grabs the metal pole and yanks it out of jay's hands. he swings at
jay -- jay dodges the blow and falls to the grass.

the bug slices down with razor-sharp claws at jay --

grass.

jay rolls right underneath the bug's legs. his hand falls on something in
the grass -- another piece of debris, a sharp metal spike, gleaming like a

vulnerable underbelly, right above him.

he grabs the spike with both hands and is about to thrust the spike up,
into the bug's gut, when;

the bug bends its head down between its legs.

bug's pov of jay there, upside-down from this perspective, lurking between
the bug's legs.
