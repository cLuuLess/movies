ext. highway - side of the road - day

the ltd is now stopped by the side of the road, dust swirling around it.
ahead of it, another car has pulled over. kay gets out, jay follows a
moment later, shaky-legged. kay walks up to the window of the car they've
stopped. the driver, a guy in his mid-thirties with a wife in her
mid-thirties, rolls the window down.

				kay
		license and registration, please.

the driver hands over some documents. kay flips through them.

				kay (cont'd)
		other license and registration, please.

the guy digs out two other cards and hands those over. jay peers over
kay's shoulder.

the photographs on the "resident alien id"cards are of two
friendly-looking reptile types, husband and wife, smiling atthe camera,
their long, skinny tongues dangling in a friendly sort of way.

kay hands them back.

				kay (cont'd)
		your resident card has you restricted to
		the five boroughs only. where do you think
		you're going?

				redgick
		it's my wife! she's -- she's -- well, look!

kay leans down and looks in the window. mrs. redgick is in front, moaning
in pain, holding her swollen belly. kay straightens up, fast.

				kay
		oh god. how soon?

mrs. redgick screams in pain. real soon. for the first time since we've
seen him, kay is nervous.

				kay (cont'd)
		okay. all right. no big deal.
			(to jay)
		you handle it.

				jay
		me?

				kay
		sure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch.

mrs. redgick screams again. redgick gets out of the car, worried.

				redgick
		are you sure he knows what he's doing?

				kay
		yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time.
		c'mon, let him work, redgick, i wanna ask
		you something.

kay gives jay a supportive slap on the back and leads redgick away, to the
rear of the car. jay stays in the background and opens the rear door,
tentatively. he leans down, into the car.

				jay
		oh god! i see it i see it i see it!

a few yards from the car, kay turns redgick to face him.

				kay
		croagg the midwife's back on 64th and 8th.
		you were headed out of town.

				redgick
		well, we're, uh -- meeting someone.

suddenly a tentacle whips out from between mrs. redgick's legs, cracks the
whip once, and wraps around the door post, grabbing hold.

				jay
		oh sweet jesus mother of god did you see
		that?!

				kay
			(still to redgick)
		so? who you meeting?

				redgick
		well, it's -- a ship.

				kay
		really? i didn't see a departure clearance
		for today.

				redgick
		you didn't? uh, well -- it was an emergency.

now a second tentacle whips out, but this one wraps around jay's neck and
pulls tight. he gasps, choking.

				jay
		guys -- guys --

				kay
		doin' fine, ace.
			(back to redgick)
		what kind of emergency? what's the rush to
		get off the planet all of a sudden?

				jay
			(choking to death)
		help?! help! hello?!

he starts tugging for all he's worth, but the fight is sort of going
against him, as the tentacles pull him in even harder than he tries to
pull the baby out.

				redgick
		we just don't like the neighborhood anymore.
		some of the -- new arrivals.

redgick looks at kay, clearly concealing something, but darts his eyes
away.

				kay
		what new arrivals? this have anything to do
		with the crasher from last night?

				jay
			(screaming)
		can you guys do this later?!

but in that moment, jay finally gets a foot up on the door frame, acquires
leverage, and rips the baby free. he falls, flat on his back in the dirt,
the multi-tentacled lizardlike baby resting squarely on his chest.

				jay (cont'd)
		oh -- oh -- oh -- man.

kay turns and claps redgick on the back.

				kay
		congratulations! it's a lizard.

jay looks down at the creature cooing and nestling on his chest.

				jay
			(misty)
		hey, you know, it is sorta --

it vomits on him.
