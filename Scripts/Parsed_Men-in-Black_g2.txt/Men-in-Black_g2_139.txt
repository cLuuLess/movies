ext. new york city block - day

the ltd is just one of many cars in a jam-packed manhattan city block.

from up in the clouds

manhattan itself is just part of a much larger urban and suburban sprawl.

from the stratosphere

the east coast of the united states is just part of a much larger land
mass.

from the eosphere

north america is just a small portion of the planet earth.

from space

earth is just a tiny ball in our solar system.

from the middle of the milky way

our solar system is just a few blips of light in a vast star field.

from outside our galaxy

the milky way is just a creamy spiral amid innumerable other creamy
spirals.

from the outer reaches of the universe

there seems to be an edge to what we see, a curved border that seems to
close in on things around the perimeters, until everything that exists
seems to be contained in one tiny ball --

-- which is actually a marble resting on a strange-looking patch of red
dirt.

an alien hand reaches down and flicks the marble, sending it skittering
and bouncing across the dirt, where it clicks into a dozen other big blue
balls just like it.
