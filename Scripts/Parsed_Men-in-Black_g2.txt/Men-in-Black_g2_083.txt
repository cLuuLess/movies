int. morgue - corridor - day

on a counter in the morgue corridor, a gray, peeling hand bangs on a bell
on a countertop, over and over. the hand belongs to edgar, who is carrying
his shotgun, concealing it behind one leg. the morgue attendant, tony,
emerges from a small security cage carrying a worn paperback copy of atlas
shrugged and a fly swatter.

				tony
		thank you for making sure the bell works.

suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, tony snaps the fly swatter down on a
buzzing fly. edgar winces.

				tony (cont'd)
			(to edgar)
		what's up, farmer john?

				edgar
		a man came in here earlier. a dead man.

				tony
		and this means what to me?

				edgar
		he was a very dear friend of mine. and i
		believe he had an animal with him. a gift
		i gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to
		me. i would like it back.

				tony
		i'll need a picture id, written proof of
		ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of
		kinship with --

whack! tony flicks the fly swatter again, sending another bug to meet its
maker. edgar grits his teeth.

				tony (cont'd)
		-- the deceased.

				edgar
		don't -- do that.

whack! still another fly goes down.

				tony
		do what?

tony looks down, to where edgar's hands rest on the counter. half a dozen
cockroaches stream out of his sleeve.

				tony (cont'd)
		shit!

he ducks under the counter --

-- and comes up with a can of raid. edgar's eyes bug out.
