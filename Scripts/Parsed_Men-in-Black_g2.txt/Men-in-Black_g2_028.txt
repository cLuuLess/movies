zed and kay stand behind smoked glass, staring at the recruits, who are
still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision.

				zed

				kay
		so do i. the guy ran down a cephlapoid, zed.
		on foot. tenacity. that i can use.

				zed
		i hope you know what you're doing.

zed turns and walks away. kay stares through the glass, at edwards, who
stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group.

zed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and
into the shooting gallery. as he talks, kay turns and walks off.

				zed (cont'd)
		congratulations, you're everything we've
		come to expect from years of government
		training. now, if you'll just follow me, we
		have one more test to administer, an eye
		exam.
