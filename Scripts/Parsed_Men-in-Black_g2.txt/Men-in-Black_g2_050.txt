ext. newsstand - day

close on on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them.
there are headlines like "pope a father!"and "top doctors baffled -- baby
born pregnant!" and "man eats own house!" (the subhead on that one is "and
that's just the appetizer, says neighbor.")

kay and jay are at a downtown newsstand. kay is furiously searching
through the tabs; jay is standing behind him, a little embarrassed.

				jay
		these are the hot sheets?

kay pulls a copy of the weekly world news from the stand and gives the guy
a buck.

				kay
		best damn investigative reporting on the
		planet.  but hey, go ahead, read the new
		york times if you want. they get lucky
		sometimes.

				jay
		you're actually looking for tips in a
		supermarket tabloid?

				kay
		not looking for. found.

he smacks the paper down on the hood in front of jay, the pages turned
open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for
the second coming:

			     farm wife says
		     "alien stole my husband's skin!"
