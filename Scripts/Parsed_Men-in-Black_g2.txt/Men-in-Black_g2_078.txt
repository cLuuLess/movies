ext. street - key kiosk - day

kay's ltd screeches to a halt in front of the kiosk on orchard street. jay
and kay leap out and jay spots the vendor, closing up the shop. he's
wearing a dirty cardigan, watch cap, and fingerless gloves, his face
aquiver with ticks and mannerisms. he has a small dog in front of him.

jay rolls his eyes as they step up to the counter.

				jay
		of course that guy's an alien. that's gotta
		be the worst disguise i've ever seen.

a voice answers him, but not the vendor's.

				frank the pug
		you don't like it, you can kiss my furry
		little butt.

jay looks down. the voice is coming from the dog. this is frank the pug.
kay approaches, motioning to jay to make sure no one hears.

				kay
		you busy, frank?

				frank the pug
		sorry, kay, i can't talk right now, my
		ride's leaving in --

kay grabs frank. he yelps like, well, a dog.

				kay
		call the pound. we got a stray.

				frank the pug
		hey! get your paws off me!

passerbys glare at kay, who appears to be seriously mistreating this poor
little dog. jay tries to explain.

				jay
		the, uh...dog owes my friend some money.

				kay
			(to frank)
		arquillians and bugs. what do you know?

				frank the pug
		i know nothing.

				kay
		not a thing?

kay shakes frank the pug, trying to force an answer.

				frank the pug
		stop it. okay, okay. rosenberg wasn't some
		two-bit arquillian. he was the guardian of
		a galaxy. they thought he would be safe
		here on earth.

				kay
		and the bug had other plans.

				frank the pug
		the galaxy is the best source for subatomic
		energy in the universe. if the bugs get
		their slimy claws on it, kiss the
		arquillians goodbye.

				jay
		ask him about the belt.

				kay
			(to frank)
		rosenberg said something about a galaxy on
		"orion's belt." what's he talking about,
		frank?

				frank the pug
		beats me.

kay shakes frank the pug once more.

				jay
			(to a person passing by)
		they're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.

				frank the pug
		the galaxy is here.

				kay
		here?

				jay
		the galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars
		and planets? how's it here?

if a dog can smirk, frank does.

				frank the pug
		you humans, when're you gonna learn that
		size doesn't matter? just 'cause something's
		important, doesn't mean it's not very, very
		small.

				kay
		how small?

				frank the pug
		tiny. like the size of a marble. or a jewel.
		now if you'll excuse me, i need to be walked
		before the flight.

kay lets go of frank, turns to jay, who is lost in thought.

				kay
			(to frank the pug)
		get out of here.
			(then to jay)
		the galaxy's here. it's not on orion's belt.

jay suddenly notices frank the pug bark at a cat farther down the
sidewalk.

				jay
		kay...
