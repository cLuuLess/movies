int. morgue - day

laurel slams into a wall on one side of the morgue, thrown there by edgar.
he leans in, close, furious.

				edgar
		where is the animal?!

				laurel
		i told you, i don't know, it ran under some
		equipment! over there.

				edgar
		get it!

he grabs her roughly and drags her across the morgue, toward the equipment
she pointed to. as they draw close, orion the cat bolts from underneath
it, races between their legs, and leapfrogs over several small cabinets,
landing on top of a very tall one with only six inches clearance between
it and the ceiling. a very tough hiding place.

edgar just starts to turn when they hear the bell and a voice from the
corridor outside.

				jay (o.s.)
		hello? anybody here?

edgar looks up at the cat's hiding place. no time to get it. the bell
dings again.

				jay (o.s.)
		hello?

roughly, edgar pulls laurel close and puts a finger to his lips --
"shhhhhhh."
