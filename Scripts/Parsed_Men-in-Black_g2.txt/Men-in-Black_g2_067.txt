ext. new york alley - night

the orkin van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown. from inside,
throaty wails of frustration can be heard. two passersby hear the racket
and hesitate, wondering if they should get involved.

but an inhuman growl rattles the whole van and they wise up, hurrying on
their way.
