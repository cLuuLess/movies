ext. farmhouse - day

the ltd pulls to a stop at the end of the driveway that leads to
beatrice's farmhouse, where the alien ship landed. the wrecked pickup
truck is still there. jay and kay get out, very undercover cop. jay starts
up the driveway.

				kay
		not so fast. walk up slow.

				jay
		why?

				kay
		part of the routine. makes it look like
		we're sizing up the situation. gives her
		time to get the wrong impression.

beatrice appears in the door to the house, curious.

				kay (cont'd)
		puts some fear into her. makes things go
		smoother.

beatrice calls to them.

				beatrice
		can i help you gentlemen?

beatrice looks much better than the last time we saw her -- more nicely
dressed, a touch of makeup, a smile on her face.

kay pulls a black card from his wallet and extends it to her as she draws
close. as she reaches for it, the card reforms into an fbi badge.

				kay
		how do you do, ma'am, i'm special agent
		manheim, this is agent black, fbi. had a
		few questions about your visitor.

				beatrice
		are you here to make fun of me too?

				kay
		no ma'am. we at the fbi don't have a sense
		of humor that we're aware of. mind if we
		come in?

				beatrice
		sure. lemonade?
