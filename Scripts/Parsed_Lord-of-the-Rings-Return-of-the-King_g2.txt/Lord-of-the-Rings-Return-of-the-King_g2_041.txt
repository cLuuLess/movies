angle on: gandalf striding back streets of the city . . . so
determined and purposeful is he, that pippin has to run to
keep up. gandalf suddenly stops and looks down at pippin . . .

                       gandalf
             peregrin took, my lad, there is a task to
             be done. another opportunity for one of the
             shire-folk to prove their great worth!

gandalf kneels down and looks at pippin earnestly, his hand
on pippin's shoulder.

                       gandalf (cont'd)
             you must not fail me.

gandalf watches as pippin hurries away.
