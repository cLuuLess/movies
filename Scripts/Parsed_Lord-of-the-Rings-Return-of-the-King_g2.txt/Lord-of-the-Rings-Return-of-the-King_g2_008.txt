wide on: all about, the great stone wall is cracked and
splintered into countless jagged shards.

far off, half veiled int he swirling steam, the tower of
orthanc stands ... unbroken by the storm. pale waters lap
about its feet.

angle on: two small hobbits are sitting on the smashed wall
. . . merry and pippin! spread before them is a feast of
breads, meats and wine. they puff on long pipes as they lie
back in the sun.

                       pippin
             i feel like i ' m back at the green dragon,
             after a hard days work.

                       merry
             only, you've never done a hard days work.

merry cuts pippin off before he can respond in kind.

                       merry (cont'd)
             welcome, my lords, to isengard.

angle on: gandalf, aragorn, legolas and gimli stare at the
sight before them . . .

                       gimli
             you young rascals! a merry hunt you've led
             us on, and now we find you feasting and
             smoking.

                        pippin
                  (mouth full)
             we are sitting on a field of victory,
             enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
             the salted pork is particularly good.

                        gimli
                  (suddenly interested)
             salted pork?

                        gandalf
                  (shaking his head)
             hobbits!

           we're under orders from treebeard, who's
           taken over management of isengard.

wide: gandalf leads the company through the flotsam and
jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the
tower ... treebeard, the giant ent, strides towards them,
alarming all but gandalf.



                     treebeard
           huraroom ... young master gandalf, i'm glad
           you've come. wood and water, stock and ,
           stone i can master, but there's a wizard to
           be managed here ... locked in his tower.

                      gandalf
           and there saruman must remain, under your
           guard, treebeard.

                     gimli
           let's just have his head and be done with
           it.                            .

gandalf stares up the long length of the dark tower . . .

                      gandalf
                (quietly)
           no. he has no power any more.

the old ent nods his head wisely . . .

                       treebeard
           the filth of saruman is washing away ...
           trees will come back to live here, young
           trees . . . wild trees.

close on: pippin, his eye caught by something lying in the water

angle on: the muddy waters glowing wit a golden light . . .

aragorn turns as, quick as a flash, pippin has jumped off his
ho rse an d pi cke d u p -- th e pa lan tir !

                      treebeard (cont'd)
            well bless my bark!

                        gandalf
                 (urgent)
            peregrin took! i'll take that, my lad!

pippin doesn't move, his eyes staring in wonder at the smooth
black stone ...

                       gandalf (cont'd)
            quickly, now!

reluctantly, pippin hands the palantir to gandalf ... who
immediately smothers it in his cloak.

angle on: gandalf looks back at pippin . . . troubled.
