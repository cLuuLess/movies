ext. pelennor fields - day

wide on: gandalf as he spurs shadowfax forward! pippin clings
tightly to the great horses mane.

angle on: faramir, sword in hand, remains at the rear, trying
desperately to fend off the deadly assault . . .

again the fell-beasts dive low ...

gandalf thunders into view, raising his staff ...

a shaft of white light suddenly stabs upwards! the nazgul
swerves away from the light, as it pierces the low cloud!

for a brief moment, sunlight streams through the hole onto
pelennor fields . . . the nazgul circle away from the sun rays,
swiftly spiralling higher and higher.

the nazgul defeated, gandalf and the rangers ride towards the
safety of minas tirith.
