int. minas tirith tower hall - day

angle on: a long solemn hall ... with rows of black marble
pillars. between the pillars stand a silent company of tall
kings carved in cold stone.

gandalf strides down the hall, with pippin following
obediently behind.

at the far end, upon a dais of many steps, sits a large,
empty throne . . . and on the wall behind is the image of a
flowering white tree set in gems.

at the foot of the dais, in a small stone chair, sits an old
man, gazing at his lap: denethor - the lord steward of
condor.

                        gandalf
             hail, denethor, son of ecthelion, lord and
             steward of gondor.

denethor does not look up as gandalf and pippin approach.

                        gandalf (cont'd)
             i come with tidings in this dark hour - and
             with counsel.

denethor slowly raises cold eyes . . .

                         denethor
                  (bitter)
             perhaps you come to explain this?

                                                           (continued)

denethor holds up boromir's broken horn ...

                          den eth or (c ont 'd )
             perhaps you come to tell me why my son is
             dead?

close on: pippin remembering . . .

insert image: boromir, as uruk-hai arrows thud into his body,
he falls to his knees . . .

pippin starts forward unable to say nothing . . .

                       .. pippin
             boromir died to save us . . . my kinsman and
             me . . . he fell, defending us from many
             foes.

close on: denethor pain flickers in his eyes.

                        gandalf
                  (hurried whisper)
             pippin!

pippin drops to his knee offering denethor his sword . . .

                        pippin
             i offer you my service, such as it is, in
             payment of this debt.

denethor looks at pippin blankly, overcome with grief.:

                         gandalf
                  (to pippin)
             get up!
                  (a ddre ssin g d enet hor)
             my lord, there will be a time to grieve for
             boromir, but it is not now. war is coming
             ... the enemy is on your doorstep. as
             steward, you are charged with the defence
             of this city. where are condor's armies?

denethor gaze turns slowly on gandalf . . .



                                                           (continued)

continued: ( 2 )


                       gandalf (cont'd)
            you still have friends - you are not alone
            in this fight. send word to theoden of
            rohan. light the beacons.

denethor smiles at gandalf, as if amused by something.

                        denethor
                 (softly)
            you think you are wise, mithrandir, yet for
            all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. do
            you think the eyes of the white tower are
            blind? i have seen more than you know. with
            your left hand you would use me as a shield
            against mordor and with your right you
            would seek to supplant me.

close on: gandalf looks shocked, denethor's eyes narrow.

                      denethor (cont'd)
                (contemptuous)
           i know who rides with theoden of rohan. oh,
           yes. word has reached my ears of this
           aragorn, son of arathorn, and i tell you
           now, i will not bow to this ranger from the
           north - last of a ragged house, long bereft
           of lordship.

                       gandalf
                (stung)
           authority is not given to you to deny the
           return of the king - steward!

                       denethor
                 (explosive)
            the rule of condor is mine, and no others!

close on: pippin, horrified. gandalf looks at denethor
closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, pippin
follows.

                      gandalf
            come.

gandalf and pippin stride from the tower hall ... denethor
slumps back into his seat.
