ext. osgiliath - day

high above osgiliath, the sinister profile of the witch king
seated on a fell beast as gothmog stands, awaiting his
orders.

                      witch king
                (clinical)
           send forth all legions. do not stop the
           attack until the city is taken. slay them
           all.

                      gothmog
           what of the wizard?

slowly the witch king' s head turns . . .

                     witch king
           i shall break him.
