ext. edoras courtyard - dawn

wide on: edoras lookout . . . a soldier ringing the great bell
in alarm as below, in the courtyard, soldiers mount their
steeds amid great activity.

angle on: theoden striding purposefully outside, flanked by
eomer and his soldiers ...

                     theoden
          assemble the army at dunharrow - as many
          men as can be found. you have two days ...
          on the third, we ride for condor ... and
          war!

angle on: theoden strides onto the parapets . . .

                        theoden (cont'd)
             gamling, make haste across the riddermark
             ... summon every able-bodied man to
             dunharrow!

angle on: theoden watches as below the soldiers prepare.

angle on: eowyn hurriedly pulling on riding gloves, preparing
to mount her horse.

                       aragorn
             you ride with us?

eowyn turns and runs smack into aragorn ...

                     eowyn
          just to the encampment. it's tradition for
          the women of the court to farewell the men.
                                                     (continued)

                                     final revision - october, 2003 45.
continued:


aragorn smiles . . . reaching past her, he lifts a cover to reveal
a sword, strapped to the side of the saddle of her horse.

eowyn deftly pulls the cover back down. she looks at aragorn.

                        eowyn (cont'd)
                  (softly)
             the men have found their captain - they
             will follow you into battle, even to death.
                  (quietly)
             you have given us hope.

pull back: to reveal theoden stares around at the streets and
people of edoras . . . it is as if he knows he will not see
this place again.

                       theoden v/0
             so . . . it is before the walls of minas
             tirith that the doom of our time will be
             decided.

angle on: eomer astride his horse, calls to the assembled
soldiers . . .

                        eomer
             now is the hour! riders of rohan - oaths
             you have taken. now, fulfil them all - to
             lord and land!
