angle on: theoden and gamling watch the retreating figures of
aragorn, legolas and gimli ... rohan soldiers emerge from
their tents, crestfallen to see aragorn leave.

aragorn, legolas and gimli disappear into the shadows of the
mountains. the rohan soldiers murmur among themselves,
"what's happening?", "where's he going?"

                    gamling

                    rohan soldier o.s.
          why does he leave on the eve of battle?

                    gamling
          he leaves because there is no hope.

close on: theoden as he moves forward.

                    theoden
          he leaves because he must.

                     gamling
          too few have come. we cannot defeat the
          armies of mordor.

                      theoden
          no, we cannot . . .
               (surveying his frightened men)
          but we will meet them in battle,
          nonetheless.
