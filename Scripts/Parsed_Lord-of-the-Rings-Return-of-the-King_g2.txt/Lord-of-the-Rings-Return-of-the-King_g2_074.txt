close on: legolas looking at a group of rohan soldiers . . .
they sit quiet and hunched ... no-one speaking ...

legolas looking toward eomer who is unsaddling his horse ...

                        legolas
                  (uneasy)
             the horses are restless . . . and the men are -;.
             quiet ..?

             they grow nervous in the shadow of the
             mountain . . .

gimli's eyes travel to a row of ancient standing stones that
mark the entrance to a road leading away from the encampment
and into the mountain.

             that mountain is evil . . .

angle on: aragorn stands before the road as though transfixed
... before him a horse whinnies and pulls at his ropes
nervously . . .

aragorn pov: a ghostly figure seems to emerge from the gloom
... aragorn starts in fright as . . .

                        gimli o.s
