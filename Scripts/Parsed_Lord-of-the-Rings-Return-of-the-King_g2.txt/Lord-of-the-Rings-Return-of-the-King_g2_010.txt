int. edoras, golden hall - evening

wide: a roaring fire; a lamb roasting on spi; long tables
laden with food; barrels of wine; a banquet is-laid ready for
the returning soldiers.

                       theoden
            tonight we remember those who gave their
            blood to defend this country. hail the
            victorious dead!

angle on: amidst the cheering crowd, eowyn moves towards
aragorn . . . as she proffers the chalice their eyes meet.

                       eowyn
            westu aragorn hal.

eowyn watches as aragorn moves away . . . a voice speaks in her
ear.

                        theoden
             i am happy for you.

eowyn looks at her uncle, as theoden follows her gaze.

                       theoden (cont'd)
             he is an honourable man.

                        eowyn
                  (smiling)
             you are both honourable men.

                        theoden
             it was not theoden of rohan who led our
             people to victory.

eowyn looks at him questioningly, disturbed'by his tone.

                       t he ode n ( co nt' d)
             don't listen to me - you are young, and
             tonight is for you.

angle on: eowyn watches concerned as her uncle moves away.

angle on: merry & pippin are in full voice, on top of one of the
tables . . . both hold very large mugs of ale in their hands.

                        merry & pippin
                  (singing)
             oh, you can search - up and down
             as many lands as can be found
             but you'll never find a beer so brown
             as the one we drink in our home town
             you can keep your fancy ales
             you can drink them by the flagon
             but the only brew, for the brave and true,
             comes from the green dragon!

angle on: gandalf laughing and clapping the hobbits. aragorn
steps up beside him, smiling at the floorshow.

                    aragorn
          no news of frodo?

                     gandalf
          no word ... nothing.

                     aragorn
          we till have time.

gandalf turns quickly to aragorn.

                    aragorn (cont'd)
          every day frpdo moves closer to mordor.

gandalf watches his friend's face . . . seeking reassurance.

                    gandalf
          do we know that?

                     aragorn
               (gently)
          what does your heart tell you?

                     gandalf
               (with a small smile)
          that frodo is alive.
               (to himself)
          yes - yes, he is alive.
