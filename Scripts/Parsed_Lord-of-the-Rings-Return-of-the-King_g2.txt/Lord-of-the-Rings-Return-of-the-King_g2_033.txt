           and minas morgul is his lair.

angle on: frodo and sam clamber into a small gully beside a
rough-hewn road ... gollum carefully.peers over the lip of
the gully ___

angle on: minas morgul, a massive dead city, set upon a rocky
knee at the head of the morgul valley. corrupt and loathsome,
it glows with a sickly luminous light - like a corpse candle.

two huge, bestial stone statues guard the bridge that leads
to the city ...

                      gollum
                (whisper)
           the dead city, very nasty place, full of
           ... enemies.

gollum, frodo and sam hurry from their cover scampering in
the shadows towards minas morgul ...

                      gollum (cont'd)
                (hissed whisper)
           quick! quick! they will see, they will see.

close on: frodo . . . he looks up at the hideous statues. his
senses start reeling.

                     gollum (cont'd)
           come away, come away. look! we have found
           it.

frodo and sam look aghast at the sight of a narrow, near-
vertical staircase, cut into the rock-face ... directly in
front of the minas morgul gates.

                      gollum (cont'd)
           the way into mordor!

                                                         (co ntinue d)

continued:


angle on: following the stairs . . . higher and higher up the
sheer western side of the morgul valley - to the high peaks
of the razor-like mountains of mordor.

                         gollum (cont'd)
             the secret stairs . . . climb!

suddenly! frodo staggers across the road . . . as if some
force, other than his own will, is at work! he lurches
towards the bridge . . . towards minas morgul!

                        sam
             no, mr frodo!

                        gollum
                  (desperate)
             not that way!

sam runs after frodo, catching him in his arms as he stumbles,

                       gollum (cont'd)
             what's it doing?

                        sam
             no!

sam and gollum pull frodo from the bridge.

                        frodo
                  (disorientated)
             they're calling me!

frodo falls to the ground.

at that moment: the ground quivers, and a great rumbling
noise rolls across the ground and echoes in the mountains.

the cold, dull morgul valley is suddenly violent and fierce,
as uprushing flame springs from mount doom.

minas morgul answers: a flare of livid lightning, forks of
blue flame, spring up from the tower into the sullen cloud.

                                                    intercut with:
