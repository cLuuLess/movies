in foreground, a blender whirrs. still hungover, dylan
cringes from the sound. natalie pours out three fruit
smoothies for the angels.

                           natalie
             just once, i want to date a normal
             man, without a wife, or a drug
             addiction, or bondage issues.

                             dylan
             here here.

she and natalie toast.       alex is only half-in. off their look...
                              alex
             what?    i've got a great relationship.

                           dylan
             your boyfriend thinks you're a
             secretary.

                           alex
             that way, he doesn't ask about my work.

bosley walks in with a folder.       he eyes their drinks.

                           natalie
             i'm sorry, bosley. i only made
             enough for three.

                           bosley
             no, that's...that's okay.

it's not okay, but that's our bosley. he takes his seat
behind his desk. now we see the biggest addition to the
office, the angels wall of fame.

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                              15.

continued:

pictures of every angel, from the original cast members to some
fictitious ones we've never seen before. the rest of the office
is exactly as we remember it, right down to the

speakerphone.
                           charlie's voice
             good morning, angels.

                           angels
                    (sing-songy)
             good morning, charlie.

the angels take a seat on couches and chairs.

                           charlie's voice
             i'm sorry to call you back from
             vacation, but we've got a case
             that just can't wait.

as he's talking, the far blinds close themselves. a white
screen lowers from the ceiling, ready to catch the
projected video:

a handsome man in his 20's in a cnn profile. the sound is
muted, be we see him attending a gala; in an office surrounded
by computers; rock climbing; smiling in a sit-down interview.

                           charlie's voice (cont'd)
             meet eric knox.

                           natalie
             he's cute.

                           bosley
             he is.

oops, did bosley say that out loud?

                           charlie's voice
             he's 28-years old, and in three days
             he'll be a billionaire, when his
             company, knox technologies, goes public.

                           dylan
             it's good to be him.

                           alex
             so what's the catch?

                           charlie's voice
             last night, knox was kidnapped
             from his own office.

on video: surveillance camera footage of a parking
garage. two men in hoods shove knox into black car.

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                               16.

continued:
                           natalie
             any ransom?

                           charlie's voice
             no one's heard a thing from the
             kidnappers.

                           a woman's voice
             they don't want money. they just
             want to sink our company.

a striking woman in a suit stands in the doorway.

                           charlie's voice
             angels, meet vivian wu, vice
             president of finance for knox
             technologies. she's hired us to
             find knox.

                           vivian wu
                    (entering)
             the initial public offering is in
             three days. if we don't get mr.
             knox back, or if word gets out
             that he's missing, the company
             stands to lose a billion dollars.

she seems to direct this next sentence right to natalie.

                           vivian wu (cont'd)
             we need your help.

                           alex
             charlie, where do we start?

                           charlie's voice
             alex, i want you and bosley to
             stake out roger corwin.

bosley is excited to hear his name mentioned.

on video: roger corwin. he's an unpleasant-looking man,
who's even nastier when he tries to smile. we see logos
for his company, red star systems

                           charlie's voice (cont'd)
             for the past year, he's been
             trying to buy knox's company and
             their new browser software. knox
             refused to sell. his company, red
             start systems, has the most to
             gain from knox's disappearance.

                           alex
             kidnap the founder and you sink
             the company.

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                   17.

continued:

                           charlie's voice
             exactly, alex. let's keep our eyes
             on mr. corwin, angels. if knox is
             still alive, corwin might lead us
             to him.

                            dylan
             we're on it.

                           natalie
             any chance you can join us,
             charlie?

                                                  cut to:

charlie's pov

we see his chalky fingers grabbing into a hand hold.
we're halfway up the face of yosemite's el capitan -- the
ground is hundreds of feet below.

                           charlie (o.s.)
             i'd love to, angels, but i've got
             my hands full this morning.

two beautiful and buxomly climbing buddies smile at him.

                                                  wipe to:
