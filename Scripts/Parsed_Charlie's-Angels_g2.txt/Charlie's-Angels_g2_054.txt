int. the van - night

dylan looks out through the windshield as the jeep combo recedes
farther and farther away.

                           dylan
             i think we're in the clear.

just then, two motorbikes race up along the chute walls, passing
the crippled jeeps. two more motorbikes jump in from above.

                             dylan
             or maybe not.

suddenly, natalie gasps, remembering something.

                             natalie
             oh god, no.

                             dylan
             what is it?
