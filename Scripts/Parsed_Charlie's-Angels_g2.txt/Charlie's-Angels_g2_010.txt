             i thought the police might be here.
             or your neighbors. or your parents,
             here to identify your remains.

he has no idea what she's talking about.         she goes to

the bathroom,

where she retrieves a toothbrush.

                           natalie (cont'd)
             i saw your car was here, so i knew
             you weren't carjacked and brutally
             beaten, left to die on the highway.

her cell phone rings.

                              bob
             i'm not...

she holds up a finger, just a sec.

                           natalie
                    (answering phone)
             hello. absolutely. i'll be right in.

she hangs up.
                              bob
             i'm not dead.

                           natalie
             but you can understand why i
             thought so. you missed our date
             last night. you didn't call or
             anything. i was just sitting
             there by myself.

angle on bob.    what can he say?

                           natalie (cont'd)
             i can tolerate a lot, but punctuality
             and attendance, those rank very high
             in my list of dating priorities.

                              bob
             i can explain.

behind natalie, a door opens.          a topless blonde looks out.

                              blonde
             bobby?

                            bob
                    (to natalie)
             i can explain.

behind the blonde, isaac hayes looks out.      he's also topless.

                             isaac hayes
             bobby?

                             bob
             damn.

beyond weirded out, natalie just leaves.
