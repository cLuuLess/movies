int. arena -- mezzanine

dylan races past rows of seats, pissing off plenty of fans
in the process.

                        dylan
                 (looking everywhere)
          charlie! charlie!

flashes fire

in the stands.

statisticians

scribble at their monitors. natalie runs behind them,
scanning the crowd. whip pans, from one man to another to
another. stopping on a likely candidate...

                              natalie
          charlie?

                              likely candidate
          who?

the scoreboard clock

counts down.    :60.   :59.    :58.
