ext. courtyard - day

dylan sneaks her way through the courtyard, doing an
admirable job of trying to stick to the walls. as she
comes around the corner.

                              thin man (o.s.)
             um, excuse me?     i think you're
             trespassing.

she whips around to see the thin man, standing right
behind her. she instantly swings at him, he blocks it.
she's about to swing again when five guns get cocked
against her temple. she's surrounded by guards.

now --

the thin man and his boys lead dylan into the house.

                           thin man (cont'd)
             no offense, but as "storming the
             castle" plans go, this one sucked.

                          dylan
             oh yeah? and i suppose you could
             do better?
                                                  (continued)

continued:

                           thin man
             yeah, i sure as hell could.

                           dylan
             oh, right.

                           thin man
             how about an underwater entry? or
             hang gliding over the main tower?
             there's a million good ways in, if
             you just do your homework.

dylan glares at him, and as she does...

we move in close on dylan's funky belt buckle.       there's a
tiny camera concealed there.
