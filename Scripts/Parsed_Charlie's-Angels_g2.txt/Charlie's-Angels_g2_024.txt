what ensues is the fastest, wildest, two chicks and one
guy foot chase you've ever seen. here are some highlights:

fence. dylan and natalie pull an old jackie chan trick
and run up the side wall and hop over easily.

-- thin man, still on foot, waits for traffic to slow,

undeterred, they make their way through, tucking and
rolling under the wheels of a moving semi.

-- dylan is racing down an alley, when a car comes barrelling
at her. she leaps up onto the hood of the car as it drives
underneath her, a la one of those that's incredible! stunts.

-- they chase the thin man into an industrial laundromat.
the scene goes something like this:
