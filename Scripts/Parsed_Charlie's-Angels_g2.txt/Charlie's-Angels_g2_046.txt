int. the van - night

everyone is piled on top of each other. dylan and knox
have a few awkward moments as they get untangled. bosley
keeps making inappropriate tuba noises.

at the wheel, natalie is fierce and focused, in total
control.

looking out the back windows, alex sees the kidnappers
piling into jeeps to give chase. from the side of the
house, more thugs appear on motorbikes.

                        alex
          they're coming after us.

                        dylan
                 (to knox, confident)
          we were expecting that.

                        natalie
          okay, new problem.

everyone's attention whips forward to see the headlights of

giant logging truck

coming up the high mountain road. it straddles the
center line, blocking both directions. there's no way
around it.
                         natalie (cont'd)
           thoughts, suggestions, points to
           consider?

                        bosley
          i don't suppose giving up would
          be a...

no, it wouldn't.   then --

                         dylan
          right!

                        natalie
          there is no right.

                         dylan
          there!
                                                (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                   38.

continued:

she points to a faded "closed" sign that hangs from a
chain. in the darkness, who knows what it's blocking.
but as we hear the thunderous horn from the oncoming
truck, we know there's no choice.

natalie cuts a hard right, smashing through the sign.

the van thumps and bumps its way across the low grass,
its headlights only showing ten feet ahead. at any
moment, the ground could stop in a cliff.

like now.

the van leaps into empty space.      tires spin, helpless.
the van falls.

everyone screams.    bosley is the loudest.

and then, touchdown. the van hits the ground, hard but
not catastrophically. natalie hits the brakes, cuts the
wheel hard to avoid hitting

a concrete wall

in front of them.    everyone takes a beat to acknowledge
they're alive.

                             dylan
             where are we?

suddenly, a bright light goes on overhead.
