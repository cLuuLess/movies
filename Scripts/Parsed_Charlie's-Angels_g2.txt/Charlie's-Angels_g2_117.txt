int. compound - day

knox and vivian walk into a fully macked computer room,
where the thin man is supervising a techie as he taps away
at bosley's laptop.

                           knox
             well?

                           thin man
             our access was cut off at the source.

                           knox
             goddamnit!

                           thin man
             but not before we retrieved the
             information you wanted.
                                                  (continued)

continued:

the thin man pulls a piece of paper out of a printer,
hands them to knox.

                           thin man (cont'd)
             the national security agency's secret file
             on the man known as charles townsend.

knox smiles.    takes the print-out.

                           knox
             finally.
                    (beat)
             how about bosley? did we get the
             information we wanted?

                           thin man
             once we we drugged him, he sang like a bird.

the thin man hands knox another print-out.

                           knox
             hmmm. miami arena.    preparations
             have been made?

                             thin man

                           knox
             excellent.
                    (beat)
             where is bosley?

                           thin man
             in the tower. we were waiting till
             you gave the word.

                             knox
             well?    no time like the present.

the thin man nods.
