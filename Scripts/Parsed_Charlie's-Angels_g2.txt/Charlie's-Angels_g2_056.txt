                           natalie
             i have a date with pete.   right now.

                             dylan
             ouch.

                             alex
             hard right!

natalie makes the hard right. the motorcycles are gaining on
them, but natalie and dylan have to talk through this first.

                           dylan
             call him, he'll totally understand.

                           natalie
             "gee, sorry pete. i had to rescue a
             billionaire."

continued:

                           alex
             hard left!

she makes the left.

                           natalie
             i'll sound like a flake.   i can't
             stand flakes.

                           dylan
             he will so give you the second chance.

                           natalie
             you think?

                           dylan
             hello, i saw the way he looked at you.

one motorcycle charges, coming up just feet from the
windshield. natalie taps on the brakes. the freaked out
guy can't slow down in time. he smacks into the windshield,
then goes flying.

                           alex
             we're at the bottom!

indeed, we are. the concrete walls end, leaving open ground.
slamming on the brakes, natalie turns the van around.
everyone goes flying. bosley is still on the phone with
charlie.
