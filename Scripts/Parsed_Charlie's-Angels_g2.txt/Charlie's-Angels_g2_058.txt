int. the van - night

dylan slams open the door, knocking one rider off.

the sliding door opens, another rider outside trying to get
in. thinking fast, knox grabs bosley's tuba and shoves it
at the motorcyclist, who tumbles, taking out the fourth
rider in the process.

                           dylan
                    (genuinely impressed)
             well done.

                           knox
             thanks.
