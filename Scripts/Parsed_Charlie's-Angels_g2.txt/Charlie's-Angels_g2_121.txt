ext. second story verandah - day

dylan is led inside by the thin man.       knox is waiting for her.

                           thin man
             present for you, sir.

                           knox
             dylan, how nice. welcome to my
             florida home. not as tasteful as
             the one in la, but much more private.

she shrugs off the goons -- enough already.

                           dylan
             so tell me, knox, what's the brilliant
             plan? you gonna sell a list of our
             foreign spies to the highest bidder?
             blackmail the president?

                           knox
             the first plan is too complicated,
             and the second is virtually
             impossible.

                           knox (cont'd)
             besides, i already have all the
             money i need and my motivation is
             much simpler...
                    (leaning in close to her)
             ... revenge.

                            dylan
             revenge?   against who?

                           knox
             you know what? i'm not in a gabby mood
             right now. i've got a score to settle.

he flips shut a suitcase filled with c-5 explosive, the
same stuff we saw pascal selling in the opening scene.

                           dylan
             seems like you're going a bit overboard.

                           knox
             no, just leaving myself plenty of
             margin for error. goodbye, dylan.

with that, he walks out of the room.

the thin man signals to the henchmen. two of them force
dylan to sit in one of the wooden deck chairs.

then, with the thick packing tape, they begin binding her
arms to the arms of the chair. as they do:

                           dylan
             i don't know why you bother.   i've
             already won.

                            thin man
             is that so?

                           dylan
             every moment i sit here is a
             moment i'm using to figure out how
             to take you down. in fact, this
             statement -- this one i'm making
             right here-- is just me stalling
             for time while i decide which of
             your goons i'm going to flatten
             first.
                    (whispering)
             it's gonna be the guy behind me.

the thin man can't help but be amused. after all, there
are six guards and one blonde -- who is now taped to a
chair.

                                                   (continued)

continued:

                           the thin man
             really?

                            dylan
             by the time your guys are firing,
             i'll be at about 180 on my reverse
             inverted 360, which will land me
             on fat boy there, as promised.
                     (nods to the second guard)
             he'll take the chair seat in the
             chin.
                     (re: two others; very slowly)
             now... i'm warning both of you:
             i'm going to get you to shoot each
             other. i know. cliche as that
             sounds.
                     (then to the last two)
             last, you guys -- hell, i'll make
             something up. we'll have fun.

the thin man smirks oh-so-confidently.

                           the thin man
             and what will you do to me?

                            dylan
             you won't even be here. i mean, i
             don't want to tell you how to do
             your job, but you should've killed
             me by now. because i already know
             that your people are onto my
             people, which means any moment now
             you're going to be called out to
             go and deal --

suddenly the door flies open and --

                           dylan (cont'd)
             ah!   see?

                           henchman at the door
             we have intruders.

with a glare to dylan, the thin man follows him out.
