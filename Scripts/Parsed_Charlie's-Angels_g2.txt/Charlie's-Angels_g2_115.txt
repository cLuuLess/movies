           i don't know where i am, really. i'm
           in a round room. the walls are white.
           well. not white-white. more of a
           cream, or an eggshell. vanilla. yes,
           i'm going to say vanilla.

dylan finds a globe amid the wreckage.     wipes off the soot.

           i don't know which ocean. i was
           blindfolded the whole time. we were
           flying. it must've been three or
           four hours. maybe more.

with her fingers, dylan figures out how far he could have
flown. estimates the circumference.

                           dylan
                    (frustrated)

the bird bosley was whistling to lands on the tv, looks

             wherever it is, they have really
             good pudding.

natalie holds up a finger -- stop.

                            dylan
                    (incredulous)
             what, pudding?

the bird sings its song again.      natalie smiles.

                          natalie
             hear that? that's a blue spotted
             egret. they only live in one place.
