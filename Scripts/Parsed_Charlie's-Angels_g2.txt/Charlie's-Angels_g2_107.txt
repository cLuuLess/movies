int. angels detective agency

natalie, dylan and alex nurse their wounds and compare notes.

                           dylan
             i can't believe knox tried to kill me.
             i mean, i've been lied to, i've been
             cheated on, but no guy has ever
             tried to shoot me before.
                    (coldly)
             i'm gonna get him for that.

                           alex
             he played us from the very start.
             it was all just so he could get us
             to tap into red star. he couldn't
             figure out a way to do it himself.

                           natalie
             who knew that we are actually
             tapping into the main servers for
             the national security agency?

                           dylan
             and now, thanks to us, he's had hours
             to download whatever top secret
             information he wants, for god knows
             what reason.

the angels take a beat to let their indignation grow.

             wait a minute. we installed the
             transmitter, yes, but we never gave
             him the receiver.

                             alex
             what?

                           natalie
             that laptop was the only way to access
             the transmitter. and we gave the
             laptop to...

they look at each other...

                             angels
             bosley!

and on that note...
