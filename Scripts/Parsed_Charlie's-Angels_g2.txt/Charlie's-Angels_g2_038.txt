ext. front porch - night

bosley is about to hyper-ventilate on the tuba, sweaty
and a little blue.

dylan and natalie's new song has them sharing the saddle
of an imaginary horse. when dylan reaches back to slap
the "horse," she hits natalie in the rump. both women
tee-hee.

the thugs think it's pretty hot.

dylan whispers a secret to natalie.     natalie whispers
back.

turning to the thugs, they each lean in to whisper into
a different thug's ear. as the men smile, the angels
suddenly bonk the two men's heads together. both men
fall, knocked out.

stepping over the bodies, dylan heads inside.
