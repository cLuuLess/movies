int. arena basement -- beneath the court

dylan races through the basement, looking for the briefcase.
then she spots it, hooked into some wires that snake up
into ceiling above.

dylan approaches it cautiously.       she slowly opens the top...

                           dylan
                    (to herself)
             alright, dylan, all we have to do is
             figure out which wire to cut.

reveal the bomb --

there are about fifty different wires, in every color in
the crayola box.

                            dylan (cont'd)
             oh, shit.
