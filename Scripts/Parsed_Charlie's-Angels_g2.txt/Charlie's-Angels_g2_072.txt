int. natalie's red car / on the freeway - day

still hot on the thin man's tail, natalie has the engine
roaring.
                                              (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                               52.

continued:

as she passes the police cars, we see several officers
look over -- what the hell?

natalie catches up to the gray chrysler. looks over to
see the wild-eyed suspect, hunched over the wheel.

he looks back at her. a beat later, she's passed him,
just taillights on the freeway.
