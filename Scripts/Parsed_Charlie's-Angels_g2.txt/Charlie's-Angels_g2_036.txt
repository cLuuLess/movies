int. great room - night

alex backs out of the fireplace to find a waiting bad guy
swinging

a fireplace poker

at her head. she ducks just in time.     the poker chings
against the stone, making a spark.

rolling, jumping and diving, alex scurries as pokerman
slashes and stabs. she ducks behind a chair, which
pokerman catches with the hook, winging it across the
room.

backed against the wall, alex yanks on the heavy
curtains, pulling them down, along with the wooden
curtain rod. a spin, a flourish of velvet and the
curtain rings drop off to leave her with a trusty
quarterstaff.

she goes on the offensive.    thrust, parry, spin.

but he's a worthy adversary. one good karate kick breaks
her staff in two. she uses both pieces to club him in
the knees, then rolls back to the fireplace.

she grabs the remaining tool: the fireplace tongs.
pokerman swings. alex catches his weapon in the tong
scissors, yanking it free with such force the point sticks
in the wall.

a quick kick knocks pokerman to the floor, where alex
rolls on top of him. she catches his head in the tongs,
squeezing his temples. his eyes bulge.

                           alex
          where's knox?
