int. restaurant - day

as a group, the angels move through the upscale lunch
crowd to find knox and vivian wu at a booth.

alex opens a slim sony laptop, sets it on the table.

                        alex
          it's done. red star's mainframe
          is open for business.

continued:

astonished, vivian wu hits some keys, checking that what
they say is true.

                           dylan
                    (to a passing waiter)
             champagne, please. your best.

smiling, knox motions for them to take a seat.

                           knox
             now i know why i hired you.   you're
             the best.

a look between the angels.      they know it's true.

                           vivian wu
                    (to knox, re: laptop)
             i'll have systems get to work on
             this right away.

she reaches for the laptop.      bosley snatches it away.

                           bosley
             uh, actually miss wu, we will get to
             work on this right away. any evidence
             we find will be turned over to you and
             the proper authorities.

                           vivian wu
             i don't think you understand how
             important that data is, mr...

                           bosley
             oh, indeed i do. and that's why i'll
             take very good care of it when i find it.

                             vivian wu
                      (reaching for the laptop)
             but...

                           knox
             vivian, please. do as the man says.

reluctantly, vivian wu pulls her hand away. bosley tucks
the laptop into a steel briefcase, then stands.

                           dylan
             where you off to, bos?

                             bosley
             vacation.

                           natalie
             uh oh, lemme guess. you're off to
             chase bikinis at some tropical resort?
                                                 (continued)

continued:

                            bosley
             exactly!   fire island, here i come!

dylan does a spit take, the other two angels roll their eyes.

                            bosley (cont'd)
             goodbye, angels. mr. knox.
                     (coldly)
             ms. wu.

as bosley exits the restaurant, vivian wu eyes him
carefully. knox raises a glass to toast the angels.

                           knox
             more champagne?

                            natalie
             have to go.   plans tonight.

                             alex
             me too.

as they get up...

                           knox
                    (to dylan)
             and you?

she notices the other angels staring at her.        she doesn't answer
at first.

                             dylan
             um... well...

natalie quickly picks up what's going on.        she glances at
alex, then clears her throat.

                           natalie
             hey dylan, can we talk to you
             for a second?

the ladies room

natalie, alex, and dylan kibbitz near the sinks.

                           natalie (cont'd)
             there's something going on between
             you and knox. isn't there?

                           dylan
             so what, so i like him.   is that
             so wrong?

                           natalie
             uh, yeah dylan, it is.    he's a client.
                                                   (continued)

continued:
                             dylan
             was a client.    we finished the job.

                           alex
             she's got a point.

                           natalie
             what? she doesn't have any point, alex,
             i can't believe you're siding with her.

                           alex
             i'm not siding with anyone, but
             technically, he is no longer...

                           natalie
             you know charlie would never
             approve of this.

                           alex
             oh come on, charlie wouldn't care. i
             think you're just being overly cautious.

                            dylan
             uh, guys?   guys!

they turn to look at her.

                           dylan (cont'd)
             i'm a big girl. i make my own
             decisions. i'm going out with him.

she walks out of the ladies' room.
