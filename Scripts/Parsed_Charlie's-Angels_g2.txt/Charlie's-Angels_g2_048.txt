looking out the back windows...

                           alex
             it's a bobsled run.

they're facing backwards.

up ahead, the kidnappers are charging down the access roads.
the first of two jeeps makes the jump into the bobsled chute.

                           natalie
             if it goes down the mountain,
             that's all i need.

throwing it into reverse, natalie peels out.

the jeeps follow.
