int. knox living room - dusk

just as big, just as beautiful. knox, or his decorator, has
great taste. everything is top quality, but unpretentious.

                           dylan
             also, stay away from the windows.

                           knox
             they're bullet-proof.   the last
             owner was paranoid.

                           dylan
                    (a smile)
             lucky for us.

she takes a marker-sized device off the table.

                           dylan (cont'd)
             this is a panic button.
                    (tosses it to him)
             press it and one of us can be here
             in ten minutes.

                           knox
             which one of you?

                           dylan
             whoever's closest.

she takes her jacket off the couch, ready to go.

                           knox
             i have a better idea.

                           dylan
             what?
                                                  (continued)

continued:

he tosses her the panic button.

                           knox
             stay for dinner.
                    (preempting objections)
             i'm a pretty good cook.

                           dylan
             i can't mr. knox. i'm sorry.     if you...

                           knox
                    (quickly)
             i'm scared.

dylan is surprised by this.

                           knox (cont'd)
             look, i didn't want to admit it, but i
             am. i was kidnapped once, and it wasn't
             fun. i know, you probably have other
             plans, but it would be very reassuring.

dylan looks him over. normally, she'd be suspicious, but
the guy was just kidnapped, and he seems sincere.

                           knox (cont'd)
             come on, don't make me beg. i'm
             embarrassed already.

she smiles.

                            dylan
             don't be.

she throws her coat back on the sofa.
