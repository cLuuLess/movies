int. executive locker room - day

making sure she's alone, alex uses the key to open a
locker. she carefully sorts through corwin's things,
finding his palm pilot organizer. she clicks it into a
special device, which blips as it downloads all his
information.

putting the palm pilot away, she shuts the locker.
