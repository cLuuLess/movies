int. natalie's excellent convertible - day

the angels are all in the car together, cruising down
sunset boulevard. dylan drives, alex in the passenger seat,
natalie in the back seat with her computer on her lap.

                           natalie
             can you not drive my car so fast,
             dyl? i'm trying to type.

                           dylan
                    (to alex, under her breath)
             i drive too fast. look who's talking.

she pulls into an in n' out burger, right up to the drive thru.

                           dylan (cont'd)
             three double doubles, animal style.
             fries. three chocolate shakes.

while they wait for their order, natalie punches
something up on her computer.

                           natalie
             here's corwin's itinerary.

onscreen -- we see a list of all corwin's plans for the
next week. two events in particular stand out:

     tuesday night -- investor reception, biltmore hotel

     thursday -- san diego raceway

dylan glances over the schedule.

                           dylan
             alright, we'll hit the reception tonight.
             i only wish we had a clue to go on.

the food comes, dylan takes it.

                           natalie
             hold that thought.

                                                   (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                    22.

continued:

natalie goes back to the computer again, slipping a cd
into the drive. dylan hands out the food, spilling a lot
of it. a big glop of chocolate shake lands on the
keyboard.

                            natalie (cont'd)
             uh, hello?   expensive equipment.

                              dylan
             sorry.

natalie licks the shake off her fingers, tapes away at
the keyboard.

                           natalie
             check this out. new program i just
             got from a friend in the bureau. we
             take that footage from the kidnapping...

on screen, the footage downloads from the cd, into the
program. natalie fast forwards through it until she
comes to a shot of one of the kidnappers where his mask
is partly pulled away from his face.

                           natalie (cont'd)
             ... isolate the part of the suspect's
             face that's revealed, then retriangulate
             his bone structure...

the program zooms in on the revealed part of his face,
then runs a series of calculations. a new drawing starts
to appear.

                              natalie (cont'd)
             ... and voila!     we've got a composite.

natalie's portable printer spits out a simulated
composite of one skinny, bad-looking dude. dylan grabs
it, looks it over.

                          dylan
             sweet. now we've got someone to
             look for.

she hands it to alex to inspect.

                           alex
             oh yeah. he'll be easy to spot
             with that open head wound.

she turns the composite around, revealing that dylan has
smudged his head with ketchup.

they all just have to laugh.

                                                   wipe to:

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                  23.
