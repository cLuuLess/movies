ext. knox compound - day

knox, carrying the briefcase bomb, gets into his waiting
helicopter, followed closely by the thin man.

                           knox
             let's go!

the helicopter quick ascends, just as...

                           dylan (o.s.)
             damn!

the three angels

run into the courtyard.

                           natalie
             don't worry, we'll get him.

                           dylan
             you don't understand. he's got a
             pound of c-5 in that briefcase.

                           alex
             the question is, where's he headed?

                           bosley (o.s.)
             miami.

the three angels turn to see bosley, huffing and puffing
his way into the courtyard.

                           bosley (cont'd)
             the man knox is trying to kill has two
             general admission tickets to the duke-
             maryland game at miami arena. he's going
             to blow up the arena and kill his target.

                           dylan
             not that i don't believe you, but how
             exactly do you know all this?

                           bosley
             because angels, i was the one who
             purchased those tickets.

                           natalie
             but bosley, you hate sports, why
             would you...
                    (suddenly getting it)
             you didn't buy them for yourself.

                           alex
             you bought them for...

bosley lowers his head.    suddenly all the angels understand.

                           angels
             charlie!

they race out the courtyard, in hot pursuit.
