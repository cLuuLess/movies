int. knox living room - night

we pan off a half-played scrabble game to find dylan and
knox at the windows. dylan picks up a family photo, knox
as a little boy with a father in a military uniform.

                           dylan
             that's you, hunh? cute kid.    cute
             family.

                            knox
             thanks.
                    (taking the photo)
             it's the only picture i have of me with
             my parents. they died a week later.

                            dylan
             oh.   oh, i'm sorry. i had no idea...

                                                   (continued)

continued:

                           knox
             please, don't apologize. i was too
             young to understand.
                    (looking at the photo)
             i never knew how they died. when i
             was a kid, when i got shuffled from
             one foster home to another, i always
             thought they just disappeared.

                            dylan
             but...?

                           knox
             i only found out later, my father was
             in the military. he and my mother were
             killed while he was on assignment,
             somewhere in eastern europe.
                    (mostly to himself)
             the files were classified, but i
             read enough to know that he was a
             good man. apparently, he was
             betrayed by one of his own team.

                            dylan
             wow.   that's a lot for a kid to live with.

                           knox
             yeah, but it motivated me, losing my
             family. it still does. i don't take
             anything for granted.

dylan nods.

                           dylan
             boy did i have you pegged wrong.

                           knox
                    (intrigued)
             how do you mean?

                           dylan
             well, to be honest, i thought you
             were a rich kid who inherited
             everything. but that's pretty typical.
             i've got instincts for the job, but
             when it comes to men? well...

                           knox
             i'm glad you don't see me as just a client.

he brushes his hand against hers.     she brushes back, fingers
against fingers. a long beat.

                                                 (continued)

continued:

                            dylan
             oh.   well, you are, so...

                           knox
             is there someone you need to be going
             home to?

                              dylan
             no.
                    (beat)
             but i...

he kisses her. after a moment, she breaks off. it's not that
it was a bad kiss. it was a damn good kiss. it's just...

                              dylan (cont'd)
             i shouldn't.

knox moves towards her.

                              knox
             shouldn't you?

dylan holds him back.

                            dylan
                     (firmly)
             no.   i shouldn't.

she stands up.

                           dylan (cont'd)
             thank you for dinner, mr. knox.    and
             lock the door behind me.

she gets up and leaves.

                                                   cut to:

formula-one race cars

roaring past on the track.       it's all thunder, smoke and
asphalt. we are...
