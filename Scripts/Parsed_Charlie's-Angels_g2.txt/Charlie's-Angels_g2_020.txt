int. biltmore ballroom - day

a sophisticated reception is in full swing, an ocean of
smart suits and power ties.

dressed as a catering waitress, natalie carries a tray of
hors d'oeuvres. moving with her, we pass roger corwin, who
talks with another suit, and further on, a conservatively-
dressed dylan who chats up a group of wall street types.

                           dylan
             the average investor sees technology
             stocks as discrete entities, "this one is
             up 50 points, this one is down 10." it's
             only through derivative analysis that one
             sees the real power of that sector.

a few nods.    she makes a good point.

                           broker guy
             which analysis method do you prefer?

on dylan.    shit.     she tries to stall...

                           dylan
             well, there are so many options.
             i mean, who can say what the one
             best choice is?

across the room

still walking, natalie talks to no one...

                           natalie
             keppler-wilson.

back with dylan

                            dylan
             for my money, keppler-wilson is a
             strong choice.

more nods, ad-libbed agreement.        the broker guy is impressed.

excusing herself, dylan turns and subtly touches her ear,
where she's wearing a hidden radio.

                             dylan (cont'd)
             thanks.

at the bar

natalie loads champagne flutes onto her tray.

                             natalie
             anytime.

continued:
                             man's voice (o.s.)
             anytime what?

she looks up to see a very cute bartender, pete (26).
she didn't realize he was so close.

                           natalie
                    (covering)
             anytime, day or night, i am... excited
             ... to be handing out champagne.

oh god.   what did she just say?       but he smiles anyway.

she heads back out into the crowd.       you can almost see
the big l on her forehead.

by the fountain

dylan has been watching this.        we intercut between her
and natalie.

                             dylan
             he's cute.

                             natalie
             i'm working.

                           dylan
             sixty-five percent of relationships
             begin in the workplace.

                           natalie
             he's a bartender. i need dependable.
             i need reliable. i need a volvo man.

natalie walks past dylan, not acknowledging her.        dylan
snaps her fingers.

                             natalie
             miss!   miss!   i'd love some champagne.

natalie comes back, a little annoyed. dylan takes a
glass for herself, then foists the other glasses on
everyone around her, whether they wanted it or not.

                           dylan (cont'd)
                    (to natalie)
             why don't you get some more?

she nudges natalie in that direction.

at the bar

we tilt up from a japanese comic book to pete.       he
suddenly realizes natalie is waiting for him.

                                                    (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                  25.

continued:
                             pete
             sorry.

he starts filling more flutes.

                           natalie
             what are you reading?

he holds it up.

                           natalie (cont'd)
             that's the new michio kazura.
             that's not even out in america.

                           pete
             you know michio kazura?

                             natalie
             hello?    warriors of the broken earth?   classic.

                           pete
             i know. i just moved back from
             tokyo. it was the biggest thing
             since haikiri nomura.

                           natalie
             tomuru nasgawa ishi tokyo sen!
                           pete
             nagada quing-gong ni.     ni zeru.
imagine that.    natalie takes her tray and reluctantly
heads off.

on dylan

                            dylan
             ask him out.   ask him out.

on natalie

she turns and heads back.

                             natalie
             i'm natalie.

                             pete
             pete.    good to meet you.

                           natalie
             listen, there's an animation festival
             at the egyptian this week. i was
             wondering if you might want to...

                           pete
             tomorrow night? eight o'clock?
                                                  (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                26.

continued:
                           natalie
             i'll meet you there.

on dylan

she smiles, hearing the deal close. pushing through a
cluster of investors, she bumps into a thin man.

                            dylan
             pardon me.

he doesn't respond, but something about this man raises
her suspicions. where has she seen him before? as he
moves out of earshot...

                            dylan (cont'd)
             natalie.   nine o'clock. thin man.

on natalie

                            natalie
             i'm on it.

spotting the thin man, she heads his way.

                           natalie
                    (offering)
             vegetarian spring roll?

he waves her away, no. oops, she drops a napkin in front
of him. she kneels down to get it.

as we move in very close on her tray, we see that there's
a tiny digital display. a metal detector is built into
the rim.

it blips as she moves past his ankle. and again as she
rises up past his chest. the man just keeps walking.

                           natalie (cont'd)
                    (to earpiece)
             two guns. one ankle, one shoulder.

                            dylan
             you call it.

                           natalie
             you take point. i'll circle behind.

                            dylan
             copy.
