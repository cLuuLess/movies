... on the big screen. the angels and bosley watch the
footage, along with knox and vivian wu. vivian has
seated herself close to natalie. so close, in fact, that
natalie keeps having to shift a few inches.

dylan, meanwhile, sits across the room from knox,
deliberately avoiding eye contact.

on the big screen: as the videocamera passes a room
marked with an intimidating warning sign...

                           knox
             there!

video freezes.

                           knox (cont'd)
             that's the room with the
             mainframe. everything at red star
             goes through that system.

                           charlie's voice
             so if we want to find proof that
             red star stole knox's technology,
             that's the computer to tap.

                           knox
             exactly. but they have heavy firewalls
             and encryption. you can't jack in from
             outside. you'll have to physically be
             in that room to get at the data.

                           alex
             even if we do get inside, there won't
             be time to search for it. there's got
             to be a hundred terabytes of
             information there. it could take days.

                           natalie
             so you install a transmitter.

all eyes go over to natalie.

                           natalie (cont'd)
             patch in directly to the relay,
             broadcast on a high frequency.
             that way, you can have access to
             the mainframe from the comfort of
             your own home. and they have no
             idea that you can peek inside.
                                                 (continued)

knox is impressed.    the other angels nod.   it's a good idea.

                           vivian wu
             that's all fine in theory. but you
             still have to get inside that room
             to install it. what about security?

                           alex
             red star has a lot of government
             contracts, so security is tight. key-
             card badges throughout. redundant
             security at all red-line areas with
             biometric scanners and weekly keycodes.
             pervasive video surveillance, lasers,
             air-displacement sensors. plus a hard-
             wired fail-safe at the relay to prevent
             exactly this kind of tapping.

                           vivian wu
             it sounds impossible.

alex checks with her fellow angels.    they're in agreement.

                           dylan
             it sounds like fun.

with a subtle rush, we move into a stylized montage that
shows how they do it. it features whip pans, freeze
frames and zooms to show us only the highlights.

                           natalie (v.o.)
             only the two directors can disengage the
             fail-safe. we have to get their keys.
