ext. front porch - night

thug one opens the door to find dylan and natalie dressed
in swiss miss outfits, complete with blonde braids.

                           dylan
             guten tag!

                           natalie
                    (correcting dylan)
             guten morgen!

                           dylan
                    (correcting natalie)
             guten nacht!

                           dylan and natalie
                    (to each other)
             guten freund!

the girls lean in and hug each other, butts sticking out.
to the left, bosley starts playing oommpa oommpa oommpa
oommpa on a wrap-around tuba. he's wearing lederhosen,
with a feather in his hat.

natalie begins to yodel.

dylan hands a fancy envelope to the bewildered thug. thug
two is approaching from behind, curious what the hell is
going on.

dylan begins to talk-sing a song in german about a too-
curious goat and his worried mistress. even with the pantomime,
we have no idea what's happening. it seems
wholesome, but occasionally one of the girls touches the
other in a weirdly coquettish, oddly sexual way.

thug two looks at the address on the envelope.

                           thug two
                    (low)
             they got the wrong address.

                           thug one
             shut up.

as the angels continue their routine, the camera rises,
three quick cuts to take us to...

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                               34.
