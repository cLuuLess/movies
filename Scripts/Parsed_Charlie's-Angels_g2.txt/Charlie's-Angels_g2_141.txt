int. arena

natalie stares up at the clock... :30.       :29.

the whistle blows.

                            referee
             time out!

whew, that was close. but it'll start up any second.       she
has to keep it stopped. but how? she glances to the
sidelines and gets an idea.

on the court --

music starts from overhead, the respective teams' cheerleaders
coming out for one last routine.

as they kick into gear, natalie comes out with them, dressed
as a duke cheerleader. she follows along with the dancers, a
bit timid at first, then more confident as she gets into it.
