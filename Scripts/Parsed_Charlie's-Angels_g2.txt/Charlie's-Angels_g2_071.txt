ext. speedway access road - day

to a chorus of car horns, the thin man's blue racer weaves
through the spectator traffic entering the speedway.

looking back, we see natalie is gaining on him.

finally clear of the traffic, both cars let it rip.

                                                  cut to:

helicopter video footage

looking down on a freeway, where a ubiquitous police
pursuit is in progress.

             if you're just joining us, we're
             approaching hour five of a pursuit
             that has lead us all across the
             southland, at speeds up to 80
             miles an hour.

a beat-up gray chrysler leads a phalanx of police cars
down the empty freeway. it's oddly calm and hypnotizing.

             chuck, time and again we hear the
             question, "why don't the police just
             ram the other car, or shoot out the
             tires?" the lapd has a policy of
             hanging back and following unless...

suddenly, the blue formula one car comes screeching past
the cops and the suspect, over 200 miles per hour.

             what was that?
