int. knox's bedroom - dusk

the room is huge. through the floor-to-ceiling windows, we see
that we're up in the hills.

knox follows her as she walks.

                           dylan
             i've got surveillance on all the windows.
             don't answer the door, don't answer the phone.

we continue...
