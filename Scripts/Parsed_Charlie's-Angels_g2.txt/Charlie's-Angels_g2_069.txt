ext. freeway pit - day

the racer pulls off her helmet as the pit crew surrounds her.
of course, the racer is natalie, aka betty lou hobert, the texas
tornado.

                           pit boss
                    (yelling over the
                     engine noise)
             nice racing!
                    (beat)
             can't believe you've never raced
             this track before!

                           natalie
                    (texas accent)
             back where ah'm from, we race in swamps
             and back roads! this all's a piece a cake!

natalie shakes out her hair, winks at the pit boss.

the pit crew races in to make repairs. dylan, dressed in a
pit suit, kneels by natalie's front tire. natalie crouches
down next to her so they can talk.

                           natalie (cont'd)
             i nicked him. should give you
             enough time to do the deed.

                             dylan
             i'm on it.

dylan steals away, heading for...

corwin's pit crew --

corwin is seething mad as he pulls into his pit.

                             corwin
             let's go!    we're losing time here!

the pit repairs his car as corwin is approached by another
racer, also wearing a red star racing suit. he leans into
corwin's car and now we see that's it's... the thin man.

                           thin man
             you okay, boss?

                                                    (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                   50.

continued:

                           corwin
             no thanks to you! you're supposed
             to be my head of security! who is
             that bitch?!

the thin man peers over at natalie, but she's got her
back to him.

                            thin man
             don't know.   i'll keep an eye out.

                            corwin
             yeah.   you do that.

corwin peels out onto the track again, almost crushing
the thin man in the process.

as corwin pulls out

dylan sneaks in. in all the cacophony, no one notices
as she grabs corwin's suitcase out of the back seat of
his regular car, a bitching mercedes. she checks both
ways to see if she's being watched.

                           bosley (o.s.)
             coast is clear, dylan.
