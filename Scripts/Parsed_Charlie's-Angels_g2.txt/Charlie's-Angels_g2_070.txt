ext. the winner's circle

where alex, dressed as a trophy girl, watches the race
through binoculars and keeps an eye on her pals. she
nods to bosley, who is dressed as the flag waver. he
speaks into a walkie talkie.

                           bosley
             let's make the switch.

back in the pit --

dylan pulls a briefcase out of her jumpsuit, and swaps
it with one in corwin's car. she carefully switches all
his files from the old briefcase to the new one, then
gives alex a thumbs up.

meanwhile back in the race --

natalie roars back onto the track, keeping corwin in her
sights. then she spots another red star car, coming up
right next to her. she locks eyes with the thin man.

the two of them recognize each other at the exact same
instant.

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                  51.

continued:

the thin man, realizing he's been made, jams on the
brakes and skids off to the right, which leads to a ramp
that heads out of the stadium.

natalie, not wanting to lose him, does something crazy.
even though she's at the front of the pack, she brakes
hard, swerves into a full 180 degree u-turn, and starts
heading the wrong way on the race track.

startled drivers pull off to the left and right as she
follows the thin man out of the racetrack.
