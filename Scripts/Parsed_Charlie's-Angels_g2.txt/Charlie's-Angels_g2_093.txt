int. bosley's mercedes - day

bosley climbs in, shutting the door behind him.        he's
putting the keys in the ignition, when...

a hand clamps a chloroformed rag over his mouth. it's
the thin man. bosley struggles, but in moments, he's
unconscious.

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                61.

outside the car

the thin man stuffs bosley in the trunk, slams it shut,
revealing...

                          vivian wu (o.s.)
          sweet dreams.

vivian wu, standing beside the thin man. she's holding
the case bosley refused to give her before.

                        the thin man
          so, now we have the transmitter, what
          do we do with fat boy? dirt nap time?

                        vivian wu
          no! not until i've got the
          information i need. we'll take
          him to the compound, hold him there.
                 (beat)
          in the meantime, we've got to tie
          up some loose ends.

                        thin man
          whenever you say something like
          that, it means more work for me.

                        vivian wu
                 (ignoring him)
          the angels will figure out they
          were duped. we can't afford them
          jeopardizing our plans.

                        the thin man
          here it comes...

                        vivian wu
                 (coldly)
          we have to kill charlie's angels.

the thin man sighs, whips out his cell phone.

                        the thin man
          guess i'll cancel my weekend plans.

and speaking of weekend plans...

                                                cut to:
