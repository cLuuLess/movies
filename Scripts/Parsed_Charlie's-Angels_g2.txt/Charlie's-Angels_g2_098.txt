int. egyptian theatre - night

a passing filmgoer reveals natalie and pete. seated near
the aisle, they share a giant tub of popcorn. the movie
hasn't started yet, but there's a slide show of various
anime heroes and villains.

                        natalie
          thanks for the second chance. i
          swear, i'm really not a flake.

he shrugs it off.

                        pete
          how can i deny any woman who's
          seen all 23 "lords of wind and
          power"?

                        natalie
          i bet there's a dozen women here
          who fit that description.

she's right.

                        pete
          honestly -- there's a looks
          component as well.

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                   66.

continued:
                             natalie
             really.

                           pete
             you're the most beautiful woman
             i've ever seen this close up.

how can she not be flattered by that? she would say
something back, but the moment has gotten so electrified
that each little glance just brings on more goofy-in-
loveness.

the only solution is to leave...

                             natalie
             ladies room.    i'll be back in two minutes.

                             pete
             i'll be here.
