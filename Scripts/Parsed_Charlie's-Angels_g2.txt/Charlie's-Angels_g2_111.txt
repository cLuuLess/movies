int. townsend agency - day

alex is on the phone, frantically dialing numbers.

                           alex
             come on, bosley, answer.
                    (she hangs up, then,
                     to the angels)
             i've tried all his numbers and paged
             him five times. no answer.

                           natalie
             i don't even want to think about
             what i'm thinking right now.

                           dylan
             don't!  he's alive, he's gotta be.   if...
                    (she pauses)
             what is that?

there's a very faint voice coming from bosley's desk drawer.
dylan walks around the desk, yanks it open...

                            bosley (o.s.)
             angels!   angels, can you hear me!

dylan grabs the radio receiver from the drawer, holds him up.
bosley's voice gets louder.

                           bosley (o.s.) (cont'd)
             i don't know if you can hear me. i don't
             know if this thing is even working.

the angels crowd around dylan and the receiver.     it seems
impossible.
