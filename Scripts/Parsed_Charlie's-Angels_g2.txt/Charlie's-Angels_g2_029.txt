int. cowboy bar --     continuous

the kind of place that rich weekend skiers don't come.
lots of over-aggressive, cowboy-biker types, drinking more
than they should. there are only a few women in the place,
and they are either waitresses or biker chicks. suddenly,
everyone stops what they're doing and turns to the door.

charlie's angels have entered the room. dressed in their
stylish ensembles, they couldn't possibly look more out of
place.
                                              (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                 31.

continued:
                            natalie
             hey look!   mechanical bull.

                           dylan
             eyes on the prize, nat.   we gotta
             tap the phones.

                           alex
             that looks like our target.

she points to a door at the back of the bar that leads
into a glassed-in office. two, beefy bouncer types are guarding
the door.

                           alex (cont'd)
             i'm gonna need a distraction.

dylan and natalie smile at each other.

                           dylan
             i think that can be arranged.

the three angels split up, bosley tagging along with dylan.

dylan

sidles up to the bar. a group of three rednecks are
downing shots, one after another.

                           dylan (cont'd)
             three shots of tequila, please.
                    (bosley whispers in her ear)
             and one tom collins.

the rednecks stare at dylan, drooling.       dylan turns to the first
one.

                           redneck
             hey baby, why don't you ditch that
             stiff and come sit on ma lap?

bosley tries to make himself small.

                           dylan
             ooh, that is an enticing offer.
             but i got a better idea. how
             about a shot contest? my treat?

the three rednecks hoot and holler.

                           dylan (cont'd)
             okay, i'll take that as a yes. bartender?
             bring ten shots of tequila over to my
             table. and keep em coming.

by the mechanical bull
                                                   (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                  32.

continued:

a group of wanna bes are waiting their turn at the
mechanical bull. natalie wanders over behind them.

                              natalie
             mind if i try?

the crowd parts for her, and natalie hops up on the bull.
she cranks it up, and lets

by the bar --

dylan downs a shot, slams it on the table.      countless
other glasses surround her.

reveal that two of the rednecks are down for the count, one
falling out of his chair, the other passed out on the table.

the third redneck is slurring badly, trying to keep up
with dylan.
                         dylan
          hey, i've got an idea. now let's
          have a chair throwing contest.

                              redneck
             hunh?

                           dylan
             chair throwing? never heard of
             it? you just pick up your chair
             and throw it as far as you can.

the redneck nods, lifts up his chair and heaves it across
the bar.

okay, here's an outline of what will happen in the rest of
this scene:

dylan and natalie create a distraction, while alex sneaks
into the back office with bosley to get the phone number
of the chalet.
