int. tower office - day

natalie keeps checking the shelves, looking for a secret
switch.

                          natalie
           i did. i do.    i mean, thank you
           for calling.

intercut

                         pete
           i'm not an insecure person or anything,
           and i've really enjoyed the very brief
           time we have spent together.

two goons race up the stairs into the office.   natalie
turns to face them.

                         pete (cont'd)
           i'm just wondering if it's
           something i said or did that's
           making this whole thing so weird
           between us.

the goons approach.

                         natalie
                  (into phone)
           can you hold on a sec?

hitting mute, natalie kicks the chair behind her and dives
under the desk. she comes up on the other side with a

surge suppressor,

electric cords attached. she backhands it into the
goons, who jerk and twitch as electricity shoots through
their bodies.

                         natalie (cont'd)
                  (un-muting)
           one more sec.

she re-mutes.

with a roundhouse kick, she flattens one of the goons,
whacks the other with the cell phone.

the first goon charges at her, but she sidesteps at the
last moment, leaving goon one to hit goon two. both men
topple through the open window, falling. yikes.

                         natalie (cont'd)
                  (un-muting)
           sorry about that.

                                                (continued)

continued:
                           pete
             listen, is this a bad time?

                            natalie
             no.   not at all.

she starts searching again for the switch.

                           pete
             you just sound distracted.

                           natalie
             you know, work this week has been
             really busy. it's been hard to focus.

behind natalie, vivian wu reaches the top of the stairs.
she moves stealthily. natalie has no idea she's there.

                           natalie (cont'd)
             see, the thing is, i'm not a full-
             time waitress. i should have been
             more up-front about that, it's just...

at the last moment, natalie catches a moving reflection
in a shiny trophy. turns to find vivian wu swinging an
antique chair at her head.

she ducks.    the chair shatters the display case.

scrambling to get away, natalie drops the phone.

                           pete
             natalie, what was that?

                           natalie
                    (yelling to phone)
             everything's fine!

                           vivian wu
             hate to disagree.

vivian upends the desk, nearly crushing natalie. vivian
jumps on top, ready to kick the shit out of our angel.

as we probably suspected, vivian wu is one hell of a
martial artist. fortunately, so is natalie.

in their first series of blows, vivian seems to have the
upper hand, but natalie rallies hard. vivian surprises
her with a floor-sweeping kick, knocking her down.

vivian grabs the phone off the floor.

                           vivian wu (cont'd)
             is this the famous charlie?

                                                (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                87.

continued:

                            pete
                    (confused)
             no, it's pete.

vivian looks at the phone. who the fuck cares?      she
throws the phone out the open window.

getting up, natalie stares her down, incredulity building
to rage.

                            natalie
             you bitch!   i like that guy.

mocking, vivian wipes away a tear.

natalie lets forth a typhoon of fury, a full-out mortal
kombat. vivian is thrown back against the bookcase,
where she knocks over a candlestick.

that's the trigger for the bookcases to begin sinking
into the floor. circling around the room, each set of
shelves drops to a different level, forming steps that
lead to the upstairs room.

as natalie and vivian continue to fight, bosley sticks
his head down from above, watching the brawl. natalie is
kicking ass.

                           natalie (cont'd)
                    (to vivian)
             do you have any idea how difficult it
             is to find a quality man in los angeles?

she slams vivian into the wall.      grabs her again, hands
around her head.

                             vivian wu
             to be honest?

vivian suddenly leans forward and kisses her, right on
the lips.

                             vivian wu (cont'd)
             i don't care.

natalie is surprised for a moment, which gives vivian the
chance to swing at her. she misses.

                           natalie
             i can handle villainy. i can even
             handle super-villainy.
                    (vivian swings and
                     misses again)
             but what you did is just wrong.

                                                  (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                              88.

continued:

she head-butts vivian, knocking her out cold.   she throws
the limp body on the floor.

a beat, then natalie looks up to see bosley.

                           natalie (cont'd)
                    (suddenly chipper)
             hi, bos!

he waves.
