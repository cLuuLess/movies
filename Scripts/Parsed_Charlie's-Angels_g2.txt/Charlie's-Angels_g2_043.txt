ext. front of mountain house - night

dylan rushes knox across the driveway to the waiting van
-- natalie is pulling it around. overhead, bright
security lights switch on.

back at the front door, alex pulls it shut. she attaches
a carabiner clip to the handle, running a thin steel cord
from it around the porch column.
