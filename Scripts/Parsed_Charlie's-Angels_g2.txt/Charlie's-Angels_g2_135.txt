int. luxury boxes --

jason gibbons, famous movie star and north carolina alumnus,
pumps his fists in the air. his luxury box is loaded with
fellow tar heels and nameless studio executives. he
repeatedly high fives a hollywood type in sunglasses and armani.

                               jason
             yes, yes!

when suddenly, the door to the luxury box is flung open.

                           alex
                    (yelling)
             charlie!? charles townsend!

jason whips around and locks eyes with alex.

                               jason
             alex?

                               alex
             jason?
                      (beat)
             shit.

realizing she has no time to explain, and that charlie isn't
in here, she turns and leaves.

                               jason
             alex!    hey...

while everyone watches, confused, jason pushes his way
through the box and follows alex into the hall.

                                               cut to:

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                               93.
