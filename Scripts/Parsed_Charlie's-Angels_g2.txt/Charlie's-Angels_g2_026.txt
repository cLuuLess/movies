int. townsend agency back room - day

natalie sits at a glowing computer monitor, the thin
man's cell phone connected by a data cable to the
townsend agency computers. rapidly touching the screen,
she calls up a list of the last thirty-five phone calls
he received. they're all from the same location.

                            bosley
             well.   that was easy.

                                                   (continued)

                              natalie
             no, it wasn't.

she points to some code next to the numbers.

                           natalie (cont'd)
             i've seen this before, he's
             scrambling his calls through a
             secondary location.

                              bosley
             in english?

                           natalie
             we need to tap this phone line
             at the source, then we'll know
             where his calls were coming from.

                            dylan
                     (checking out the numbers)
             503?   that's not local, where is it?

                           natalie
             bos, can we check a directory?

                           alex
             don't bother. i know where it is.
             i used to spend every winter there.

as she says it...
