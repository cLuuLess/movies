ext. street off mulholland - day

angle on roger corwin, driving his mercedes.     he slows,
a road crew working ahead.

angle on dylan, dressed in an orange vest, manning the
slow/stop sign. she makes corwin stop, leans in to
apologize for the delay.

behind the mercedes, natalie sneaks up. she quickly
picks the trunk lock, then quietly climbs in. she hoists
in a large duffel bag, then shuts herself inside.
