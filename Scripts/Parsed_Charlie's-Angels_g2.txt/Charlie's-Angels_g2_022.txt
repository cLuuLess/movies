int. service hallway - day

the thin man comes around the corner.       we stay tight on
him, until he suddenly stops.

natalie

has come around from the other side. his bad guy instincts
tell him these women are working together. he's boxed in.

and then, a ding!

elevator doors open beside him. he looks in to see the clue-
less bellboy, who had a funky groove going on his headphones.
in a single motion, the thin man yanks the guy out into the
hallway and takes his place. hits the button.

from opposite directions, natalie and dylan run to the
elevator, but the doors have already shut. checking the
panel.

                           dylan
             he's going down.

they take the stairs.
