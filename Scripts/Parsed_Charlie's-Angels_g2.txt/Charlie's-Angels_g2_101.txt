ext. hollywood hills - night

dylan and knox walk hand in hand up a quaint, woodsy path
behind knox's home. we can hear music drifting up from
the hill in front of them.

                           dylan
             where's that music coming from?

                             knox
             you'll see.    just a little farther.

he helps her up a steep part of the path.       as she comes
over the crest of a hill.

                              dylan
             oh...
                       (taking in the view)
             oh wow.

dylan's pov --

the hill behind knox's house has a magnificent view right
into the hollywood bowl. the music is the symphony
playing something very romantic.

                           dylan (cont'd)
             that's amazing.

they stand there, together, just listening to the music,
knox watching her reaction closely.

                           knox
             can i ask you a personal question?

                              dylan
             maybe.

                           knox
             how much do you know about charlie?

dylan seems surprised by this question.

                           knox (cont'd)
             i just find it strange that you
             work for a man you've never met.

                           dylan
             well, i don't know what he looks like,
             but i feel like i know him. we all do.
                                                 (continued)

continued:
                           knox
             and none of you have any clue who
             he actually is?

                             dylan
             nope.

                           knox
             and you're never curious to find out?

                           dylan
             of course, but believe me, it's
             impossible. i've tried.
                    (beat)
             let's not talk about charlie,
             okay? or work.

she smiles t him, motioning for them to go back up to
knox's house.

                           dylan (cont'd)
             in fact, let's not talk at all.
