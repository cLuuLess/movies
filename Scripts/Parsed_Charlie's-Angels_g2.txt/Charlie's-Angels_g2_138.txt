int. hallway -- continuous

alex walks out into the hallway, frustrated.     then,
miraculously, she spots him...

knox.

he walks out of one of the luxury boxes, holding a large,
metal briefcase. he heads for the elevator.

alex

immediately goes to intercept him, but...

                              thin man (o.s.)
          don't move.

                                                 (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                 94.

continued:

it's the thin man, standing behind her, with a gun in
her back.

                           thin man (cont'd)
             you move, you say anything, i
             perforate you. got it?

knox glances back at the thin man, nods to him.      then he
gets in the elevator.

the thin man starts edging alex towards some emergency exit
doors, gun still in her back. alex is trying to think of an
escape, quickly. she knows that the second he gets her out
of this public space, he's gonna shoot her. the door gets
closer and closer...

                            jason (o.s.)
             alex?!   jesus, what is going on?

the thin man and alex turn around to face jason, who is
sweaty and exasperated from chasing her.

                           alex
             jason, hi, i...

the thin man digs the gun deeper into her back.

                           alex (cont'd)
             can i talk to you later?

                           jason
             no you can talk to me now. i want
             to know what the hell is going on.
             first, you disappear with no
             explanation, not even a goodbye.

                           alex
             i'm sorry, i...

                           jason
             now, i see you here, but you're
             with some other guy.

                           thin man
             hey, movie star, do yourself a
             favor and get lost.

jason double takes.     he's not used to someone talking to
him like that.

                            jason
             lemme guess.   you must be charlie?

                           alex
             jason, please...
                                                   (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                               95.

continued:
                           jason
             no, no i'm sick of this shit. i'm
             sick of this asshole telling you
             what you can and can't do.

and then, with no warning, he hauls off and punches the
thin man.

now, jason's just an actor, not an ass-kicking super
detective, so his punch isn't all that great. in fact, it
leaves jason shaking his hand in pain.

the thin man, a trickle of blood running from his lip, smiles.

                           thin man
             that was stupid.

first, he pops jason right in the jaw. jason stumbles
backward, dazed. then he reaches for his gun, in the
process, loosening his grip on alex...

                           alex
             jason, get down!

alex spins out of the thin man's grasp and does a full
roundhouse kick, knocking the gun out of the thin man's
hands. the thin man immediately responds, throwing two
quick punches, which alex expertly blocks and then follows
with a hitch-kick to the chin.

jason, dazed and confused, thinks he must be hallucinating.

                           jason
             what the hell is going on?

what's going on is a world class ass-kicking, courtesy of his
girlfriend. while the action star watches in amazement, alex
unloads an arsenal of bad ass kung fu moves that would make
jet li green with envy.

the thin man doesn't stand a chance. a flying side kick
sends him stumbling backwards into the stairwell. we
follow the fight...
