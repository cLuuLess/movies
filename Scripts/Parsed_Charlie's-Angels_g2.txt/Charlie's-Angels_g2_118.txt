int. knox compound - day

the thin man cocks his gun as he heads to the tower to do
away with bosley. then...

                             henchman
             sir?    you should take a look at this.

the henchman leads thin man into...

security room

a room lined with monitors that survey the courtyard. henchman
points to one in the corner.
                                              (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                  80.

continued:
                          henchman (cont'd)
             see here? look at the timer on
             the camera.

                           thin man
             it's not moving.
                    (beat)
             oh, this is the oldest one in the
             book. punch up camera three.

another camera angle comes up, this also a view of the
empty courtyard.

                              thin man (cont'd)
             now pan left.

the henchman does what he's told and, on the monitor...

we see dylan, dressed in a black cat suit, as she rewires
a security camera. she glances around, making sure no
one sees her.

                           thin man (cont'd)
             the old re-loop the video camera trick.
             and look, she's not even carrying a gun.
                    (beat)
             what is this, amateur hour?

                                                  cut to:
