      ext. piazza san marco - night

      a swirl of colors, noise and music. pushing his way into the chaotic
      celebration, bond scans the crowd, looking for a face:

      nothing but a sea of masks. white. yellow. red. blue.

      caught up in the tumult, he turns left, he strains to turn right,
      anxiously looking for the contact. who is it?

      three masked women appear in front of bond. they curtsy, and giggle.

                              woman
                 buona sera, signore -

      he's spun by a masked man with a bottle.

                              man
                 vino?

      bond waves him off - and is jostled in the other direction, by a
      group of celebrants carrying a long banner.

      suddenly, the crowd surges forward: a procession, carrying the
      effigy of carnival is making its way through the square.

      locked shoulder to shoulder in the crowd, bond struggles to look
      forward - left, right - when he feels a tug at his cape from behind.
      he can only crane his neck to see/hear -

                              masked woman
                 i may have been followed. meet me at
                 the church in five minutes!

      with an effort, bond turns to look at her - but sees nothing, save
      the wisp of a satin costume, disappearing as the crowd closes ranks
      behind him.

      san giacomo square - night

      five minutes later. almost deserted. a few stray couples. the
      masked woman appears, walking tentatively between the shadows and
      the moonlight, looking for bond. suddenly -

      whomp! - an arm reaches out, and yanks her into an alcove.

                              bond
                 looking for someone?

      recovering her breath (it was a violent yank,) the woman - paris
      removes her mask. she shines a sexy, 1000-watt smile at 007:

                              paris
                 hello, james.

      bond reacts. he is not happy to see her.

                              bond
                 paris?!? what are you doing here?

                              paris
                 is that any way to say hello?

                              bond
                 i thought your specialty was good-bye.

      paris smiles coyly. she lifts a hand to tousle his hair -

                              paris
                 oh, james. i've missed you -

                              bond
                       (grabbing her by the wrist)
                 is this another one of your games?

                              paris
                 stop it! you're hurting me! can't
                 you just be nice?

                              bond
                 i've got half the british government
                 breathing down my neck. i don't have
                 time for your nonsense.

      she's surprised - and hurt - by his coldness.

                              paris
                 don't you even miss me? didn't i
                 mean anything to you?

                              bond
                 nothing.

      she turns away from him, fighting back tears. bond doesn't care:

                              bond
                 what about elliot harmsway? or is
                 this just another one of your stunts?

                              paris
                       (anguished)
                 no! he's crazy - he's insane. he
                 hates everybody. he's got these
                 plans -
                       (facing bond, becoming hysterical:)
                 you've got to help me, james. i'm
                 sorry. i'm sorry for everything. i
                 know i was wrong - but you've got to
                 protect me. i know you still love -

      bond slaps her. she's stunned. he waits. she's angered:

                              paris
                 do you feel better now?

                              bond
                       (not giving an inch)
                 do you?

      she turns away. bond feels remorse for hitting her. softens:

                              bond
                 what about the uranium?

                              paris
                 it's on the boat. he's holding a
                 press conference tomorrow.

      bond reaches out to touch her. she falls into his arms, burying her
      face in his shoulder.

                              paris
                 i'm so sorry, james. i promise, i'll
                 never leave you again.

                              bond
                       (patting her head)
                 shhhhh...

                              paris
                 just hold me.

      bond thinks for a moment, then gently pushes her away, a foot
      backwards, to look in her eyes:

                              bond
                 how do you know harmsway?

      paris' eyes flicker at something over bond's shoulder. she swoons:

                              paris
                 kiss me.

      she pulls bond to her, kissing him - then hauls off, belting him
      across the mouth.

                              paris
                 bastard! leave me alone!

      she shoves him off, darts away. bond is bleeding from his mouth -
      and not altogether surprised at her behavior. he turns to see -

      another angle - san giacomo square - (bond's pov) -

      paris running to four men dressed alike in three-corner hats,
      enveloped from head-to-foot in black capes. their faces are
      completely concealed behind flat, bone-white masks covering all but
      their chins. they look like messengers of death.

      closer on paris and the men -

      the leader is stamper; the others are locals, thug #1, #2, #3. (thug
      #1 is built like a bank vault.) stamper looks steadily at bond

                              stamper
                 who is he?

                              paris
                 nobody. just some drunk. leave him
                 alone -

                              stamper
                       (to thug #3)
                 take her to the boat.

      return on bond -

      he sees stamper and the two henchmen approaching. he turns and walks
      quickly toward -
