      ext. mountainside -

      bond slaloms down, in and out of trees, to avoid detection. at the
      bottom, where the snow thins, he comes to:

      a rock outcropping.

      hiding behind the rock, bond takes off his skis, knapsack. he
      unpacks (and unfolds) a high tech automatic rifle. puts on a
      headset. he creeps up on the rock, and looks out on:

      a secret military base/air strip (bond's pov)

      50 feet down, 200 yards away: 50 men are unloading cargo from a dozen
      military transport trucks; there are two north korean mig-29s on the
      ground (one partially obscured by a truck,) plus flatbeds carrying
      helicopters and scud missiles.

      near a quonset hut, a truck-mounted radar dish scans the area, with
      infrared gatling guns mounted on either side.

      bond - at the rock outcropping -

      props his rife on the boulder, and peers through the gun sight.

      through the telescopic sight -

      he sees a closer (but still wide) telescopic view of men bargaining
      over weapons, and forklifts loading/unloading crates of munitions.

      the same scene on a video wall - mi-6 situation room, london.

                              bond's voice
                       (over a speaker)
                 seven, in position.

                              tanner's voice
                 roger, seven.

      watching this display is m, tanner, and a handful of military brass,
      including a russian general, bukharin, and british admiral roebuck,
      an aging sea-lion with no love for m, or mi-6.

      m deals with the humorless admiral by, well, humoring him:

                              m
                 ... what were you saying, admiral?
                 something about this 'not being a job
                 for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing
                 playboy spy?'

                              admiral roebuck
                 - i'll be sure to acknowledge 007's
                 'assistance' in my report to the
                 prime minister. but this is, still,
                 a naval operation.

                              m
                 what do they say in russia, general
                 bukharin?
                       (asks questions in
                        flawless russian)

      the general chuckles. translates:

                              general bukharin
                 'in a joint operation, someone's nose
                 always gets put out of joint.'

      m turns to admiral roebuck:

                              m
                 i'm interested in success, admiral.
                 not who gets credit.
                       (turning to:)
                 mr. tanner: what have we got?

      tanner points to the video wall with a red laser pen.

                              tanner
                       (ironically)
                 a regular terrorist swap meet. death
                 at discount: two chinese long march
                 scuds, a pair of soviet a-17 attack

                              bukharin
                       (interrupting)
                 stolen -

                              tanner
                 and the crates look like american m-16
                 assault rifles, chilean antipersonnel
                 mines, six french exocet missiles, and
                 75 - no maybe a hundred - kilograms of
                 czech made c-4 semtech explosive.
                       (beat)
                 something for everyone. fun for the
                 whole family.

                              m
                       (freezing him with a glance)
                 what about id's?

                              tanner
                       (pushes a button on a console)
                 one to seven: deal the face cards.

      the rock outcropping -

      bond adjusts a knob on the scope.

      mi-6 situation room -

      on the video-screen, the picture zooms to a close up of one of the
      arms traders. tanner presses a button, and - almost instantly - the
      man's bio and vitals appear on another video screen.

                 aces high, seven. bid to the east.

      bond shifts his aim, east. (intercut as necessary) he zeroes in on
      another face, and the man's stats appear in london.

                 full house, seven. bid to the north.

      bond complies. another face, another set of stats:

                 sitoshi isagura. japanese religious

                              admiral roebuck
                       (impatiently, cutting him off:)
                 i've seen enough. let's finish this.
                       (ordering m:)

                              admiral roebuck
                 - thank you, m. but this is more
                 than your man can handle.
                       (to bukharin)
                 are we in agreement?

                              bukharin
                       (hesitant, at first)
                 - yes. yes.

                 admiral -

      moving swiftly, the admiral has picked up a red phone:

                              admiral roebuck
                 command to nelson: authorization to
