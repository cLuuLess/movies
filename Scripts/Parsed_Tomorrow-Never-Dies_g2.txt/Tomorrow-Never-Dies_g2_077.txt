      general li. he and stamper get in helicopter.

      close on the helicopter -

      as harmsway waves good-bye from the window, the helicopter rises,
      revealing a metal cable attached to the landing skid.

      wider -

      the cable leads to a spool, which runs to the fifth metal ventilation
      shaft harmsway referred to in the last scene.
