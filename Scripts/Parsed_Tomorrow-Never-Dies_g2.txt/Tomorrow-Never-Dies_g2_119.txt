      int. harmsway's office -

      the door opens and harmsway enters, followed by bond. he calls to
      someone we don't see:

                              harmsway
                 hello, dear. i'm sorry i took so long -

      reveal: sidney is sitting across from his desk.

                              sidney
                 that's okay, uncle ell -

      she freezes in mid-sentence, seeing bond. bond is equally surprised.

                              sidney
                 what is he doing here?

                              harmsway
                 i see you two have met.

                              bond
                 briefly.

                              harmsway
                       (crossing to his desk)
                 don't pout, sidney. i invited him
                 here hoping he might shed some light
                 on your story. he's from 'lloyd's of
                 london.'
                       (sly glance to bond)
                 ...aren't you, mr. bond?

                              sidney
                 he's not going to tell the truth! he
                 was diving for the gold!

      harmsway sits, and addresses bond, matter-of-factly:

                              harmsway
                 it seems - mr. bond - that miss winch
                 has told me the most incredible story: a
                 sunken british warship filled with gold;
                 a british cutter firing on her; billions
                 of dollars in bullion lying on the
                 bottom of the strait.

      bond isn't enjoying this charade.

                              harmsway
                 obviously, the british government
                 denies all of this -

                              sidney
                 - i told you! he was there! -

                              harmsway
                 - but as i've explained to sidney,
                 without proof, there's just no story.
                 don't you agree mr. bond?

      before bond can answer -

                              sidney
                 but i have proof! you ran out of here
                 so fast, i didn't get to show you.

      bond and harmsway react - with entirely different concerns: harmsway
      wasn't expecting her to have proof; bond knows that if she shows him
      the gold, (or worse, the uranium tooth,) harmsway will probably kill
      both of them to destroy the evidence, and witnesses.

                              harmsway
                       (forcing a smile)
                 ...and what's that, my dear?

                              bond
                 sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -

      sidney cuts bond off, dropping the gold bar on harmsway's desk.

                              sidney
                 he brought that up from the wreck.

                              harmsway
                 ...i see.

      alarmed, bond wants to stop sidney from reaching into her bag again -

                              bond
                 sidney, i wouldn't -

      too late. she drops the uranium tooth on his desk.

                              sidney
                 and what about this? any idea what this is?

      silence. harmsway and bond exchange a sober look. then:

                              harmsway
                 ... i believe it's a depleted uranium
                 drill bit, my dear.

      he presses an alarm under his desk. bond reaches for the drill tooth.

                              bond
                 why don't we just take these -

                              sidney
                       (blocking him)
                 no. i want sir elliot to keep them.

      harmsway stands, comes around the desk:

                              harmsway
                 ...well! i do believe this requires
                 further investigation!

                              sidney
                 thank you, uncle elliot.

                              harmsway
                 no matter what the british government
                 says, i won't kill this story.
                       (his secretary appears in the doorway)
                 miss oxford will show both of you to
                 the elevator... and one of my people
                 will definitely be in touch sooner
                 than later.

                              bond
                 i'm sure they will.

                              harmsway
                 good-bye, mister bond.

      he reaches to kiss sidney - and looks in her eyes a second too long.

                              harmsway
                 good-bye, darling.

      watching them exit, his smile turns hard and bitter.
