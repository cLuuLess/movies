      ext. bank of london - night - continuous -

                              m
                 i've already contacted our station in
                 kuala lumpur. they're lining up a
                 local contact.
                       (beat)
                 i want you to find that gold, and
                 secure it.

      they've arrived at her car. the door is already open.

                              bond
                 ... didn't elliot harmsway just move
                 his headquarters to kuala lumpur?

      she turns, freezes bond with a look:

                              m
                 contrary to what you may believe,
                 007, the world is not filled with
                 mad-men who can hollow out volcanoes,
                 stock them with big-breasted women,
                 and threaten the world with nuclear
                 annihilation.

      bond reacts to the comeuppance. she continues:

                              m (cont'd)
                 the case is closed. the italian
                 authorities ruled the girl a suicide.
                 we had enough trouble keeping your
                 name out of the media. for
                 everyone's sake -
                       (beat)
                 your job is to find the gold. not
                 settle some personal score with
                 elliot harmsway.
