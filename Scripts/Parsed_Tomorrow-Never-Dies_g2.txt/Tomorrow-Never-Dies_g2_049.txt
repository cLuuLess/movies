      number three fidgets in the back... and notices stamper smiling at
      him in the rearview mirror. he sees stamper reach into his jacket -
      and panics! is he going to get shot? is it over? he winces, as -

      stamper's hand suddenly thrusts backward through the partition.

                              stamper
                 gum?

      shaking his head, he pulls out a handkerchief to mop the flop sweat.

      return on the manor house - favoring the hnn helicopter -

      amidst ad-libbed 'good-bye's" from the gang of six (now five,)
      harmsway gets in the waiting hnn chopper. it powers up, takes off.
