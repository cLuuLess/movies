      int. bridge - dusk

      close on a vertical glass map. an electronic panel display with a
      blinking yellow dot indicates -

                              navigator
                 we've cleared hong kong harbor, sir.

      the captain nods. turns to the gps officer:

                              captain
                 position?

      the gps officer enters keyboard commands on console marked "global
      positioning satellite." he reads out the data:

                              gps officer
                 two-two, zed-three, one-five north; a
                 hundred fourteen degrees, five
                 minutes, ten seconds east.

                              captain
                 mark.

                              gps officer
                 locked on satellite, sir.

                              captain
                 set course, two-ten degrees, south
                 south east.

                              navigator
                 coming about, sir.

      the captain is all business - clipped, sober terse. turns to his
      first officer, hands him a slip of paper:

                              captain
                 orders from london: for the next
                 ninety-six hours, we're to run on
                 full radio silence. double watches,
                 full alert.
                       (beat)
                 we're to send one encrypted positioning
                 burst to london every six hours -
                 otherwise, zero electronic emissions.

      the first officer nods.

                              captain (cont'd)
                 inform the men, then run a surprise
                 inspection. if someone paints us, i
                 don't want this ship showing up on their
                 radar screen like some god-damned
                 harrod's christmas tree.

                              first officer
                 yes, sir!

                              captain
                 i'll be in my cabin until oh-six-
                 hundred hours.

      the captain heads for the door.

                              second officer
                 captain leaving the bridge.

      the officers salute as he exits. with a shrug, the first officer
      picks up the intercom microphone:

                              first officer
                 attention all hands. now hear this...
