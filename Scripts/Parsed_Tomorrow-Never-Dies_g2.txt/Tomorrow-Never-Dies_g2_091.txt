      int. kuala lumpur yacht club - night

      a local band plays on the verandah. we find wade at a poker table
      with five local malay chinese. he cuts the cards, exuberantly:

                              wade
                 okay gentlemen. the name of the game
                 is 7-card cambodian stud. everything
                 is wild!

      and then - moving through a beaded glass curtain - we find bond, in a
      white dinner jacket, sitting with captain cheong. the captain is
      elegant, mid-5o's, eye patch. (to be put into local dialect.)

                              captain cheong
                 in the strait of malacca, when a boat
                 is even five minutes late, one begins
                 to worry, mr. bond.

                              bond
                 i know. pirates from sumatra want
                 the cargo; smugglers from thailand
                 and burma want the ships.

                              captain cheong
                 sometimes kill the crew; other times -
                       (points to his eye)
                 torture them.

                              bond
                 i'm sorry.

                              captain cheong
                 the kuala lumpur ferry was 35 miles
                 off-course that night. captain blamed
                 the auto-pilot; i suspected he was
                 drunk - until the sumatra ferry
                 captain had same problem.

                              bond
                 did you test the auto-pilots? the
                 satellite positioning receiver?

                              captain cheong
                 next morning. both boats. nothing wrong.
                       (chuckles)
                 my 90 year old grandfather thinks
                 'ghost in the computer - silicon
                 dragon.'

                              bond
                       (smiles, standing to leave)
                 i appreciate your time -

                              captain cheong
                 maybe you should talk to sidney winch.
                 owns a marine salvage company. nobody
                 knows more about the strait.

                              bond
                 where can i find him?

                              captain cheong
                 him? he, is a she -
                       (points)
                 at the bar.

      new angle - the bar -

      sidney winch, about 32, tough, smart, and (here's a surprise,)
      beautiful, is ordering a drink when bond appears:

                              sidney
                 bourbon. neat.

                              bond
                 i wonder if you handle your liquor
                 more carefully than you handle your boat.

      very slowly, sidney turns to bond. she looks him up and down - as if
      deciding whether this specimen is worth her time. her conclusion: a
      definite - though skeptical - maybe. she gives him a sultry smile:

                              sidney
                 sometimes, you just have to plunge
                 into things. be reckless.

                              bond
                 - and i bet you always leave turmoil
                 in your wake.

                              sidney
                       (thinking, 'not bad')
                 have we met?

                              bond
                 this afternoon. our boats practically
                 kissed in the harbor.
                       (holds out his hand to shake)
                 james bond.

                              sidney
                 sidney winch.

      the bartender appears.

                              bond
                 vodka martini, shaken not stirred.
                       (to sidney)
                 and another for you?

                              sidney
                 no. but you can buy a drink for my
                 friend, taro.

      she steps back revealing a huge samoan, taro, wearing a dark suit and
      tie, sitting on a stool. taro smiles menacingly at bond.

                              bond
                 boyfriend?

                              sidney
                 chaperone. i'm waiting for my dinner date.

                              bond
                 pity.
                       (to bartender)
                 bring him whatever he wants.

                              sidney
                 so what brings you to kuala lumpur,
                 mr. bond?
                       (beat)
                 wait - don't tell me: unhappy marriage?
                 running from some poor little girl
                 with two kids and a chanel pocketbook in -
                 london?

      bond analyzes the situation: 1) she's with a thug. 2) she's in marine
      salvage. 3) she went to the harbor master's office for the charts.
      4) she's a smart-ass. he decides to see if he can rattle her:

                              bond
                 actually, i'm here on business. you
                 might say it was a... golden opportunity.

                              sidney
                       (a chill in her voice)
                 and exactly what business are you in,
                 mr. bond?

                              bond
                 insurance. lloyds of london.

                              sidney
                       (daggers in her voice)
                 the strait can be a very dangerous
                 place, mr. bond. a few words
                 scribbled on a piece of paper in
                 london doesn't carry a lot of value
                 out here. including life insurance.

                              bond
                 i'll keep that in mind.

                              sidney
                       (looking off)
                 i see my date is here.
                       (to taro)
                 and i think mr. bond is ready to leave.

                              bond
                 nice to run into you again.

                              sidney
                 let's not make it a habit.

      she exits. turning his back on taro, bond watches her cross the
      room. taro places a huge hand on bond's shoulder -

                              taro
                 i think you should go -

                              bond
                 not quite yet, taro -

      and from bond's pov - sidney greets harmsway with a big hug.

                              sidney
                 uncle elliot!!

      watching this, bond seethes with memory of paris and his hatred of
      harmsway. taro tightens his grip -

                              taro
                 i said you should -

      but before he finishes, bond spins, and: 1) slams taro's head on the
      bar, 2) snatches the ice-pick from the bartender, 3) yanks taro back-
      ward by his collar, 4) slams the ice-pick through taro's tie into the
      wooden bar, and 5) kicks the stool out from under the goon.

      taro is now hanging by his tie, from the bar, choking.

      bond takes a moment to straighten his own bow-tie. wade appears,
      jubilant, with a wad of cash:

                              wade
                 yo! jimbo! i won five hundred -
                       (seeing taro)
                 what happened?

                              bond
                 he tied one on.
