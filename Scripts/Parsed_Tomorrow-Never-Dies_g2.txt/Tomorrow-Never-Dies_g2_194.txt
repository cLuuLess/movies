      int. bridge -

      harmsway is thrown backwards. gun in hand, he makes his way up the
      incline, to the port-side door.

      just when he thinks he's made it -

      bang. bond appears in the doorway, having jumped down from the roof
      on the small exterior walkway. he's seething with rage.

      harmsway looks up at him. blinks in disbelief.

                              bond
                 i never believe what i read in the
                 newspapers.

      harmsway slowly brings up the gun.

                              harmsway
                 pity you'll miss your obituary.

      bond smacks the gun out of his hand with contempt. moves closer.

                              bond
                 where is she, harmsway?

      boom! the fuel tanks explode in the distance. the bridge rocks
      violently; the room tilts to a greater angle.

                              harmsway
                 you want to kill me, bond? go ahead.

      with both arms, bond pushes harmsway backwards, flinging him downward
      against the starboard wall. the water is rising on the bridge.

                              bond
                       (moving in on him)
                 where is she harmsway? -

      he grabs harmsway by the lapels, and throws him against the front
      wall, crashing onto the instrument panel head first.

      harmsway laughs maniacally, face down on the gauges:

                              harmsway
                 what is it, bond? you haven't the
                 guts?

      boom! there's another explosion in the background! the front of the
      boat tilts upward! the water is rushing in!

      bond grabs harmsway by the shoulder -

                              bond
                 you spineless paper tiger -

      and yanks him off the instrument panel, flinging him backwards
      against the rear wall of the bridge.

                              bond
                 where is she, harmsway?!? or did you
                 kill her like paris?

      suddenly, the boat groans. the bridge rises out of the water! and
      bond loses his balance, falling onto harmsway -

                              harmsway
                       (glaring, insanely:)
                 we all go down together!!!

      harmsway lunges for bond's throat -

      and the bridge slips underwater -

      where bond breaks harmsway's grasp in a violent struggle - then
      punches him. air bubbles break from harmsway's mouth. he
      frantically tries to break free for the surface -

      but bond pulls him back down, and holds him down, pushing down on
      harmsway's shoulders.

      harmsway is thrashing about, flailing in all directions, pounding at
      bond in a haze of bubbles...

      then falls still.

      with his lungs aching, bursting with fire, bond rockets up -

      underwater - (bond/boat) -

      through the bridge windows, up to -

      the surface.

      he breaks through the water, gasping for air... and then, almost
      instantly, dives down again.

      underwater - (bond/boat) -

      bond dives for the boat - down, and down, chasing it, as if he could
      just grab it, and stop it from sinking.

      he goes deeper, and deeper, as it sinks further and further away,
      just beyond his reach.

      and just when it seems impossible for him to survive - to hold his
      breath a second longer -

      a figure in scuba gear (mask and tank) grabs him.

      bond turns in disbelief. stares into the mask: it's sidney. she
      puts her regulator in bond's mouth...

      and they share the air as they rise from the depths.

      the surface -

      they break through the water. sidney yanks off her mask. teases:

                              sidney
                 what do you mean, you'd rather die
                 alone?

                              bond
                 i didn't say when i want to die -

      she splashes him. turning away, bond spots stamper's 'arms cache'
      dinghy floating nearby.

      new angle - the dinghy -

      bond climbs into it, then helps sidney get in. they collapse in the
      bottom of the boat, resting their heads against the gunwale.

      after a beat, sidney clears her throat. bond is already amused:

                              bond
                 ... yes???

                              sidney
                 before we go any further here, mr.
                 bond, from lloyds of london, i just
                 want to get two things straight.

                              bond
                 ... yes?

                              sidney
                 first, that boat is in international
                 waters. i'm claiming it for salvage.
                 one-third of that gold is mine.

                              bond
                 and number two?

                              sidney
                 if you think we're going to have some
                 kind of 'life affirming' romance here
                 just because we cheated death, let me
                 be clear:
                       (pause)
                 we're going to have it where i want,
                 and when i want.

                              bond
                 and when might that be?

                              sidney
                 now.

      he laughs. she falls into his arms. they kiss, and we cut to:

      two pairs of binoculars -

      with the dinghy reflected in the glass. in unison, they are both
      lowered, revealing q and wade.

                              q
                 ... as usual, i see the situation is
                 in 007's very capable hands.

                              wade
                 life is not fair.

                              q
                       (emphatically)
                 you're right.

      a british naval officer appears.

                              officer
                 excuse me, major boothroyd - the
                 message went to london.

                              q
                 thank you.

      q and wade throw a glance back to the sea, then turn, waking off:

                              wade
                 tell me, q-ster. you do ever do any
                 gardening?

                              q
                 ...the only thing i ever planted was
                 bugs.

      close on a picture of harmsway on a video screen -

      on the wall behind m's desk. it's night. moneypenny sits across
      from m, with a steno pad.

                              m
                 moneypenny, take the following release:
                       (beat)
                 the body of sir elliot harmsway was
                 found floating in the south china sea
                 this morning, at 08:00 hours local
                 hong kong time.
                       (pauses)
                 at present, local authorities believe
                 the media mogul committed suicide.

      return on the dinghy -

      bond and sidney break off a kiss. she lies nestled in his arms.

                              sidney
                 james... is this really what a
                 typical day is like for you?

      bond replies with a wry smile:

                              bond
                 yes...
                       (pause)
                 but some days... are longer than
                 others.

      and with this, he reaches up over his head, and pulls a tarp over the
      two of them...

      and the camera pulls back, and up, rising into the air to reveal:

      the entire british navy closing in on them from all points of the
      compass.
