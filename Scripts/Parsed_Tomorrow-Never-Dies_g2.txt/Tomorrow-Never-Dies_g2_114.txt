      the noise from the printing presses is deafening. bond and the pr
      woman walk down a metal staircase to the pressroom floor, where -

      harmsway (wearing a printer's smock and newsprint cap,) is joking
      with several pressmen - a fresh issue of "tomorrow" outstretched in
      his hands.

                              harmsway
                       (spotting bond, yelling:)
