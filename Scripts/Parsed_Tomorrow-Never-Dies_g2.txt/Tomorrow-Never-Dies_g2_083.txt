      int. conference room - hnn headquarters - continuous - day

      a glass conference roam, whose partially closed blinds obscure the
      view of the mammoth hnn news center. (we'll see this, in full,
      later.) meanwhile, a dozen rambunctious editors react to:

                              harmsway
                 morning, all my golden retrievers.
                 what kind of havoc shall we create in
                 the world today?

                 dog bites man.
                       (explains)
                 man bites dog is a news story. riots at
                 the world cup soccer finals is a social
                 announcement. next?

                              news editor 4
                 this just came in: there's something
                 up with the british navy in the
                 strait. rescue planes, helicopters;
                 two ships supposedly sailing from the
                 persian gulf. they just chased away
                 one of our news boats.

                              harmsway
                       (feigning complete innocence)
                 is that so?

                              news editor 4
                 yeah. sounds like a plane went down
                 or something... either way, they're
                 calling it - all together now:

                              all at table
                 "a routine training exercise."

                              harmsway
                 i'm shocked!! issue the usual vehement
                 protest: freedom of the press, people's
                 right to know... lather it up with a lot
                 of righteous indignation.
                       (off their laughter)
                 next?
