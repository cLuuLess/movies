      int. grand room - scottish manor house -

      a single white rose is added to a pile of white roses in paris
      harmsway's open casket.

      reveal: we're in mid-procession: the last two (of the six men from
      outside) place roses in the casket...

      then turn, nodding sorrowfully to elliot harmsway (sitting in the
      front row of a room that's keen turned into a makeshift chapel)...

      and follow hand signals of stamper, who motions them through a door,
      to an unseen room.

      after the last man has paid his respects, harmsway stands, walks to
      the bier, and - wiping away a tear - places a single red rose in his
      dead wife's casket.
