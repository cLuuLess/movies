      int. bond's car - moving -

                              sidney
                 we're not going to make it!

      bond flips down a control panel from the radio. a digital display
      begins to run through a set of numbers. bond explains:

                              bond
                 if it's radio controlled, it'll break
                 the code.

                              sidney
                 if not?

                              bond
                       (pointing to a button)
                 we blast through.

      the car approaches the closing door at high speed -

      bond sees they're not going to make it. he punches the missile button.

      two missiles roar out from the front of the car -

      they explode against the closing door - to no effect.

      bond's car gets closer and closer -

      sidney screams! bond braces, and -

      boom! crash! silence. black. after a moment, we hear the sound of
      footsteps on cement.
