      ext. port klang - establishing - day

      the harbor master's tower overlooks a small armada of yachts, fishing
      boats, etc. a series of long dockways jut out into the harbor.

      cigarette boat - (port klang - waterway) - day

      wade's boat is moving slowly along the waterway at the end of the
      docks. looking off, bond spots the harbor master's tower:

                              bond
                 over there.

      wade turns the boat down one of the dock channels.

      new angle - wade/bond's pov - dockway channel -

      a sleek launch is roaring towards them, on a dead collision course.
      a woman in a baseball cap is at the wheel.

      wade pulls his boat to the right; the launch roars around them,
      rocking the cigarette boat with its wake.

      both bond and wade clock the woman - who we will later learn is
      sidney winch. wade stares after her:

                              wade
                 i think i've just seen my next future
                 ex-wife.

                              bond
                       (seeing they're about to crash)
                 not if you kill us first - unless
                 that's how you plan to leave muffy.

      wade scowls, setting the boat back on course.

      dockside - port klang - day -

      bond hops off the boat, securing the lines. wade joins him.

                              wade
                 by the way, jimbo - whatever happened
                 to that girl - in cuba - ?

      finished tying the boat, they walk toward the harbor master's office.

                              bond
                 natalya?

                              wade

                              bond
                 she married a hockey player.

                              wade
                 i envy your 'undercover' assignments.

                              bond
                       (a look, then)
                 we work in the dark. we do what we can.
