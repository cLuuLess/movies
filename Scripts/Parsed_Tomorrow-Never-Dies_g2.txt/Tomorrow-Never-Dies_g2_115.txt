      int. dressing alcove - off the pressroom -

      harmsway is hanging up his smock in the short hallway that leads from
      the press room to an elevator. there's a sink in the room.

                              harmsway
                 it's funny, mr. bond. of all the
                 things i own, nothing gives me as
                 much enjoyment as my newspapers.

      he moves to the sink to wash his hands. turns on the faucets:

                              harmsway (cont'd)
                 ironic, isn't it? in the age of tv, i
                 still can't get the ink out of my veins.

      bond smiles wryly, looking at harmsway hunched over the sink:

                              bond
                 yes... a man with ink in his veins,
                 and blood on his hands.

      harmsway smiles to himself, acknowledging the jibe... but decides to
      ignore it. he turns off the faucet, dries his hands -

                              harmsway
                 we print 31 newspapers here; another
                 two-hundred-and-seventy at satellite
                 plants around the world.

      he pulls on his Â£2000 saville row suit-jacket.

                              bond
                 ... and how many of those newspapers
                 carried paris harmsway's obituary?

      harmsway turns, and presses the elevator button. the doors open,
      instantly. he smiles:

                              harmsway
                 all of them, mister bond...
                       (motioning inside)
                 after you?
