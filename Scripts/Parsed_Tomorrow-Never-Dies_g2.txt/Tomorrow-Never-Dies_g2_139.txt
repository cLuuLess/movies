      ext. terrace set-back - twilight -

      stamper jumps back from the ledge, enraged. ax in hand, he moves to
      the window washing rig's machinery -

      and takes a roundhouse swing at the unspooling cable - but instead of
      cutting it, the ax bounces off, and the rig slides on its tracks.

      the rig - (still descending) -

      swings! sidney screams - almost falling out. bond grabs her. they
      are now 5 stories directly above the sky bridge, swaying like a giant
      pendulum - although still descending.

      return on stamper - terrace set-back - 72nd floor - twilight -

      having failed at the cable, stamper goes at the pulley feeding it.
      he swings. swings again. with each blow, the pulley shaft weakens.

      bond and sidney - (window washer's rig) -

      dropping in violent spurts - just trying to stay in the damn bucket.

      stamper - wielding the ax -

      finally, the pulley shaft shatters. the cable grinds to a halt.

      bond and sidney -

      are stopped about 20 feet above the sky bridge.

                              sidney
                       (panicked, anxious, fast)
                 what now? and don't give me some
                 movie clich√© like 'trust me.'

                              bond
                       (what the hell)
                 trust me.

      and with this, he turns, and shoots out the adjacent window.

                              bond
                 let's go -

      but as he starts to climb out - sidney screams! the cable suddenly
      drops them 10 feet lower, below the window.

      the terrace set-back -

      stamper whacks away at the side of the cable drum. it's coming loose
      from its moorings.

      bond and sidney -

      look down at the curved glass top of the sky bridge - facing what
      (she thinks) is certain death:

                              sidney
                 we're going to bounce off that thing!

      bond looks up - assuming they have only seconds left before stamper
      cuts the cable. he grabs her:

                              bond
                 hold on!

      terrace set-back - 72nd floor - twilight -

      stamper takes a final swing at the cable drum. with a great clat-
      tering sound it snaps free of the moorings, smashes into the wall,
      and the whole mechanism careens over the side of the building.

      the window washer's rig -

      bond and sidney feel the cable give way. they start to free-fall.

      bond - fires his machine pistol at the glass top of the sky bridge.

      the bullets shatter the glass -

      bond and sidney crash through, into -
