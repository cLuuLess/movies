      int. harmsway's cabin -

      the windows rattle as bond's chopper thunders by. perplexed,
      harmsway stands, opens the porthole curtains. he cranes his neck,
      but sees nothing. he presses an intercom button:

                              harmsway
                 what the hell is going on?
