      ext. coastal inlet - marshland - strait of malacca - day

      the sea king comes in above several police cars and boats. bond
      jumps the last ten feet, and the chopper peels off.

                              male voice (o.s.)
                 yo! jimbo!

      bond turns to look: it's jack wade.

                              bond
                 wade, what the hell are you doing here?

                              wade
                 i am not here, ol' buddy. the cia has
                 absolutely no knowledge of the
                 missing ship, the missing gold, where
                 it was going, or when it left hong
                 kong.

                              bond
                 that's reassuring.

                              wade
                 hey - the world is my office.

                              bond
                 let's take a look at the body.

      as bond moves off, wade sniffs the air, savoring the aroma:

                              wade
                 smells like... coffee plants.

      new angle -

      a policemen pulls a white sheet from the body. (we don't see it.)
      bond and wade look down at something gruesome:

                              wade
                 colorful... shark attack?

      bond shakes his head grimly.

                              bond
                 i don't think so. the veins are
                 cauterized - as if they were sealed
                 by heat...
                       (beat, confounded)
                 but there are no burn marks on the
                 flesh. it doesn't make sense.
                       (to the policeman)
                 who found the body?

                              police officer
                       (points to)
                 dato. local fisherman. says it came
                 in with the tide early this morning.

                              bond
                 ask him if it could have washed in
                 from the west side of the strait.

      the policeman has an animated conversation with fisherman. then:

                              policeman
                 no. he says it's not possible. the
                 current could have only brought the
                 body in from the east.

                              bond
                       (to wade)
                 you have a boat?

                              wade
                 i don't know if you'd call it a boat...

                              bond
                 something with an engine? not oars?

                              wade
                 step into my office.
