      int. dockside cafe -

      bond meets with signore digiacomo, a middle-aged italian intelligence
      official in shirtsleeves. two underlings hover in the background.

                              bond
                 you've confirmed all the legal
                 details with m?

                              digiacomo
                 si. bueno. she's very...
                 'competent.' ...for a woman.

                              bond
                 let's go over this one more time.

                              digiacomo
                 you will investigate the boat.
                 you'll signal us if you find the
                 enriched uranium. and then -
                       (distracted)
                 pardon.

      he looks at a woman who has appeared with a baby in her arms.

                              italian woman w/baby
                 don franco. i just want to say we're
                 voting for you in the election.

                              digiacomo
                       (teasing, re: the baby)
                 both of you?

                              italian woman w/baby
                       (laughs)
                 of course.

                              digiacomo
                 grazie, grazie. ciao.

      she leaves. he turns back bond:

                              digiacomo
                 so. you'll signal us if you find the
                 uranium -

                              bond
                 and you'll wait until after the press
                 conference - and everyone is gone -
                 before you board the boat and arrest
                 him.

                              digiacomo
                 perfecto. then we turn him over to you,
                 and the english government puts him on a
                 military transport back to london.

      bond nods, looks over at the sea dolphin ii.

                              digiacomo
                 do not worry, my friend. i only want
                 what is best. for both of us.

      bond stands to leave. digiacomo smiles after 007 - as if he's
      savoring some private secret. he snaps his fingers to an underling:

                              digiacomo
                 rocco! un cappuccino!

      the sea dolphin ii -

      as bond makes his way up the gangplank -

      elliot harmsway is holding a press conference near the bow, surround-
      ed by dignitaries. he is a man with an evil euphoria - showing off
      all the charm and charisma that's made him one of the world's most
      powerful media tycoons.

                              harmsway
                 ...and so, it's somewhat fitting that
                 we are here today... to christen this
                 environmental research boat in venice -
                 - 'venezia' - the port where marco
                 polo sailed forth to explore the
                 world's great uncharted oceans...
                       (beat)
                 that 2/3 of the earth's surface where
                 the sharks are not working members of
                 the press.

      laughter. bond studies the man. harmsway continues, pointing to a
      large drill/boring object, the size of a jet engine, attached to a
      long flexible hose/tube.

                              harmsway
                 with our six custom designed sea-bed
                 coring drills, we will probe the
                 long-term effects of pollution; our
                 sonars, radars, and research labs
                 will study the wind, the water, and
                 the sea life that so dearly feeds us.

      bond moves through the crowd. he spots a bulkhead, with a door.

                              harmsway
                 and so, in the spirit of international
                 cooperation - thanking my good friend,
                 valentin zukofsky - the newly elected
                 president of the ukraine for all his
                 assistance -

      he motions to zukofsky, who nods to the audience...

                              harmsway
                 i give this boat to mankind - selflessly
                 - in pure charity asking nothing for
                 myself... but the cable tv rights.

      big laugh from the assemblage. harmsway turns to a beauty queen:

                              harmsway
                 miss venice? if you'll do the honors -

      smash! she cracks a champagne bottle on the tip of the bow. cheers!

                              harmsway
                 now i'll take some questions from the
                 press - even the few of you who
                 aren't on my payroll.

      laughter. harmsway points to a reporter:

                              reporter #1
                 mr. harmsway: why did you name this
                 boat the sea dolphin ii?

                              harmsway
                 actually, my first choice was 'no
                 comment.' so if someone asked where
                 i was, i could truthfully respond 'no
                 comment.'
                       (laughter; he points)
                 over there.

                              reporter #2
                 sir elliot: is it true you're in
                 negotiations to move your offices
                 from hong kong to kuala lumpur?

                              harmsway
                       (impishly)
                 no comment.

      amidst more laughter, bond disappears into the bulkhead door.
