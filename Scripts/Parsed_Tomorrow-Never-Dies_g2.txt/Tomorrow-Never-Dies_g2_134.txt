      ext. 72nd floor - terrace setback - twilight -

      it's magic hour as bond and sidney rush out onto the setback. bond
      sees a window washer's rig. and although sidney asks -

                              sidney
                 now what?

      bond's first concern is to make sure stamper can't get them. amidst
      a pile of construction equipment, he spots a pneumatic nail gun. he
      grabs it, and -

      bang. bang. bang. he fires 3 nails through the door into the frame.

                              bond
                 that should buy us some time.

      now, bond moves to the window washer's rig - a two-man bucket-like
      scaffold on tracks, with two leather safety harnesses inside, and a
      large cable spool/motor that stays on the roof.

      approaching it, bond looks over the side:

      bond's pov - looking down from 72nd floor -

      twenty stories below is the sky bridge. 50 stories below that, the
      ground. it's a long, long, way down.

      return on bond - at the window washer's rig - terrace set-back -

                              bond
                 help me move this.
