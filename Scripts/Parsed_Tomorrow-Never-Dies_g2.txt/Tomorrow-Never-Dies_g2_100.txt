      int. bridge - salvage barge - day

      we're back in bond-land: a high-tech control room, with lots of
      monitors and white-suited technicians. bond and wade are pushed
      through the-door, followed by taro and the two goons.

                              taro
                 here they are, captain.

      the "captain" turns from a monitor: it's sidney.

                              sidney
                 just give me one goad reason - mister
                 bond, from lloyds of london - why i
                 shouldn't kill both of you, burn your
                 boat, and use your bodies for shark bait.

                              wade
                       (chirping up)
                 so you two know each other!?! small
                 world, ain't it? what happened?
                 commitment problems?

                              sidney
                 who is he?

                              bond
                 sidney winch, meet -

                              wade
                 jack wade. citibank. commercial
                 loan division. if you're ever lookin'
                 for a sweet refinance on the boat -

                              sidney
                 - shut up!

                              bond
                       (to wade)
                 you have to excuse miss winch: she
                 thinks she's on a 'seduce and
                 destroy' mission through life...
                       (pauses)
                 ...but she won't kill us.

                              sidney
                 no?

                              bond
                 no. first, because i don't think
                 it's in your nature. and second,
                 because there's no gold down there.

                              sidney
                 so charming! so suave!
                       (beat)
                 don't insult me. i'm not one of your
                 'little london girls' who falls for
                 the lies.

                              wade
                 so it was commitment!

                              sidney
                 every wharf-rat from here to hong kong
                 knows what's on that boat and i'm
                 claiming it. one-third of that gold is
                 mine.

                              bond
                 that's fine, but - even a little
                 london girl knows that one third of
                 nothing is still nothing.

      there's a flicker of doubt in her eyes. she turns to taro:

                              sidney
                 was he carrying anything?

      taro holds up the bond's diving belt, indicating 'nothing'. angrily:

                              sidney
                 search him.

      the men look at bond - wearing only swim trunks. nobody moves.

                              sidney
                 do i have to do everything around here?

                              bond
                 i hope so.

      frowning, sidney moves to bond. as she reaches into his trunks, we
      cut to their faces. their eyes are locked on each other:

                              bond
                 i hope you'll be gentle.

                              sidney
                 think about mom.

      bond winces. she's goosed him.

                              bond
                 ... unusual technique.

      returning to the wide shot, she opens the sack. shows the gold:

                              sidney
                 and what do you call this?

                              bond
                 - the family jewels?

      she scowls, takes out the uranium tooth. looks at it, blankly, and
      holds it out to a technician, who examines it.

                              sidney
                 what is this?

                              technician
                 ...i don't know. i'm not sure -

      just then, a crewman bursts in:

                              crewman
                 boss! we got company - comin' up off
                 the starboard bow!

                              sidney
                       (exiting, to taro)
                 bring them.

      taro motions with his uzi for bond and wade to follow...

      but bond hesitates, looking back at the technician with the uranium.
      007 wants to get it, but taro nudges him out with the gun muzzle.
