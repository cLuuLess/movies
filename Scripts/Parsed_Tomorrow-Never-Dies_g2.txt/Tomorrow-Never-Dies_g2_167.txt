      ext. the sea dolphin ii - (aerial - south china sea) - day

      the hnn boat has pulled alongside the sea dolphin ii. the gang from
      the nuke plant is boarding the larger boat.

      (note: from the air, we should notice that the "gold hold" is now
      covered by a steel hatch, and the biggest worm is stored in the open,
      hanging from a steel boom.)

      the deck -

      coming up the ladder first, harmsway is greeted by the captain.

                              harmsway
                 any news?

                              the captain
                 the call just went out on the hong
                 kong police radio: fire at the power
                 plant.

                              harmsway
                       (ironically)
                 alert the media!

      stamper and sidney have climbed onto the deck.

                              stamper
                 what do you want me to do with her?

                              sidney
                 - can't we make a deal? i won't say
                 anything -

                              harmsway
                       (touching her cheek)
                 you're so cute, my dear.
                       (beat)
                 but i'm afraid not.
                       (to one of the cameramen)
                 put her in the storage room.

      the cameraman takes her away. harmsway turns to the captain:

                              harmsway (cont'd)
                 we'll get rid of her when we're in
                 international waters.
                       (then)
                 set sail, full speed, due south.
                 i'll be in my cabin. let me know
                 when mr. yung arrives. we'll break
                 out the champagne.
