      int./ext. bond's mig -

      fighting against the garrote, bond strains to reach a red button on
      the panel: copilot ejector seat.

      bond finally taps it, and - the back half of the canopy blows off!

      the copilot blasts out of the plane, downward, directly into mig-2's
      cockpit. bond peels off.

      for a second, mig-2 hangs in the air. until... boom!!! the two heat
      seeking missiles blast it to smithereens.

      back in mig-1, bond fiddles with the radio.

      mi-6 - situation room -

                              bond's voice
                 seven to base. i have a full
                 house. your bid.

      the situation room erupts in cheers.

      return on bond in the mig -

                              bond
                 by the way: thank the general for all
                 his "assistance." over and out.
