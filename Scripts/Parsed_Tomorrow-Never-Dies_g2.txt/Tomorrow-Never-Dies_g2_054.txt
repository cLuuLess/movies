      the ship is moving towards a dark vertical shape - harmsway's sea-bed
      core boring drill (shorthand "the worm',) attached to a long flexible
      dredging pipe.

      motionless, hanging in the water. then the monster awakes: a metal
      sphere retracts, revealing a wide angle camera lens.
