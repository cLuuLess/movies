      ext. the sea dolphin ii/harbor - day

      bond rushes down the gangplank, along the dock. jumps in a gondola.

                              bond
                 the danielli. presto!

      return on the metallurgy lab -

      harmsway closes the door. yung is there.

                              yung
                 that was too close.

                              harmsway
                 don't worry. mr. bond will get the
                 message. so will his boss.

      harmsway presses a button - and suddenly the red box lifts, and a
      second red box appears underneath it, like shuffling a deck of cards.

                              harmsway

                 captain to set sail at once.
