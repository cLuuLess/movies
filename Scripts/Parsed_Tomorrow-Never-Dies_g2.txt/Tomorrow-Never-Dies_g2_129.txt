      int. stairwell - (on the other side of the building) -

      stamper, running up steps with the guard. they exit into:

      a short service hallway - 71st. floor -

      they rush though it, bursting through a door into:

      the elevator bank hallway -

      stamper and the guard start hunting bond.

      return on sidney (hallway/kitchen) -

      as she continues to exchange fire with the guards...

      bond, (having broken the toner cartridge open,) is dumping the toner
      in a coffee can. he reaches for a box of sugar

                              bond
                 one second -

      and (with gunfire sfx over,) bond sweeps the broken dish into the
      can, and drops his q lighter in the mix.

      he moves to sidney, in the doorway. kneels. in-between shots:

                              bond
                 ... how did you get into marine
                 salvage?

                              sidney
                       (gun burst, then)
                 my father left me the business.

      bond glances at his watch, timing the bomb. the guards shoot; she
      shoots back, then explains:

                              sidney
                 i used to be a divorce lawyer in new
                 york city.

      bond nods, continuing to look at his watch. glances at her:

                              bond
                 not a lot of difference.

                              sidney
                 what do you mean?

      bond reaches forward to toss the coffee can -

                              bond
                 either way, you're taking the goods
                 from dead hulks.

      he tosses the can, and pulls her backwards, covering her.

      new angle - the hallway -

      the guards spring from the door, rushing forward to storm bond's
      position - just as the coffee can rolls towards them, and explodes.

      return on bond and sidney in the kitchen -

                              bond
                 let's go -

      taking the gun, the two of them start for the door when -

      new angle - opposite end of the hallway - corner -

      stamper and the guard have arrived at the corner, blasting.

      return on bond and sidney in the kitchen -

                              bond
                 damn!

      swiftly, bond grabs a jug of cleaner from under the sink, moves to
      the door, and rolls it down the hall in stamper's direction.

      stamper and the guard - (hallway corner) -

      anticipate a bomb. they move back.

      bond and sidney (int. kitchen) -

                              sidney
                 what the hell does that do?

                              bond
                 cleans dirt. let's go.
