      int. metallurgy lab - sea dolphin ii -

      harmsway holds court near the red box. bond squeezes in.

                              harmsway
                 i believe this is what you're looking
                 for, colonel.

      he opens the red box. hoists out a canister.

                              harmsway
                 is it uranium? absolutely. but watch -
                       (runs the geiger counter over it)
                 it's depleted uranium! completely
                 safe! a child could sleep on it.

      bond can't believe what he's seeing. digiacomo is mortified.

                              harmsway
                 i received it from the russian
                 government - a by-product of their
                 nuclear arms program - in the hopes
                 that i could create tools for
                 oceanographic research.
                       (beat)
                 it's what i was talking about:
                 'swords into plowshares'! the sprit
                 of international cooperation!

                              digiacomo
                 signore harmsway. a thousand apologies.
                       (snaps his fingers to a lackey:)
                 give him the video tape.

                              harmsway
                 please. no harm done, don franco. go
                 upstairs, and enjoy the reception.

      as the room empties, he calls -

                              harmsway
                 oh - mr. bond. one minute.

      bond approaches him. they're the only people in the room.

                              harmsway
                 i hope you've enjoyed this little charade.

                              bond
                 which part? the colonel's? or yours?

                              harmsway
                       (icily)
                 a piece of advice, mr. bond: don't
                 screw with a man who buys ink by the
                 ton.
                       (beat)
                 it's deadlier than uranium.

                              bond
                       (staring him down)
                 we'll see about that.

      harmsway glances at his watch. smiles coldly.

                              harmsway
                 aren't you late for a meeting?
