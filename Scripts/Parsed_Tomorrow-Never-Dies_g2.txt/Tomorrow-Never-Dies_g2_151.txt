      int. bond's car - (moving) -

      bond glances at the rearview mirror. sees the hum-vees. presses
      another switch -

      close on bond's exhaust pipe -

      whoosh! a missile blasts out, trailing smoke as it hones in on -

      the first hum-vee.

      boom! it's decimated.

      angle on harmsway - on his radio -

                              harmsway
                 seal the garage! cut the power!
                 he's got no headlamps!
