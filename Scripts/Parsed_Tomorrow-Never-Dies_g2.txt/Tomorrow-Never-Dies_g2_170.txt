      int. helicopter - flying -

      bond checks the compass, and adjusts his course. the compass swings
      due south.

      bond's pov -

      the helicopter clears the island: bright blue sea ahead. bond sees
      then passes over - the hnn boat, bobbing empty in the water...

      then, further ahead, he spots the stern of sea dolphin ii, shimmering
      in the instance.

      rear deck - sea dolphin ii -

      looking north, off the back of the boat stamper and a crewman see the
      helicopter - a tiny speck in the air.

                              stamper
                 there it is.

      stamper lifts a pair of binoculars for confirmation.

      stamper's pov - through the binoculars -

      he sees two figures in the cockpit.

      return to scene -

      stamper picks up his radio:

                              stamper
                 it's him. they both made it.

      the bridge -

      the captain replies:

                              the captain
                 i'll tell sir elliot.

      harmsway's cabin -

      harmsway is working at a computer. a chime sounds.

                              harmsway
                 yes?

                              captain's voice
                 he's approaching from the north, sir.

                              crewman
                 fantastic. invite the crew on deck
                 to celebrate, and i'll be up in a few
                 minutes.
