      ext. malacca strait - day

      a british naval cutter is pulling alongside the barge - sea siren
      wailing, crew members in battle gear, forward gatling gun manned.

                              captain morton
                       (on bullhorn)
                 attention sea barge: lay down your
                 weapons, and prepare to be boarded.

      on the barge - sidney and co. stand, weapons ready.

                              captain morton
                 repeat: lay down your weapons, and
                 prepare to be boarded.

      bond turns to sidney, who's grabbed a bullhorn of her own.

                              bond
                 if i were you -

                              sidney
                 - you're not.

                              bond
                       (as she hoists the bullhorn)
                 just remember: they think there's ten
                 billion dollars in gold down there.

                              sidney
                 thank you.
                       (clicks it on, and:)
                 "now hear this: drop dead."

      bond and wade exchange an amused/helpless glance - as if they both
      know what's coming next. there's a pause, then -

      the cruiser's gatling gun erupts with an eardrum-shattering salvo.
      it's only a warning shot, but -

      everyone on the barge dives for the deck... except for bond and
      wade, who might as well be having tea. bond looks down at taro,
      cowering on the boards.

                              bond
                 gatling gun beats uzi.

      new angle - (cutter/barge) - day

      an armed boarding party is coming across an aluminum bridge that has
      extended from the cutter onto the barge.

                              captain morton
                       (a tiny popinjay)
                 who's in charge here?

                              sidney
                 i am. what do you want?

                              captain morton
                 you have precisely one minute to pull
                 up your anchor and be under way.

                              sidney
                 forget it. no way. i got here first.

                              captain morton
                       (ignoring her)
                 who's wade?

                              wade
                 that would be me -

                              captain morton
                       (snidely)
                 thanks for your message.
                       (turns to)
                 and you're bond?

                              bond
                 yes -

                              captain morton
                 guard! arrest these men! escort
                 them to the cutter!

      bond and wade are stunned. the marines move in. bond struggles -

                              bond
                 wait a minute -

                              captain morton
                 get them out of here. if he says one
                 word, shoot him.

      as two marines with automatic rifles take bond and wade across the
      folding bridge -

                              sidney
                       (demanding)
                 what's your name?

                              captain morton
                 captain morton.

      pause. she expects him to ask "and yours?" but he doesn't.

                              sidney
                 my name is sidney winch, and -

                              captain morton
                 good for you, miss winch. you now
                 have exactly 30 seconds to get this
                 rust bucket out of here.

                              sidney
                       (furiously)
                 i know my rights. these are
                 international waters. the british
                 navy abandoned that boat, and i'm
                 claiming it. under international
                 law, i have the right to salvage
                 what's on that wreck.

                              captain morton
                 fifteen seconds. perhaps you should
                 consider hiring an attorney.

                              sidney
                 i was an attorney!

                              captain morton
                 hmmm. i suppose this is a step above
                 that profession.
                       (beat)
                 ten seconds. are you leaving?

                              sidney
                 no.

                              captain morton
                 you leave me no alternative.

                              captain morton
                       (upholstering a walkie-talkie)
                 cut her anchor.

      as sidney yells "no!" - the forward gatling gun erupts to life. one
      short, bone rattling burst cuts the chain.

                              sidney
                 you won't get away with this!

                              captain morton
                       (stepping onto the bridge)
                 good-day, miss winch. i advise you
                 to get some steam up - before you run
                 aground.

      as she floats away, sidney calls out to the captain, bond and wade:

                              sidney
                 you bastards! believe me - you
                 haven't heard the last of me!
