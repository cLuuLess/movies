      int. sky bridge - twilight -

      stamper lands on bridge. he unbuckles his harness, runs to railing,
      looks down and sees sidney and bond climbing out onto the balcony,
      going for the press room door.

                              stamper
                       (into his radio)
                 they're heading for the press room.
                 stop them!
