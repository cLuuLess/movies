      int. stairwell -

      darting up the few steps, stamper and guards arrive at the door. he
      tries to open it. won't budge.

                              guard
                 i'll call for a battering ram -

                              stamper
                 no. get the fire ax.

      one of the guards grabs it from inside a fire cabinet. he hands the
      ax to stamper, who takes the first swing at the door.

      return on bond - terrace set-back - ext. 72nd floor - twilight -

      bond is positioning the window washer rig. he explains:

                              bond
                 we'll go down close to the sky bridge.
                 we may be able to swing over and use it
                 for cover.

      as bond climbs into the bucket, sidney peers over the side.

                              sidney
                 no way. i sail. i do not fly.

      bang! behind them, stamper's ax has just penetrated the door.

                              bond
                 ... sometimes, you just have to take
                 the plunge.

      bond yanks her in, flips switches on the control pod, and starts
      down, as fast as they can go.
