      int. hallway -

      bond and sidney break for the staircase door. (where the first guards
      were shooting at them from.) twisting around, bond lets a burst go
      in stamper's direction, as he stoops to scoop up one of the dead
      guards' mac-l0's.

      insert - bond's bullets rip up the jug of cleaner.

      bond and sidney escape from the hallway -

      stamper -

      cowers, waiting for the jug to blow up... then realizes:

                              stamper
                 it's a trick! after him.
                       (into his radio, on the run)
                 they're in the south stairwell!

      harmsway, in the security center -

                              harmsway
                 get more men up there!
