      int. conference room - bank of london - night

      admiral roebuck glares as minister johnstone enters to address m,
      tanner, a treasury official, and various uniforms and suits.

                              minister johnstone
                 good evening. i've just spoken with
                 the prime minister at the economic
                 summit in tokyo; he's expecting a
                 full update within the hour.
                       (beat)
                 for those of you still unaware, some
                 forty minutes ago -

                              admiral roebuck
                       (interrupting)
                 excuse me, but -
                       (all turn to him:)
                 i must formally protest this meeting.
                 given the nature of what's occurred -
                 and the need for secrecy - i see no
                 reason to involve the air force, the
                 army, or mi-6.
                       (beat, as m and tanner exchange a look)
                 this is an internal affair that should
                 be handled strictly by the officers of
                 her majesty's royal navy.

                              minister johnstone
                       (furious)
                 admiral, are you suggesting -

      he's distracted by the click of a door opening. all turn to see bond
      entering, wearing a full naval uniform. m stifles a smile.

                              bond
                 sorry i'm late -

                              m
                 actually, you're just in time.
                       (she turns to)
                 admiral roebuck: you know commander
                 bond, don't you?

                              admiral roebuck
                       (deflated)
                 yes. of course.

                              bond
                 i've looked forward to meeting you.

      bond sits. m glances at johnstone as if to say "proceed."

                              minister johnstone
                 as i was saying: approximately forty-
                 five minutes ago, we received an abandon
                 ship signal from the h.m.s. indomitable.
                       (flicks on a map display)
                 looking at these infrared satellite
                 images - provided by mr. tanner of
                 mi-6 -the ship is presumed lost here,
                 just south of kuala lumpur, where she
                 broadcast her last position.

                                                                  cut to:
