      the doors close. bond clocks the security camera in the ceiling.
      harmsway is about to take great delight in making bond squirm:

                              harmsway
                 before i became involved with paris,
                 she was always involved with the most
                 inappropriate' men...
                       (beat)
                 playboys. thrill seekers. middle
                 aged peter pans who only brought out
                 the worst in her.

                              bond
                 i see.

                              harmsway
                 i tried to save her. but she remained a
                 manic depressive: fits, inappropriate
                 behavior... delusions of grandeur.

                              bond
                 i wonder if it runs in the family.

                              harmsway
                       (bursts out in a laugh)
                 the only difference between a
                 psychopath and a genius, mr. bond, is
                 the degree of success.

      he looks up at the digital readout, going from 40 to 50.

                              harmsway
                 still, i do miss her. i only wish
                 she could have lived to see all this.

                              bond
                 i can feel your pain.

      the doors open:

                              harmsway
                 by the way - what is it that brings
                 you to kuala lumpur, mister bond?

                              bond
                 sightseeing.
