      ext. deck - the cutter - day -

      bond, wade and the captain.

                              wade
                 - nice trick with the arrest. very convincing.

                              captain morton
                 it's no trick, mr. wade. i've got
                 half a mind to throw both of you in
                 the brig.

                              bond
                 don't you think you're overreacting?

                              captain morton
                       (with great sarcasm)
                 yes. the famous james bond. i've heard
                 all about you, sir. you were under
                 direct orders to act as an observer -
                 and yet you had to go off, on your own,
                 like some half-assed cia cowboy -
                       (wade reacts)
                 endangering the gold, attracting that
                 lunatic woman, and then putting in a
                 distress call for us to save your
                 bloody hide.

                              bond
                       (calmly)
                 ...that's all well and good, captain,
                 save for one thing:
                       (beat)
                 there's no gold down there.

                              captain morton
                 what are you talking about? we went
                 through all this and the ship isn't
                 even down there?

                              bond
                 yes, the ship is down there. but the
                 gold is gone.

                              captain morton
                 that's absurd! it took two squads of
                 forty men fifteen days to load that
                 gold.

                              bond
                 i know what i saw -

                              captain
                 i don't care what you think you saw.
                 you're a damned amateur.
                       (beat)
                 just get off my ship. go back to
                 your trench-coats and your code names
                 - and leave the job to professionals.

                              bond
                       (exchanges a glance with wade, then)
                 aye-aye, captain.
