      int. conference room - bank of england - night

      the bloodletting and recriminations have begun. this plays fast:

                              minister johnstone
                       (incredulous)
                 one-third of the british gold reserves?!?
                       (beat)
                 what kind of idiot loses -
                       (looks to the treasury officer)
                 what is it? the equivalent of ten
                 billion us dollars???

                              treasury official
                       (sheepishly)
                 give or take. depending on today's
                 currency rates -

                              minister johnstone
                       (ignoring him)
                 what the hell was the gold doing on
                 that boat?

                              admiral roebuck
                 we were bringing it back from hong
                 kong. under orders from the treasury.

                              treasury official
                 during the cold war, we stored a
                 third in america, and another third
                 in hong kong - in case of a nuclear
                 attack. and with the turn-over of
                 hong kong to the chinese -

                              minister johnstone
                 why wasn't the ship protected?!?!
                 why was it sailing without radar?

                              admiral roebuck
                 i resent your tone, sir. i have men
                 who are missing -

                              minister johnstone
                 and i have the entire british economy
                 to worry about.

                              bond
                       (breaking in)
                 minister -
                       (all turn to him)
                 obviously, mi-6 was not involved in
                 this operation. but i have to defend
                 the admiral.

      roebuck looks at bond with great surprise. bond continues:

                              bond (cont'd)
                 electronic silence was the safest way
                 to move that gold. otherwise, any
                 country - or individual - with the
                 crudest missile could just lock onto
                 our signals, and take out the boat.
                       (beat)
                 that's what happened to the sheffield
                 in the falklands.
                       (beat)
                 since then, it's standard operating
                 procedure for any sensitive shipment.

                              minister johnstone
                       (frowns)
                 at least we know where the gold is.
                 when are the recovery ships due?

                              admiral roebuck
                 36 hours. they've already sailed
                 from the persian gulf.

                              minister johnstone
                 i expect to have that gold recovered
                 in 36 hours. until then, i'm
                 imposing my own electronic silence:
                 for the sake of the economy, not a
                 word to nato, the press, the cia.
                       (beat, looking at:)
                 ...and so long as commander bond here
                 seems to be such an expert on these
                 matters, i want him to go along as an
                 observer. are we agreed?

                              roebuck
                 yes.

                              bond
                 yes.

                              m
                 as you wish.
