      ext. mid-ship - deck -

      stamper bounces himself, handing out automatic weapons from an arms
      cache hidden inside a dinghy.

      the two cameramen take their m-16's and rush forward, jumping up on
      some machinery to climb onto -

      the roof of the bridge -

      they rush forward, and assume positions shooting at bond.

      angle on the helicopter -

      taking hits. bond pivots and turns the chopper, heading straight for
      them.

      bond's pov - (int. helicopter) -

      the men turn, and start to run as the chopper chases them -

      close on the chopper's landing skids -

      bond hooks both of them with the skids, by the back of their untucked
      shirts!!!!   the man are flailing like crazy as -

      bond pulls back on the cyclic pitch lever -

      the helicopter rears backwards, and up -

      and the men burst through their shirt buttons, falling, shirtless,
      into the sea.
