      int. harbor master office - port klang - day

      the local malay harbor master puts a stack of charts on the counter.

                              harbor master
                 wind, tide, currents... you're the
                 second person today asked for a full
                 set of charts.
                       (holds out a clipboard)
                 if you'd just sign here -

      bond takes the clipboard -

      insert clipboard - read signature: sidney winch.

                 thanks.
                       (apparent afterthought)
                 by the way - was there anything
                 strange the night before last? odd
                 weather, lost boats - ??

                              harbor master
                 no... unless you're talking about
                 the bus problem.

                              bond
                 ...bus problem?

                              harbor master
                 captain cheong's ferry was late. he
                 runs the line across the strait
                 between here and sumatra. the lumber
                 mill workers coming back for the
                 weekend missed the last bus. slept
                 on the docks. hundreds of them.

                              bond
                 thanks.
