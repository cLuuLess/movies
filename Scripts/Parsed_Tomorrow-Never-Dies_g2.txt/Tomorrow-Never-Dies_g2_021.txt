      int. hallway - outside jenny's office - oxford -

      bond and jenny wu emerge from the office. (she's still in the gown.)
      they pass a flock of young students:

                              student
                 good afternoon, professor wu.

                              jenny wu
                 good afternoon.
                       (then to bond)
                 are you sure you can't stay for the
                 lecture?

                              bond
                 i can't. but i did enjoy the dress
                 rehearsal.

      she gives him a wry glance, opens a door to a lecture hall.

                              jenny wu
                 tsi tien, mr. bond.

                              bond
                 tsi tien, professor wu.

      she exits; bond walks off, passing underneath a wall mounted tv set.

      on the tv set - the hnn globe logo - the harmsway news network -
      spins into view, followed by:
