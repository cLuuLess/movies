      ext. sport fishing boat, flying bridge - day -

      wade at the helm; bond next to him, near sonar, holding q's map.

                              bond
                 slow down. we're close.

      wade pulls back on the throttle.

      aerial - (sport fishing boat/strait of malacca) - day -

      the boat starts a wide turn -

      new angle - (sport fishing boat/rock outcropping/strait) - day -

      and we're back at the outcropping where the indomitable sank. the
      sport fishing boat is trolling against a background of sandy beaches
      and the lush green hills of sumatra.

      flying bridge -

      wade scans the shore; bond studies the sonar display.

                              wade
                 i dunno, jimbo. it can't be out
                 here. how could they get this far
                 off course?

                              bond
                       (concentrating on the sonar)
                 who knows? fog, night...

                              wade
                 they'd never sail this close to the shore.

                              bond
                 wait a minute -
                       (beat, pointing to the
                        screen)
                 i've got it. there! off the port bow!

      insert sonar screen -

      the murky electronic outline of a ship.

      back to scene -

      bond watches the sonar screen. wade slows engines, consults charts.

                              bond
                 cut the engines! it's about two-
                 hundred fifty feet down.

                                                              jump cut to:

      an anchor being pitched into the water - (bow of sport fishing boat) -

      by wade. bond is strapping on his scuba tank.

                              wade
                 two-fifty's pretty deep for air. you
                 should really be using mixed gases.

      bond glances at the air gauge on his tanks.

                              bond
                 i'll make a bounce dive. if i can
                 keep my bottom time short, i'll be
                 all right.

      bond gathers up flares, and sits on the gunwale.

                              bond
                       (only half teasing)
                 keep your eye out for pirates.

      wade pulls back his shirt to reveal two six-shooters.

                              wade
                 i got you covered.

                              bond
                 that's reassuring.

      bond rolls backward into the water and disappears.

      underwater -

      bond swims to the anchor line, and begins pulling himself downward,
      handover-hand, deeper and deeper into a monochromatic gloom.

      underwater bottom -

      bond touches down by the anchor; his fins kick up the sandy bottom.
      checking his wrist compass, he sets off through a rocky channel.
