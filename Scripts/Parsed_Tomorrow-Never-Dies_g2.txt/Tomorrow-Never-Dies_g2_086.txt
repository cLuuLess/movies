      ext. 'the running dog' cigarette boat - strait of malacca - day -

      smashing through the water at breakneck speed. wade and bond yell
      over the engines.

                              wade
                 what do you want with the harbor master?

                              bond
                 tide and current charts. work
                 backward from the body - find where
                 the ship sank.
                       (wade nods appreciatively)
                 where did you get the boat?

                              wade
                 seized it from a guy smuggling
                 computer chips out of bangkok.
                       (beat)
                 should have seen his rose garden:
                 blooms the size of hand grenades.

      bond looks at wade: the man remains, forever deranged.
