      int. helicopter - flying - day -

      bond is about two miles out from the stern of the sea dolphin ii.
      maybe 500' in the air.

      taking the machine pistol from the dead guard's lap, he opens the
      small pilot's window, and balances it on his knees. ahead, he sees:

      bond's pov - deck - sea dolphin ii -

      the crewmen are lining up on either side of the landing pad, near the
      ship's railings.

      return on bond -

      ready for war. he pushes the cyclic pitch lever forward, and the
      bell jetranger goes into a screaming descent.

      the deck/helicopter landing pad

      champagne bottles pop. stamper is with a crewman, who looks up at
      the chopper, about 1000' off the stern:

                              crewman
                 he seems to be coming in awfully fast.

      stamper picks up his binoculars.

      stamper's pov - through the binoculars -

      he sees bond.

      return to scene -

                              stamper
                 get the guns! it's not him! it's
                 bond!!!

      he might have also added "it's too late," as -

      new angle - rear deck of the boat/helicopter -

      bond swoops in low on the port side of the boat, firing his gun from
      the pilot's window, and using the chopper's blades to threaten the
      men on deck.

      about half of them dive into the water for safety, only to be quickly
      left behind.

      flying up the port side toward the front of the boat, bond passes -
