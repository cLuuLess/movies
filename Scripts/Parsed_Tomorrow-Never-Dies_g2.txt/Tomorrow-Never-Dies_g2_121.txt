      int. elevator - day

      sidney presses the button for "1". bond glances at the floor indi-
      cator with reads "55" - clocks the security camera - and starts
      looking for an escape panel. sidney watches out of the corner of her
      eye, thinking he's nuts.

                              bond
                       (glancing at the security camera)
                 ... do you have a gun?

                              sidney
                 what?

                              bond
                       (yanking it down)
                 you heard me. a gun?
                       (disabling it)
                 i left mine in the car.

                              sidney
                 that's funny: you struck me as the kind
                 of man who always carries protection.

                              bond
                 listen to me! i'm a british secret
                 service agent. and we have about two
                 minutes before harmsway kills both of us.

      he glances up at the escape panel at the rear of the car.

                              sidney
                 has anyone ever suggested that you're
                 a paranoid psychotic?

      bond ignores the insult, explaining as he moves under the panel:

                              bond
                 harmsway sank that ship and stole the
                 gold. it's on the sea dolphin ii.
                       (boosting himself up)
                 and thanks to your little show and tell -
                       (straining to open the panel)
                 - giving him the evidence -
                       (popping it open)
                 we're the only ones who can tie him
                 to the crime.

                              sidney
                 elliot harmsway is my uncle!

                              bond
                 blood or dutch?

                              sidney
                 he was my father's best friend!

                              bond
                 he's killed closer.

                              sidney
                 you are seriously deranged.

                              bond
                 maybe. but why are we going up
                 instead of down?

      he nods to the floor indicator. she looks: 60, 65, 70. it stops.
      bond reaches down to her -

                              bond
                 sidney, come with me -

      the doors open. she looks at his outstretched hand with disdain:

                              sidney
                 not if my life depended on it.
