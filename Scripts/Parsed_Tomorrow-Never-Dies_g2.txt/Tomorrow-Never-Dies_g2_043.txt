      int. engine room -

      the engineer shouts to his crew, over noise of diesel engines:

                              engineer
                 check the engine baffles; rig the
                 generators for shielded operation.

      return on the bridge -

      the first officer stands next to the communications officer.

                              communications officer
                 communications set to receive only, sir.

      the first officer looks over the shoulder of rating at radar screen.

                              rating
                 radar switched to passive mode; sonar
                 re-set to low-power operation.

                 you couldn't find our signature with
                 a magnifying glass.

                              first officer
                 let's hope so.

      the first officer joins the second officer at the windows, scanning
      the horizon with binoculars.

                              second officer
                 looks like we're in for a long,
                 uncomfortable trip.

                              first officer
                 we'll all breathe a lot easier when
                 we get this cargo back to london.

                                                                   cut to:
