      ext. entranceway -

      stamper is marching bond and sidney through the door in handcuffs.

                              bond
                 sleep well?

                              sidney
                 next time, i do the driving.

      bond gives her a look.

      return on the control room -

      harmsway and yung are locking down at the video screen of a portable
      version of the "worm" controller we saw on the sea dolphin ii.

                              yung
                 the drill is in the water;
                 approaching the intake tunnel.

                              harmsway
                 excellent.

      harmsway looks up, hearing:

                              bond
                 i see you're in your natural element,
                 harmsway: a room filled with lethal
                 power...
                       (beat)
                 ...with a toxic core at its center.

      harmsway smiles at bond and sidney, who have entered (handcuffed, at
      gun point,) with stamper and a guard. harmsway is charming as ever:

                              harmsway
                 do come in mr. bond, sidney...
                 you're just in time for a nuclear
                 meltdown!

      coming closer, sidney struggles against her cuffs, swinging at him -

                              sidney
                 you bastard -

      stamper restrains her, while bond scans the room for an advantage.
      he sees a machine pistol on the console.

                              harmsway
                 please, sidney. i'd like to remember
                 you fondly.

                              yung
                       (calling from the console)
                 approaching the first gate.

                              harmsway
                 start the grinders.

      underwater - power plant intake tunnel -

      the "worm" is nearing an iron sluice gate; the eye closes, the
      grinders rev, and it starts to eat through the bars.

      return on control room -

                              bond
                 ...so that's what the weapons grade
                 uranium was for.

                              harmsway
                 precisely, mr. bond. in a matter of
                 minutes, the boring device will
                 arrive at the core of the reactor...
                       (beat)
                 and when the radioactive blades cut
                 into the plutonium -

                              bond
                 - instant melt-down.

                              harmsway
                 chernobyl will look like a campfire.

      young calls out again, with a hint of urgency. bond decides to try
      rattling harmsway - so he can move closer to the gun, unnoticed.

                              yung
                 we're through the first gate.
                 approaching the second -

                              bond
                       (demanding)
                 why, harmsway? wasn't stealing the
                 gold enough?

                              harmsway
                       (to yung)
                 bore through.
                       (to bond, chuckling)
                 ...they used to say living well was
                 the best revenge, mr. bond.
                       (beat)
                 they're wrong.
                       (beat)
                 revenge is the best revenge.

                              yung
                 entering the main tunnel - ten
                 minutes to target -

                              bond
                       (fiercely)
                 what could you possibly have to be
                 vengeful for, harmsway? still trying
                 to prove yourself to daddy?

      this infuriates harmsway. bond moves closer to the gun.

                              harmsway
                 hong kong, mr. bond!

                              yung
                 you have to leave -

                              harmsway
                       (enraged, ignoring yung)
                 a hundred and fifty years ago, my
                 ancestors took this island - a
                 barren, lifeless rock - and turned it
                 into the greatest city known to
                 modern civilization.
                       (beat)
                 and now that i'm being forced to give
                 it back, i intend to return it in
                 exactly the same condition: a
                 barren, lifeless rock.
                       (beat)
                 the gold is merely reparations -
                 payment from the spineless british
                 government who wouldn't listen.

                              bond
                       (to sidney, glancing at the gun)
                 ... i think uncle elliot is having
                 his own melt-down.

                              yung
                 approaching the third gate -

                              harmsway
                 smash through it!
                       (then)
                 laugh all you'd like, mr. bond - but
                 you fit perfectly in to my plans.
                       (he reaches for a newspaper)
                 here. this just in. newsflash.
                 read all about it.

      he thrusts an issue of tomorrow at bond, holding the top half out as
      bond reads the headlines, sourly:

                              bond
                 ... hong kong destroyed by nuclear
                 meltdown... british agent found in
                 reactor suspected of sabotage; harmsway
                 calls for british government to resign.

      harmsway smiles at bond:

                              harmsway
                 ...as the advertising says: tomorrow
                 never lies.

                              bond
                 what about the gold?

                              yung
                 you must go. now. otherwise the
                 boat won't be out of range -

      stamper and the guard appear nervous, itching to leave -

                              harmsway
                 thirty seconds.
                       (then, to bond)
                 that's the most brilliant part of the
                 plan, mr. bond: to save the economy,
                 i'll let the new british government -
                 my british government - announce that
                 the gold was irradiated in hong kong
                 - where no one will be able to touch
                 it for a hundred years.
                       (beat)
                 and just by coincidence:

      he turns the paper over and reads/reveals a smaller headline:

                              harmsway
                 ...gold mine opens in vietnam.
                       (turns to stamper)
                 let's go. put them in the airlock.

      stamper moves towards bond and sidney. bond edges closer to the gun.

                              bond
                 you'll never get away with it,
                 harmsway. too many people know.

      bond tenses, ready to spring -

                              harmsway
                 who, mr. bond? the kooks - the
                 crazies - the conspiracy theorists?
                 the oliver stones of the world?
                       (pausing, then, with great scorn:)
                 i'll publish their books, i'll make
                 their movies, i'll put them on my tv
                 shows!
                       (beat)
                 they're my bellboys. they carry my
                 luggage.

      bond moves, but - the guard picks up the gun!!! bond frowns.

                              harmsway
                 now. get them in the airlock.

      fortunately, bond has a back-up plan. as stamper hustles them off -

                              bond
                 one problem, harmsway: the girl. and
                 the handcuffs. they'll give it away.

      harmsway considers this for a second. sidney takes bond's arm.

                              sidney
                 no. i want to stay with him.

      bond looks at her. he's surprised: in the blink of an eye, he
      realizes he's developed feelings for her. he knows that if he could
      hold her, he'd kiss her, and whisper "you're a hell of a girl"...

      but at the same instant - throwing a glance at yung - he knows he's
      running out of time against the worm, and is better off alone.

                              harmsway
                       (breaking the moment, cynically)
                 how sweet.

                              sidney
                       (satto, to bond)
                 my timing always was lousy.

                              bond
                       (cold and hard)
                 i'd rather die alone.

                              harmsway
                 take the girl. leave the handcuffs.
                 we'll drown her at sea.

                              sidney
                       (to bond, sarcastically)
                 enjoy the rest of your life.

      as stamper pushes bond into the reactor room airlock, he hears:

                              harmsway
                 i'll meet you on the boat, south of
                 lantau island.
