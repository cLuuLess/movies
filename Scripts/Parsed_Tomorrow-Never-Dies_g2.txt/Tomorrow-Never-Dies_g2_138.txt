      ext. terrace set-back - 72nd floor -

      stamper and the guards rush to the ledge.

      bond and sidney - descending on the rig - 60th floor -

      bond, looking up - for stamper - and down - to check their progress.

                              sidney
                 all i know is one thing: if we get
                 out of here alive, that gold is mine.
                       (beat)
                 i've earned it.

      looking upward, bond sees stamper peering over the rail. bond fires.

                              bond
                 one thing at a time.
