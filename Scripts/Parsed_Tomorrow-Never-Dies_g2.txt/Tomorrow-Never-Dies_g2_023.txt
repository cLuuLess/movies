      int. conference room - day

      debriefing: bond, m, and several others listen as nato colonel
      dominique everhart, (early 30's, belgian,) refers to video clips from
      the khyber pass sequence:

                              col. dominique everhart
                 to sum up: after analyzing the tire
                 inflation of the fork-lift in the mi-6
                 video tape, nato believes the "red
                 box contains approximately eighty
                 kilograms of u235 weapons grade
                 uranium - an incredibly hard,
                 incredibly heavy, incredibly lethal
                 substance.

                              m
                 and that's enough enriched uranium to
                 produce how many nuclear devices?

                              col. dqminique everhart
                 depending on the builder's sophistication
                 - one crude bomb that could devastate
                 london, paris, new york, berlin - or all
                 four if they have the latest technology.

      there's a pregnant pause in the room.

                              m
                 and the participants?

                              col. dominique everhart
                       (pointing at the screen)
                 kim dae yung. moscow-trained north
                 korean nuclear weapons specialist;
                 apparently fell out of favor with the
                 current north korean regime after a
                 botched attempt to steal fissionable
                 material from a british light-water
                 reactor in south africa - an accident
                 that left him entirely hairless...

      another face appears on the screen:

                              col. dominique everhart (cont'd)
                 and rendera sikrahm, also known as
                 richard stamper. freelance mercenary,
                 laos and cambodia. his father was
                 from nepal - a ghurka warrior - con-
                 scripted by the british government to
                 fight in china during world war ii -
                 after which the family settled in
                 hong kong, where the young stamper
                 was undoubtedly treated like a second
                 class citizen by both the hong kong
                 chinese, and local british.
                       (beat, aside:)
                 we've all read about the signs at the
                 british swimming pools in hong kong
                 that said "no ghurka's allowed."

                              bond
                 nothing like a little imperialism to
                 promote loyalty among the faithful.

                              col. dominique everhart
                       (stifles a smile, then:)
                 in conclusion: both these men have a
                 vendetta against the world. they are
                 nuclear armed, and dangerous. and
                 having failed to get the uz35 through
                 the old opium route - the khyber pass
                 - it's nato's belief that their next
                 attempt will be through bulgaria -
                 where the nato nuclear strike force
                 will be there to stop them.

                              m
                 thank you colonel everhart.
                       (stands, turns to:)
                 007, i'd like to see you in my office.
                 why don't you and the colonel exchange
                 numbers if you need more information?

                              bond
                 yes, m.

      m exits. bond approaches dominique. she smiles, warmly. there's a
      mutual attraction - but there's something else going on, unspoken.

                              bond
                 interesting presentation.

                              dominique
                 interesting video tape.

                              bond
                 they point, i shoot.

                              dominique
                       (feels her pockets)
                 do you have a pen? i just got promoted
                 and don't have my new cards yet.

                              bond
                 of course.

      bond hands her a pen. she regards it cautiously.

                              dominique
                 ... does this do anything?

                              bond
                 depends what number you write.

      she gives him a wry look; starts to write. he notes her wedding band.

                              bond
                 married?

                              dominique
                 happily.

                              bond
                 ... kids?

                              dominique
                 three. you? married?

                              bond
                 no.

                              dominique
                       (smiles)
                 i didn't think so.

      for an instant, something crosses bond's face: bittersweetness? re-
      morse? either way, she's scored a subtle victory.

                              dominique
                 here. i gave you my assistant's
                 phone number. if it's urgent, she
                 knows where to reach me.

                              bond
                 thanks.
                       (beat, holding her gaze)
                 take care -

                              dominique
                 you too.

      with a sphinx-like smile, she watches bond leave.
