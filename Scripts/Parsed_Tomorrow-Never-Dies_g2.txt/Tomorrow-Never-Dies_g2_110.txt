      passing newspaper loading docks (with trucks displaying both the
      "tomorrow" and "hnn" logos, and hum-vees used by building security,)
      bond pulls into the valet area -

      where a cheerful young pr woman and valet wait. both wear the
      colorful blazer used by all harmsway building service personnel.

                              bond

                 mind of its own.
