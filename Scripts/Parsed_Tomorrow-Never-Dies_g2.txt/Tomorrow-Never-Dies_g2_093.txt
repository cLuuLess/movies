      ext./int. boat at marina - morning -

      bond looks around furtively, before climbing aboard the sleek ocean-
      going craft. on the aft-deck, there's a large covered object.

      as bond reaches for the cabin door, it opens by itself - and a
      succession of three young english women in string bikinis emerge.

                              girl one
                 good morning!

                              girl two
                 good morning.

                              girl three
                       (calling back into the cabin)
                 he's arrived.

      bond turns from the door to watch the women. he hears:

                              q's voice
                 you're late 007. i've been expecting
                 you.

      q emerges from the cabin in a blazer and an ascot. he's irritated:

                              bond
                 q! how are you?

                              q
                 retired. i'm not getting paid to
                 help you save the world anymore.

                              bond
                 i'm sorry. it was a national emergency -

                              q
                 that hardly makes up for the imposition.
                       (beat)
                 now, for what i hope will be the very
                 last time - pay attention, 007.
                       (he unfurls a map:)
                 first, computer generated retrograde
                 analysis map. body here, meteorolog-
                 ical influences here, likely vector-
                 ing of the ship's coordinates here.

                              bond
                 do you have any idea of what any of
                 that means? in english?

                              q
                 not a clue. i didn't lose the ship.
                       (reaches for a filofax sized device)
                 next, your new personal communicator.
                       (flips it open)
                 picture-phone, fax, beeper.

                              bond
                       (taking it)
                 do i have to dial '9' to get out?

                              q
                 i don't care who you dial, so long as
                 it's not me. next -

      q walks to the large object on the aft-deck. pulls off a tarp:

                              q
                 your new car. (insert name)

                              bond
                       (interrupting)
                 - four wheel drive?

                              q
                 yes. and do try to keep all four of
                 them on the road.
                       (continuing)
                 all the usual refinements: smoke,
                 missiles, machine guns -
                       (shows him a key fob)
                 fully operational remote control.
                 drives forward, reverse -
                       (bond presses a button,
                        opening a window)
                 stop that!
                       (grabbing it away)
                 plus infrared thermal imaging radar,
                 heads up instrumentation, and 17
                 beverage cup holders.

                              bond
                 ... 17 beverage cup holders?

                              q
                 standard equipment. the world's
                 automobile manufacturers seem to be
                 in some kind of mad war to see who
                 can provide the most beverage cup
                 holders.

      bond nods, and looks at a distraction from the girls in bikinis.

                              bond
                 i must say, q, you seem to be doing
                 rather well in your retirement.

                              q
                 don't even think about it. 007.
                 they're my granddaughters.

      strait of malacca - day -

      clear skies and blue water. the only vessel in sight is a thirty-
      five foot sport fishing boat underway at full throttle.
