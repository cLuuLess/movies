      int. bond's car - moving - coastal roadway - day -

      as bond downshifts in anticipation of an upcoming hill, his car phone
      rings. before answering it, he looks down at:

      insert - dashboard - digital display panel -

      displayed on separate lines:, "incoming call." "origin: (the display
      runs through numbers until it hits on) 763-4733." "name: (blinking)
      unknown. "status: (blinking) secure."

      return on bond -

      reacting - the information is curious. bond picks up the phone.

                 bond.
