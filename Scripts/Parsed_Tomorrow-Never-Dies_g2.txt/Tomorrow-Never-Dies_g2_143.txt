      bond and sidney fall from the bridge - 50 stories up.

      they go down,

      and down,

      and down -

      return on the railing - (int. sky bridge) -

      the cable looped around the railing is slowing their descent; the
      paint on the railing is burning off, and the steel itself is starting
      to smoke from the friction.

      bond and sidney - dropping -

      dropping -

      and dropping.

      looking to the ground, bond sees the press room observation balcony
      coming up fast from below. it looks like they're going to get
      splattered on the tile floor, when -

      return on the railing - sky bridge -

      the cable comes to the end of its run! it drags the spool, the
      bucket, and all the other mechanics to the side of the bridge,
      smashing against the wall, jamming against the railing.
