      int. cafe -

      digiacomo sees the blue laser. motions his men to action.

      return on the sea dolphin ii - topside -

      bond has sauntered to one of the hospitality bars, trying to remain
      ac inconspicuous as possible. a hand clasps his shoulder:

                              valentin's voice
                 mr. james bond!

      bond spins to see valentin, surrounded by the usual assortment of
      cheaply dressed goons.

                              bond
                 valentin. what an unpleasant surprise.

                              valentin
                 what is it that brings you to
                 venezia, mr. bond? business -
                       (sly glance to the thugs)
                 or somebody else's business?

      the goons chortle. bond isn't happy with this attention. he clocks
      a video surveillance camera on one of the masts, scanning the deck.

      a woman's shrill whining voice - brings bond back to valentin. she
      is very colorfully dressed - dripping in high-ticket logos.

                              sofia
                 dimitri!!! you promised i could go
                 shopping!!

                              valentin
                       (sotto, to bond)
                 new mistress.
                       (to her, impatiently)
                 so? go!

                              sofia
                 i need money.

      valentin gives a beleaguered shrug, and pulls out a huge wad of cash.

                              valentin
                 here. take an inch.

      shaking his head, valentin turns back to bond:

                              valentin
                 come. let me buy you a drink. it's
                 free.

      with bond keeping an eye on the surveillance camera, they move
      several steps to the bar.

                              valentin
                       (to the bartender)
                 two vodka martini's. shaken. not stirred.
                       (to bond)
                 and you?

      bond would rather not drink - but knows that any change from his
      regular behavior might arouse suspicion.

                              bond
                 one.

      as the bartender pours:

                              bond
                 i must say, valentin, capitalism
                 seems to be treating you well.

                              valentin
                       (belting one back)
                 i used to sell weapons; now i buy votes.
                       (then)
                 off the record.

                              bond
                 of course. if you can't beat the
                 government, you might as well own it.

      valentin spots someone off-camera.

                              valentin
                 wait - i want you to meet a friend of
                 mine.
                       (calling out)
                 elliot! elliot! come here.

      harmsway appears. ebullient as ever.

                              valentin
                 elliot harmsway, i want to introduce
                 you to an old friend -

                              bond
                       (putting out a hand to shake)
                 the name is bond. james bond.

      harmsway greets bond with a warm smile. yet his words are ambiguous:

                              harmsway
                 always nice to meet one of her
                 majesty's fellow subjects...
                       (a nod to valentin)
                 especially one with such
                 distinguished friends.

                              bond
                 you might say i've always been one of
                 mr. valentin's biggest followers.

                              valentin
                       (chortling)
                 'biggest followers?' he's
                 practically made a career' of it!!

      he laughs. bond decides to pull harmsway's chain.

                              bond
                 it's a beautiful boat, sir elliot.
                 practically glows in the dark.

                              harmsway
                       (smiles)
                 i can tell you're a man with an eye
                 for exquisite possessions, mr. bond.
                       (signaling off camera)
                 darling! come here.
                       (beat)
                 i want you to meet my wife.

      a woman appears in frame, her face obscured by a large sun hat. as
      she reveals her face to the camera - and bond -

                              harmsway
                 paris harmsway, allow me to introduce
                 you to james bond.

      there is a terrified look on her face. harmsway continues, beaming
      his most insinuating smile:

                              harmsway
                 but then... i believe you two have
                 already met.

      there is a beat - an uncomfortable moment when nobody speaks. then -

      police whistles blow! sirens! sound of tires screeching to a halt!

      the entire party turns to see digiacomo barging his way up the
      gangplank - wearing a ludicrous military uniform, trailed by uzi-
      toting carbinieri, along with his own video and still crews.

                              digiacomo
                 elliot harmsway: under the auspices
                 of the italian government, i, franco
                 digiacomo -
                       (pauses; smiles at a camera;
                        pop! a flash goes off)
                 am arresting you for the illegal
                 possession of weapons grade enriched
                 uranium.
                       (to his underlings)
                 seize the boat!

      a set of frozen glances goes from bond, to paris, to harmsway.

                              valentin
                 i think i suddenly remembered an
                 urgent meeting in moscow.

      to everyone's surprise, harmsway guffaws.

                              harmsway
                 my friends, there's been a terrible mistake.
                       (putting his arm around digiacomo)
                 come. let me show you.

      and he leads the procession off, through the bulkhead door. bond is
      left with paris. she is white with fear. bond moves to console her:

                              bond
                 paris -

                              paris
                 leave me alone! he's going to kill me!!

                              bond
                 why didn't you tell me? why wasn't
                 it in our files?

                              paris
                       (anguished)
                 he didn't want anyone to know. he
                 kept it out of the papers. he said a
                 third wife was bad for his image.
                       (beat)
                 you've got to protect me!

      bond wants to help her - and follow harmsway. he pulls out a key:

                              bond
                 go to my hotel room. i'll be there
                 in twenty minutes.

      paris looks up at him like a hurt child. she wants some contact; she
      wants to hear him say 'i love you.'

                              paris
                 just - say it. say it just once.

                              bond
                       (pauses, discomfited)
                 one thing at a time. i'll see you
                 in twenty minutes. go.

      she exits; he goes to the bulkhead door... and we pan up to see the
      surveillance camera, following him.
