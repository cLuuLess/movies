ext. back yard - moments later

the back porch light comes on. reverend sullivan steps
out onto the back porch. landon looks up.

                         landon
                    (flushes, almost
                    manic)
               i have to finish it tonight.

without a word, the reverend turns around and goes back
inside. leaving the porch light on. landon goes back to
work.
