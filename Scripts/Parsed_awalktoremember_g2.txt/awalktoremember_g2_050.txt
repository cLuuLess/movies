int. restaurant - kitchen - lunch hour

landon is sweating, scouring pots. a crooked cap on his
head, an assistant manager name tag on his shirt. he's
making some headway; only two more to wash.

marvin, the owner, walks over. beer belly, greasy hair.
dumps another pile of dirty pots and pans in landon's
sink. landon glimpses his future.
