ext. pickup

the truck makes a circle around landon, then stops. the
music quiets. eric and clay jump down. a long tense
moment, then:

                         eric
               hey.

                         landon

               hey.

without a word, clay walks to the yugo, lifts the heaviest
telescope part, and carries it to the bed of the pickup.
eric follows suit.
