ext./int. yugo (carter driveway) - few days later

landon's under the yugo's hood. josh, the kid from next
door, is in the driver's seat.

                         landon
               start the engine.

josh turns the key. nothing happens. under the hood,
landon changes something.

                         landon
               again.

josh tries the engine again. still no go. landon changes
something else.

                         landon
               one more time.

josh tries one more time. the engine roars, then dies,
then amazingly starts again. it's running. landon high-
fives josh, then sees an old station wagon turn in.
