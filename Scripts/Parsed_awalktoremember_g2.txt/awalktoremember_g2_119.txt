int. reverend's office

landon doesn't sit.

                         landon
               i'd like to take jamie to dinner
               on new year's eve.

                         rev. sullivan
               that won't be possible.

he looks back to his papers. end of conversation.

                         landon
               i'm sorry i haven't always treated
               jamie the way -- i should have.
               she deserves better.

reverend sullivan glances up. as if surprised landon is
still there.

                         landon
               i care for her.

                         rev. sullivan
               i don't want to see her hurt.

                         landon

               i wouldn't do that --

                         rev. sullivan
               this week.

                         landon
               ever again.

the reverend looks out the window. a gray day, cold,
bitter, stark. he considers his options.

                         rev. sullivan
               have her home by one. and drive
               carefully.
