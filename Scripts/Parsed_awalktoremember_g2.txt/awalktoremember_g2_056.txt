int. jefferson high - library - little later

a big room with tables and chairs but few books. pairs of
heads are bent over textbooks and notebooks. landon sits
with luis, a freshman boy of mixed ethnicity. a geometry
text between them.

                         landon
                    (reading)
               -- 'so what is the measure of
               angle x if a and b are similar
               triangles?'

luis is lost, intimidated.

                         landon
               know what 'similar' means?

luis shrugs. luis looks down at the book as if for the
answer, then at landon, hopeless. he gets up and walks
off. landon looks up in disbelief and catches jamie
studying him. she's at a nearby table with her student,
isabel.
