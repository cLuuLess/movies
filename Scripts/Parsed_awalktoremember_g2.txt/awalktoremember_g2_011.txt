empties roll and clink on the floor. a tiny plastic
skeleton dances as it hangs from the rearview mirror.
landon stamps a joint into the ashtray.

                         landon
                    (impatient, edgy)
               where is he? he's supposed to be
               here.

                         eric
                    (from back seat)
               i need to whizz.

eric's skinny, high-energy. a leg always jiggling.

                         landon

               eric. you're such a hummingbird.

                         eric
                    (pointing, like
                    tattoo)
