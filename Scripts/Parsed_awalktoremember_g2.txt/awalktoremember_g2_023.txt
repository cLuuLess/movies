belinda, eric, clay are still laughing. landon's smiling.

                         eric
               ten years. where're you gonna be?
                    (to belinda, mocking)
               hypothetically?

                         belinda

               paris.

                         clay
               dead.

laughter.

                         landon
               right here. with you.

he clinks eric's raised beer. more laughter. but
landon's face clouds slightly -- maybe this isn't where
he'd really like to be.

                         clay
               'twilight zone.' 'one step
               beyond.' 'tales from the dark
               side.'

                         eric
               'twilight zone,' dipshit.

                         landon
               don't call him a dipshit.

                         eric
               you do --

                         landon
               and you don't.
                    (beat, re: jamie)
               what's she doing in there?

                         belinda
               nothing i'd be doing.

laughter. landon kisses her. with tongue.

a blinding white light dances through the car and settles
on landon and belinda's faces.

                         landon

               shit!

he scrambles out of the car.
