int. hallway outside science lab - next afternoon

the door is open to a lab where jamie and the star club is
meeting. landon mops, working hard, while listening in.
inside, jamie ignores him.

mr. kelly watches from near the trophy case. almost
approving.

                         mr. kelly
               mr. carter. don't wear a hole in
               that one spot there.

landon grins and moves on. behind landon's back, mr.
kelly peeks into the science lab. sees jamie. looks back
at landon. wonders.
