int. parsonage - sullivan kitchen - later that night

reverend sullivan and jamie put the dishes away.

                         rev. sullivan
               you and the carter boy. want to
               catch me up on recent
               developments?

                         jamie

               you're asking if we're involved?

                         rev. sullivan
               i'm asking how much.

                         jamie
               dad --

                         rev. sullivan
               it's time to tell him.
                    (pause)
               it would be the right thing.

she turns to him, upset. her anger spilling out.

                         jamie
               maybe. but that's not the real
               reason. you think if i tell,
               he'll disappear and that's what
               you want! me all to yourself!

                         rev. sullivan
                    (calm, stung)
               no. i want what's best for you.

                         jamie
               this -- him -- landon -- is what's
               best for me!

                         rev. sullivan

               you're sure? you're sure you can
               trust him?

he's playing to her old insecurities. she's not one
hundred percent sure.

                         rev. sullivan
                    (gentler)
               isn't it better to know?

their eyes meet. she knows he's right.
