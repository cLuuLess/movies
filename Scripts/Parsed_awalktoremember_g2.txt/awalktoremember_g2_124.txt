int. yugo - traveling - night

landon drives. the cars' "tonight she comes" plays. he
belches loudly, dramatically.

                         jamie

               excuse you.

                         landon
               your turn.

                         jamie
                    (laughing)
               no.

                         landon
               i know you want to.

she grins. and tries. a small burp.

                         landon
               bring the air all the way up from
               your stomach.

he belches again. just as loud. she tries again,
laughing.
