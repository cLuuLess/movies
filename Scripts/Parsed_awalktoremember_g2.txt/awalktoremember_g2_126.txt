               before we do this.

                         jamie
               we're doing something -- ?

                         landon
               before we do this, i just want to
               say that a good life's gotta be
               about more than achieving stuff --
               like on your list.

she waits for more.

                         landon
               it's about working with what you
               already have -- right now -- at
               your fingertips -- you know,
               spontaneously.

                         jamie
               what are you talking about?

                         landon

               that little bit of larceny in your
               heart.

                         jamie
               excuse me?

                         landon
               fun.
