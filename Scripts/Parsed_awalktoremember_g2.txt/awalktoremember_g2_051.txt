int. principal kelly's outer office - early afternoon

landon paces, jumpy. kelly's secretary, miss tarbox,
quietly locks her purse in her bottom drawer.

                         landon
               who's he in with?

                         miss tarbox
               he'll be with you when he's
               available.

the door to kelly's office opens. jamie sullivan exits
with her father, the tall stern reverend hegbert sullivan.
jamie eyes landon as she passes by.

                         landon
                    (joking)
               you expelled, too?

nobody laughs or even smiles.
