ext. rear access road to cemetery - ten minutes later

landon is waiting when jamie appears. he has scripts in
his back pocket. they smile at each other, laugh.

                         jamie
                    (re: her father)
               i know. don't say anything.

                         landon
               he's a softy. got him wrapped
               around my finger.

                         jamie
               you think so.

                         landon
               know so.

she grins, skeptical.

                         jamie
               this way.

another angle

jamie leads landon toward the cemetery rear gate.

                         jamie
               people think i'm strange, don't
               they?

                         landon

                    (smiling)
               yes.

                         jamie
               because i try to be nice to
               people?

                         landon
               yeah. maybe. i dunno.

                         jamie
               do you think i'm strange?

pause. landon's caught off-guard by her frankness.

                         landon
               yeah. but that can be good.
