int. landon's bedroom - late night

landon sits at his desk, sketching the larger telescope,
making a few computations.

a library book on haley's comet is open. a stack of
similar books by his elbow.

cynthia enters wearing her waitressing outfit.

                         cynthia
               what can i do?

he shrugs. tears fill his eyes.

                         landon
               everything's being done but it's
               not enough. i have to find
               something -- more.

                         cynthia
                    (gently)
               landon, honey. there's nothing
               more.

                         landon

               i don't mean about jamie being
               sick. i mean about jamie and me.

                         cynthia
               be with her when she wants. make
               sure she never feels alone.

landon thinks his mother is also talking about herself.

                         landon
               mom, i'm not going anywhere. not
               yet anyway.

pause.

                         cynthia
               when you are ready, i want you to
               feel free to go.

they embrace.
