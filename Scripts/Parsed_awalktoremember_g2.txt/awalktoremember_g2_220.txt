jamie hugs landon in gratitude.

                         landon
               we have five minutes.

jamie, tears streaming, braces herself against landon and
she peers into the telescope eyepiece. she pulls back,
wipes her eyes, then looks again. she swings the
telescope into the correct position.

her pov through telescope

haley's comet, its icy nucleus issuing the jets and
streamers of gas, dust, and debris that form the comet's
hazy head and long tail.

                         jamie (o.s.)

               the comet of the century...

back to scene

she steps back so he can see. he looks quickly, then
moves aside so she can keep looking. she's completely
engrossed. a long, quiet moment, then:

                         landon
               you love me?

she leans away from the eyepiece and looks at him -- yes.

                         landon
               will you do something for me?

                         jamie
               landon. i can't even do for
               myself.

                         landon
               but if you could, you would?

                         jamie
               yes.

his throat tightens with nervousness, with hope, fear,
sadness, and love.

                         landon
               will you marry me?

her face

illness, happiness, disbelief.
