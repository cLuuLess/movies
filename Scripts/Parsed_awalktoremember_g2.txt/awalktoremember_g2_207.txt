int. parsonage - jamie's bedroom - day

a smaller jamie lies in a hospital bed, seemingly asleep.
hooked to an iv. bottles of pills. landon dozes in a
comfortable chair. a nurse sits in a corner, reading.

eric and clay stand in the doorway, not sure what to do.
jamie opens her eyes, smiles.

                         jamie
               don't wake landon.

they tiptoe in. stand on either side of her bed.

                         jamie
               do i look scary?

                         eric
               not too bad.

                         clay

               you all right?

a dumb question but she handles it well.

                         jamie
                    (smiling)
               things could be better.

awkward pause.

                         clay
               we thought you'd be asleep --

                         jamie
                    (trying to help)
               i don't know what to say either.

clay hands her an envelope.

                         jamie
               what is it?

she pulls out a stack of worn bills.

                         clay
               for the book drive. landon told
               us about it --

                         eric
               we told everyone at school.

jamie takes their hands, holds them. thanking them
silently. her eyes shining with tears.
