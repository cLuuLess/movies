int. jefferson high - library - minutes later

a christmas party for the tutors and tutored. a rock 'n'
roll christmas cd plays. a raffle ticket box by the door.
a sign reads: "win movie tickets."

landon enters, buys a ticket, then takes off his leather
jacket. underneath, a nice shirt and tie.

landon's pov

across the room -- jamie, looking pretty in a dress,
laughing with her student, isabel. mr. kelly talking with
mr. reginald adams, principal of jefferson high.

luis runs over, diverts landon's attention.

front of room

mr. adams goes to a microphone. taps it.

                         mr. adams
               everyone? quiet please. as you
               all know, we're here to celebrate
               the holidays and to raise money to
               buy books for our library. the
               book drive is being led by
               beaufort high's jamie sullivan.

applause. this is new. landon looks at jamie, who's
smiling. she steps to the microphone.

                         jamie
               thank you for buying tickets.
               we've raised two hundred and
               eighty-five dollars.

more applause. she steps down.

landon and luis

off to one side.

                         landon

                    (to luis)
               about enough to buy maybe five
               volumes in a set of encyclopedias.

luis smiles. jamie overhears.

                         jamie
               it's a start.

                         landon
               yeah, with a finish in about a
               decade.

she smiles. he looks at her.

                         landon
               so you're talking to me?

                         jamie
               when i have something to say.

he smiles.

                         landon
               what's number one on your list?

she shakes her head.

                         landon
               my number one would be getting out
               of beaufort.

                         jamie

               getting out won't be your problem.
               it'll be figuring out what you
               want when you get somewhere.

she walks away.

                         landon
               what does that mean?!

                         jamie
                    (turning back)
               it means you can do anything.

landon smiles, not sure why she believes in him.
