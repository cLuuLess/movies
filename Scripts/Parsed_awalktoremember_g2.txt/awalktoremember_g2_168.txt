int. parsonage - sullivan kitchen - same time

jamie and her father eat dinner. jamie is red-eyed,
heartbroken.

                         jamie
                    (not sure at all)
               he'll call.

                         rev. sullivan

               i wanted to think he'd changed.

                         jamie
                    (angry)
               no you didn't.
                    (beat)
               but he did change. just not
               enough.

                         rev. sullivan
               jamie, you're not mad at me.
               you're mad at landon --

                         jamie
                    (furious)
               i am mad at you! and at landon!
               and the universe! and god!
                    (quieter)
               i don't even know where to put all
               my anger.

                         rev. sullivan
               that's normal. god accepts your
               anger. he won't punish you.

                         jamie
               by making me ill, he is punishing
               me!
                    (quieter)
               i just don't know what for.
