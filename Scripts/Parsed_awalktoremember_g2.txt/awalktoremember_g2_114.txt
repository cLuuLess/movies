int. principal kelly's office

kelly looks up from paperwork.

                         mr. kelly
               landon?

landon drops a folded wad of hundreds on the desk.

                         landon
               for jefferson high. for books.

                         mr. kelly
                    (suspicious)
               where did you get -- ?

                         landon
                    (angry)
               it's mine to give. i didn't steal
               it.

                         mr. kelly
               i didn't say you did.

but his tone implied it and landon's already gone. kelly
is immediately sorry. he goes to his window and sees
landon pedal away on the old bike.
