int. jamie's room - that evening

jamie opens her eyes. but can barely keep them open.
groggy from pain medication. landon's standing there.
showered, clean clothes.

                         landon
               we're going out.

he starts helping the nurse disconnect her iv.

                         jamie
               can i -- go out?

                         landon
               you'll be fine for a few minutes.

jamie looks at the nurse. uncertain. the nurse nods.
