int. beaufort high - corridor - next morning

landon's waiting when jamie approaches her locker. her
hair pulled back. she looks good in a simple, fresh way.

                         landon
               you weren't in school yesterday.

                         jamie

               i went to the doctor with my
               father.

                         landon
               he okay?

                         jamie
               healthy as can be.

pause. she doesn't help him. she opens her locker, gets
what she needs.

                         landon
               you were great the other night.

                         jamie
               thank you. so were you.

pause. he tries to touch her hair. she ducks.

                         landon
               i haven't been nice to you.

                         jamie
               you're hardly nice to anyone.

                         landon

                    (sincere)
               i'm sorry.

                         jamie
                    (walking away)
               i wish i could believe you.
