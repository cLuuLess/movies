ext. used car lot - next morning

colorful banners and flags flap in the brisk wind. landon
talks with a used car salesman.

                         salesman

               eight hundred.

                         landon
               it's got a new v-6 and
               transmission. alloy wheels.
                    (beat)
               twelve hundred.

                         salesman
               nine-fifty.

                         landon
               new paint. extra chrome. not a
               scratch anywhere.

                         salesman
               the interior is --

                         landon
               reconditioned. completely. be a
               collector's someday. twelve
               hundred.

they look at the camaro. shining in the sun.

                         salesman
               you can't expect me to pay you for
               your -- attachment to that car.

landon gazes at another dealership across the street, then
adopts the surly, vaguely-threatening attitude of old.

                         landon

               i don't. i expect you to pay me
               for yours.

the salesman looks from landon to the car. he pulls a wad
of cash from his pocket. wearily counts out twelve bills.
landon takes the money, touches the camaro's hood, then
walks away.
