ext. beaufort high gym - night (november, 1985)

rock music drifts out open doors -- barely recognizable as
born in the u.s.a. students hang. brains, preps,
richies, heavy metals, jocks, punk rockers, goths, geeks.
mixing without mixing. most are red-eyed, woozy, wasted.
a couple of boys break dance to a boom box.

missing are the criminals...

a shiny t-top camaro roars up. stops, tires squealing.
van halen blasting. landon, 18, at the wheel. he is
impulsive, sexy-troubled, with the nothing-to-lose courage
to act on destructive whims. he is envied, copied,
feared.
