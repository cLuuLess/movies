int. hospital - patient room - another afternoon

jamie's breathing is shallower. landon's reading her the
sheltering sky. he pauses, looks up. isabel, jamie's
student, is standing in the doorway. jamie sees her too.
she smiles weakly.

                         jamie
               isabel?

                         isabel
                    (shy)
               hi.

isabel comes in. landon offers her the book. she takes
it and keeps going from where landon left off. stumbling
but reading. jamie grins.

                         jamie
               who's been working with you?

isabel looks shyly at landon. jamie shakes her head,
amazed. landon nods to isabel and she begins reading
again.
