int. patient room

reverend sullivan enters.

                         rev. sullivan
               landon. you go on home.

                         landon
               i'm not tired.

                         rev. sullivan
               i need to be with her.

there's only one chair. landon nods and goes.

the reverend sits, closes his eyes a moment. when he
opens them, she's looking at him.

                         jamie
               dad.

he kisses her forehead, then sits back.

                         jamie
               so serious.

                         rev. sullivan

               jamie, god is not punishing you.
               no god i know wants anyone to be
               sick or feel pain or suffer.

pause.

                         jamie
               when mom died you told me god
               wanted her more, loved her more --

                         rev. sullivan
               i was wrong. nobody could have
               wanted or loved your mother more
               than we did. not even god.

he lets this sink in.

                         rev. sullivan
               god loaned you to me, entrusted
               you to my care. i'm failing you.

she looks away, agreeing without saying so.

                         rev. sullivan
               jamie. i make you the same
               promise that god does.
                    (beat)
               i will always be with you.

she sits up and embraces him. he wraps his arms around
her. tight. she closes her eyes, tears welling, never
wanting to let him go. her father.
