ext. auditorium - later that evening

raining. landon exits behind all the others. stands
under an overhang, lights a cigarette, angry, waiting for
a ride. jamie approaches, something on her mind.

                         landon
                    (rude)
               you're like this fly, buzzing
               buzzing everywhere --

                         jamie
               -- this play means a lot to me.

                         landon
                    (snorting)
               this play -- ?

                         jamie
               -- i know you don't suck at
               acting.

landon laughs. refusing to take her seriously. behind
him, the lights go out as the school closes for the night.

                         jamie
               but you have to make it a big joke
               because only dorks and dweebies
               like doing theater --

                         landon

               -- what are you going on about?

pause.

                         jamie
               i can judge too.

he exhales, eyeing her, daring her.

                         jamie

               you don't care about classes or
               graduating. but you like school
               because you're popular and you
               know you'll never be on top again.

                         landon
               that's deep --

                         jamie
               -- your act only works with an
               audience.

                         landon
               my act?!

she walks off toward her father's old pontiac. the last
car in the parking lot.

fire trucks rush by on the street below. landon's ears
twitch. he looks about. no one, no ride. he sees the
pontiac backing out of a parking spot.
