int. beaufort high - corridor - half hour later

deserted, classes are meeting. landon runs, sliding to a
stop at one classroom door. looks in, keeps going, stops
at another. searching.

this is jamie's pov from the top of the hallway.

jamie

she stands, holding her books, watching him, unsure.

landon

finally feels her gaze, turns to look.

jamie

turns away, still angry and disappointed.

landon

runs to her.

                         landon
               jamie!

he catches up to her.

jamie and landon

face each other. neither sure what to say.

                         landon
               i'm so sorry. i'm a coward --

                         jamie
               i should have told you sooner --

                         landon
                    (guilt-ridden)
               i made you do too many things,
               kept you up all night --

                         jamie
               no. the drugs just stopped
               working. if anything, doing
               things i love kept me healthy
               longer.

pause.

                         landon
               are you frightened?

                         jamie
               all the time.
                    (beat)
               i feel like i have no one.

she means not even god and he gets this.

                         landon
               you have me.

he hugs her close, rocking her, comforting her and
himself.

                         jamie
               help me live until i die?

                         landon
               i will.
