int. sullivan kitchen - late night

the reverend and landon drink coffee.

                         rev. sullivan
               it's her decision and she's
               decided not to tell people -- at
               least for now.

                         landon
               how -- how long does she have?

                         rev. sullivan

               two, three months. maybe less.
               maybe more.

                         landon
               so you've given up.

reverend sullivan hears the challenge in his voice.

                         rev. sullivan
               her doctors have. jamie and i.
               we're still praying for a miracle.

                         landon
                    (disdainful)
               praying.

                         rev. sullivan
               landon. we've lived with this for
               over a year now and --

                         landon
               if there is a god, how could he
               let this happen??!!

it's a long answer and by the time the reverend opens his
mouth to explain, landon's out the door.
