int. cafeteria - noon

landon eats alone, ignored by eric and clay. jamie
approaches with her tray, red-faced, tearful.

she hesitates about sitting -- feeling bad that landon's
being diminished, ostracized. she thinks he doesn't see
her. but as she turns to leave, he pulls a chair out for
her and smiles. she sits. landon sees her face.

                         landon
               what's wr--?

                         jamie
                    (choked up)
               the challenger exploded.
               principal kelly's about to make an
               announcement.

the public address system crackles. landon takes jamie's
hand as the room hushes.

                         landon
               come on.

                         jamie
               where?

                         landon
               away from here.
