int. jamie's bedroom

jamie grips landon's arms, seems to slip, suddenly too
exhausted to carry her weight. landon picks her up,
gently carries her back to bed. settles her in.

                         landon
               how you doing?

                         jamie
                    (murmurs)
               tired.

landon sits on her bed. strokes her hair. they look at
each other. landon reaches for her hand. when he looks
at her face again, she's asleep.
