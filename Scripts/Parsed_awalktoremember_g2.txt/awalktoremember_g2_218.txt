ext. parsonage roof - night

landon carries jamie out a large attic window. the
finished large telescope is set up. pointing at the sky.
she's in her nightgown, wrapped in a blanket.

                         jamie
                    (grateful, touching
                    it)
               it's beautiful... thank you.

but she looks at the lights of the house and streets
around them.

                         jamie
               i don't know what we'll be able to
               see... help me stand.

he checks his watch.

                         landon
               wait a sec.

as she turns to him, questioning, the neighborhood
suddenly darkens as the street lamps and lights in every
nearby house are switched off.
