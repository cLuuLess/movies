dark save for a gilded fake tree lit with tiny blinking
lights and the glow of cynthia's cigarette in the dark.

landon comes down the stairs. sits on the sofa. wearing
another good shirt. she tries to reach out.

                         cynthia
               you look nice. i should have
               dressed.

                         landon
               you're fine like that, mom.

                         cynthia
