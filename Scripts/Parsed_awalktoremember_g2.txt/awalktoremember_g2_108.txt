int. patient room - moments later

a tv flickers. landon comes in. opens the box. pulls
out the evergreen wreath with the plaid bow.

                    landon
               for me. christmas is all about
               the smells.

landon leans the wreath in the window. harold keene --
the old man from the accident, watches from his bed,
baffled.

                         landon

               pine's my favorite. that and
               cider with cloves.

landon pulls a thermos from his coat pocket. unscrews the
cap. finds a drinking cup. pours in cider. offers
harold the cup.

                         harold
               who are you?

                         landon
               landon carter. i was driving the
               car that --

                         harold
               you.

                         landon
               me.

harold takes the cup, looks landon over. landon appears
genuinely contrite.

                         landon
               i'm very sorry --

                         harold
               what kind of a man are you, son?

pause.

                         landon
                    (honest)
               i don't know that i am -- a man.
               yet. i'm working on it.

pause.

                         harold
               i've worked on it my whole life.

harold reaches under his pillow. pulls out a small bottle
of liquor. tops off his cider.

                         harold
               get yourself a glass.

                         landon
               no. thanks. gotta keep my wits
               for the drive home.

harold nods, liking landon.

                         harold

               you'll sit a while.

                         landon
               i will.
