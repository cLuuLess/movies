ext. movie theater - evening (early february)

ferris bueller's day off and three amigos! on the marquee.

landon and jamie exit as belinda and a new boyfriend buy
tickets. clay and eric and a crowd behind them.

                         landon
               hey, belinda.

she takes her boyfriend's arm, turns away, snubbing him.

                         landon
               clay, eric.

eric says something inaudible and the whole crowd sniggers
and laughs. he's become landon. landon reddens, now
realizing for certain that he's become a jamie sullivan.
