ext. woods by side of road - moments later

jamie gets out of the car. landon quickly follows.

                         landon
               jamie --

                         jamie
               i'm sick.

                         landon
               then i'll take you home. you'll
               feel better tomorrow.

he tries to take her arm. she shakes off his hand, steps
back. wanting to be heard and understood.

                         jamie
               landon. i'm sick -- with
               leukemia.

landon tries to say something. nothing comes out. his
soul numb.

                         jamie
               i found out last winter. i'm not
               responding to treatment anymore.

his face crumples with pain and anguish.

                         landon
               why didn't you tell me?

                         jamie
               the doctors said to do everything
               the same as long as possible.
                    (pause)
               i didn't want anyone being --
               weird around me.

                         landon

               including me?!

                         jamie
               especially you.
                    (long beat)
               god gives me an illness, then you.
               a cruel joke.

she gets in the car. slams her door shut. he stands
there, not knowing what to do.
