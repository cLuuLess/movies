int. science classroom - after school

landon sweeps at the floor during the star club open
house. a dozen nerds, including jamie sullivan (wearing
her brown sweater), stand at astronomy exhibits. students
wander in, listen, look.

                         jamie
                    (answering question)
               -- saturn's 15 degrees to the
               right of red antares and much
               brighter.

to her small audience, she holds up a contraption made
from a wire coat hanger.

                         jamie
               this is a very simple device made
               from a coat hanger, plastic wrap
               and typewriter correction fluid.
               does anyone know what it is?

no one does.

                         landon
                    (barely audible)
               a star frame.

but jamie hears. she regards him a moment, then keeps
going.

                         jamie
               this is a star frame.

clay and eric enter, checking on landon, glancing at
jamie.

                         jamie
               a star frame will help you locate
               stars and planets with your naked
               eye --

                         clay
                    (scoffing, setting
                    her up)
               -- did god create the sun?

                         jamie
                    (taking him seriously)
               yes, god created the universe and
               all its physical laws. even
               einstein said it's a miracle that
               our world is comprehensible --

                         eric
               -- if god can do all that, why
               can't he get you a new sweater?

landon laughs loudly. members of the club look at him.

                         landon
               that was a joke. laugh.

jamie smiles. she can laugh at herself. and she finds
landon funny.
