the mangled front bumper's on the ground. cynthia stands
there in her bathrobe. upset. landon's almost too much.

                         cynthia

               you're not hanging round here all
               day.

                         landon

               you don't need a car you can't
               drive for a month. go see marvin.

                         landon
               'bout what?

                         cynthia
               about a job.

landon ignores her. slides back under his car.
