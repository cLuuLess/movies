landon's looking at kelly in the rearview mirror.

                         landon
                    (mocking)
               kelly. he looks like his face
               caught fire and he tried to put it
               out with a fork.

landon inches the car forward, teasing clay, teasing
kelly.

                         eric
               he couldn't find his own butt with
               both hands at high noon in a hall
               of mirrors.

sniggering laughter.

                         clay
               go!

landon presses the gas. the car roars away.

                         clay
               kelly's so old he --

                         landon
               we're done with that already,
               bonehead.

clay smiles, good-natured. he often misses social cues.
