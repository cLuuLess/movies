ext. beach (neuse river) - late night

a starry night with a bright moon. glimmering silver
water. jamie and landon walk onto a dock. distant
fireworks boom.

                         jamie
               it's places like this that make me
               certain there's a god.

                         landon
                    (surprised)
               you're sometimes not sure?

                         jamie
               i'm sure. pretty sure.

they reach the end of the dock. she turns to face the
wind. it blows her hair. she turns his face the same
way.

                         jamie
               it's like the wind. i can't see
               it but i feel it.

he closes his eyes. feeling the wind. opens them again,
rejecting the idea.

                         landon
               we can measure wind.

                         jamie
               uncertainty makes you
               uncomfortable.

                         landon
               what do you actually know with
               religion?

                         jamie
               wonder. beauty. joy.
                    (beat, quieter)
               love.

she's embarrassed. she tries to avoid implying anything.

                         jamie

               my mother told me god is love, so
               when you're feeling love, you're
               feeling god.
                    (beat)
               i think talking about these things
               -- threatens their very beauty and
               mystery.

her tone is matter-of-fact, but landon's got a serious and
tender look on his face. he touches her hair.

                         jamie
                    (almost a whisper)
               i don't understand...

                         landon
               maybe you're not supposed to.

he moves closer.

                         landon
               i might kiss you.

she looks down. shy.

                         jamie
               i might do it wrong.

                         landon
                    (tenderly)
               not possible.

he touches her neck, her cheek, her mouth. then leans in
and kisses her. a tender, soft kiss. he pulls away.
they look at each other a moment.

                         landon
               i love you, jamie.

there, he put it out there, risked looking and feeling
foolish. not the old landon. jamie looks away. mixed
emotions. happy and sad.

                         landon

                    (gently)
               now's when you say something.

                         jamie
                    (overwhelmed)
               i can't.
                    (beat)
               i can't -- explain.

she turns back to him, her eyes shining. she touches his
face and they kiss again, deeply.

but after a few moments, she drops her chin onto his
shoulder. smiling, glowing even, but slightly aloof,
staring at the water. he pulls away slightly to study her
face. he touches her cheek and brings her back from
wherever she's been.

                         jamie
               you make me feel...

                         landon
                    (hopeful)
               loved?

                         jamie
                    (smiling)
               that. and less strange.

tears run down her cheeks. landon wipes them away with
his thumbs, attributing them to happiness.
