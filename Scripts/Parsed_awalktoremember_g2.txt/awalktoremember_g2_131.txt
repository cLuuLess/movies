ext. country road - night

landon takes jamie's hand and pulls her toward some
invisible place.

                         jamie
               where -- what -- are we -- ?

he keeps tugging her. she follows him. laughing.

                         landon
               stand right here.

                         jamie
               where?

he leans down and lifts one of her feet a foot from the
other. he notices a large bruise on her leg. she brushes
her dress down.

                         jamie
               you're acting like a crazy person.

                         landon
               you're straddling the state line.
               you're in two places at once.

she's thrilled at his solution to her wish. he walks to
the shoulder of the road.

                         landon
               repeat after me.

huh? he does a cartwheel. she laughs.

                         jamie

               i can't.

                         landon
               i'm gonna teach you.
