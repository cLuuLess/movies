ext. parsonage - front porch - later

landon follows jamie up the steps. the lights in the
living room are on. through the windows, they can see her
father taking down the christmas tree.

                         jamie
               be very quiet.

he pulls her to him. kisses her. the front door opens.

                         rev. sullivan

                    (embarrassed)
               hello, landon.

landon and jamie separate, but landon keeps an arm over
her shoulder.

                         landon
               hey, reverend.

reverend sullivan studies the two young people.

                         landon
                    (whispers to jamie)
               happy new year.

and he goes. jamie walks by her father and into the
house. not saying anything. he watches her. what has he
allowed?
