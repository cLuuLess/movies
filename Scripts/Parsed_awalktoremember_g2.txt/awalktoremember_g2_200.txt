int. hospital - patient room - day

jamie looks smaller. her eyes have blue circles beneath.
the hemingway novel on the bedstand. belinda pushes the
door open. peeks in. not sure she is welcome.

landon is sitting in a chair. he sees her, motions for
her to come in. quietly.

                         belinda
               she asleep?

                         landon
               i'll tell her you were here.

pause. awkwardness.

                         belinda
               give her this, okay?

she hands landon a small photo album.

                         belinda
               pictures from the play. jamie
               looks pretty --

                         landon
               i'm sorry about how we --

                         belinda
                    (conciliatory)
               no. you're with who you should
               be. it's like she chose you.

                         landon
                    (agreeing)
               and i have no idea why.

                         belinda
               i do.

she hugs him quickly, then leaves. landon goes to the
window, looks out.

same scene - hours later

the sky is grayer, darker. landon is still at the window.
jamie wakes.

                         jamie

               hi.

he goes to her side.

                         landon
               hey.

he kisses her.

                         jamie
               i have something for you.

she reaches under her pillow for the worn book from the
attic. she offers it to landon.

                         jamie
                    (smiling)
               don't worry. it's not a bible.

he takes it.

                         jamie
               my mother made it for me before i
               was born.
                    (beat)
               it's got quotes from famous
               people. her favorite lines from
               books. her thoughts.

landon looks at a page.

                         landon
                    (reading)
               'what is a friend? a single soul
               dwelling in two bodies.'
               aristotle.

                         jamie
               lower. same page.

                         landon
                    (reading)
               'find out who you are and do it on
               purpose.' dolly parton.

a bookmark falls out. he studies that page a moment.

close on passage

from corinthians.

back to scene

landon reads it.

                         landon
               'love is always patient and kind.
               it is never boastful or
               conceited -- '

                         jamie
               that was read at my parents'
               wedding.

he takes her hand. holds it.

                         landon
               how're you doing?

                         jamie
                    (looking away)
               better. i was really angry.

                         landon

               i know.

                         jamie
               it's gone now.

                         landon
                    (gently)
               because you have hope that you'll
               get better?

                         jamie
               no.
                    (pause, shrugging,
                    accepting)
               maybe i believe god has a bigger
               dream for me than i had for
               myself.
                    (beat)
               maybe i believe the journey, the
               big adventure, never ends...

he kneels on the floor. puts his head on her pillow next
to hers.

                         jamie
               maybe i believe god sent you to me
               because i am ill. to help me
               through.

he touches her face tenderly.

                         jamie
                    (almost whispering)
               i want to go home.

pause. he gets her meaning.

                         landon
                    (trying not to
                    break)
               i'll talk to your father.

                         jamie
                    (looking away)
               it's not that simple.
                    (pause)
               it costs money to do this at home.
