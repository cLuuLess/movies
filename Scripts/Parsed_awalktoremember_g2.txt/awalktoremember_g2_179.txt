ext. parsonage - back yard - next day

reverend sullivan is up a ladder. cleaning a gutter.
landon stands below, a few feet away, gathering his nerve.
he walks over.

on ladder

the reverend is busy ignoring landon standing below. a
long beat, then:

                         landon
                    (calling up)
               sir. being ignored is beginning
               to feel preferable to being
               noticed.

the reverend looks down.

                         landon
               i'll be honest. i don't know if i
               can pray, but i can do just about
               anything else.

neither landon nor the reverend see jamie come out of the
house and walk over.

on ground

landon shields his eyes with a hand to see the reverend
better.

                         landon
               whatever you need. whatever jamie
               needs. i'm here.
                    (beat)
               i could start by driving her to
               school --

                         jamie
               i'm not going back to school.

landon and her father both turn to her. pale, wane. they
understand what she is saying.

                         jamie
               you can tell anyone you want. i
               don't care.

she goes into the house. landon and reverend sullivan
look at each other, then away, uncomfortable. that didn't
sound like her.
