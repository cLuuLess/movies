int. parsonage - living room - minutes later

jamie sits on the sofa. her father doesn't look up from
his reading.

                         rev. sullivan
               the first time i met him i knew.
               i'm proud of how you're handling
               yourself.

tears well and jamie's face cracks with guilt and
heartbreak. she leaves before her father can see her
distress.
