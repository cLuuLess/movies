ext. cemetery gate - half hour later

jamie looks at the high fence, weary, then reaches into a
pocket for a key. unlocks the gate. swings the gate
open. landon's astonished.

                         landon
               you have a key?

                         jamie

               yeah. i've just never needed it.
                    (pause)
               will you talk to my father?

                         landon
               i've talked to your father.

                         jamie
               that's what i mean.

their eyes meet. her look is serious.
