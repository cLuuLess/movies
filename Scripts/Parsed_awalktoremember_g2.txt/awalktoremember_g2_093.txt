ext. carter driveway - dusk

eric and clay watch landon hammer out dents in the camaro.
they're smoking, sharing some beers. josh, the neighbor
kid, stands across the street, wanting to be invited over.

                         eric
                    (contemptuous)
               she's like some puritan.

                         landon
               she's not. she's got her own
               ideas.

                         clay
               mutant ideas.

                         landon
               maybe to you.

eric and clay exchange a look -- is landon defending her?

                         eric
               belinda's telling everyone that
               kiss was real.

                         landon
               it was.

eric and clay smirk in disbelief.

                         eric
               and that you're scamming on jamie
               sullivan.

                         landon
                    (not denying it)
               scamming's a strong word.
