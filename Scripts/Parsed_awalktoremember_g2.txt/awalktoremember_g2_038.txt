int. principal's office - 8:05 am

mr. kelly gestures for landon to sit. landon doesn't.
his forehead still shows a bruise.

                         mr. kelly
               i had hopes for you.

                         landon

               like i'd grow up to be president,
               another reagan.

                         mr. kelly
                    (not laughing)
               like you'd make it to june. even
               cutting half your classes, you
               have a b- average.

                         landon
               i'm no dummy.

                         mr. kelly
               that's right. you just act like
               one.

on his desk, he places the empty bottles that rolled out
of the camaro.

                         landon
               those aren't mine.

                         mr.kelly
               they came from your car.

                         landon
               i wasn't the one drinking.

kelly holds up the police test finding.

                         mr. kelly
               your blood alcohol level. maybe
               you were legally in the clear, but
               i make the rules here.

landon scowls, knows he's defeated.

                         landon
               you expelling me?

                         mr. kelly

               i am.

                         landon
               now i can do what i want.

                         mr. kelly
               that's right.
                    (sarcastic)
               the world is your oyster.
