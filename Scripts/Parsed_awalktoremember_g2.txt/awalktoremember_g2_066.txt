int. sullivan living room - moments later

dark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade. landon
pokes around, then stares at a photo of little girl jamie
with her parents. he looks up, aware that the reverend is
studying him closely.

                         landon
               you know our planet would not
               suffer for one nanosecond if
               humans died off. but if ants
               disappeared, that would be
               catastrophic.

the reverend waits, letting landon suffer the silence.

                         landon
                    (confidence flagging)
               apropos of nothing... so. so so
               so so --

                         rev. sullivan
               let's get something straight. you
               don't know me. i don't know you.
               but i know what you're about.
                    (beat)
               keep your distance from this
               house -- and from jamie.

his eyes lock with landon's. his message clear. a noise
and jamie is there, carrying glasses of lemonade, all
cheerful.

                         jamie
               i miss anything?
