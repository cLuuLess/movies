               him.

                         jamie
               he wants help with his lines --

                         rev. sullivan

               he was driving the car that hit
               harold keene --

                         jamie
               by accident --

                         rev. sullivan
               jamie, he's careless. reckless.
                    (beat)
               is this really the best time to be
               making a new friend...?

                         jamie
               i'm supposed to always be alone?

                         rev. sullivan
               i don't want you to see him
               outside school activities.

                         jamie
               fine. but i need to start
               deciding how to spend my time and
               my life.

pause.

                         rev. sullivan
                    (gentler)
               i'm sorry your mother isn't here
               to help you become a woman.

                         jamie
               dad, i've become a woman without
               her. just not a pretty one.
