int. corridor - moments later

landon and jamie arrive at his locker. it's been kicked
in.

                         landon
               assholes. this happen to you?

                         jamie
               twice a year.

bang, bang, bang. landon kicks in every locker in his
row. a dozen in all. jamie watches, a little frightened
by his anger. but then he turns to her and grins.

                         landon

               now they all match.
