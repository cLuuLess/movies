ext. back yard - minutes later

reverend sullivan comes out. dressed. he carries two
mugs of coffee and a brightly burning kerosene camp
lantern. peace offerings.

he walks over, sets down the lantern, hands landon a mug.
ready to work.

                         landon
               i've almost finished the rocker.
               did she order mirrors?

                         rev. sullivan
               in there.

as they walk to the garage.

                         rev. sullivan
               you have materials for the side
               bearings?

                         landon
               i'm using an old phonographic
               turntable.

                         rev. sullivan
               for the focuser?

                         landon

               a chrome-plated brass pipe from a
               drain line.

the reverend nods, impressed. he yanks the garage door
up. goes in.

                         landon
               you know about this stuff?

                         rev. sullivan
               i helped jamie with the first one.

                         landon
                    (surprised)
               i thought she built it herself.

                         rev. sullivan
               she did. but hardly anyone does
               anything truly alone.

the reverend carries out a large cardboard postal package.
landon takes it as the reverend lowers the garage door.

                         landon
                    (serious)
               i need to do this alone.

reverend sullivan searches landon's face for a long
moment, understanding, then turns and heads for the back
door.
