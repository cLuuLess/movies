int. flauvin's - hour later

a seafood joint on the waterfront. quaint, not fancy.
twinkle lights illuminate jamie's face. landon finds her
lovely. jamie picks.

                         jamie
               i can't believe you asked my
               father's permission.

                         landon
               i wanted this to be a date.

she watches landon, happy, then perplexed.

jamie's pov

landon wolfing down his food.

back to scene

                         jamie
               is there a rush?

                         landon
               i have to get you home by one.

                         jamie
               it's only 7:30.

                         landon
               we're going somewhere. after.
               and no. i didn't ask your father.
