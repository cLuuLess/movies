               i'm thinking.

                         eric
               no thinking. the doctor only
               gives you three seconds to
               decide --

                         landon

               could i lose one ear and one nut?

                         eric
               no questions, no negotiating --

                         belinda
                    (to eric, annoyed)
               where do you get these stupid
               questions -- ?

                         landon
               hypotheticals --

                         eric
                    (to belinda)
               i'm just wondering --

                         belinda
               don't wonder.

their pov

a pale, contemplative girl, 17, is jumping down off the
gate, caught in the headlights. wearing clothes she
probably made herself; long hair hiding her face. she
lives in her mind, not her body.
