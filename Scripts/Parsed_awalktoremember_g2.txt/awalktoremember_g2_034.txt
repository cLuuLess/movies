ext. street

the camaro crumpled into the light pole. headlights
askew. clay and eric and belinda getting out, dazed.

landon runs to the old man. kneels. shakes him. no
response. the man's terrier barks at landon.

landon's face

frightened, anguished. the real landon showing for an
instant.

police sirens wail in the b.g., growing louder.
