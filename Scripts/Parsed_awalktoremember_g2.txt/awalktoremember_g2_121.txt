kelly hands a paper to landon.

                         mr. kelly
               your grades for fall semester.
               they're -- good.

                         landon
                    (incredulous)
               you came here to give me my report
               card?

                         mr. kelly
               i've seen students with records
               like yours go to j.c. for a couple
               of years, then transfer to a good
               college.

landon understands what kelly is implying.

                         mr. kelly
               i'd gladly write you a letter of
               recommendation.

                         landon
               thank you.

                         mr. kelly
               you're welcome.

they shake hands.
