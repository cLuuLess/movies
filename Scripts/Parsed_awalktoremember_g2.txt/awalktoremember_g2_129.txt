               the cells in our bodies are always
               changing. in six or seven years
               all your cells have changed. you
               could be like a completely new
               person from the inside out.

                         jamie
               that what's happening to you, only
               faster?

he grins. pulls the car over.

                         landon

he leaps out, leaving the headlights on.
