int. beaufort high - hallway - monday morning

landon, looking haggard, moves slowly as he cleans out
jamie's locker.

students stare as he carefully places her things,
including the pink sweater, in a shopping bag. they part
and hush as he passes by. news travels fast. clay and
eric step forward.

                         clay
               hey. landon.

                         eric
               we heard 'bout jamie sullivan.
               she --

                         landon
                    (fierce)
               say nothing. nothing 'bout her.

                         eric
                    (misunderstood,
                    genuine)
               no. hey. we're sorry, man!

landon turns back. surprised. inspects belinda. eric.
clay. others. no one speaks.

                         landon
               too late and not enough.

he pushes past belinda's new boyfriend, heading for the
office.
