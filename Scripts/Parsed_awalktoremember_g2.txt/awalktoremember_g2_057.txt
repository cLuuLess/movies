int. school bus - noon

the door swishes shut behind landon as he hops aboard.
he's late and heads for the rear bench seat.

landon's pov

jamie sitting there. and no vacant seats save next to
her.

back to scene

the bus begins to roll. landon lurches forward.

traveling - later

the bus is moving through beaufort. landon sits next to
jamie. putting a new tape into his sony walkman. his
body turned away. she's reading her book.

                         jamie
               you going to visit harold?

landon scowls. what-who is she talking about?

                         jamie
               they let him out of the hospital
               yesterday. he's in a rest home on
               oak street.

that old man.

                         jamie
               he goes to my father's church. he
               could've died --

                         landon
               -- this your idea of small talk?

                         jamie
               i don't make small talk --

                         landon
               -- obviously.

                         jamie

               i just wanted to tell you not to
               give up. sometimes you've got to
               back into the teaching from
               somewhere else.

if he heard her, he makes no sign. she goes back to her
book. a long beat, then:

                         jamie
               what makes you volunteer?
                    (pause)
               want to know why i tutor reading?

not really.

                         jamie
               because, growing up, books were my
               world.

                         landon
                    (mean)
               were?

                         jamie
               you don't know me.

                         landon
               your book and your brown sweater
               and your hair. what's more to
               know -- ?

                         jamie
               -- i wear the sweater because i'm
               cold. i read because no one talks
               to me. my hair is my hair. what
               is it exactly that's bothering
               you?

                         landon

               you don't care what people say?

                         jamie
               you mean care what you say? i'm
               worrying about other things.

                         landon
               like what? the moons of jupiter?

                         jamie
               can't you have a normal
               conversation?

                         landon
               i don't want to have any
               conversation.

                         jamie
               good, cuz talking to you is like
               trying to explain red to a blind
               person.

she reads again. the bus pulls to a stop in front of
beaufort high. belinda, wearing a neck brace, is waiting,
leaning on her cabriolet. jamie watches landon exit the
bus.

jamie's pov - out the window

landon greeting belinda, kissing her.
