                         jamie

she's standing in the front yard.

                         landon
               you're not in a very good mood.

                         jamie

he steps down off the porch.

                         landon
               the play's in a couple of weeks.

                         jamie
               yes. and?

                         landon

               i was hoping we could run lines
               together.

                         jamie
               oh. just not at school...

                         landon
               yeah --

                         jamie
               or anywhere where people might see
               us.

                         landon
               belinda's a very jealous person.

                         jamie
               that would be the reason.

pause. he thinks she might be going for this.

                         jamie
               so it's like you want to be secret
               friends.

                         landon
               that's it! exactly! you're
               reading my mind --

                         jamie
               then maybe you can read mine.

she walks up the porch steps, goes in the front door, and
opens it. before she goes in:

                         jamie

               i thought i saw something in you,
               something good. but i was wrong.
