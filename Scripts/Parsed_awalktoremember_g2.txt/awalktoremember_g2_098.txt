int. carter kitchen - night

landon comes in from outside. is surprised to find
cynthia sipping tea, wearing her uniform.

                         cynthia
               out with belinda?

                         landon
               that's over. way over.

                         cynthia
               i can't know things if you don't
               tell me.

pause.

                         landon

               dad came to the play.

                         cynthia
                    (surprised)
               you saw him?

                         landon
               we talked. he wanted to get a
               bite -- after. i said no.

                         cynthia
                    (disbelief)
               after he moved out, i invited him
               to every practice, every game,
               every parent-teacher conference
               you ever had. he didn't show, not
               once.

                         landon
               he wants to show now.

                         cynthia
               you going to let him? you going
               to reward him by being the son he
               was never man enough to be a
               father to?

landon doesn't answer.

                         cynthia
                    (angry)
               you do that.
