ext. neuse river - that afternoon

landon walks alone. his hair and clothing tousled by a
steady gentle wind.

                         adult landon (v.o.)
               she made me a believer. in love.
               in life. in the journey that
               never ends...

landon stops. faces the wind. lets the air swirl over
him.

                         adult landon (v.o.)
               ... and in the mystery of all
               things you can't see but feel
               everywhere around you...

he closes his eyes. she's there...
