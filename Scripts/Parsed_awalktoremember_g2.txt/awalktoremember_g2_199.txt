int. principal kelly's office - minutes later

landon picks up a pile of books and assignments.
looks through them, then eyes miss tarbox.

                         landon

               where's jamie's book?!

                         miss tarbox
               that's everything mr. kelly gave
               me.

                         landon
                    (insistent)
               the next book on that list! the
               old man and... and...

                         miss tarbox
               the sea.

                         landon

mr. kelly steps out of his inner office. sees landon's
anguished face, his exhaustion.

                         mr. kelly
               i'll drive a copy over to her.

landon nods his appreciation.
