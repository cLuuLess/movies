int. carter kitchen - few minutes later

landon sits at the kitchen table. cynthia pours him a cup
of coffee.

                         cynthia
               you and i may not be communicating
               very well right now. but let me
               be clear. don't make this about
               you. it's about her.

pause. her words sink in.

                         landon
               i have no idea what to say. how
               to act. what if i do the wrong
               thing?

                         cynthia
                    (gently)
               be yourself and i don't think
               there is a wrong thing.
                    (beat)
               let jamie take the lead. she'll
               let you know what she needs.
