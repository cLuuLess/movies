landon's mother, cynthia, 35, drives. she's weary with
sun-worn skin, but still attractive. she wears a skimpy
black-and-white cocktail waitress uniform under her coat.

                         cynthia
               what if they expel you?

                         landon
               kelly wouldn't do that.

                         cynthia
               why not?

                         landon
               cuz nothing happened at school.

he smiles his biggest most reassuring smile.

                         cynthia
               don't smile at me. it's not going
               to get you out of this.

                         landon

               why not? it always has before.
