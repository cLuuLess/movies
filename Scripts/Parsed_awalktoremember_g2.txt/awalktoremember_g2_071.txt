jamie drops down. takes a flashlight from her bag.

                         jamie
               cuz it's dark and quiet and you
               can see into another world.

                         landon
                    (on top of gate)
               the world of the dead?

                         jamie
                    (being mysterious)
               could be...

he drops down, not sure what she means. she's already
walking away. he follows.

                         jamie
               my mother's buried near here.

                         landon

               my father's alive but it's like
               he's dead.

she looks at landon, feeling his sorrow, then unlocks a
storage shed. opens the door. enters. returns a moment
later carrying several pieces of an odd-looking home-made
cylindrical device.

                         landon
               what is that?

                         jamie
                    (proud)
               that is my telescope.

same scene - minutes later

the ten-inch dobsonian telescope is pointed at the sky.
the eye-piece is at the end of the long scope; the scope
rests on a plywood base. landon looks through the eye-
piece.

pov (through telescope) - close on golden planet

a beautiful view of a golden planet with a broad, flat
ring system.

widen.

                         landon
                    (impressed)
               saturn. beautiful.

                         jamie
               before voyager we expected maybe a
               dozen rings --

                         landon
               but there are thousands of them,
               made of floating ice --

                         jamie
               maybe debris from a moon that
               broke apart.

                         landon
               or building blocks for a world
               that never formed.

she looks at him. he smiles, embarrassed.

                         landon
               i'm not smart. just a sponge.

she smiles, disagreeing, then looks through the telescope
and changes its view.

                         jamie

               sometimes i come here and just
               scan the heavens.

                         landon
                    (joking)
               looking for intelligent life?

                         jamie
               looking for something -- someone.

pause. he doesn't know what to say.

                         landon
               do you believe you'll see your
               mother again?

                         jamie
               i hope so.
                    (beat)
               i think maybe she sees me now.

their eyes meet. she looks away. changes the subject.

                         jamie
                    (re: telescope)
               i'm building a larger one to see
               the nucleus of haley's comet --

                         landon
               the dirty snowball at its core.

                         jamie
               yeah.
                    (beat)
               i'm probably not going to be
               around next time it comes.

                         landon
               in 76 years, me neither.

she likes that he knows a little about astronomy. they
each lean back on a tombstone and stare at the stars.

                         landon
               you're really into god, right?

                         jamie
               in ten words or less?

                         landon
               yeah.

                         jamie
               my relationship with god is my
               own.

                         landon
               but you think about him -- it --
               her.

                         jamie
               don't you?

                         landon

               not really.

pause.

                         jamie
               when you do, how do you?

landon could joke or he could reveal something.

                         landon
               like in a church painting. i see
               this giant hovering over the
               ground. he's wearing a robe, and
               has long flowing hair, and he's
               pointing his finger at something.

                         jamie
               do you ever wonder why things
               happen the way they do?

                         landon
               no.

                         jamie
               i know there's a plan for
               everyone, but sometimes i don't
               understand what the message is --
               or what the point is.

                         landon
               there is no point. you live. you
               die. the end.

                         jamie

               maybe we're not supposed to
               understand, but we're supposed to
               have faith that someone else sees
               the big picture.

                         landon
               you have to believe to have faith.

                         jamie
               you don't believe in anything?

                         landon
               the bible. why should i read a
               bunch of dumb stories about some
               ancient guy who supposedly worked
               miracles.

                         jamie
               interpreted by another guy like my
               father.

                         landon
               your father doesn't like me.

pause.

                         jamie
               he doesn't trust you.

                         landon
               sometimes i don't even trust me.

he sits up and pulls rainmaker scripts from his back
pocket. he holds one out to her. a moment passes. she
takes it.

                         jamie
               i'm not afraid of you.

                         landon

               likewise.
