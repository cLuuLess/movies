they exit the staircase to a small 360 degree overlook.
jamie's amazed at the view.

                         landon
               before the divorce. my father
               used to take me here. fire

they look off to the curve of the horizon, where sea meets
sky.

                         landon
               from here he proved to me the

               on rainy days, we'd be above the
               clouds.

                         jamie
               what would you do up here?

                         landon
               look. talk. not talk.

he pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket. they sit
and he starts to shuffle. not too well. jamie takes the
deck. shuffles like a card shark.
