int. cafeteria - later

jamie sits alone, reading, wearing her old brown sweater.
landon walks by clay and eric at a table.

                         eric
               landon!

                         landon
               later.

puts his tray down on jamie's table and sits. making a
public statement.

                         jamie
               people can see.

                         landon
               and that would ruin your
               reputation how?

she goes back to her book. ignoring him.

                         landon
                    (re: her book)
               what's that?

she doesn't look up. shows him the spine: the scarlet
letter.

                         jamie
               i'm reading all the novels on mr.
               rothberg's best american authors
               list.

                         landon

               how many books are there?

                         jamie
                    (annoyed)
               a hundred. then there's his
               classics list. and his european
               list.

landon realizes this is why she's always reading.

                         landon
               that on your 'life list.' to read
               all those books?

she doesn't deny it. he just dives in.

                         landon
               jamie. maybe i want to try being
               positive.

she looks up. examines his face for the truth.

                         landon
               maybe i miss doing that dumb play
               with you.

students seated near them have overheard. whisper.

                         landon
               maybe you inspire me.

                         jamie
               that sounds like horseshit.

                         landon

               which part?

                         jamie
               all of it.

                         landon
               it's not.

                         jamie
               prove it.

she picks up her books and tray. everyone is watching.

                         landon
               i just did!
