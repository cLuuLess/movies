ext. parking lot - after school

                         landon
               jamie --

                         jamie

               you lack honor. you lack
               compassion. you lack honesty.
               you lack humanity.

she heads to the old pontiac. landon jogs after her.

                         landon
               okay. maybe some of that is
               true --

                         jamie
               you don't know the first thing
               about being someone's friend --

                         landon
               i don't want to be just your
               friend --

                         jamie
               you don't know what you want --

                         landon
               you don't either. take a look at
               yourself. maybe you're scared
               that someone might actually like
               you --

                         jamie
               and why would that scare me?

                         landon
               because then you couldn't hide
               behind your books and your
               telescope and your sweater and
               your god.

she gets into her car. slams the door. starts the
engine. she recognizes the truth.

                         landon
               but the real reason you're scared?
               you like me!

she drives off. clay and eric, watching, guffaw at
landon's spectacle.

                         landon

               if you were really my friends,
               you'd be helping me, not running
               me down.

                         eric
               the only one running you down is
               you.
