ext. beaufort high parking lot - morning (before school)

landon, clay, eric, belinda. eric's pickup is parked by
belinda's cabriolet. radios on, blasting the same
station, same song: john fogerty's "rock and roll girls."

                         eric
               women are definitely evolving into
               men.

                         clay
               the moustaches on some girls.
               unbelievable.

                         belinda
               why is jamie sullivan staring at
               us?

they look. jamie's watching them. they laugh.

                         eric
               she wants to jump landon's bones.

                         belinda
               that is so pitiful.

                         landon
               she's very confused.

                         clay
               deluded.

                         eric
               deranged.

                         landon
               demented.

                         belinda
               she's coming over here...

                         landon
               heart be still.

they laugh more and she's there.

                         jamie
                    (to landon)
               hi.

he doesn't respond. she shifts from foot to foot.
confused.

                         jamie
               the play's going to be really
               good.

                         landon
                    (mocking her)
               i'm really glad you think so.

his friends snicker and guffaw. she looks at them, then
back to landon.

                         jamie
               i guess you don't want to practice
               lines tonight.

                         landon

               you guessed right.

she gives him a funny look and walks away. a better
person than he and he knows it.

                         belinda
               that's one girl who can't take a
               hint.

                         landon
               because she doesn't know what a
               hint is.

they laugh. landon the loudest. it feels good, but he
also feels a little... bad.
