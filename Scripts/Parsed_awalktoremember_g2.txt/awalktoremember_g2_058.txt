int. school auditorium - tuesday evening

landon opens a side door, peers in at the drama club.

landon's pov

a big space with a stage. ms. garber stands before six
geeky boys, and a dozen fat girls and jamie.

back to scene

landon reacts -- this girl actually chooses to be in these
places? ms. garber looks up from her papers.

                         ms. garber
               we're waiting, mr. carter.

he slides in a row behind the others. leans forward and
pokes a boy, eddie jones. eddie's pimply and talks with
his eyes squinched up.

                         landon
               what's the play?

eddie hands him a photocopied script, the rainmaker.

                         eddie
               the-the-there's this drought an'
               -- and a smooth t-t-alking guy
               comes and says he can m-make
               rain --

                         landon

               -- and the ugly farmer's daughter
               falls for him. i saw the movie.

                         eddie
               yeah. it's really g-g-good --

                         landon
               -- it blows.

on stage - minutes later

jamie and landon sit in folding chairs, reading from
scripts. landon's wooden, showing how lame this is.

                         landon
                    (as starbuck)
               'i hope your dreams come true.'

                         jamie
                    (as lizzie, sad)
               'they won't.'

                         landon
                    (as starbuck)
               'believe in yourself and they
               will. let me ask you, lizzie.
               look in the mirror? are you
               pretty --?'

                         ms. garber

               -- landon, are you trying to be
               bad at this?

                         landon
               no, it just comes naturally.

jamie smiles. garber taps her script -- continue.

                         landon
                    (as starbuck)
               'it's got to be inside you. then
               one day the mirror will be the
               eyes of the man who loves you.
               you'll look in that mirror and
               you'll be more than pretty.
               you'll be beautiful.'

ms. garber eyes landon, motions for him to keep going.

                         landon
                    (as starbuck)
               'look at me. tell me what you
               see!'

as lizzie, jamie looks into his eyes.

                         jamie
                    (as lizzie)
               'is it really me?'

                         landon
                    (as starbuck, hamming)
               'yes. you're-you're b-b-
               beautiful.'

hoots and laughter. jamie looks away, humiliated.

                         ms. garber
               quiet!
                    (announcing)
               landon will play the role of bill
               starbuck.

groans among the boys. jamie is horrified. so is landon.

                         landon
                    (to garber)
               no way. no thanks. i can't do
               it --

                         mr. kelly (o.s.)
                    (offstage)
               -- you can and you will, mr.
               carter.

kelly's been standing in the wings.

                         mr. kelly
                    (warning)
               with all the sincerity and dignity
               you can muster.

everyone stares at landon. he's trapped.
