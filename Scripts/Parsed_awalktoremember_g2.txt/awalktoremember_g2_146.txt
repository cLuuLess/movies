int. parsonage - sullivan dining room - evening

landon eats dinner with jamie and reverend sullivan.
silence, then:

                         rev. sullivan
               landon. you're not the quiet
               type.

                         landon
               no.

                         rev. sullivan
               so talk to us about something.

                         landon
               like what, sir?

                         rev. sullivan
               you decide.

landon searches his mind for just the right subject.

                         rev. sullivan
               how about your family?

                         landon
               okay. sure.
                    (beat)
               my grandfather. when he was
               seven, he shook the hand of an old
               guy, a war vet or something, who
               had once shaken president
               lincoln's hand.
                    (pause)
               made a big impression on him.

reverend sullivan looks at his daughter. she's nodding,
interested.

                         landon

               my cousin mike. he's from a big
               family. he's the fifth kid. he
               heard that every fifth child in
               the world is chinese. so he
               thought he was.

jamie smiles.

                         landon
               we didn't tell him any different
               for years --

                         rev. sullivan
                    (getting to the
                    point)
               your parents are divorced?

                         landon
               since i was five. my mom's a
               cocktail waitress.

                         rev. sullivan
               how do you -- the two of you --
               get by?

                         landon
               materially or spiritually?

                         rev. sullivan
                    (surprised)
               either. both.

                         landon

                    (honest)
               i don't know. we used to try to
               believe in each other.

his eyes meet the reverend's. the reverend's got to
respect him some.
