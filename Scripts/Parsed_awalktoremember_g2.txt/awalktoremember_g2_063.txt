int. old pontiac - traveling - moments later

jamie's at the wheel.

                         jamie
               i know you don't want help.

                         landon
               then we both know.
                    (beat)
               i'll point. you drive. faster.

he points the way, to the taillights of the fire trucks.
the wet road glistens.

                         jamie

               we're following fire trucks?

                         landon
               yeah.

                         jamie
               why?

                         landon
                    (duh)
               because that's where the fire is?

he fishes in his pocket for a tape. pulls one out. he's
searching the dash -- no cassette player.

                         landon
               fire is like a living thing.
               wild. unpredictable.

                         jamie
               like me.

                         landon
               no. not like you.

she jerks the car across the center lane. driving on the
wrong side of the road. he grips the dash.

                         landon
               what the -- ?!

                         jamie
               so you agree you need help?

landon's pov - out windshield

headlights looming, a car coming. closer and closer.

back to scene

                         landon
               yes!

she swings the pontiac back to the right lane. smiling.
a car zips by in the other direction, horn blaring.

                         jamie
               really?

landon drops his attitude, his act. he toys with the
glove compartment knob.

                         landon

               yeah. kelly'll make me leave
               school if i screw up the play.

                         jamie
                    (to herself)
               28 and 42.

pause. he acts like he doesn't hear, but he's interested.

                         landon
               what's with the friggin numbers?

                         jamie
               28 is do something illegal. 42 is
               befriend an enemy.

                         landon
               i'm an enemy?

                         jamie
               kinda. yeah.
