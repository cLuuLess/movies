ext. across street from fire - little later

landon and jamie walk around the fire, watching the fire
and the firemen. landon is just tolerating her.

                         jamie
               the reason i got the part... i'm a
               little like lizzie. except i
               don't worry about some man
               rescuing me.

                         landon
               good thing.

if she's offended, she keeps it to herself.

                         landon
               you got some kind of list?

                         jamie
               are you asking to mock me or do
               you really want to know?

                         landon
               maybe a little of both.

they both smile.

                         jamie
               i'll take a chance.

                         landon
               go for it.

                         jamie
               it's like a to-do list, but for my
               life.

he smirks.

                         jamie
               if you can't imagine the future,
               you won't have one.

he lights a cigarette. she reaches for it.

                         landon

                    (joking)
               having a cigarette. 100.

she grins and takes a drag. they share the cigarette.

                         landon
               so what else is on this list?

                         jamie
               it's private.

                         landon
                    (cajoling)
               you want to tell me...

she eyes him, not certain she's willing to risk sharing
her dreams with him.

                         landon
                    (guessing, rudely)
               get very wasted. lose your
               virginity --

                         jamie
                    (correcting)
               spend a year in the peace corps.
               make a medical discovery --

                         landon
                    (contemptuous)
               ambitious.

                         jamie

               being negative's a lot more work
               than being positive.

                         landon
               like you'd know.

                         jamie
               i do know.
                    (pause)
               be two places at once... learn to
               hit a baseball or turn a
               cartwheel... eat breakfast with
               chopsticks...

he likes the frivolity of these.

                         landon
               what's... number one?

she looks away, embarrassed.

                         jamie
                    (changing subject)
               if you want help with your lines,
               i have two conditions.
                    (smiling)
               you have to promise not to fall in
               love with me.

he's certain she's joking.

                         landon
               no problem --

                         jamie
               and you have to meet my father.

he looks at her like she's crazy to worry about this.

                         landon
               fathers love me.
