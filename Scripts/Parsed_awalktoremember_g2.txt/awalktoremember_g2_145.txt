jamie and landon are looking at the heavens through the
telescope.

                         landon
               where's pluto?

                         jamie

               in virgo, but it's about 1000
               times too faint to see.

                         landon
               what's the best thing i can see
               tonight?

                         jamie
               me.

he draws her close, they kiss. she shyly pulls away.
their hands still touching until she looks again into the
telescope eyepiece.

                         jamie
               the second best thing is jupiter.

she swivels the telescope into position for jupiter and
steps aside so he can look. but he picks up the
flashlight, pulls a diagram from his pocket.

                         landon
               can you locate xxi5639i?

                         jamie
               sure.

she takes the diagram, studies it, and adjusts the scope.

                         jamie
               here. why am i looking at this
               star?

                         landon
               because i had it named for you. i
               know it's not an official
               designation --

she couldn't be happier. she reaches for his hand.

                         jamie
               it's wonderful. i love you.

it's the first time he's heard it. he pulls her into his
arms. they kiss. passionately. she starts to object.

                         landon
                    (respecting her
                    boundaries)
               okay. i'm stopping.

and he does. they snuggle. silence, then:

                         landon
               what's number one?

long pause.

                         jamie

                    (very shy)
               in april when the dogwoods and
               wisteria are blooming... get
               married.

he doesn't make fun. he strokes her hair. kisses her
forehead.
