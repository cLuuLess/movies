int. kitchen - 5 am

landon enters from outside. cynthia, still in her
waitress uniform, is sitting at the table, drinking
coffee.

                         cynthia
               a late night or an early morning?

                         landon
                    (honest)
               late night.
                    (smart-aleck)
               you?

                         cynthia
               were you with jamie?

                         landon
               yeah.

                         cynthia
               you sleeping with her?

landon doesn't dignify this question with an answer.

                         cynthia

               i was cleaning yesterday. i found
               this.

she pulls landon's life list from her pocket. landon is
horrified. she reads it.

                         cynthia
               scuba dive. touch a moon rock.
               learn to read egyptian
               hieroglyphs. go to college?
                    (pause)
               she talking to you 'bout this
               stuff?

landon doesn't answer. she puts the list on the table.
smoothes it. gently discouraging.

                         cynthia
               honey, some of this is...
               farfetched. you take after me.
               people skills and common sense.
               good dependable qualities.

                         landon
               i could take after dad, too.

                         cynthia
               you do. you're handsome and
               charming.

                         landon
               i meant he's a doctor.

                         cynthia
               that's eight years of school and
               training -- after college. and
               all that doesn't necessarily make
               you a better human being.

                         landon
               i could do it if i tried. even
               kelly thinks so.

                         cynthia
               that'd be something.

she doesn't want to discourage him, but she wants him to
be practical and realistic.

                         cynthia
               but if it doesn't happen, grab for
               something within reach. life's
               tough enough without causing
               yourself disappointment --

                         landon
                    (angry now)
               whatever my life is, i'm going to
               be friggin' sure i'm never
               disappointed --

                         cynthia

                    (honest)
               disappointment isn't something
               anyone plans for.
                    (quieter)
               it catches you by surprise.

long pause. they are both sorry to have raised their
voices.

                         cynthia
               have i told you how proud i am of
               you -- ?

                         landon
               mom, great. but what i want is
               for me to be proud of me.
