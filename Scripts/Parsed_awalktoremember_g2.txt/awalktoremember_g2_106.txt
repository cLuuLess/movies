int. parsonage - jamie's room - minutes later

jamie hums to herself as she brushes her hair. she's
wearing the new sweater. her father knocks. enters.

                         rev. sullivan
               what's landon carter up to?

                         jamie
                    (innocent)
               up to?

                         rev. sullivan
               i thought we had rid ourselves of
               his disagreeable companionship.

                         jamie

               dad, why don't you get to the
               point where you get to the point.

                         rev. sullivan
               why is he giving you a gift?

jamie doesn't answer.

                         rev. sullivan
               did you give him a gift?

                         jamie
               no.

                         rev. sullivan
               i saw the way he looked at you.
               the way he kissed you.

                         jamie
               it was a play.

                         rev. sullivan
                    (unconvinced)
               boys like him have --
               expectations.

                         jamie
               i have expectations, too.

pause. he's feeling her grow up, grow away.

                         rev. sullivan
               i'm not changing the rules.

                         jamie

               i haven't asked you to.

they eye each other. he's losing her.
