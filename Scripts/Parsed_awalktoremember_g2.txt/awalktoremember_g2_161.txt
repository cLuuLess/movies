ext. dr. carter's home

landon backs away from the house. angrily kicks over a
decorative planter. is halfway to his car when dr. carter
opens the door and comes out.

                         dr. carter
               landon!

landon doesn't hear.

                         dr. carter
               landon!!

landon turns around. sees his father. breaks down,
sobbing. his father goes to him. hugs him, a big bear
hug.

                         landon
               you have to save her!

                         dr. carter
               landon, who? is your mother all
               right?

lights pop upstairs.

                         landon
               it's jamie -- my girlfriend -- she
               has cancer -- you have to come
               look at her -- right now!

                         dr. carter

                    (calm, trying to
                    diffuse)
               it's the middle of the night --

                         landon
               i don't give a shit what time it
               is!

landon pulls away. angrier.

                         dr. carter
               landon, i'm a cardiologist, not an
               oncologist --

                         landon
               you're a doctor, aren't you?!!

he waves his father off, dismissing him.

                         dr. carter
               landon! i'll look into it!!

but landon hasn't heard. he's in his car. dr. carter
watches his son's car move away, regretful.
