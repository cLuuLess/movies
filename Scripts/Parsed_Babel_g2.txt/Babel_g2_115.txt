                mohammed sits outside with three friends drinking coffee.
                from where they are we see the bus and the american tourists.
                a battery powered radio plays moroccan music and commercials
                in the background.
          
                                      mohammed
                          i don't understand why anwar brought
                          them here.
          
                                      friend 1
                          well he spends all his time with
                          them, what do you expect.
          
                                      friend 2
                          the woman is hurt, he had to help
                          her.
          
                                       mohammed
                          yeah?   and when have they helped us?
          
                                      friend 1
                          i liked one of those tourists.
          
                                       friend 2
                          really?   they're all skin and bones.
          
                suddenly mohammed focuses on the radio.
          
                                      mohammed
                          shh... sh... listen.
          
                the friends are quiet.

                          today, near tazarine, there was an
                          incident where an american was shot...
          
                one of the friends interrupts.
          
                                      friend 3
                          hey look, it's the story.
          
                                      friend 2
                          they said tazarine, did you hear?
                          we were on the radio...
          
                                      mohammed
                          shh, shut up.
          
                                                                          67.

                          although authorities say it could
                          have been a foiled robbery, the
                          american government claims they are
                          certain it was a terrorist attack.
                          minister hassef hazal has said that
                          in our country, terrorist cells have
                          been eradicated, that morocco is a
                          peaceful country and that one act of
                          vulgar banditry followed by
                          superficial evaluations such as the
                          u.s. intends to place upon it cannot
                          ruin the image, the economy and the
                          pacifist reputation of our country.
                          american ambassador ken jones,
                          however, insists that it was a
                          terrorist attack on american citizens,
                          that it merits a full investigation,
                          and that the guilty should be
                          punished. so far, the attack has not
                          been attributed to any known terrorist
                          organizations...
          
                mohammed shouts.
          
                                      mohammed
                          i fucking told anwar, i told him he
                          was only going to get us in trouble...
                          he never comes and when he does he
                          always brings trouble...god damn
                          it...
          
                                       friend 1
                          are the americans going to invade
                          our country?
          
                                      mohammed
                          i don't know.
