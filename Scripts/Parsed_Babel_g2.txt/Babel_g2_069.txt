                         in egypt, in a town like this, they
                         slit thirty german tourists' throats.
                         they might do the same to us.
          
                                                                    39.

                                tom

                    out of here as soon as possible.

                                lilly
                    it's very hot, sir, and the driver
                    turned off the air conditioning.
                    i'm feeling sick.
          
                                richard
                    you can't leave us here.

                                james
                    what's the use in staying?
          
                                richard
                    in case i need the bus.
          
                                james
                    they can go drop us off and then
                    come back for you.
          
          douglas (75), a tall old man with good posture, interjects.
          
                                douglas
                    i'll stay with you if you need me.

                                elyse
                    and why would you stay?
          
                                   richard

                    with this.
          
                                tom
                    we're not going to risk our lives,
                    so hurry.
          
          douglas looks defiantly at tom.
          
                                douglas
                    you do what you have to do, we'll
                    wait.
          
                                                                            40.
