          158   ext. patio, anwar's house -- afternoon
          
                the policeman, anwar and richard are chatting in the patio.
          
                                      richard
                              (to anwar)
                          when did he find out?
          
                                      anwar
                              (in arabic)
                          when did you know?
          
                                      policeman
                              (in arabic)
                          a while ago... they said the ambulance
                          isn't coming anymore.
          
                                      anwar
                          a while ago... he says the ambulance
                          broke down.
          
                                      richard
                          what? tell him to call another one.
                          he has to get another one.
          
                                      anwar
                              (in arabic, to the
                               policeman)
                          he wants you to call another
                          ambulance.
          
                                      policeman
                              (in arabic)
                          you know there isn't another one.
          
                                      anwar
                              (to richard)
                          there isn't another ambulance.
          
                                                                     90.
          
                                richard
                    what the hell do you mean there isn't
                    another ambulance? you've got to get
                    her out of here...
          
          he faces the police officer.
          
                                richard (cont'd)
                    she can't stay here or she'll die.
                    call another fucking ambulance...
          
          the policeman cannot understand and remains expressionless.
          
                                 richard (cont'd)
                    come on, move... call another
                    ambulance...
          
                                anwar
                        (in arabic)
                    he asks how we're going to get the
                    woman out of here.
          
                                policeman
                        (in arabic)
                    tell him that they told me that his
                    embassy is going to deal with it.
          
                                anwar
                    he says your embassy will deal with
                    the matter.
          
          richard now shouts at anwar.
          
                                richard
                    how the fuck are they going to deal
                    with it? it's your shitty fucking
                    country's responsibility.
          
                                policeman
                        (in arabic)
                    the americans want to send one of
                    their helicopters but i think there
                    are some problems.
          
          anwar mulls over his answer.   he seems to want to lie again.
          
                                anwar
                    they're going to try to send a
                    helicopter.
          
                                richard
                        (incredulous)
                    a helicopter?... let's get out of
                    here...
          
          he starts walking. anwar catches up to him.
          
                                                                     91.
          
                                anwar
                    where?
          
          richard turns to him, desperate.
          
                                richard
                    i need to make a phone call.
          
          they turn towards the exit leaving the cop behind, who doesn't
          seem to understand. tom and james take advantage of the
          situation to go talk to richard.
          
                                tom
                    we can't stay here any longer. it's
                    going to get dark soon. lots of
                    people aren't feeling well and its
                    dangerous to stay here.
          
          richard explodes and pushes tom.
          
                                richard
                    stop fucking with me.
          
                                tom
                    don't you dare push me.
          
                                richard
                    oh no?
          
          he pushes him again, angrily.
          
                                tom
                    what are you doing, you stupid fuck?
          
                                richard
                    leave asshole.
          
          tom shoves him.
          
                                tom
                    fuck you.
          
          richard becomes furious and loses it, hitting him over and
          over again. some of the tourists get involved. james manages
          to grab him with anwar.
          
                                james
                    hey, take it easy.
          
                                richard
                    i'm fed up with that asshole.
          
          james pulls him away while other tourists pull tom away.
          
                                james
                    try to calm down.
          
                                                                          92.
          
                                      richard
                          calm down? my wife is dying up there.
          
                                      james
                          come with us.
          
                                      richard
                          where the fuck do you want me to
                          take her?
          
                                      james
                          try to understand, many of them can't
                          go on. tell me, honestly, is there
                          any point in us staying?
          
                richard threatens him.
          
                                      richard
                          you leave and i'll kill you...
          
                james is going to say something, but richard turns around
                and walks away as he is about to say something. anwar follows.
