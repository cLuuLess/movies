          155   int. room, anwar's house -- afternoon
          
                dusk. susan sleeps and richard looks at the vast desert
                through the window. anwar, sitting on a chair, with a fan
                clears away the flies hovering around susan. we can hear the
                call to prayer and anwar prostrates himself toward mecca.
          
                richard observes anwar's prayer and then looks at susan who
                moans in her sleep.
