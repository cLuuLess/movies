          178   ext. cluster of mesquites -- day
          
                they arrive at the cluster. the two trucks park and the
                three get out. she is still cuffed. a helicopter hovers
                above them.
          
                they walk around: nothing.
          
                                      john
                          there's nobody here.
          
                                      amelia
                              (to eliseo, in spanish)
                          i left them about a kilometer in
                          from the road.
          
                                      eliseo
                              (in spanish)
                          which road?
          
                she doesn't know what to say.    john grabs her by the arm and
                drags her toward the vehicle.
          
                                      john
                          i don't believe you.
          
                amelia looks at him desperately.
          
                                      amelia
                              (in english)
                          i swear they're around here.
          
                john is not affected.   he keeps pulling her.
          
                                      eliseo
                              (in english)
                          john, wait, maybe she's telling the
                          truth.
          
                                      john
                          maybe she's not, let's go.
          
                                                                            107.
          
                                      amelia
                          please sir, believe me.
          
                john pays no attention.   she turns to eliseo.
          
                                      amelia (cont'd)
                              (in spanish)
                          i swear, they're lost, they're going
                          to die. i have to find them.
          
                john keeps pulling her. he puts her in the truck and closes
                the door before eliseo's passive gaze.
          
                                      amelia (cont'd)
                              (in english)
                          please no... please...
