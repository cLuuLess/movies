          163   ext. balcony, chieko's apartment -- night
          
                she opens the door to the balcony and points at the void:
                it's over twelve floors. kenji looks over; the distance is
                dizzying. chieko writes in her notebook and shows him the
                piece of paper.
          
                                      kenji
                          you saw her jump?
          
                she nods and writes again.    she looks perturbed.
          
                                      kenji (cont'd)
                          you've already told the other
                          officers?
          
                she nods again.   kenji holds her by her arms.
          
                                      kenji (cont'd)
                          i don't know what you're talking
                          about.
          
                chieko remains motionless for a few seconds. she scrawls in
                her notebook "then why do you want to talk to my father?"
                kenji reads and then turns to her.
          
                                      kenji (cont'd)
                          it's about a hunting rifle in his
                          name.
          
                the red bulb on the gadget starts to blink. chieko spots it
                from the balcony and signals to kenji that she has to go to
                the kitchen. she runs off.
