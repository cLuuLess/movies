                          internally, and there's been some
                          clotting so there's a high risk of
                          gangrene.
          
                                       richard
                              (insistently, as if
                               he hadn't heard the
                               doctor)
                          but she's going to be ok?
          
                the moroccan doctor puts his hand on richard's shoulder and
                thinks about his answer.
          
                                      moroccan doctor
                          yes, she's going to be ok.
          
                the doctor leaves and richard goes back to looking at his
                wife through the glass.
          
                the doctors are still prepping her.   richard walks in.
