          116   int. anwar's house -- day
          
                susan lies on the floor with her neck shoddily stitched and
                a splint on her shoulder made out of a few sticks and some
                dirty bandages. she moans in pain and mumbles curses.
          
                                      susan
                          i hate you... i hate you...
          
                she tries to stand, but the doctor impedes it.
          
                                      doctor
                              (to anwar in arabic)
                          tell her not to move; the bullet's
                          still inside.
          
                                                                             68.
          
                                      anwar
                              (to susan)
                          don't move, miss. the bullet is still
                          inside you.
          
                                      susan
                          i don't give a shit...
          
                                      richard
                          my love, don't move.
          
                                      susan
                          i want to call the kids.
          
                                      richard
                          you can't move, calm down.
          
                                      susan
                          i want to talk to them.
          
                                      richard
                          you can't; there's only one phone in
                          town. i'll call them later.
          
                she seems obsessed by the idea.
          
                                      susan
                          i want to talk to them...
          
                she tries to stand again. as they struggle, the grandmother
                takes out a hash pipe form a drawer and lights it. she gives
                it two drags and squats next to susan.
          
                she shows her how to smoke it and hands it over. the old
                woman's serenity is such that susan acquiesces. she takes
                four drags and slowly starts to relax.
          
                susan smokes another three times, relaxes and closes her
                eyes. the old woman goes to get the clump of mud and starts
                to spread it on susan's neck. susan does not protest.
                richard watches the scene in awe.
