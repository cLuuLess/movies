                santiago, a little bit drunk, and amelia, carrying debbie
                who has passed out, say goodbye to luis and patricia. sleepy,
                mike leans on the hood of the car.
          
                                      luis
                              (all in spanish)
                          stay the night.
          
                                      amelia

                          home and it's almost dawn.
          
                                      luis
                          but santiago's pretty drunk.
          
                                      santiago

                          and come back in an hour.

                          school.
          
                santiago opens the door for amelia, who carefully sets debbie
                on the back seat. mike gets in and as soon as he does he
                nestles in to go to sleep.
          
                                      amelia (cont'd)
                          see you soon, son.
          
                luis and amelia hug each other.    then amelia hugs her daughter-
                in-law.
          
                                                                             82.
          
                                      amelia (cont'd)
                          congratulations, dear.
                              (she points at her
                               belly)

                          dying to be a grandmother.
          
                she gives her a kiss and gets in the car.   luis turns to
                santiago.
          
                                      luis
                          you sure you're not too drunk?
          
                                      santiago
