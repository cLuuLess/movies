          179   int. room, anwar's house -- afternoon
          
                night begins to fall. from the window we can hear the noises
                of the town: voices, goats bleating, camels moaning, music
                from a radio.
          
                susan wakes from her slumber and turns to richard, who is
                leaning on a wall, tired, sweaty, with his eyes closed.
          
                                       susan
                          richard.
          
                                      richard
                          what do you need?
          
                                      susan
                          richard... if i die, take care of
                          the kids. especially mike, he really
                          needs you.
          
                                      richard
                          you're not going to die. you can't
                          die. you just can't.
          
                                      susan
                          don't ever leave them again.
          
                                      richard
                          no, i'm not going to leave them and
                          don't you even think about leaving
                          me, because i'll kill you like
                          nobody's killed you before.
          
                she smiles.   he caresses her.
          
                                      susan
                          i peed my pants.
          
                                       richard
                          what?
          
                                                                        108.
          
                                susan
                    i couldn't hold it in and i peed.
          
          richard touches between her legs and feels the moisture.
          
                                richard
                    i'm going to tell mike on you, so
                    you never scold him again.
          
          they both laugh.   she grimaces in pain when she does.
          
                                susan
                    i need to pee again.
          
                                richard
                        (to anwar)
                    do you have a pot i can borrow?
          
          anwar looks in a corner and hands it over.
          
                                richard (cont'd)
                        (to anwar)
                    can you leave us alone for a moment?
          
          the grandmother and anwar exit.
          
                                richard (cont'd)
                    come, try it like this.
          
          he lifts up her dress, pulls down her underpants and sets
          the basin under her. she puts her arm around him to pull
          herself up, but can't move her right arm.
          
                                 susan
                    i can't.
          
          they laugh.   he kisses her.   we start to hear the stream.
          
                                 susan (cont'd)
                    now i can.
          
          while she pees, they kiss painfully.    she starts to cry.
          
                                richard
                    forgive me my love. when pat died i
                    didn't know what to do, the pain
                    drove me crazy... i was scared, that's
                    why i left... forgive me.
          
                                susan
                    i was scared too... when i saw pat
                    lying still in his crib...
          
          her voice breaks up and she can barely go on.
          
                                                                         109.
          
                                      susan (cont'd)
                          it wasn't my fault, it wasn't... i
                          couldn't do anything for him...
          
                                      richard
                          no, it wasn't your fault. i was
                          wrong...
          
                he strokes her head.
          
                                       richard (cont'd)
                          shhh... it wasn't your fault my love,
                          it wasn't anybody's fault... pat
                          just left...
                              (a beat)
                          forgive me, please.
          
                                      susan
                          forgive me for not forgiving you.
          
                richard hugs her and starts to laugh.
          
                                      richard
                          you missed; you got my leg.
          
                they both laugh, and as they do, the blanket covering susan's
                wound slips off. richard sees her swollen, bruised arm. he
                touches it.
          
                                      richard (cont'd)
                          does it hurt?
          
                                      susan
                          so much... so much...
          
                richard looks worried and leaves the room.
