               richard (45), tall, thin, weathered, and susan (38), good-
               looking, with an athletic body, visit the impressive casbah
               with a group of american, french and english tourists. most
               of them are old, with a few couples in their forties or
               fifties.
          
                                                                         15.
          
               anwar (30), a man with a kind face, is the tour guide showing
               them around.
          
                                     anwar
                             (in english, with an
                              arabic accent)
                         the berbers built these kasbahs.
                         they made them like forts and here
                         they would reside after finishing
                         their caravans.
          
               richard listens attentively.   susan looks hot.
          
                                     richard
                         this place is beautiful, don't you
                         think?
          
                                     susan
                             (not very
                              enthusiastically)
                         yeah, yeah it's very pretty...
          
               anwar walks toward one end of the aisles and calls the group.
          
                                      anwar
                         now, i'd like to show you the
                         materials that were used to build
                         the walls...
          
               the herd moves docile toward anwar's voice.
