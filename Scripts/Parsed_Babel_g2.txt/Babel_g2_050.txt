          50   ext. desert highway -- day
          
               santiago parks the car next to a junkyard.   amelia and debbie
               run out and hide behind a fence.
          
               debbie pulls her underpants down to pee.   troubled, she looks
               at the mound of destroyed cars.
          
                                     debbie
