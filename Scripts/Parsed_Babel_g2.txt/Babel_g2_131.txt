          131   ext. desert -- day
          
                yussef and ahmed dig up the rifle and the bullets in front
                of their parents and sisters.
          
                abdullah grabs the rifle, dusts it off and puts the bullets
                in his bag. he turns to yasira.
          
                                                                            76.

                          we're going to hide out at naguib's
                          house. if the cops come, tell them
                          we went south.
          
                with the rifle in hand, abdullah runs off, followed by yussef
                and ahmed. the women watch them get lost on the horizon.
