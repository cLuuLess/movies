               house and abdullah gets out. he raises his hand to say
               goodbye.
          
                                     abdullah
                         thank you, i'll see you tomorrow.

               turns to yussef.
          
                                     abdullah (cont'd)
                         tell your mother to prepare dinner.

               towards a little field below the house. yasira is plowing
               with a manual plow.
          
                                     yussef
                         mother, mother, father says he wants
