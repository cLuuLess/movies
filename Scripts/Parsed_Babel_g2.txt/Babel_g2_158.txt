          160   ext. hamlet -- evening
          
                richard runs after the bus as it drives away down the side
                streets.
          
                                        richard
                            stop... stop... stop you mother-
                            fuckers stop...
          
                the bus vanishes into the distance. richard picks up a stone
                and hurls it impotently.
