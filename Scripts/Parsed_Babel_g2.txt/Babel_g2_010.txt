          10   ext. desert -- day
          
               the goats graze. yussef and ahmed watch them sitting on the
               side of a hill. they look hot and bored. they both throw
               stones at a small rusty can. yussef throws one and misses.
               ahmed throws his and does. he draws a line in the ground.
          
                                        ahmed
                         five to two.
          
               a jackal is stalking the goats.    yussef spots it.
          
                                                                            5.
          
                                     yussef
                         there's a jackal over there.
          
               ahmed raises his head but cannot see it. yussef points at
               it, but ahmed still cannot locate it. yussef despairs.
          
                                       yussef (cont'd)
                         over there.
          
               ahmed finally spots it. he loads the rifle, but when he is
               about to aim, the rifle fires. the shot hits amidst the
               goats, lifting up a small cloud of dust.
          
                                     yussef (cont'd)
                         what are you doing, you idiot?
          
               the jackal flees, terrified, while the goats scamper in
               different directions.
