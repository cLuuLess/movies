          114   int. room, anwar's house -- day
          
                the doctor enters the room.
          
                                      doctor
                              (in arabic)
                          allah be with you.
          
                                      anwar's grandmother
                              (in arabic)
                          allah be with you.
          
                richard just bows his head slightly. the doctor walks over
                to susan, shoos the flies away and examines the wound. she
                looks at him, anxious.
          
                                      doctor
                              (in arabic)
                          the bullet didn't hit her spine or
                          split her jugular. but it did shatter
                          her clavicle and she could bleed to
                          death.
          
                anwar looks worried.
          
                                      richard
                          what did he say?
          
                                      anwar
                          he says she will be fine.
          
                                      richard
                          stop lying to me god damn it, and
                          tell me what the fuck he said!
          
                the doctor addresses richard in terrible english.
          
                                      doctor
                          hospital... need hospital...
          
                                      richard
                          yes, we know that. what can you do
                          in the meantime?
          
                                      doctor
                              (in arabic, to anwar)
                          tell him i have to stitch up the
                          wound to stop the bleeding.
          
                                                                    64.
          
          anwar draws close to richard and whispers.
          
                                anwar
                    he has to sew up her wounds.
          
          susan turns to look at them, suspicious.
          
                                susan
                    what did he say?
          
          richard gets nervous.
          
                                richard
                    you need some stitches.
          
                                susan
                    what do you mean stitches?
          
          the doctor opens his kit and takes out a rudimentary needle
          and thread. he gets ready to sew. richard questions him,
          also in whispers.
          
                                richard
                    you're not going to give her any
                    anesthetic?
          
          the doctor and anwar exchange a look.
          
                                anwar
                        (to richard)
                    no, he doesn't use anesthetic.
          
                                richard
                    what kind of doctor is he?
          
          anwar answers naively, in a low voice.
          
                                anwar
                    he's a veterinarian, but he is good.
          
          richard looks at him, surprised and angry.
          
                                richard
                    he can't take care of her.
          
                                susan
                    richard, he might infect the wound...
          
          richard can't answer as he focuses on what the doctor says.
          
                                doctor
                        (in arabic)
                    tell him that if i don't stitch up
                    her wound she may bleed to death.
          
                                                                        65.
          
                                anwar
                    if he doesn't sew up the wound, she
                    may bleed to death.
          
                                doctor
                        (in arabic, to anwar)
                    and tell him her clavicle is broken.
                    we have to fasten a splint to it.
          
                                anwar
                    he says she has a broken bone and he
                    has to put a splint on it.
          
          richard remains pensive for a moment. he looks at susan,
          then at the doctor and assents tentatively.
          
                                doctor
                        (in arabic)
                    we're going to have to hold her down.
          
          he mimes holding her down with his hands. richard leans over
          susan, who weakly languishes on the rug.
          
                                richard
                    honey, this is going to hurt a little.
          
          she stares at him. richard turns to anwar and signals that
          he can begin. anwar holds her hands. susan, stupefied, to
          richard.
          
                                susan
                    richard, don't let him...
          
          the doctor lifts susan's neck and starts to stitch.    she
          howls in pain and tries to move away.
          
          anwar and richard hold susan down.    the doctor sticks the
          needle in again.
          
          susan shakes her head from side to side trying to pull away.
          
                                susan (cont'd)
                    don't let him, don't let him.
          
                                richard
                    calm down... calm down... susan,
                    they have to sew you up... relax...
          
          richard holds her head to keep her still. she resists.
          
                                susan
                    no, no...no..
          
                                richard
                    honey, please try to relax...
          
                                                                          66.
          
                the doctor rubs alcohol on the wound and starts to stitch.
                she moans in pain. richard puts a rag in her mouth, on which
                she bites down.
