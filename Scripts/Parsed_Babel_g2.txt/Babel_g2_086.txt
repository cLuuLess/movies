          86   int. chieko's room -- day
          
               chieko sits in front of a mute t.v., channel surfing.   she
               stops at a fashion show, then some cartoons.
          
               suddenly, on a news program, we see the photographs of ahmed
               and yussef. chieko looks at them for a moment and then
               changes the channel. she is watching t.v. when a red bulb,
               set between a yellow bulb and a blue one, starts to light up
               insistently as the doorbell rings.
          
               chieko notices and shuts off the t.v.
