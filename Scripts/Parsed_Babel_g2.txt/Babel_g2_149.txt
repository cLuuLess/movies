                                                                            85.
          
                                      santiago
                              (in spanish)
                          see, i told you you shouldn't have
                          brought them. i told you. i told
                          you..
          
                a trailer drives slowly. santiago decides to drive around
                it blindly, and almost drives off the other side of the road.
          
                                      amelia
                              (in spanish)
                          santiago, stop acting crazy and stop
                          the car... santiago, stop...
          
                santiago ignores her, concentrated on his driving. he looks
                through the rear-view mirror. there is nobody behind him,
                only the dark highway. santiago steps on the gas.
          
                amelia tries to comfort the kids.
          
                                      amelia (cont'd)
                              (in english)
                          everything's all right sweeties...
          
                the children won't stop crying, terrified by the speed.
                through one of his mirrors, santiago sees two patrol cars
                following him with their turrets flashing.
          
                                      santiago
                              (in spanish)
                          fucking asshole gringo mother-fuckers,
                          here they come...
          
                santiago accelerates. the car seems to be out of control.
                the children scream. amelia tries to stop santiago.
          
                                      amelia
                              (in spanish)
                          stop... stop...
          
                santiago reaches a path and heads toward it.
