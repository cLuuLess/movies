          89   ext. highway, desert -- morning
          
               alarid (40), a federal cop, tall, in an impeccable uniform
               with numerous rank badges, stands on the highway examining
               the site of the shot with the old man who was driving.
          
                                                                         52.
          
               in the distance we can see a police checkpoint stopping some
               cars and, after checking them, letting them go.
          
                                      alarid
                             (to the old man, the
                              entire dialogue in
                              arabic)
                         are you sure it was here?
          
                                     old man
                         sure. i drive down this road every
                         day. the american tried to stop me
                         right here.
          
               he stands more or less where richard tried to stop him.
          
                                     old man (cont'd)
                         i was scared. he was covered in
                         blood and i was coming from picking
                         up my grandson from his work.
          
                                     alarid
                         where was the bus?
          
               the old man points some twenty yards behind him.
          
                                       old man
                         over there.
          
               alarid walks toward where the old man said and looks out at
               the mountains. some of his men are visible at the tops.
               alarid talks to them by radio.
          
                                     alarid
                         look further to the right.
          
               we can see some men exploring the terrain.
          
                                     alarid (cont'd)
                             (to the old man)
                         why did you wait so long to contact
                         the police?
          
                                     old man
                         i had to drive my grandson home.
          
               the radio crackles.
          
                                     policeman voice
                         captain alarid, captain alarid... we
                         found the cartridges.
