          140   ext. hamlet "los lobos" -- day
          
                the band plays various norte√±o songs. everyone waits for
                the music to start. after a while a couple starts to timidly
                dance. then another, and another, until the dance floor
                becomes a sway of heads moving to the same rhythm.
          
                amelia dances with mike and debbie with santiago; both amelia
                and santiago show them a few steps.
          
                                      santiago
                              (to debbie, in spanish)
                          like this, look...
          
                he kicks his heel back, then forward. debbie watches,
                entertained. jacinto (55), overweight and with a good-natured
                face, moves closer to amelia and watches her dance for a
                while, she notices and stops, embarrassed.
          
                                       jacinto
                               (both in spanish)
                          amelia, will you let me dance with
                          you?
          
                amelia remains unperturbed, without answering him.
          
                                      jacinto (cont'd)
                          i've been asking you for a dance for
                          30 years. does it really cost you
                          that much?
          
                                                                              79.
          
                amelia stares at him.
          
                                      amelia
                          i don't think your wife would have
                          liked that.
          
                                      jacinto
                          c'mon amelia, she's been dead for 10
                          years.
          
                amelia looks around and then turns to him.
          
                                      amelia
                          okay, just one.
          
                jacinto chivalrously takes her by the waist and they begin
                to dance. santiago watches them, amused, and continues to
                dance with mike and debbie.
          
                jacinto draws amelia closer and they kiss gently.
