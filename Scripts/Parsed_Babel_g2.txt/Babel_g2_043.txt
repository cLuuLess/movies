          43   int. yussef and ahmed's house -- night
          
               night. an oil lamp in a nescafe jar lights the house. the
               family sleeps in the only two rooms in the house. one of
               them is the parents room, the other the children's.
          
               we hear a goat bleating in the darkness. abdullah's snoring.
               yasira's breathing. the crunching of wood in the night cold.
          
               neither yussef, nor ahmed can sleep.   they both look at each
               other, anxious.
