              abdullah's family is inside the house. there is a room, a
              small table and a simple kitchen. yasira (38) is roasting
              some goat meat assisted by yamil (16) and zora (17), her
              daughters.
          
              abdullah and his sons, yussef (13) and ahmed (14), are sitting
              on the floor around the small table, looking at a well-
              conserved .270 caliber winchester 60 rifle.
          
                                    hassan
                            (to abdullah)
                        it's almost new.
          
              he takes out several boxes of cartridges from his satchel.

                                    hassan (cont'd)
                        the hunter who gave it to me said
                        you can hit up to three kilometers
                        away.
          
                                    abdullah
                        how much do you want for everything?
          
                                    hassan
                        one thousand dirhams.
          
                                                                           2.
          
                                    abdullah
                        one thousand dirhams? i'll give you
                        one thousand and a goat.
          
              abdullah and hassan exchange a look and hassan smiles.
