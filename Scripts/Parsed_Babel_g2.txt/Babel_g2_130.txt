                a cop interrogates hassan. his face is badly bruised and
                his hands are cuffed behind his back.
          
                                      cop
                          what organization gave you the weapon?
          
                                      hassan
                          i've told you it wasn't an
                          organization; i got it from a hunter.
          
                                         cop
                          what hunter?
          
                                      hassan
                          a japanese hunter gave it to me many
                          years ago. i've got a picture inside.

                he turns to look at his wife. she has also been beaten and
                is guarded by two cops. the interrogating cop authorizes
                her. she walks in and comes out with a photograph of hassan
                with yasujiro, posing with the scimitar-horned oryx. he hands
                it over and the cop examines it.
          
                                      hassan (cont'd)
                          he's holding the rifle he gave me.
