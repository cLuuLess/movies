          182   ext. anwar's house -- day
          
                richard and the vet carry susan out on a wheelbarrow. it is
                very difficult to move her. she is clearly in pain and groans
                quietly.
          
                outside the house is the policeman with his peugeot. anwar
                is talking to him.
          
                richard and the vet carry susan all the way to the car.
                richard stands before the policeman he humiliated earlier.
          
                                      richard
                          thank you for lending us the car.
          
                anwar translates.
          
                                       anwar
                               (in arabic)
                          he thanks you for lending us the
                          car.
          
                the policeman nods kindly.
          
                dozens of girls and boys and a few adults stare at the scene.
          
                gingerly, richard, anwar and the vet lift her into the car
                and softly lay her on the back seat.
          
                                                                           111.
          
                even so, she screams in pain.
          
                                      susan
                          ahhh... ahhh...
          
                richard holds her hand and squeezes it.
          
                                      richard
                          sweetie, you've got to hold on.
          
                richard gets into the car, and as they're about to drive
                off, the shopkeeper runs up to them.
          
                                      tendero
                              (in arabic)
                          stop... stop...
          
                the shopkeeper catches up to them.
          
                                      tendero (cont'd)
                              (in arabic)
                          they're calling from the american
                          embassy.
