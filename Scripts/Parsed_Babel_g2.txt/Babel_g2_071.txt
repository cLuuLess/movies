          71   int. room, anwar's house -- day
          
               susan is lying on the floor, desolate. it seems as if the
               pain is diminishing. the grandmother leans over her and softly
               caresses her with her dirty, wrinkled hands. this startles
               susan.
          
                                     anwar's grandmother
                             (in arabic)
                         how do you feel?
          
               susan is a little bit uncomfortable with her this close.
          
                                     susan
                         can i have some water?
          
               the old woman doesn't seem to understand. she grabs a basket
               of dates and offers them to her. susan shakes her head.
          
                                        susan (cont'd)
                         no, water...
          
               with her hand, susan mimes drinking a glass of water. the
               old woman seems to understand. she pours some water from a
               jar, leans over her and helps her drink in small sips.
          
                                        susan (cont'd)
                         thanks.
          
               the grandmother bows her head as if to say "your welcome."
          
                                     susan (cont'd)
                         where's my husband?
          
               the old woman just smiles. susan makes a gesture of
               desperation. the grandmother leans over her, unfurls her
               index finger and points at her heart.
          
                                     anwar's grandmother
                             (in arabic)
                         trust in god.
          
               susan keeps looking at her as she slowly gets up and goes to
               sit in a chair.
          
                                                                        41.
