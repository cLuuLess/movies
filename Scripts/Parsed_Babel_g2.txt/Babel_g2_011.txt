               both brothers are sitting under a tree, eating bread and
               drinking water from a goatskin canteen.
          
                                     yussef
                         zora doesn't mind.
          
               ahmed keeps eating without turning to look at his brother.
          
                                     ahmed
                         she doesn't, but i do.
          
                                     yussef
                         this is between her and me.
          
                                     ahmed
                         you're both pigs. next time i'm
                         going to tell my dad.
          
                                     yussef
                         stay out of this.
          
                                      ahmed
                         if you want me to stay out of it,
                         don't do it.
          
               yussef gets annoyed, stand up and leaves.
