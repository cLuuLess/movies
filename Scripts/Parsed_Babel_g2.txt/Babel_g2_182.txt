                                police officer
                        (in english)
                    ma'am, it was a miracle that we found
                    those kids. i don't know how you
                    could leave them alone in the desert.
          
                                amelia
                    i had to look for help.
          
                                 police officer
                    your reckless behavior endangered
                    their lives.
          
          amelia stops arguing.   she looks worried.
          
                                amelia
                    how are they?
          
                                police officer
                    that's none of your business, ma'am.
          
          the man's words hurt amelia, who looks away to avoid crying.
          
                                police officer (cont'd)
                    you've committed serious crimes.
          
                                amelia
                    i just took the kids to my son's
                    wedding.
          
                                police officer
                    no ma'am, you did not just do that.
                    you took them to another country
                    without their parents' permission
                    and you put them in danger.
          
                                amelia
                    sir, i raised these kids since they
                    were born. i take care of them day
                    and night. i feed them breakfast,
                    lunch and dinner. i play with them.
                    mike and debbie are like my own
                    children.
          
                                police officer
                        (sternly)
                    but they are not your kids, ma'am.
          
                                amelia
                    what about my nephew, santiago?
          
                                police officer
                    i don't have any information on him.
          
          amelia looks destitute.
          
                                                                          114.
          
                                      police officer (cont'd)
                          we located the parents in morocco.
                          they're very angry, but they've
                          decided not to raise charges.
          
                amelia exhales, relieved.   the policeman leans toward her.
          
                                      police officer (cont'd)
                          nevertheless, the government of the
                          united states has deemed you were
                          seriously breaking the law and has
                          decided to immediately and
                          definitively deport you.
          
                amelia loses her breath.
          
                                      amelia
                          i've been living here for fifteen
                          years. my things are here, i rent a
                          house, i made my life here.
          
                                      police officer
                          you should've thought of that
                          beforehand.
          
                                      amelia
                          i want to talk to a lawyer.
          
                                      police officer
                          if you attempt to take this to court,
                          i assure you you will end up in jail.
                          if you want my advice, accept the
                          deportation and never come back.
