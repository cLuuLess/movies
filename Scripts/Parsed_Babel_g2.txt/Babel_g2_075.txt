          75   int. room, anwar's house -- day
          
               susan is lying down. a small pool of blood has collected
               under her neck. she looks restless. she whispers weakly.
          
                                     susan
                         get me out of here... please...
          
                                     richard
                         i'm going to as soon as i can. i've
                         already called rachel; she's going
                         to tell the embassy.
          
                                     susan
                         i told you we shouldn't have come.
          
               just then anwar enters. the grandmother takes the basin and
               sets it in a corner. she gets some pieces of cloth and starts
               to soak them.
          
                                     richard
                         how long until the ambulance gets
                         here?
          
                                     anwar
                         about an hour and a half. it's coming
                         from alnif.
          
                                     richard
                         that much? isn't there anyone here
                         who could take her?
          
                                                                     44.
          
          anwar shakes his head.
          
                                richard (cont'd)
                    we've got to get her out of here.
                    there's no one to tend to her.
          
                                 anwar
                    my brother already called a doctor,
                    he's coming.
          
          richard is going to say something, but holds back.   his
          despair and confusion are evident.
          
                                anwar (cont'd)
                    trust my grandmother; she knows a
                    lot about remedies.
          
          the grandmother wrings out the rags and puts them on a table.
          she takes some herbs, a fistful of earth from the floor and
          she tosses them into the basin. she stirs it and pulls out
          a clump of mud which she lays out on one of the pieces of
          cloth.
          
          susan looks horrified at the dirt. the grandmother leans
          over her and tries to clean the wound with the other moistened
          rags. susan resists.
          
                                anwar's grandmother
                        (in arabic)
                    i have to clean you.
          
                                anwar
                        (to susan)
                    miss, my grandmother is going to
                    help you.
          
          the grandmother finishes cleaning her with the damp cloths
          and grabs the clump of mud. she tries to put it on the wound,
          but susan flinches.
          
                                susan
                    no, not that.
          
                                anwar's grandmother
                        (in arabic)
                    it will stop the bleeding.
          
                                susan
                    no, no... not that...
          
          richard intervenes.
          
                                richard
                        (to anwar)
                    let's wait for the doctor.
          
                                                                            45.
