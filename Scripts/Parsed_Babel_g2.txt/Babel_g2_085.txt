          85   int. chieko's apartment -- day
          
               chieko walks into the apartment. it is a large apartment,
               elegantly furnished. although decoration is scant, some
               hunting trophies stand out: a scimitar-horned oryx, sheep,
               and others. there are also photographs of yasujiro hunting.
          
               a wall is dedicated to family photos. among them is a picture
               of chieko as a little girl with her father and her mother.
          
               chieko sees a note on the table at the entrance. she puts
               the policeman's card down and picks up a note from her father
               that says: "i waited until five and you didn't make it.
               i've got a meeting and i'll be back late. i left you some
               soup and some chicken for dinner. kisses. papa."
