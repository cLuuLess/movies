          5   ext. goat corral -- later
          
              yussef takes one of the goats out, ties and ropes it and
              gives it to hassan. abdullah supervises. yasira approaches
              and gives abdullah a bag.
          
                                      yasira
                        your lunch.

                        you better kill at least three
                        jackals.
          
                                    hassan
                        and make sure no one sees you with
                        the rifle, hide it if you see someone
                        approach you.
          
              ahmed nods.   abdullah and hassan go on their way.
