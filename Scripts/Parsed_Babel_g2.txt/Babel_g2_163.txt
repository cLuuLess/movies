          165   ext. desert -- day
          
                abdullah, afraid, watches his son shoot. the police have
                stopped firing and run for cover. yussef loads the rifle
                again and aims carefully. he shoots and, in the distance,
                we can see one of the headlights on a police truck shatter.
          
                abdullah shouts at yussef desperately.
          
                                      abdullah
                          yussef, stop shooting!
          
                furious, yussef loads the rifle again and starts shooting at
                the cops. ahmed won't stop screaming from the pain. confused,
                abdullah doesn't know if he should console his wounded son
                or stop the enraged yussef.
          
                in the distance, the cops reorganize.    we hear the faraway
                shots of alarid giving orders.
          
                                      alarid
                          move that truck... god damn it...
          
                one of the cops gets onto a truck and uses it as a parapet.
                yussef aims again, but this time the policemen are well
                covered. abdullah drags himself all the way to yussef.
          
                                                                     98.
          
                                abdullah
                    give me that rifle...
          
          yussef turns to his father.
          
                                yussef
                    they're going to kill us.
          
                                abdullah
                    give me that rifle.
          
          he tries to wrest it away, but yussef resists. the struggle
          and abdullah finally pulls it away. when yussef tries to
          snatch it back, the police fire a round of shots and the two
          barely have time to hide.
          
          the air is thick with gunshots. yussef and abdullah,
          terrified, stick to the stones. the bullets strike very
          close to them, and they can't even raise their heads.
          
          ahmed won't stop complaining.    abdullah shouts at him.
          
                                abdullah (cont'd)
                    ahmed, don't move.
          
          the gunshots rain down for over a minute. when they stop,
          abdullah turns to look at ahmed, who is lying motionless on
          the rocks with bullet in his back.
          
                                 abdullah (cont'd)
                    ahmed!   ahmed!
          
          oblivious of the police, he gets up and runs toward him.
          motionless, ahmed just moans. with every breath, his shirt
          grows bloodier.
          
                                 abdullah (cont'd)
                    ahmed!   ahmed!
          
          he rolls ahmed over and lays his head on his lap. abdullah
          cannot stop crying. yussef, ducking, runs toward his brother.
          abdullah laments nervously.
          
                                abdullah (cont'd)
                    don't die, don't die.
          
          yussef is shocked upon seeing his dead brother. he stands
          up and, without caring whether anyone fires at him or not,
          he raises the rifle up in the air for the police to see that
          he is not aiming, and starts to break it against the rocks.
          
          when he's finished breaking it he opens his arms and walks
          toward the police. one of them policemen looks at him through
          a pair of binoculars. alarid interrogates him.
          
                                alarid
                    what's happening?
          
                                                                       99.
          
                                police officer
                    a boy is walking this way.
          
                                   alarid
                    is he armed?
          
          the officer takes a careful look.
          
                                police officer
                    it doesn't look like it.
          
                                alarid
                    what are the others doing?
          
          the officer watches abdullah carrying his wounded son.
          
                                police officer
                    a man is holding somebody injured.
          
                                alarid
                    is the other one still walking this
                    way?
          
                                   police officer
                    yes.
          
          alarid turns to the other officers.
          
                                   alarid
                    aim.
          
          the police aim and hold yussef in their sights. he keeps
          walking resolutely toward his aggressors. he is crying
          softly, keeping his arms open.
          
          yussef walks until his is 10 meters away from the police and
          he kneels with his arms open.
          
                                yussef
                    i killed the american, i was the
                    only one who shot at you...
          
          cautious, the police still aim at his chest. yussef proceeds
          with his confession, babbling it through his nerves, his
          pain and his attempt to control his sobbing.
          
                                yussef (cont'd)
                    they did nothing... nothing...
          
          he turns to his father and his brother and points at them.
          
                                yussef (cont'd)
                    kill me, but save my brother, he did
                    nothing... nothing...
          
          alarid moves in, aiming at him with a rifle.    behind him are
          five other cops, also ready to shoot.
          
                                                                            100.
          
                                      alarid
                          on the ground...
          
                yussef does not obey.
          
                                      yussef
                          save my brother...
          
                                      alarid
                          on the ground...
          
                yussef turns his face toward alarid looks him in the eye.
          
                                      yussef
                          save my brother... please...
          
                he lies on the floor, crying. alarid puts his gun down and
                looks at him: his enemy is a disconsolate child. then he
                looks up at abdullah who is screaming his lamentations. he
                turns to one of his subordinates.
          
                                      alarid
                          go help them.
          
                one of the officers goes to help abdullah and ahmed.     yussef
                lies on the floor, crying.
