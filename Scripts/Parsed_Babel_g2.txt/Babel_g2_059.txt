          59   int. bus -- day
          
               the passengers sit quietly. as the ride gets bumpier, susan
               starts to cry out in pain.
          
                                     susan
                         it hurts, it hurts...
          
               richard tries to calm her down.
          
                                     richard
                         easy, sweetie, easy...
          
                                     susan
                         it hurts... it hurts so much...
          
               richard turns her around and sees her shoulder has been
               shattered. she won't stop shouting. a pool of blood starts
               trickling down the aisle.
          
                                     richard
                             (a anwar)
                         isn't there anywhere else we can
                         take her?
          
                                                                           36.
          
                                     anwar
                         we can take her to my town. it's
                         near here and there's a doctor. in
                         the meantime we can call erfourd for
                         an ambulance.
          
               richard turns to look at susan, who is writhing in pain.
          
                                        richard
                         ok.
          
                                      anwar
                             (to the driver, in
                              arabic)
                         make a right onto the next road.
          
               richard and anwar exchange a glance.
