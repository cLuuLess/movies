          147   ext. immigration stall, border crossing -- continuous
          
                the officer walks up to the window.
          
                                      officer
                          your papers...
          
                santiago and amelia take out their passports and their green
                cards. the officer compares the documents to their faces
                again and again.
          
                                      officer (cont'd)
                          where you comin' from?
          
                                                                      83.
          
                                santiago
                        (in bad english)
                    from a wedding.
          
          the officer looks through the window and sees debbie and
          mike sleeping in the back.
          
                                officer
                    who are they?
          
          santiago rushes to answer.
          
                                santiago
                    they're her nephews.
          
          amelia freezes at santiago's answer.    the officer won't stop
          looking at the children.
          
                                officer
                    they don't look like you.
          
                                amelia
                        (bewildered)
                    i'm in charge of them.
          
                                officer
                    do you have their passports?
          
          amelia takes out their american passports and shows them to
          the cop. he looks them over very carefully. santiago starts
          to get nervous.
          
                                santiago
                    is there a problem?
          
          the officer turns to look at them suspiciously.    he obviously
          smells the alcohol.
          
                                officer
                    should there be one?
          
          santiago shakes his head.    debbie wakes up and looks at the
          officer sleepily.
          
                                  debbie
                    hi.
          
                                officer
                    hey there, sweetie.
          
          debbie rubs her eyes.
          
                                officer (cont'd)
                    tell me, is this lady your aunty?
          
          debbie innocently shakes her head.
          
                                                                            84.
          
                                      debbie
                          no, she's not my aunty.
          
                the officer stares at them harshly. he says something
                incomprehensible over his radio and asks santiago.
          
                                      officer
                          are you drunk?
          
                                       santiago
                          me, sir?   no.
          
                                      officer
                          get out of the car.
          
                                      santiago
                          why, officer?
          
                                      officer
                          i'm countin' to three...
          
                he brings his hand to his gun.
