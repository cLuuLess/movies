          197   int. lobby, tokyo apartment building -- night
          
                kenji walks past the doorman.
          
                                                                     120.
          
                                  kenji
                    good night.
          
          he keeps walking. on the other end of the lobby, at the
          parking lot entrance, yasujiro walks in.
          
          the doorman calls kenji as he is about to leave.
          
                                doorman
                    officer... officer...
          
          kenji stops.   beside him is yasujiro.
          
                                doorman (cont'd)
                    this is the man you were looking
                    for.
          
          kenji approaches him while the doorman discretely moves away
          to leave them alone in the lobby.
          
                                kenji
                    good evening, i'm lieutenant mamiya.
          
                                yasujiro
                    good evening, how can i help you?
          
                                kenji
                    sir, there was an incident and...
          
          yasujiro looks at him attentively. kenji, still moved by
          chieko, looks distracted, confused.
          
                                 kenji (cont'd)
                    i don't mean to bother you, but...
                        (a beat)
                    do you own a .270 caliber winchester
                    70 rifle with the registration
                    number...
          
          kenji looks through his pockets, takes out a small notebook
          and looks up the missing number.
          
                                  kenji (cont'd)
                    uk-9023?
          
                                yasujiro
                    i don't remember the license, but i
                    did have a rifle like the one you
                    described.
          
                                kenji
                    is it true that you gave it to a mr.
                    hassan ibrahim, who lives in southern
                    morocco?
          
                                yasujiro
                    hassan ibrahim?
          
                                                                    121.
          
                                kenji
                    he says he was your guide in a hunt.
          
                                yasujiro
                    hassan? of course. he was a very
                    good guide and i gave him the rifle.
                    hassan is a very kind man. did
                    anything happen?
          
                                kenji
                    there was an attempted murder with
                    that rifle, and the moroccan police
                    want to confirm it's not off the
                    black market.
          
                                 yasujiro
                    no, i gave it to him.
                        (a beat)
                    is hassan ok?
          
                                kenji
                    i don't know.
          
          yasujiro remains silent for a moment.
          
                                yasujiro
                    am i legally involved?
          
                                kenji
                    not for the moment. you may have to
                    go testify for your friend.
          
                                yasujiro
                    can i leave now?
          
                                  kenji
                    good night.
          
          they both bow to say goodbye. yasujiro walks toward the
          elevator. kenji calls out to him.
          
                                  kenji (cont'd)
                    excuse me.
          
          kenji approaches and yasujiro awaits, expectant.
          
                                kenji (cont'd)
                    your daughter told me about your
                    wife on the balcony. i'm very sorry.
          
                                yasujiro
                    what balcony?
          
                                kenji
                    about how your wife killed herself
                    by jumping off the balcony.
          
                                                                           122.
          
                                      yasujiro
                          my wife never jumped off a balcony.
                          she shot herself in the head. my
                          daughter was the first to find her.
          
                kenji is left speechless.
          
                                      yasujiro (cont'd)
                          i've explained it to the police
                          several times. don't bother us with
                          that anymore, please.
          
                                      kenji
                          i'm very sorry sir, we won't bother
                          you anymore. good night.
          
                he turns around and leaves the building.
