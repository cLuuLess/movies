          112   int. room, anwar's house -- day
          
                susan is lying on the floor, moaning softly. flies hover
                around the pool of blood under her neck. richard, worried,
                strokes her hair.
          
                the grandmother brings them a pot of tea with two cups and
                sets them on the floor beside them.
          
                                       richard
                          thank you.
          
                the grandmother goes to sit in a chair. mohammed walks in
                and whispers something to him. anwar turns to richard.
          
                                                                           63.
          
                                      anwar
                          the doctor's here.
