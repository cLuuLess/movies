          132   ext. hassan's house -- day
          
                alarid's truck parks in front of hassan's house again. hassan
                is still cuffed and being interrogated. furious, alarid gets
                out of the truck and goes toward him.
          
                                       alarid
                          this abdullah doesn't live where you
                          said he did.
          
                he walks over to kick him. the wife intervenes from where
                she is, some ten yards away.
          
                                      wife
                          they live where he said they do.
          
                alarid turns to her.
          
                                      alarid
                          you're going to take us.
          
                with a gesture, he orders his subordinates to put her in the
                truck. she obeys, docile.
          
                                      alarid (cont'd)
                          and if they're not there, i'll cut
                          your tongue out and i'll kill your
                          husband.
