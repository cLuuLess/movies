          42   int. yussef and ahmed's house -- evening
          
               abdullah and his children sit at the small table while the
               women prepare the food. a column of smoke rises from the
               fire where they are roasting goat meat and toasting bread.
          
               yamil, the youngest of the daughters, sets some bread on the
               table. abdullah takes it, tears some off and starts to eat.
               he turns to yussef.
          
                                     abdullah
                         did you kill any jackals?
          
                                     yussef
                         we shot at them, but didn't hit them.
          
                                     abdullah
                         you have to kill them. if not they're
                         going to eat all the goats.
          
               yasira sets the strips of goat meat on the table. abdullah
               serves himself some. his children wait until he's done to
               serve themselves.
          
                                     yasira
                         why are you home so late?
          
               abdullah starts talking with his mouth full.
          
                                                                           28.
          
                                     abdullah
                         they closed the road, and we had to
                         take the long way around.
                             (he swallows)
                         apparently some terrorists killed an
                         american tourist.
          
               ahmed and yussef shoot each other a nervous glance.
          
                                        yasira
                         an american?
          
                                     abdullah
                         yes, the terrorists attacked a tour
                         bus on the road.
          
                                     yasira
                         but there aren't any terrorists here.
          
               abdullah finishes his mouthful. he wipes himself with his
               sleeve. ahmed doesn't even dare raise his eyes.
          
                                     abdullah
                         you never know.
          
               yussef, nervous, looks up.
          
                                     yussef
                         and how do you know the american
                         died?
          
                                     abdullah
                         that's what they were saying. the
                         police are looking for the culprits.
          
               yussef and ahmed again exchange a furtive glance.
