          74   ext. patio, anwar's house -- day
          
               anwar goes out to the patio and fetches a metal basin full
               of soil. he goes to a well, scoops out some water with a
               gourd and washes out the basin.
          
               anwar is walking back when he is stopped by mohammed, his
               brother, a fat man (32) with curly hair and a tanned face.
          
                                     mohammed
                             (the entire dialogue
                              in arabic)
                         why did you bring them here?
          
                                                                           43.
          
               anwar doesn't pay attention to him and keeps walking toward
               the room. his brother catches up to him.
          
                                     mohammed (cont'd)
                         you should have consulted with us.
          
               anwar stops and looks at him fixedly.
          
                                     anwar
                         she's hurt, we had to take care of
                         her.
          
                                     mohammed
                         in town they're saying she was shot
                         by terrorists. do you know what
                         they're going to do to us when they
                         find out she's here?
          
                                     anwar
                         don't be paranoid and go help find
                         the doctor.
          
               anwar pays no more attention to him and carries the basin
               into the room.
