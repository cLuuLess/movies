          156   int. anwar's house -- afternoon
          
                richard and anwar are sitting in silence while susan lies
                unconsciously on the floor.
          
                yamilé (9), a beautiful girl with large brown eyes, enters
                carrying a tray with cookies and tea. she greets richard
                with a nod and offers him tea.
          
                richard takes the tea.
          
                                         richard
                          thank you.
          
                the girl gets up to offer tea to anwar, who takes it.
          
                                      anwar
                              (in arabic)
                          thank you, yamilé.
          
                yamilé smiles and leaves the room.
          
                                      richard
                          is that your daughter?
          
                                                                             88.
          
                                      anwar
                          the fourth of eight.
          
                                      richard
                          eight?
          
                anwar affirms, smiling.
          
                                      anwar
                          do you have kids?
          
                richard takes out his wallet and pulls out a photo of him,
                susan, mike and debbie. he shows it to him.
          
                anwar takes it and looks at it.
          
                                      anwar (cont'd)
                          just two?
          
                                      richard
                          three...
                              (he remains pensive)
                          yes, just two.
          
                                      anwar
                          you should have more.
          
                anwar returns the photo. richard looks at it for a moment
                before putting it back into his wallet.
          
                                      richard
                          what about you? how many wives do
                          you have?
          
                                      anwar
                              (smiling)
                          i can only afford one.
          
                                      richard
                          and is this where you live?
          
                                      anwar
                          no, this is where my family lives. i
                          live in marrakesh. but i come whenever
                          i can...
          
                they exchange a look. we hear a car engine.
