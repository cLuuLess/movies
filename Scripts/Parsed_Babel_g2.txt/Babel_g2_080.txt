          80   int. dentist's office -- day
          
               chieko is sitting in the reception area, waiting her turn.
               there is a woman with a twelve year-old son listening to a
               walkman and an old couple.
          
               the receptionist (50) will not stop talking to the old lady.
          
                                                                            48.
          
                                     receptionist
                         my niece sells these creams. and
                         just look at my skin now. i'm going
                         to turn fifty-two and look, almost
                         no wrinkles...
          
               the woman continues her banal chatter. chieko observes her
               grotesque mouth. she then looks at the old man's bored face,
               the old woman's feigned interest, the mother's annoyed
               expression, and the boy, who rocks his head to the music.
          
               a man walks out and the receptionist gestures at chieko and
               points toward the door.
