          124   ext. park, tokyo -- later
          
                half-drunk and rushing from the pills, chieko, her friends,
                and haruki and takeshi, play on the swings and see-saw.
                they laugh at almost anything. haruki and chieko are on the
                see-saw and every time chieko rises, haruki looks at her
                bush. chieko knows this sometimes opens her legs even more
                so he can look to his heart's content. hormones float in
                the air.
          
                mitsu also takes advantage of the occasion. she flirts with
                haruki whenever she can. haruki looks happy to be the object
                of their attention.
          
                takeshi, who has started to make out with one of chieko's
                friends, turns to the group and speaks slowly.
          
                                      takeshi
                          why- don't- we- go- to- montana?
          
                                                                             73.
