          169   ext. desert -- later
          
                it is well into the morning. amelia and the children sleep
                deeply. there is a noise and amelia opens her eyes. she
                sees a border patrol truck driving around near them.
          
                                                                     102.
          
          looking through the branches, she spies on the truck and
          watches another one join it. mike awakes and sits up.
          
                                mike
                    what happening?
          
          amelia ducks and lays mike face down.    the two trucks slowly
          approach.
          
                                amelia
                        (to mike, in a low
                         voice, in spanish)
                    stay still.
          
          a truck drives by about eighty yards away and then passes.
          the other one cuts diagonally across its path and then gets
          lost in the desert.
          
          amelia gets up and shakes off the dust. she looks out of
          place, wearing her best clothes torn by the bramble. she
          makes sure the trucks are leaving.
          
                                mike
                    why are we hiding if we didn't do
                    anything wrong?
          
                                amelia
                        (in english)
                    because they think we did something
                    wrong.
          
                                mike
                    that's not true: you're bad.
          
          amelia freezes upon hearing the boy's words.
          
                                amelia
                    no, sweetie, i'm not bad.     i just
                    did something stupid.
          
          she pulls him toward her and hugs him tenderly.
          
                                amelia (cont'd)
                        (in spanish)
                    i love you very much, sweetie.
          
          amelia turns and tries to wake debbie.
          
                                amelia (cont'd)
                        (in english)
                    debbie, we've got to go.
          
          the girl opens her eyes, but doesn't answer.
          
                                amelia (cont'd)
                    debbie, sweetheart, wake up.
          
                                                                           103.
          
                she closes her eyes again. amelia notices her lips are dry
                and her breath is irregular: she is visibly dehydrated.
          
                upon seeing that she doesn't react, amelia looks for the
                trucks: they're far away.
