          175   ext. desert -- day
          
                amelia sees a small hillock and climbs it with difficulty.
                she surveys the environs from the top. in the distance she
                sees a border patrol truck driving down a path.
          
                                                                      104.
          
          with great effort, amelia runs down the hill.
          
                                amelia
                        (in spanish)
                    stop, stop...
          
          the truck doesn't stop. amelia keeps running, flailing her
          arms and screaming wildly.
          
                                amelia (cont'd)
                    sir... sir... stop...
          
          the truck stops and backs up.   amelia keeps going, tripping
          over stones.
          
          john (29), a thoroughly mexican officer, gets out and she
          runs up, panting, to him.
          
                                amelia (cont'd)
                    please help me.
          
          john stares at her suspiciously.
          
                                amelia (cont'd)
                    i have to go get two kids i left
                    behind in the desert.
          
          john looks at her suspiciously.
          
                                john
                        (in spanish, with a
                         terrible accent)
                    are they illegal immigrants?
          
                                amelia
                    no, they're american.
          
                                john
                    when did you cross?
          
                                amelia
                        (in english)
                    i didn't cross, i live here.   please,
                    help me find these kids.
          
          john keeps staring at her.   he points to a mesquite.
          
                                john
                    stand there and don't move.
          
          amelia obeys. john goes back to the vehicle, opens the door
          and sits down and grabs the radio.
          
                                john (cont'd)
                    attention base, i have a 4533...i
                    have the suspect.
          
                                                                           105.
          
                amelia doesn't manage to hear what the radio says. she looks
                attentively at what the agent is doing. john stops and runs
                back to her.
          
                                      john (cont'd)
                          you're under arrest. turn around
                          and put your hands behind your head.
          
                amelia despairs.
          
                                      amelia
                          i left those kids in the desert, i
                          swear.
          
                john pushes her forcefully against the truck.
          
                                      john
                          turn around, now.
          
                she turns around with her hands over her head.    john handcuffs
                her and leads her to the vehicle.
