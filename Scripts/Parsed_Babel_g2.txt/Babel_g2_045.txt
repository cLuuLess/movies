          45   int. santiago's car -- day
          
               debbie and mike stare through the windows, amazed at the new
               world they are entering: other people, other architecture,
               other colors, other noises.
          
               santiago turns towards them while he's driving.
          
                                     santiago
                         see how easy it is to get into
                         paradise?
          
                                     debbie
                         is this mexico?
          
                                     amelia
                             (in spanish)
                         yes, this is mexico.
          
                                     mike
                         my mom told us mexico is really
                         dangerous.
          
               santiago turns toward the kids.
          
                                     santiago
                             (in spanish)
                         yes, it's full of mexicans.
          
               amelia and santiago look at each other and smile.
