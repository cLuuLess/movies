          53   int. room, hamlet "los lobos" -- day
          
               amelia is in a room with her two daughters standing in front
               of a peeling and broken mirror putting on her violet gown.
               one of her daughters helps her and pulls the zipper all the
               way up.
          
                                     daughter 1
                             (all in spanish)
                         oh ma, i don't know how you did it
                         but it zipped up perfectly.
          
                                     amelia
                         and it's been 15 years since i last
                         wore this dress.
          
                                     daughter 1
                         you haven't changed a bit, ma.
          
                                                                            33.
          
                                     amelia
                         working, dear, working, that's what
                         keeps one young.
          
               the two sisters realize that the dress has a hole just below
               the seat, exchange looks and smile, which doesn't please
               amelia.
          
                                     amelia (cont'd)
                         what are you guys laughing about?
          
                                     daughter 2
                         nothing ma, nothing.
          
               amelia looks at them suspiciously, turns around and leaves
               the room with her dress elegantly torn.
