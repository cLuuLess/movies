                the heat is strong and amelia is beaten. she looks for the
                shade of a cluster of mesquites and lays debbie down. then
                she turns to mike.
          
                                      amelia
                          sweetie, i'm going to go look for
                          help. stay here and don't move.
          
                                      mike
                          i'm not staying here alone.
          
                                      amelia
                          honey, you have to take care of
                          debbie.
          
                                      mike
                          i'm going with you.
          
                mike looks at her with imploring eyes.   amelia caresses him.
          
                                      amelia
                          i won't be long. i promise.
