          47   int. santiago's car -- day
          
               mike and debbie continue to gaze awestruck through the
               windows. santiago turns to them.
          
                                     santiago
                             (in spanish)
                         are you hungry?
          
               they both nod.
          
                                     santiago (cont'd)
                         do you like popsicles?
          
               santiago pulls over next to some stalls, and the street
               vendors run out to offer them their products.
