               amelia enters the kitchen and answers a wall phone.

                         amelia, it's richard. we're going to
                         have to be here a few more days here
                         in morocco than we expected and rachel
                         wasn't able to find anyone to take
                         care of the kids.
          
                                     amelia
                         your sister-in-law promised me to
                         find someone.
          
                                     richard (o.s.)
                         amelia, this is very serious.
          
               amelia looks worried.
          
                                     amelia
                         it's because... i told mrs. jones
                         three months ago that today is my
                         son's wedding.
          
                                      richard (o.s.)
                         amelia, this is an emergency. cancel
                         your son's wedding. i'll pay for
                         another one.
          
                                     amelia
                         sir, everything is ready. can't anyone
                         come take care of the kids? it's
                         just one day.
          
                                     richard (o.s.)
                         we need you, amelia... hold on.
          
               richard stops talking. we hear voices in the background.
          
                                     richard (o.s.) (cont'd)
                         amelia, we're really counting on
                         you. i have to go. goodbye.
          
               he hangs up.   amelia stares into empty space.
