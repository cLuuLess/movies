          105   ext. chicken coop -- day
          
                santiago has several chickens tied up. one of the kids
                catches the last one and hands it to santiago.
          
                                      santiago
                              (in spanish)
                          ready. now who's going to help me?
          
                several children raise their hands. mike and debbie raise
                theirs as well, excited. santiago picks mike.
          
                                      santiago (cont'd)
                          let's see, mike, you can help me.
          
                proud, mike walks toward santiago and stands next to him.
                santiago unties a chicken and gives it to mike.
          
                                      santiago (cont'd)
                          hold it tight, like this.
          
                he shows him how to hold it. mike grabs it and holds it
                between his arms, smiling, oblivious to what will happen.
                santiago grabs the chicken by the head and pulls it off.
          
                the chicken starts to shake, spurting blood everywhere.
                mike, stunned, lets the animal fall to the ground and the
                chicken starts its mad race.
          
                the mexican kids start screaming excitedly, chasing the
                headless chicken. nobody notices that debbie and mike,
                completely shocked, are about to cry.
