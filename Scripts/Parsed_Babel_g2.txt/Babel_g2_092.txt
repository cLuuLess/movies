          92   ext. hassan's house -- morning
          
               hassan and his wife are listening to the radio and playing
               cards at a table placed outside the house. as they play,
               hassan whittles a stake with a small knife.
          
               hassan's wife lowers her hand and hassan follows.
          
                                        hassan
                         i won...
          
               his wife pushes two chips from her pile toward him. in the
               distance, several trucks approach, kicking up a dust cloud.
               hassan's wife gets up to better see them.
          
                                     wife
                         are you expecting anyone?
          
               hassan stands up and watches the vehicles come closer.
          
                                        hassan
                         no.
          
               five trucks pull up in a semicircle around the house. a
               dozen police officers get out armed and aim at hassan and
               his wife.
          
               alarid gets out and stands next to his car door.
          
                                     alarid
                         hassan ibrahim?
          
               hassan paralyzed by fear, answers in a broken voice.
          
                                        hassan
                         yes.
          
               one of the police officers approaches him aiming directly at
               his head, while another one aims at his wife.
          
                                                                            54.
          
                                     police officer
                         drop your weapon.
          
               hassan lifts up his knife and shows it to them.
          
                                     hassan
                         it's not a weapon, it's my knife.
          
                                     police officer
                         drop it, now...
          
               hassan drops the knife in the dust.
          
                                     police officer (cont'd)
                         get down on the floor... face down...
          
               hassan and his wife look at each other before they obey.
          
                                     hassan
                         what did we do?
          
               the cop readies himself to fire, and hassan drops to the
               ground. his wife follows and also lies on her stomach.
