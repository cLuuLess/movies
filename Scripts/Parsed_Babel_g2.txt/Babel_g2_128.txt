          128   int. lobby, tokyo apartment building -- night
          
                chieko enters her building and goes straight to the doorman.
          
                                      doorman
                          good evening, how may i help you?
          
                chieko takes out a piece of paper and a pen from her purse
                and writes a note. she gives it to the doorman together
                with kenji's card. he reads it carefully, and when he's
                done he turns to her.
          
                                                                            74.
          
                                      doorman (cont'd)
                          very well miss, i'll call him now.
          
                the doorman picks up a cordless phone and dials.
          
                                      doorman (cont'd)
                          lieutenant kenji mamiya, please?
          
                there is a pause. the doorman gestures to chieko that the
                lieutenant will answer in a moment.
          
                                      doorman (cont'd)
                          lieutenant? yes, look, i'm with the
                          deaf-mute girl you saw in the
                          afternoon, and she asked me to call
                          you... yes, her... she says she needs
                          to talk to you, alone... about her
                          father... if it's possible, in her
                          apartment, tonight.
          
                chieko watches attentively.
