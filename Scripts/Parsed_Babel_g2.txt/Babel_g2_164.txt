          166   ext. desert -- night
          
                the sun rises.   amelia and the children keep walking.    they
                sweat.
          
                                      mike
                          i can't walk anymore.
          
                                      amelia
                          we have to keep walking.
          
                                      mike
                          why is the air so hot?
          
                amelia stops and tries to distract them.
          
                                      amelia
                              (the entire dialogue
                               in english)
                          because coyotes and snakes and quails
                          have already breathed that air.
          
                mike remains pensive.
          
                                      mike
                          we're breathing the same air animals
                          breathe?
          
                                        amelia
                          yes.
          
                                                                             101.
          
                                      mike
                          and it doesn't rot?
          
                                      amelia
                          no, it doesn't rot.   we all breathe
                          this air.
