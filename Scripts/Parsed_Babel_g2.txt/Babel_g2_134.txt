          134   int. police truck -- day
          
                hassan's wife gives directions.
          
                                      wife
                          make a right here.
          
                alarid, with his hand, signals the driver to follow her
                directions.
          
                suddenly, in the distance, over the hills, she signals three
                tiny dots running up a slope.
          
                                         wife (cont'd)
                          that's them.
          
                                                                             77.
          
                                      alarid
                              (to the driver)
                          stop...
          
                the trucks stop and alarid takes out his binoculars.
          
          135   p.o.v. alarid's binoculars -- continuous
          
                in the distance, we can still see abdullah, yussef and ahmed
                run across the hills. abdullah is clearly carrying the rifle.
