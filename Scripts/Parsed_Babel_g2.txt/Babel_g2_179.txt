          181   int. anwar's house -- day
          
                richard is squatting next to susan.
          
                                      richard
                          my love... i'm going to get you out
                          of here.   we're going to try to
                          take you to a clinic an hour and a
                          half away from here. do you think
                          you can make it?
          
                she thinks for a moment and then nods.
          
                                      susan
                          yeah.
          
                                      richard
                          i need you to be strong. really
                          strong.
          
                susan sighs: the effort required seems as if it will be too
                much, but she nods again. richard hugs and kisses her.
