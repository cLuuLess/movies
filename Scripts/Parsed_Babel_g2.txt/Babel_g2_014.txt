               amelia is putting debbie and mike to sleep.   they are both
               lying in bed. amelia sits next to them.
          
                                     amelia
                             (in spanish)
                         did you brush your teeth?
          
               mike shows her his teeth so she can see he did.
          
                                     mike
                         will you tell us a story?
          
                                     amelia
                         one and then you're going to sleep.
          
               both children nod.
          
                                                             9.
          
                                amelia (cont'd)
                        (her entire story in
                         spanish)
                    once there was a hawk who wanted to
                    fly higher than everyone else. he
                    trained every day and hunted little
                    birds so he could eat them and be
                    strong.
          
                                   mike
                    pajaritos?     little birds?
          
                                amelia
                    of course, that's what hawks eat.
                    so, one day the hawk flew so, so
                    high that it crashed into an airplane.
                    it fainted and started to fall. and
                    when it was about to hit the ground,
                    all the birds flew toward him and
                    saved him.
          
                                debbie
                    they saved him?
          
                                amelia
                    yes, and when the hawk was healthy
                    again he went to talk to the birds
                    and said: i want to thank you for
                    saving me, but i can't change and
                    i'm going to keep hunting you. the
                    little birds answered: we don't care
                    that you hunt us, because that's who
                    you are. but we will always save
                    you, because that's who we are.
          
          the children are silent.
          
                                amelia (cont'd)
                        (in english)
                    did you like it?
          
                                   debbie
                    no.
          
          amelia moves to turn out the light.
          
                                   debbie (cont'd)
                    leave it on.
          
          amelia stands still beside the switch.
          
                                amelia
                    quedamos en que se iban a dormir con
                    la luz apagada.
          
                                debbie
                    but i'm scared.
          
                                                                            10.
          
                                     amelia
                         no pasa nada.
          
                                     debbie
                         i'm scared that what happened to pat
                         is gonna happen to me.
          
               amelia sits down next to her and caresses her.
          
                                     amelia
                         a ti no te va a pasar eso...
          
                                     debbie
                         pat died while she was sleeping.
          
                                     amelia
                         that only happens to some babies
                         when they're really little.
          
                                     mike
                         then why did daddy get so angry at
                         mommy?
          
                                     amelia
                         he wasn't angry, he was just very
                         sad.
          
                                     debbie
                         he left.
          
               amelia doesn't know what else to say. she pats debbie's head.
          
                                     amelia
                         go to sleep. i'll sit here with you,
                         but you can't talk anymore.
          
               they both nod and snuggle under their blankets. amelia watches
               them silently.
