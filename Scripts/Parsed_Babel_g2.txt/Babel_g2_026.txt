          26   int. bus -- later
          
               susan sits next to the window, in the middle of the bus.
               she looks hurt and sad. richard walks over and sits next to
               her.
          
               the bus starts. through the window, richard can still see
               the boy with the binoculars. he smiles until he sees an older
               boy snatch the binoculars away and push the little boy.
          
               the bus drives away, but richard can't take his eyes off the
               scene. the older boy walks away with the binoculars.
