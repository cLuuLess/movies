          52   ext. hamlet "los lobos" -- day
          
               they arrive at a dusty hamlet in the middle of the desert; a
               few houses, no more than twenty, some adorned with
               multicolored paper.
          
               several crates of soda are stacked up against a makeshift
               shed built out of yucca fronds. a group of musicians who
               play norteña music are setting up their instruments.
          
               there are various pickup trucks and smuggled cars parked
               around the hamlet. the guests are wearing their best: fresh
               shirts, big buckles, almost new boots.
          
               santiago parks. amelia gets out first.     a group of people
               sees her and comes over to greet her.
          
                                     comadre 1
                             (all in spanish)
                         hey, so you finally made it.
          
               amelia smiles.   her friends notices mike and debbie.
          
                                     comadre 1 (cont'd)
                         you brought them?
          
               amelia nods. luis (24), amelia's son, a typical norteño
               cowboy with long sideburns and moustache, his face tanned
               from days under the sun, wearing a pistachio-colored tuxedo
               with a cloth flower in the lapel, greets amelia with a kiss.
          
                                     luis
                         hi mom, how're you doing?
          
               she looks him up and down.
          
                                     amelia
                         son, you look like pedro infante.
          
                                     comadre 1
                         more like luis miguel.
          
                                     amelia
                         where's the bride?
          
                                     luis
                         she's not here yet.
          
                                     amelia
                         what d'you mean she's not here yet?
          
                                                                            32.
          
                                     luis
                         well, she ain't here.
          
               mike and debbie, struck dumb by the language and the
               strangers, hide behind amelia, who introduces them to luis.
          
                                     amelia
                         look son, these are mike and debbie,
                         the kids i take care of.
          
               luis holds his hand out ceremoniously.
          
                                     luis
                         pleased to meet you mike.
          
               santiago calls out to some kids who are running around.
          
                                      santiago
                         psst.   lucio, come here.
          
               lucio (10), the oldest of the gang, approaches.   santiago
               gestures toward the two american kids.
          
                                     santiago (cont'd)
                         these are mike and debbie. keep an
                         eye on them for me.
          
               lucio gives them a scornful glance and calls them over half-
               heartedly.
          
                                     lucio
                         come with me.
          
               with her hand, amelia signals to the kids that it's ok to go
               with him. shyly, debbie and mike follow.
