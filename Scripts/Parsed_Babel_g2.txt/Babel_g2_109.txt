                              (in spanish)

                                       santiago (cont'd)
                          why?
          
                                      mike
                          it's not good to kill animals.
          
                santiago smiles to himself.
          
                                      santiago

                          have you ever been to kentucky fried
                          chicken?
          
                they both nod.
          
                                      santiago (cont'd)
                          what? did you think that colonel
                          sanders kept them as pets?
          
                he hands mike a headless chicken, and he slowly starts to
                pluck it.
