          12   ext. desert -- day
          
               the brothers are sitting apart from each other.   ahmed guards
               the goats with the rifle on his lap.
          
               after a while, yussef goes to sit behind a large rock. he
               makes sure his brother isn't watching and he pulls his pants
               down to start masturbating.
          
                                                                        6.
          
          when he is at his most concentrated, a shot rings out and
          startles him. he quickly pulls his pants up and another
          shot rings out. yussef gets up to see what his brother is
          doing.
          
          ahmed is aiming the rifle at a rock some two hundred yards
          away. he fires a third time.
          
          yussef runs up to him.
          
                                yussef
                    what are you doing?
          
          ahmed doesn't pay attention, and focuses on the rock in the
          distance.
          
                                ahmed
                    hassan said that it could hit things
                    three kilometers away, but it can't
                    even reach that rock over there.
          
                                yussef
                    that's because you don't know how to
                    shoot. give me the rifle.
          
          ahmed looks at his brother defiantly, then hands the rifle
          over. yussef aims and fires. the shot echoes through the
          vast desert; the frightened goats scamper a few yards away.
          
                                ahmed
                    see, it can't reach it.
          
                                yussef
                    give me another bullet.
          
          yussef aims and fires. the bullet hits the rock and kicks
          up a lot of whitish dust.
          
                                   yussef (cont'd)
                    see.
          
                                ahmed
                    yeah, but that's not three kilometers.
          
          ahmed remains pensive and suddenly starts climbing to the
          top of the hill. once at the top, he looks around for a
          moment and then calls his brother.
          
                                ahmed (cont'd)
                    yussef, come here.
          
          yussef climbs the slope. ahmed signals a road that in the
          distance cuts across the great desert plain, and points out
          a traffic sign that indicates a curve ahead.
          
                                                                        7.
          
                                ahmed (cont'd)
                    i bet you the bullet can't hit that
                    far away.
          
          ahmed loads the rifle and aims at the sign.    he fires and
          nothing.
          
                                ahmed (cont'd)
                    these fucking bullets aren't any
                    good.
          
                                yussef
                    you're not aiming right.
          
          yussef points at a yellow car driving along the road.
          
                                yussef (cont'd)
                    what'll you give me if i hit that
                    car?
          
                                  ahmed
                    i'll shoot.
          
          ahmed reloads. the empty cartridge falls to the ground. he
          fires again - the car keeps going. yussef asks for the rifle.
          
                                  ahmed (cont'd)
                    you see?    nothing happens.
          
                                yussef
                    let me shoot.
          
          he also drops the used cartridge on the ground, reloads and
          shoots the traffic sign. he fires and nothing.
          
                                  ahmed
                    i told you.    hassan's a liar.
          
          a bus approaches.    ahmed points at it.
          
                                ahmed (cont'd)
                    shoot at that one...
          
          yussef loads the rifle parsimoniously, shuts the chamber,
          raises the weapon, aims and fires.
          
          the bus drives on.    ahmed turns to his brother.
          
                                ahmed (cont'd)
                    see: nothing.
          
          the bus drives on another three hundred yards and suddenly
          stops in the middle of the road.
          
                                                                             8.
