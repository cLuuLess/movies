          68   int. room, anwar's house -- day
          
               an old woman (87), anwar's grandmother, who has centuries of
               desert in her expression, lets them in and points at a rug
               on the floor.
          
                                     anwar's grandmother
                             (in arabic)
                         put her there...
          
               richard understands and softly lays susan on the rug. susan
               looks around horrified: adobe walls, dirt floor: the epitome
               of the third world.
          
                                     richard
                         i need to call an ambulance and
                         contact my embassy.
          
                                     anwar
                         if you have the number of the embassy,
                         i can go call.
          
               obviously, richard does not have it.
          
                                     richard
                         i need to make a phone call.
          
                                     anwar
                         of course, come with me.
          
               they get ready to leave and susan starts imploring.
          
                                     susan
                         don't leave me here alone...
          
                                                                           38.
          
                                     richard
                         don't worry, i'll be right back.
          
               susan looks desperate. to set richard somewhat at ease,
               anwar points at his grandmother.
          
                                     anwar
                         she can take care of her.
          
               richard leans over susan.
          
                                     richard
                         you're going to be ok.
          
               anwar kneels down next to her, takes a cloth and improvises
               a tourniquet that he adjusts near her shoulder. he turns
               towards the grandmother.
          
                                     anwar
                             (in arabic)
                         hold and release the tourniquet every
                         once in a while.
          
               the grandmother nods. she sees the swarm of kids looking
               into the place and she shoos them away.
          
                                     anwar's grandmother
                             (in arabic)
                         get out of here... out...
          
               the kids obey, except for one or two who take one last look
               before they go. susan's terrified eyes watch anwar and richard
               leave the room.
