               debbie and mike are almost like spectators at a soccer match
               between the other kids, as they play in the dirt with an
               orange plastic ball.
          
                                                                               58.
          
                nobody passes to them.    mike just runs from side to side
                without saying a word.    frustrated, debbie just watches.
