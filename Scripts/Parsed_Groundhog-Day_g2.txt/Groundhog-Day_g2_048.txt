          ext . main street - continuous
          phil throws the car into a high-speed, skidding u-turn, goes up
          on the curb, across a couple of lawns, takes out a mailbox and
          a stop sign and bounces back onto the street.
          a police car parked in front of the hardware store pulls out
          and takes off after him.
