          phil is talking to one of his girlfriends, sorting through a
          stack of cd's, as usual, grabbing at the good life with both
          hands.

           phil

           meet me up there tonight and let
           me vulgarize you for about seven

           the night in punxsutawney all

          phil loads a cd and a great, driving song kicks in.

           cut to:

          a sign
          "welcome to punxsutawney - the original weather capitol of the
          world since 1887." depicted on the sign is a large cartoon
          groundhog wearing a top hat and clutching an umbrella under his
          arm.
          the mini-convoy passes some fast food places on the outskirts
          of town.
