          int. phil's room - night

          a hat is lying on phil's bed. a playing card flies past. a
          second playing card sails right into the hat. another playing
          card sails past, missing. another playing card sails right in
          phil and rita are tossing cards. rita is missing. phil is
          hitting.

           phil
           it's not in the wrist so much as
           the fingers. be the hat.

           rita
           it would take me a year to get
           good at this.

           phil
           uh-uh. six months. four, five
           hours a day.

           rita
           is this what you do with
           eternity?

          

           -93-

          

          

           phil
           now you know. it's like waiting
           for a bus that never comes . you
           should see me play pool -- and
           bowling, juggling, hacky sack.
           i can ride a unicycle.
          there ' s a knock on the door .

           phil
           i'll get it!
          phil jumps for the door and opens it. the pizza guy is there.

           phil
           hi, marty. $11.75 including the
           delivery charge, right?

           pizza guy
           u h hh h --
          phil pays him, takes the pizza and closes the door.

           rita
           (opening the pizza box)
           mmmm. pepperoni and olives. my
           favorite .

           phil
           of course. i told you, i know
           everything .

           rita
           (taking a bite of

           pizza)
           i don ' t think i ' d want to know
           everything that ' s going to
           happen. i like to be surprised.

           phil
           that's not the worst part.

           rita
           what's the worst part?

           phil
           the worst part is starting over
           everyday. tomorrow you won't
           remember any of this. you'll go
           back to treating me like a
           complete jerk --

           rita
           no --

           phil
           it's not your fault. i am a
           jerk.

          

           -94-

          

          

           rita
           no, you're not.

           phil
           okay, i ' m not. it really doesn't
           make a lot of difference. i've
           killed myself so many times, i
           don't even exist anymore. i'm
           just completely empty.

           rita
           or completely clean.

           phil
           if you're going to be this
           positive all the time i may have
           to rough you up a little.

           rita
           wait! have we done this before?

           phil
           which part?

           rita
           you getting me up here, the card
           gam e, the pizza--

           phil
           no, this is the first time.

           rita

           (excited)
           well?

           phil
           well, what?

           rita
           well how does it feel to be doing
           something completely new?
          phil looks at her with tremendous affection and gratitude.

           phil
           good. really good.
          he takes a slice of pizza and starts eating with gusto.

           dissolve to:

          the pizza box - later
          there's only one slice left.
          phil and rita are sitting together on the bed, close but not
          touching. soft music is playing on the radio.

          

           -95-

          

          

           rita
           sometimes i wish i had a thousand
           lifetimes. one to be a great
           journalist. one to, i don't
           know, go back to school, study
           art, or auto mechanics. one just
           to take care of all the busywork,
           you know, pay the bills, get my
           car tuned up. one to be the wild
           woman of borneo. one to be
           mother theresa. maybe it's not
           a curse, phil. it all just
           depends on how you look at it.
          phil stares at her for a long time letting this sink in. then
          he belches really loud. rita stares at him, then burps
          surprisingly loud herself.

           rita
           i want you to know, it's been a
           really nice day for me.

           phil
           me, too.

           rita
           maybe, if it's not too boring for
           you, we could do it again.

           phil
           i hope so.
          the clock reads 11:59. rita grabs phil's hand. he puts his
          arm around her.
          they look into each others' eyes. rita gives phil a reassuring
          smile. she squeezes his hand. their eyes turn to the clock.
          11:;59 turns to 12:00.
          rita looks up at phil as if expecting some magical event.

           rita
           you're still here!

           phil
           i know.

           rita
           i thought you were supposed to
           disappear-- or i was or
           something.

           phil
           not 'til six.

           rita
           you rat!

          

           -96-

          

          
          she is mad in a playful way.

           phil
           i never said midnight--

           rita
           you knew i was waiting for
           midnight!

           phil
           but i never said it.

           rita
           oh, i can't believe you!
           (she slugs him with a

           pillow)
           i didn't know this was going to
           take all night!

           phil
           does that mean you're going?

           rita
           no.
          phil takes rita's hand. she doesn't resist.

           dissolve to:

          later
          rita is now sitting right next to phil on the bed, her head
          resting on his shoulder. she nods off then catches herself.

           rita
           i'm sorry.

           phil
           it's okay to go to sleep you
           know. i promise i won't touch
           you-- much.

           rita
           no, it's all right. i'm not
           tired. what were you saying?
          her eyes start to close again.

           phil
           i was saying that the cow was
           eventually returned to it's
           rightful owner.

           rita
           (drifting off)
           really?

          

           -97-

          

          

           phil
           that's right.
          he looks at her, sees she's truly asleep, and gently maneuvers
          her into a comfortable reclining position on the bed. then he
          carefully puts a pillow under her head and settles down next to
          her.

           phil
           what i was going to say was, i
           think you're the kindest,
           sweetest, prettiest, most
           wonderful girl i ever met in my
           life.
          she starts to stir but he gently kisses her back to sleep.

           phil
           shhhh. that's good.
           (satisfied she's still

           asleep)
           i could never tell you this, but
           from the first minute i looked at
           you i wanted to just hold you
           close and be with you forever.
           ieverytime i -saw you around the
           station, i thought my heart was
           going to explode. i used to
           dream about us being together.
           in my dream you loved me as much
           as i loved you and we didn't have
           to say anything but i knew you
           understood everything.
          she stirs again but he kisses her until she returns to deep
          sleep.

           phil
           i know a guy like me could never
           deserve to have someone like you,
           but if i did, i swear i would
           love you for the rest of my life.
          rita opens her eyes.

           rita

           (half-asleep)
           did you say something?

           phil
           good-night, rita.
          he kisses her gently on the forehead.

           rita
           good-night, phil.

          

           -98-

          

          c lose up - the clock
          the time changes from 5:59 to 6:00. the radio starts playing.
          phil wakes up alone in bed. he lies there for a moment then
          leaps out of bed like a man reborn and heads straight for the
          shower.
