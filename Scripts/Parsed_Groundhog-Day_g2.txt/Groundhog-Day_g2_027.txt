          int. phil's room - dawn

          phil sits up in bed, quickly alert, and looks around the room.
          something is wrong. he's wearing pajamas, his suit is once
          again hanging neatly on the closet door and his suitcase is
          back on its stand at the foot of the bed, again neatly packed.
          the song ends and the same radio deejay and his sidekick come
          on with the same manic energy. phil stares at the radio and
          listens to them. a look of astonishment comes over his face as
          they banter.

           deejay
           okay, campers, rise and shine,
           and don't forget your booties
           because it's cooold out there
           today!

           sidekick
           it's cold out there everyday.
           what is this-- miami beach?
          the deejay laughs. phil "mock" laughs at exactly the same
          time, recognizing the repartee from the previous morning.

           phil
           (to himself)
           nice going guys. that's
           yesterday's tape.
          phil crosses to the sink and gets a towel off the rack, only
          half-listening to the radio.

          

           -26-

          

           deejay
           not hardly. expect hazardous
           travel later today with that, you
           know, blizzard thing --

           sidekick
           that "blizzard thing?"
          phil turns on the water and splashes some on his face as if
          trying to wake himself up, vaguely disturbed by the repetition
          of the broadcast.

           sidekick (cont.)
           oh, here's the report: the
           national weather service is
           calling for a big blizzard
           thing."

           deejay
           yes they are, but there's another
           reason today is very special --

           sidekick
           especially cold --

           deejay
           especially cold, okay, but the
           big question on everybody's lips --
          phil supplies the next line in unison with the radio.

           sidekick and phil
           chapped lips --

           deejay
           -- on their chapped lips, right --
           do you think phil's going to come
           out and see his shadow?

           sidekick
           punxsutawney phil.
          some vague doubt causes phil to go to the window.

           deejay
           that's right, rodent lovers!

           it's--

           both deejays
           groundhog day!
          sound effect of grunting groundhogs as phil pulls back the
          curtains and looks out.

          his pov
          the street is full of people heading toward gobbler's knob,
          exactly as they did the day before.

          

           -27-

          

           phil

           (aghast)
           what the hell?

           cut to:
