          phil is walking through the crowd. he spots nancy, walks up to
          her and greets her half-heartedly .

           phil
           hi, nancy.

           nancy

           (pleasantly)
           hi. do i know you?
          phil can't manage enough enthusiasm to pursue her yet again.

           phil
           no, i guess not. i thought you
           were someone else.
          phil wanders over to where rita and larry are setting up the
          camera. rita comes over to him.

           rita
           are you all right, phil? you
           look terrible.
          phil looks at her sadly, then turns away.

           phil

           (vacantly)
