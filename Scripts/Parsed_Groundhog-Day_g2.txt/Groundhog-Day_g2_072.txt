          int. the bar - later

          rita and phil are now sitting together at a table, a plate of
          cheese and crackers and a bottle of white wine between them.

           phil
           you like your job?

           rita
           it's okay. i think it could be
           really challenging. of course
           it's about a million miles from
           where i started out in college.

           phil
           you weren't in broadcasting?

           rita
           at bryn mawr? no, uh-uh.
           "believe it or not, i studied
           nineteenth century french poetry.

           phil
           (laughs good-naturedly)
           really? what a waste of time.
          rita looks offended. phil knows he made a mistake.

          same scene - another day

           phil

           believe it or not, i studied

          phil leans in closer to her.

           phil
           la fille qui j'aimera
           sera comme bon vin
           qui se bonifiera
           un peut chaque matin.
          rita smiles, entranced.
