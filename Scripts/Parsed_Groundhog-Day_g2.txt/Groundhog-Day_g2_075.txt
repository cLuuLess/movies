          ext. main street - later that night

          there is a light snow falling. phil and rita are making a
          little snowman. somehow the town looks magical tonight-- old
          fashioned, wholesome.
          a snowball hits phil in the back. he and rita turn around to
          see a giggling kid. phil packs a snowball and tosses it. the
          kid throws one back. rita and phil both get into it, packing
          snowballs and getting into a war with this kid and his little
          gang of friends.
          a snowball catches rita unaware, she slips and goes down in a
          snowbank. phil bends down to help her and slips. they are no
          together, lying in the snow, laughing. their eyes lock for a
          long sweet moment, then rita gets embarrassed and stands up.

          ext . cherry street inn - night
          phil and rita are walking slowly, very close.

           phil
           what?

           rita
           i ' m just amazed. and i'm not
           easily amazed.

           phil
           about what?

          

           -69-

          

           rita
           how you can start a day with one
           kind of expectation and end up so
           completely different.

           phil
           do you like how this day is
           turning out?

           rita
           yes. i like it very much.
           they stop dn front of phil's hotel. she turns to him.

           rita
           you could never have planned a
           day like this, but it couldn't
           have been more perfect.

           phil
           you're wrong. i've been planning
           this day for weeks.
           rita ignores the remark and hugs him. phil tries to kiss her
           but she gently puts her fingers to his lips, stopping him.
          \ they enter the bed and breakfast inn.
