          ext. the street - day

          phil and rita walk down main street hand in hand.

           a man
           phil! good morning!

           a lady
           mr. connors. i wanted to thank
           you.

           phil
           that's all right. i--
          a florist steps out of the flower shop with a bouquet.

           florist
           phil, here. i want you to have
           these.

           phil
           thanks, carl.
          phil smells the flowers, and hands the bouquet to rita.

           and so began my final lifetime,
           and ended the longest winter on
           record. i would find myself no
           longer able to affect the chain
           of events in this town, but i did
           learn something about time. you
           can waste time, you can kill
           time, you can do time, but if you
           use it wisely, there's never
           enough of it. so you'd better
           make the most of the time you've
           got.
          a car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree. phil and rita
          rush over to help, but the driver waves that he's okay. rita
          and phil continue their walk.

           larry never got through the
           blizzard, so none of my groundhog
           reports ever made it on the air.
           but rita and i-- we lived happily
           ever after.
          phil and rita walk off together.
          across the street, larry is trying to get rid of ned ryerson
          who is doggedly trying to sell him insurance.

           ned
           but phil told me you were his
           accountant!

           larry
           look, i told you! he's nuts!
          larry keeps trying to walk away, but ned won't leave him alone.

           ned
           let me just tell you about single
           premium life--
          finally, larry slugs ned and storms off, leaving ned
          floundering in a snowbank.
          phil and rita walk on as we pull up and away from main street
          revealing the whole of punxsutawney and the snowy countryside
          that embraces it.
