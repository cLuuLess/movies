          int. phil's room - dawn

          phil sits up in bed and looks around the room. the decor is
          typical bed and breakfast, flocked wallpaper, framed prints,
          and an odd assortment of mismatched furniture. his suit is
          hanging neatly on the back of the closet door and his suitcase
          is open on a stand at the foot of the bed, still neatly packed.
          a iradio, deejay and his sidekick come on with hyped-up,
          drivetime chappy talk." phil stares at the radio and listens
          to them.

           deejay
           okay, campers, rise and shine,
           and don't forget your booties
           because it's cooold out there

           today1
          phil grimaces and swings out of bed.

           sidek ick
           it's cold out there everyday.
           w hat is this-- miami beach?
          the deejay laughs. phil shakes his head at the cheesy repartee
          as he crosses to the sink and starts brushing his teeth.

           hazardous travel later today with

           sidekick
           that "blizzard thing?"
          phil splashes some water on his face and prepares to shave.

           sidekick (cont.)
           oh, here's the report: the
           national weather service is
           calling for a big blizzard thing.

           deejay

           reason today is very special--

           out and see his shadow?

           sidekick
           punxsutawney phil.
          phil looks up at himself in the mirror, admiring his own face.

           deejay
           that's right, rodent lovers!

          sound effect of grunting groundhogs.
          phil grunts at his reflection in the mirror.

           phil
           (to himself)
           never again.
