          int. studio - continuous

          hawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather
          corner of the action news set. phil starts putting weather
          stats up on a chart.

           phil
           get away from me. i'm working.

           hawley
           so what's the outlook? we gonna
           get that blizzard?
          phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed
          "phil's phorecast" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next
          to the title.

           phil
           no way. all that moisture coming
           up from the gulf is going to miss
           us completely and take a dump on
           harrisburg.

           hawley
           (with authority)
           good, 'cause you're going up to
           punxsutawney to cover the
           groundhog story tomorrow morning
           and i want you back here in time
           to do the five.

           phil
           jesus, gil, give me a break, will
           you! i covered the goddamn
           groundhog last year and the year
           before that.

           hawley
           and you'll do it :next year and
           the year after, too. when i
           worked in san diego, i covered
           the swallows coming back to
           capistrano for ten years in a
           row.

           phil
           you should've killed the guy who
           made you do that.

           hawley
           i wanted to do it.

           phil
           then you should've killed
           yourself. i don't want to get
           stuck with the groundhog for the
           rest of my life.

          

           -4-

          

           hawley
           it's a cute story. he comes out,
           he looks around, he wrinkles up
           his little nose, he sniffs around
           a little, he sees his shadow, he
           d oesn't see his shadow-- it's
           nice. people like it.

           phil
           many people are morons.

           hawley
           just do it.

           phil
           what'11 you give me?
          hawley looks across the studio and sees rita hanson enter, a
          very attractive segment producer in her late twenties.

           hawley
           (to phil)
           i'll give you rita.
           (calls her over)
           rita, could you come here for a
           second? i got a little job for
           you.
          rita is relatively new to the station, but very competent,
          personable, humorous, self-assured and very pretty-- in short,
          a genuine princess, though phil is too self-absorbed at this
          point to realize it.

           phil

           (teasing)
           you can't send rita out on a
           story like this. she's just a
           cub, a pup, still wet behind the
           ears. look at her. her ears are
           sopping wet. this needs a
           woodward or a bernstein. it's a
           big story. people need to know.

           rita

           (intrigued)
           what's the story?

           hawley
           the punxsutawney groundhog
           festival.

           rita
           gil, if it's all right with you
           i ' d rather follow-up on the
           nurses' strike.

          

           -5-

          

           hawley
           you can do the nurses when you
           get back. just take the squeaky
           wheel here up to punxsutawney and
           get him back in one piece. okay?

           rita
           yeah, okay.
          hawley exits leaving phil and rita alone in the studio. she
          knows phil mainly by his reputation and it isn't good. still,
          she finds him appealing in an odd way.

           phil

           (pleasantly)
           you know, this could be extremely
           interesting.

           rita
           i've never done a weather story
           before. what's punxsutawney
           like?

           phil
           oh, it's an enchanted place. a
           magical world. it's the
           constantinople of the whole
           western appalachian-susquehanna
           drainage system.

           rita
           do you always joke?

           phil
           about 70 to 80% of the time.
           inside i'm actually a very shy
           and sensitive person.

           rita
           a lot of people around here think
           you're not very sincere.

           phil
           tell me the names of these
           people.

           rita
           i'll line up a crew and
           transportation. if you don't
           feel like driving, we can all go
           up in the van together.

           phil
           i think i'll take my own car.
           i ' m not that fond of my fellow
           man.

          

           -6-

          

          

           rita

           (exiting)
           nice attitude.

           phil
           nice face.
           (calls after her)
           why don't you ride up with me?

           rita
           no, thanks.
          stephanie decastro , an attractive, dark-eyed, dark-haired
          correspondent, glares at phil from across the studio.
