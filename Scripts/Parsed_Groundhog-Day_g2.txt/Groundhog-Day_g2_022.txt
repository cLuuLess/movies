           phil jumps out and begins to walk down the highway, past the
           parked cars, shivering in his light sweater and silk sport
           shirt. the snowfall is getting heavier and the wind is pickin
           up. the snow comes down unnaturally hard and fast. he walks
           on, slipping and sliding in his expensive loafers until he
           j comes to a police roadblock up ahead, manned by two highway

          "j patrolmen.
