          ext. the street - later

          phil, gus and ralph approach ralph's big, black, old buick
          convertible parked outside the bar. they are even drunker than
          they were before.

           ralph
           (fumbling with his

           carkeys)
           where you stayin', phil? we'll
           drop you off.

           phil
           hey, friends don't let friends
           drive drunk. give me your keys.

          

           -46-

          
          he's as wasted as they are, but ralph hands over his keys
          without a fight.

           ralph
           thanks , man .

           phil
           it's nothing. get in.
          they all pile into the front seat with phil at the wheel.

           phil
           (starting the ear)
           seatbelts.
          ralph and gus give him the thumbs up sign and start digging
          around in the seat cracks for their seatbelts. suddenly, phil
          floors the accelerator and peels away, sideswiping a parked car
          as he screeches around the corner.
