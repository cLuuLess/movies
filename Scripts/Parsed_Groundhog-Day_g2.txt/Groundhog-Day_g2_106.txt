          int. diner - day

          phil and rita are sitting in the diner at their regular table.

           rita
           i ' m sorry. what was that again?

           phil
           i'm a god.

           rita
           you're god?

           phil
           no, i'm a god. not the god-- at
           least i don't think i am.

           rita
           that's reassuring. for a mintute
           there i thought you might be
           crazy.

           phil
           no, it's true. it's the only
           possible explanation. i'm a
           supernatural being.

           rita
           because you survived a car wreck?

          

           -85-

          
          the waiter comes to the table.

           waiter
           are you ready to order?

           phil
           (to rita, ignoring the

           waiter)
           not just the car wreck! i didn't
           just blow up yesterday, you know.
           i've been run over, drowned,
           crushed, stabbed, shot,
           electrocuted, poisoned, frozen,
           burn ed, and asphyxiated--

           rita
           really?
          the waiter looks at him like he's nuts.

           phil
           --but i always wake up the next
           day without a scratch, without
           even a headache. i'm telling
           you, i ' m immortal.

           waiter
           the special today is blueberry
           waffles.

           rita
           why are you telling me this?

           waiter

           (shrugs)
           because some people like
           blueberry waffles.

           rita
           (to the waiter)
           no t you-- him.

           phil
           because i want you to believe in
           me.

           rita
           you're not a god, phil. take my
           word for it. this is twelve
           years of catholic school talking.

           waiter
           i could come back if you're not
           ready.

           phil
           how do you know i'm not a god?

          

           -86-

          

           rita
           please.

           phil
           how do you know?

           rita
           because it's not possible.

           waiter
           i'll come back.
          the /waiter turns to leave.

           phil
           hey, billy!
          the waiter turns back.

           phil
           this is bill. he's been a waiter
           for three years because he left
           penn state and had to find work.
           he likes the town, he paints toy
           soldiers, and he's gay.

           waiter
           i am notl
          phil grabs an astonished rita and pulls her over to the next
          table.

           rita
           what are you doing?

           phil
           this is doris kleiser and her
           fiance fred.

           doris
           do i know you?

           phil
           they're supposed to get married
           tonight but doris is having
           second thoughts.

           fred
           what!
          doris touces her engagement ring, dumbfounded. rita is a
          little embarrassed.

           rita
           lovely ring.

           doris
           thanks.

          

           -87-

          
          phil drags rita to the counter.

           phil
           this is ralph. say "hi," rita.
          rita flashes a quick smile.

           ralph
           don't believe i've had the--

           phil
           ralph hates his life here and
           wants to drive around town
           smashing into policemen.

           ralph
           well, who don't?

           rita
           this is some kind of trick.

           phil
           yes, it's a trick. but maybe the
           real god cheats, too. maybe god
           isn't omnipotent-- he's just had
           a lot of practice.

           rita
           how about that guy?

           phil
           tom. worked in the coal mine
           Â·til they shut it down.

           rita
           her?

           phil '
           nancy. went to lincoln high
           school in pittsburgh. takes
           herself out to lunch once a week.
          rita is getting very bewildered. from their reactions she can
          see that phil is right about each and every one of them.

           rita
           how do you know these people!

           phil
           i told you the truth. in five
           seconds there's going to be a
           grease fire in the kitchen.
           five, four--

           rita
           this is nuts.

          

           -88-

          

           phil
           --three, two, one.
          phil points to the kitchen as smoke starts pouring from the
          service window. everyone in the diner is now staring at them

           rita
           (trying to puzzle it

           out)
           okay, enough. let's just sit
           down and think for a second.
           (they sit)
           what do you know about me, phil?
           do you know me, too?
          phil takes a long pause.

           phil
           i know all about you, rita. i
           know you like producing, but hope
           for better than channel 9,
           pittsburgh.

           rita
           everyone knows that.

           phil
           you like boats but not the ocean.
           there's a lake you go to in the
           summer with your family, up in
           the mountains, with an old wooden
           dock and a boathouse with boards
           missing in the roof, and a place
           you used to crawl underneath to
           be alone, and at night you'd look
           up and see the stars. you're a
           sucker for rocky road, marlon
           brando, and french poetry.
           you're wonderfully generous;
           you're kind to strangers, and
           children; and when you stand in
           the snow, you look like an angel.

          

           rita
           how are you doing this?

           phil
           i told you! i wake up every day
           right here, right in
           punxsutawney, and it's always
           february second and i can't turn
           it off. if you still don't
           bel iev e me, listen--

           rita
           b u t , phil--

          

           -89-

          

           phil
           listen! in ten seconds larry is
           going to walk through that door
           and take you away from me.

           rita
           larry?

           phil
           but you can't let him. please
           believe me. you've got to
           believe me.

           rita
           i don't --
          larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around and spots
          rita.

           phil
           look.
          as rita turns around to see larry, phil grabs a pen and pad
          from a passing waitress and quickly writes something down as
          larry makes his way to their table. phil finishes writing.

           larry
           (to rita)
           you ready? we better get going
           if we're going to stay ahead of
           the weather.
          phil hands the paper to rita. she reads it.

           rita

           (reading)
           " . . . stay ahead of the weather. "
          larry looks at the paper.

           larry
           what ' s that?
          rita looks at phil with new understanding and empathy.
