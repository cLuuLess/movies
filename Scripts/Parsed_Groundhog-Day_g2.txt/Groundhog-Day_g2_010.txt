          ext. a highway - afternoon

          a van marked ".channel 9 action news" speeds along a two-lane
          highway through the winter landscape of west central
          pennsylvania. mounted atop the van is a microwave transmitter.
          rita is riding up front with larry, the union cameraman and
          techie. phil is following close behind the van in a new lexus
          coupe. his car has a bumper-sticker that reads "weathermen
          like it wet."

           phil (v.o.)
           (on his earphone)
           i'm on my way to punxsutawney...
           (forced to repeat it,
           a little embarrassed)

           i think that all depends on you.
