          ext. boarding house - moments later

          phil gulps down the steaming coffee, still trying to wake up
          from what he assumes is a dream, and descends the front steps
          of the house. he accosts a passerby.

           phil
           ma'am? excuse me. where's
           everybody going?

           passerby
           to gobbler's knob. it's
           groundhog day!
          the coffee cup drops from phil's hand as he stands there open-
          mouthed. then he slaps his own face and shakes his head as if
          trying to clear it and starts off down the street.
