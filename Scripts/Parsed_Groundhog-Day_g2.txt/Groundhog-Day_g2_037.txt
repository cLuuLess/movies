          int. phil's room - continuous

          phil, has demolished just about all the furniture and woodwork
          in the room. he rips off the last of the wooden moldings with
          the crowbar, then crosses to the mirror over the demolished
          sink.
          phil stands there, staring at his image in the mirror, trying
          to figure out what's happening to him. he starts breathing
          heavier, as if gathering courage, then, just when we think he's
          going to cut off his ear or something, he raises an electric
          barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his
          head. he studies his new look for a moment then smashes the
          mirror with his sledgehammer.
          then he opens the cans of paint, dips the two big brushes into
          the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls,
          madly, feverishly, splashing himself and everything else in the
          room with it.
          as a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open,
          then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of
          feathers.
          finally, phil falls exhausted on the bed. from outside we can
          hear outraged hotel employees pounding on the door.
          we pan over to the clock radio, the only undamaged object in
          the room. feathers drift down past the face of the clock which
          reads 5:59 am. the time changes to 6:00, the radio clicks on
          and "i got you, babe" starts playing as we pan back to phil
          sleeping on the bed.
          he opens his eyes, jumps out of bed and looks around. no
          paint, no feathers, no damage. everything is as clean and tidy
          as the day he checked in.
          he races over to the unbroken mirror and looks at himself. his
          hair is completely restored, as if it had never been shaved.
          the song ends and the deejays come on. phil says every word
          right along with them, shocked into a state of complete
          wonderment.

           phil and deejay
           okay, campers, rise and shine,
           and don't forget your booties
           because it's cooold out there
           today.

           phil and sidekick
           it's cold out there everyday.
           what is this -- miami beach?
          the deejay laughs. phil laughs insanely along with him.

          ext . gobbler ' s knob - early morning
          phil is wrapping up another groundhog report, trying to be
          completely professional despite the circumstances.

           phil
           (with forced good

           humor)
           . . . s o according to mr. groundhog
           i guess we can expect six more
           weeks of winter. it's not very
           scientific, but it sure is fun.
           hey, wait a second. if he's
           right, i could be out of a job!
           (mock laugh)
           for channel 9 news, this is phil
           connors in punxsutawney .
          he holds until larry stops tape, then approaches rita.

           phil
           how was that?

           rita

           (pleased)
           it was good. a little smarmy for
           my taste, but i guess that's what
           sells.

           phil
           could i talk to you about a
           matter that is not work related?

           rita
           you never talk about work.

           phil
           do you know what i did last
           night?

           rita
           do i want to know?

           phil
           i destroyed my hotel room.

           rita
           you whatl this is not some kind
           of rock and roll tour. we don't
           have the budget for that--

           phil
           no, it's okay. this morning it
           was all right again. that's what
           i have to talk to you about.
