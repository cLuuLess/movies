          int. breakfast room - continuous

          phil enters the old library of the house now set up with a
          breakfast buffet. an old spinet piano stands in the corner.
          one wall is lined with .bookcases filled with books. a handful
          of guests are seated around the room, eating.
          the matron of the house, mrs. lancaster, spots phil as she
          comes out of the kitchen with a fresh pot of coffee.

           mrs. lancaster
           did you sleep well, mr. connors?

           phil
           (with mock civility)
           like a roumanian orphan, mrs.
           lancaster.

           mrs. lancaster
           would you like some coffee?

           phil
           i don't suppose it1 d be possible
           to get an espresso or a capuccino
           around here.

           mrs. lancaster

           (blankly)
           i don't really know --

           phil
           forget it. this '11 be fine.

          

           -14-

          

           mrs. lancaster
           ( as she pours)
           i wonder what the weather's going
           to be like for all the
           festivities.

           phil
           my guess is it'11 be cold and
           overcast, high today in the low
           30's, dropping to the low 20's
           tonight, but i'm predicting that
           all that moisture coming up from
           the gulf is going to miss us and
           dump some locally heavy snow,
           possibly blizzard conditions with
           travel advisories in the
           harrisburg area and maybe as far
           east as .philadelphia.
           (off her surprised

           look)
           you want to talk weather, you
           asked the right guy.
          he heads for the door.

           ;mrs. lancaster Â·

           :
           oh, will you be checking out
           today, mr. connors?

           phil
           unfortunately yes.
          phil exits.

           cut to:
