          ext. alley - night

          phil kneels on the cold ground beside the old bum who lies
          huddled against the wall, immobile.
          rita is standing by at the end of the alley, watching as phil
          examines him.
          phil writes something down on a small pad. he finishes, and
          sets it down by the old man. then he takes his coat and uses
          it to cover the man up. a siren is heard.
          phil stands and walks away, as an ambulance pulls into the
          alley.

           rita
           is he -- ?

           . 'phil
           yeah. let's go.

           rita
           in a minute.
          she waits and watches.
          the paramedics, bud and andy, get out of the ambulance and
          inspect the scene.

           bud
           it's ol1 really.

           andy
           that's a shame.

           bud
           look here .
          bud picks up the note phil left.
          rita steps closer.

           rita
           may i see that?
           (reading aloud)
           "every night, by cold bricks

           glow
           i watch the shadow rising
           from this old man in the snow.
           at 8:02 we let it go."

          

           -112-

          

           andy

           (repeating)
           "at 8:02 we let it go."

           bud
           wow, that's nice.
          rita hands him the note and quickly walks away.

           andy
           suppose he wrote it?

           bud

           (doubtful)
