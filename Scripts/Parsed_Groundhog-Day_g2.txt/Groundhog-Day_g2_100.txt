          int. ned ryerson's office - day

          ned and a client are huddled over his desk, looking at some
          papers. a body drops quickly past the window behind them.
          it's phil.
          they rush to the window and look down at the sidewalk three
          stories below. phil is sprawled there like a broken puppet,
          lifeless.
