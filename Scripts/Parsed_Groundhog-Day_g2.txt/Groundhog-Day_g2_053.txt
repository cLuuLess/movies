          int. breakfast room - continuous

          phil rushes into the breakfast room just as mrs. lancaster
          comes out of the kitchen with the coffee. everything is
          exactly the same as before.

           mrs. lancaster
           w o u l d you--
          phil interrupts, answering all her questions before she even
          asks them.

           phil

           (urgently)
           yes, i would like some coffee;
           the weather is going to be cold
           and overcast with blizzard
           conditions moving in later today;
           and yes, i will be staying an
           extra day.

           mrs. lancaster

           (baffled)
           why thank you.

           phil
           mrs. lancaster, has anyone been
           around here looking for me this
           morning? maybe a state official,
           blue coat, hat, gun, nightstick,
           badge, driving a late-model ford
           br chevy, black and white with
           bub ble lights on top--

           mrs. lancaster

           (shocked)
           no, no one like that-- i .don't--
           will they be?

           phil
           (greatly relieved)
           apparently not.
          phil gooses her, grabs a sweet roll, and heads for the door,
          starting to believe now that he can truly do anything he wants
          to.
