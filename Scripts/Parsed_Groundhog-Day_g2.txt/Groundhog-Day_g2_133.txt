           like a dog with a biiiiig-- what
           was it?

          phil makes an animal really quickly.
          rita watches from the doorway, unseen by phil.

           kids

          the kids attack phil. lots of rolling around on the bed. rita
          watches, completely enthralled.
          finally, phil extricates himself and exits to find rita
          waiting.

           rita
           all right, now what's going on?

           phil

          ext . residential street - a little later
          phil rushes down the sidewalk with rita close behind him. he
          stops under a tree and puts his arms out just as a young boy
          falls out of the tree and into his arms, knocking him to the
          ground. the kid runs off unhurt as phil gets back to his feet
          and brushes himself off.

           phil
           (to rita)

           thanked me once . i ought to j ust

           lesson.

           dreaming.
