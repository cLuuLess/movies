          int. diner.- continuous

          phil and rita sit together at the same table they had
          previously. the waiter approaches.

           rita
           (to waiter)
           could i have some coffee, please?
          the waiter pours her a cup.

           waiter

           (exiting)
           i'll be back to take your order.

           rita
           thanks.
           (to phil)
           okay, so tell me. how'd you know
           where to put the camera?

           phil
           because i've done it before.

           rita
           i know, but the groundhog doesn't
           do exactly the same thing every
           year, does he?

          

           -40-

          

           phil
           i ' m not talking about last year.
           i ' m talking about today. i lived
           it before.

           rita
           you're having deja vu?

           phil
           big time. rita, i know it's nuts
           but i keep reliving the same day
           o ve r and over-- groundhog day--
           today. this is the third time.

           rita
           (completely skeptical)
           uh-huh. i'm waiting for the
           punchline.

           phil
           no, really. it's like today
           never happened. i shaved my head
           last night, today its all grown
           back. i could probably cut off
           my limbs, one by one, and - pop!
           they'd grow back. just like a
           starfish. i probably don't even
           have to floss?

           rita
           i'm wracking my brain, but i
           can't even begin to imagine why
           you'd make up something like
           this.

           phil
           'cause i'm not making it up. i'm
           asking for your help.
          rita looks at him for a long moment.

           rita
           okay, i'll bite. what do you
           want me to do?

           phil
           the truth? i'd 1ike you to spend
           the next 24 hours with me and
           don't leave my side for a second.

           rita
           i see. you know, phil, you can
           charm all the little p.a.'s at
           the station, all the secretaries,
           and even some of the weekend
           a nchors, but not me-- not in a
           thousand years.

           phil
           wa it a second--

           rita
           not if i was dying and your
           breath was the only cure; not if
           having your child was the only
           way to preserve the human race.
           just get it out of your head
           because it is not going to

           happen!

           phil
           so much for the truth.
          larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots rita
          and makes his way over to their table.

           larry
           (to rita)
           you ready? we better get going
           if we're going to stay ahead of
           the weather.

           rita
           yeah, , i ' m . ready, larry.

           (exiting)
           good luck, phil.
