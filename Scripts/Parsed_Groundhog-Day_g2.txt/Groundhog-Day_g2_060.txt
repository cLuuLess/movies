          ext. penn bank and trust - day

          two harmless-looking old guards are calmly loading bags of cash
          into an armored car parked in front of a local bank. suddenly
          phil appears, wielding a shotgun, wearing a batman style cape,
          his face completely hidden by a ski mask.

           phil

           (shouts)
           all right, freeze!! drop your
           guns j!
          the guards stand there frozen with terror.

           phil
           you guys ever been held up
           before?
           (they shake their

           heads)
           it's kind of exciting, isn't it?

           first guard

           (frightened)
           i guess so. something to tell
           the kids about.

           phil

          he raises the mask and shows his face.

           (shaking their hands)
           herman and felix. okay. take it
           easy, boys. and thanks.
          the frightened guards watch as phil makes off with two large
          satchels of cash.
