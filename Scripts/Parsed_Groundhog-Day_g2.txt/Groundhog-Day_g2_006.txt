          int. phil connors' office - morning

          we don't see anyone at first but the office itself speaks
          volumes about it's inhabitant-- team pictures of the steelers
          from the franco harris-terry bradshaw glory years, a framed
          memorial portrait of roberto clemente, a local emmy award
          statue, an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk
          on the desk, ^windowsill, and every other available surface.
          as the credits end, we notice a sleeping figure on the small
          sofa, buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline
          blanket.
          gil hawley, executive producer of the action news, sticks his
          head in the door.

           hawley
           christ, what a pit. phil"
          the sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at hawley.
          it's phil, the .channel 9 action news weatherman.

           phil

           (sleepy)
           what?

           hawley
           it's february first, phil. you
           know what tomorrow is?
          phil sits up and.thinks hard. he's in his mid-thirties, smart,
          rugged-looking, perhaps a little too full of himself, but
          clearly a guy with a lot of personality.

           phil
           (catching on)
           oh, no! not again.
          he jumps up and exits the office with hawley right behind him.

           phil
           forget it! i'm not going.
