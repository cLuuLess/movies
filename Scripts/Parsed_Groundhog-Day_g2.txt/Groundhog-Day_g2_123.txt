          ext. street - day

          phil is walking down the street. he glances down the alley as
          he passes, stops, walks back and enters the alley. the old bum
          that phil never noticed before is lying there, huddled against
          a wall. phil goes to help him.

           phil
           hey, mister. hey. come on,
           let's get you somewhere warm.
          the old bum turns to look at phil, then closes his eyes.

           phil
           (helps the old man to
           his feet)
           there you go.
          phil practically carries him out of the alley.
