          ext. gobbler's knob - dawn

          a big crowd is standing in a park-like clearing off a
          residential street. they are gathered around a large mound of
          dirt enclosed by a rail fence, waiting for the big moment. for
          a cold gray dawn, there is the atmosphere of a festival here.
          an area close to the mound is roped off for news reporters and
          cameras. rita stands there, a pocket of genuine beauty in this
          sea of potbellied old union guys and blow-dried reporters.

          stomping her feet against the cold, rita looks at her watch and
          glances around. larry, the cameraman, just looks bored.

           rita
           how could he be late?

           larry
           prima donnas.

           rita
           it's just so-- inconsiderate.

           larry
           what happens to some people?
           they're born nice. they grow up
           nice. you put 'em on tv and -
           bam! prima donnas.
          rita spots phil heading into the crowd.

           rita
           here he comes. phil! hey, phil.
           over here!
          phil joins them in the press area. rita pulls him to his mark
          near the rail fence.

           rita
           where've you been?

           phil
           i got hung up with some jerk i
           went to high school with. so,
           did you sleep okay without me?
           you tossed and turned, didn't
           you?
          rita holds up a slate for larry to id the tape.

           rita
           you're incredible.

           phil
           who told you?

           rita
           ready when you are.
          phil takes the microphone from rita and positions himself
          against the fence.
          the groundhog club officials in top hats, striped trousers and
          cutaway coats parade out to the burrow that houses punxsutawney
          phil.

           rita
           looks like they're starting.
           roll tape.

           rolling.
          rita silently counts down from five and cues phil who instantly
          snaps into announce mode.

           phil
           (to camera)
           once a year, the eyes of the
           nation turn here, to this tiny
           hamlet in pennsylvania, to watch
           a master at work. the master?
           punxsutawney phil, the world's
           most famous weatherman, the
           groundhog, who, as legend has it,
           can predict the coming of an
           early spring.
          rita turns to larry. this is impressive-- so far, so good.
          a groundhog club official kneels at the burrow and
          ceremoniously knocks on the small wooden door, then opens it
          and retreats.

           phil
           and here's the big moment we've
           all been waiting for. let's just
           see what mr. groundhog has to
           say.
          the groundhog sticks his head out, looks around, steps out of
          the hole, and runs over to the other side of the mound, about
          as far away from the cameras as he can get.

           phil
           hey! over here, you little
           weasel!
          larry zooms in as far as he can but the best he can manage is
          a close-up of the groundhog's back. the groundhog stands there
          a moment, his body casting a long shadow, then he lets out a
          squeak and runs back into the hole.

           phil
           great shot, huh, folks? well,
           that was certainly worth the
           trip. now we'll be hearing from
           mr. buster greene, president of
           the punxsutawney groundhog club,
           the so-called seer of seers who
           will interpret for us.
          buster greene, dressed up in his top hat and cutaway coat,
          walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd.

           b u st e r
           he came out, and he saw his
           shadow. sorry, ladies and
           gentlemen, but it looks like it's
           going to be a long winter.
          the crowd lets out a good-natured "awwwwww" in disappointment.

           phil
           (sarcastic, to camera)
           well, that's it. sorry you
           couldn't be here in person to
           share the electric moment. this
           is one event where televison
           really fails to capture the
           excitement of thousands of people
           gathered to watch a large
           squirrel predict the weather, and
           i for one am deeply grateful to
           have been a part of it.
           reporting for channel 9, this is
           phil connors.
          larry cuts the camera.

           rita
           (to phil)
           you want to try one that's a
           little sweeter?

           phil
           (to rita)
           that's as sweet as i get. i'm
           outa here.
          as he exits, phil tosses the mike to larry, who isn't expecting
          the throw and bobbles it, dropping the mike on the ground.

          int . diner - later
          phil is sitting alone having a cup of coffee in a busy, loud
          and lively cafe. rita enters, sees him sitting there, crosses
          to his table and sits down across from him.

           rita
           that was really lousy.

           phil
           is it my fault the little rat
           went south on us?

          

           -20-

          

           rita
           a real professional would have
           handled it. you acted like it
           was a personal insult. who do
           you think you are -- wolf blitzer?

           phil
           god, you really take this stuff
           seriously, don't you.

           rita
           yes, i do. as far as i ' m
           concerned there are no little
           stories, phil. only little
           reporters with big egos who think
           they're too good for the job they
           have to do.

           phil
           (trying to look hurt)
           you really don't know me very
           well, do you. 'cause if you did
           you could never say something
           like that about me. i care!
           call me a cockeyed optimist but
           i happen to think there's more to
           this job than just getting my
           ugly mug on the boob tube every
           night.

           rita
           is that so.

           phil
           yes, that is so.
          rita is so irritated by him she can't even respond.
          phil looks at her evenly for a long moment.

           phil
           so as far as us getting together,
           would you say the glass is half
           empty or half full?
          larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots rita
          and makes his way over to their table.

           larry
           (to rita)
           you ready? we better get going
           if we ' re going to stay ahead of
           the weather.

           phil
           you don't have to rush off, you
           know. that storm is 'going to
           miss us completely.

          

           -21-

          

           rita
           nice working with you, phil. see
           you around.
           rita walks away, leaving him sitting alone.
