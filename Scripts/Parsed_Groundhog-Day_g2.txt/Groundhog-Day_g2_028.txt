          phil rushes out into the corridor, hastily tying his tie, his
          suit jacket and overcoat over his arm. as he heads for the
          breakfast room, the same chubby man passes.

           chubby man

           phil
           morning.

           chubby man
           think it'll be an early spring?

           phil
           (stops, irritated)
           didn't we do this yesterday?

           chubby man

           (intimidated)
           i don't know what you mean.
          phil grabs him by the front of his shirt and looks deep into
          his eyes.

           phil
           don't mess with me, pork chop.
           what day is this?

           chubby man

           (terrified)
           febr uary second--groundhog day!
          phil can see he's telling the truth and relaxes his grip on the
          poor man.

           phil
           okay. sorry. i'm having a bad
           day.
          phil walks on, leaving the chubby man baffled and insulted.

           chubby man
           (to himself)
           i'll say.
