          ext. cemetery - day

          beyond the graveyard is a work shed with various tombstones
          scattered about. old tucker, the town stonecarver, is at work
          chiseling a name into a gravemarker.
          behind him, phil is chipping away at a small hunk of marble,
          sculpting a very lovely cherub.
          rita sits on a stool eating an apple and sipping hot tea
          watching him with amazed interest.

           phil
           but what if the rules changed?
           what if none of your actions had
           consequences?

           rita
           there would still be an absolute
           morality. there has to be an
           absolute good, regardless of the
           circumstances.

           phil
           oh, is that so, miss plato? then
           let me ask you this. where does
           this "absolute good" come from?
           from the sky?

          rita shrugs.

           rita
           i don't know. from my freshman
           philosophy course, i guess.
          they both laugh. then she looks at him for a long moment and
          grins.

           phil
           what?

           rita
           nothing. i just can't believe
           you're such a fine sculptor.
          phil takes a bite of her apple and gets up.

           phil
           i gotta go.

           rita
           where do you have to go in
           punxsutawney?

           phil
           i got piano and then drums.

           rita
           here?

           phil
           come on, i'll drop you off.
          they exit.
