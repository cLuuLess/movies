          ext. main street - day

          the bmw comes screeching to a stop right in front of the movie
          theater and the door opens.
          a pair of really elaborate cowboy boots complete with silver
          spurs hits the pavement first; then we pan up to see phil
          emerge from the car wearing a really gaudy; full cowboy outfit
          with real six-guns on his hips. a very trashy-looking girl,
          laraine, gets out on the passenger side, dressed like a french
          maid.

           (very self-conscious)
           i thought we were going to a
           costume party.

           phil
           yeah, we are, we are. but first
           i have this movie theater fantasy
           i want to talk to you about.
          he escorts her into the theater.
