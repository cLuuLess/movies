          ext. the street - continuous

          a second police car joins the chase.

           ralph
           (looking back)
           that's two!

           phil
           having a good time?

           ralph
           i'm having a great time!
          phil speeds up to a hundred miles and hour. gus is looking
          even worse from the liquor and the motion of the car.

           gus
           hey, uh --

           phil
           phil.

          

           -48-

          

           gus
           yeah, phil-- like the groundhog.

           phil
           right.

           gus
           hey, phil? how're we going to
           get out of this?

          their pov - the intersection ahead
          two police cars with lights flashing are parked sideways,
          completely blocking the road. officers stand in the roadway,
          motioning for phil to stop.

           phil

           (calmly)
           gus, you're just going to have to
           trust me on this one.
          he tromps the gas pedal to the floor. gus's eyes go wide with
          terror.
          the police dive out of the way.

           phil and ralph
           yahooooo!

          their pov - through the windshield
          the buick crashes head on into one of the police cars.

           black out:

          c lose up - clock
          the time changes from 5:59 to 6:00. the radio starts playing
          "i got you, babe."
          phil sits up suddenly and looks around, completely amazed. he
          is in his room at the bed and breakfast, everything exactly the
          same as before. he hops out of bed and quickly examines
          himself for signs of physical injury. nothing. the music ends
          and the two deej ays come on.

           deejay
           okay, campers, rise and shine,
           and don't forget your booties
           because it's cooold out there
           today.
          phil talks out loud along with them.

           phil and sidekick
           it's cold out there everyday.
           what is this-- miami beach?

          

           -49-

          
          the deejays laughs. phil laughs, too, exhilirated at having
          survived the car wreck, still very confused and perplexed, but
          just beginning to see the possibilities of his unique
          situation. he starts dressing in a hurry.
