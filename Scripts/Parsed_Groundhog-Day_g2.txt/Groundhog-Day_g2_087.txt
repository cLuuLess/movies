          int. library - continuous

          phil walks past the front desk looking very haggard and
          dangerous, and enters the children's section. no one is
          present except the children's librarian, a young woman,
          reshelving books in the stacks. he looks around quickly and
          sees a window in the wall and over it a large sign which reads:
          "punxsutawney phil - the great prognosticates"
          phil heads right for it.
          the groundhog scurries around his little temperature-controlled
          habitat, oblivious to the approaching danger.
          as phil approaches the groundhog display, he reaches into his
          overcoat and pulls out a pump shotgun with a short pistol grip.
          the children's librarian sees the gun and freezes.
          phil pumps a shell into the chamber as he walks right up to the
          case.

          phil's pov
          the groundhog looks right into his sights.
          philsqueezes the trigger. loud gunshot.
          the glass window is still intact, not a scratch on it. the
          groundhog looks up playfully.
          phil fires off four more rounds but, again, no results. phil
          can't believe it. he charges the glass and pounds it with the
          rifle butt. he can't even chip it. suddenly he is seized from
          behind by two strong men who take the rifle from him and
          wrestle him to floor.
          the librarian comes running up and looks at the groundhog.

           bystander
           is he all right?

           librarian
           he's just fine. that's two
           inches of bullet-proof glass
           there. you can't be too careful
           in this day and age.
