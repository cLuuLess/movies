          int. phil's office - later

          phil is in his cluttered cubicle talking on a headset phone
          while he reviews cassettes of his groundhog spots from the past
          two years on a small monitor. as he talks, he stuffs a number
          of personal items in an overnight bag, all the time watching
          himself on the tv monitor.

           phil
           (on the phone)
           they don't really think of me as
           a weatherman around here. more
           of a "personality," but with the
           credibility of a first-class
           broadcast journalist. once you
           look at my tape i think you'll
           see what they mean.
          stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at phil for
          a long moment. there is something vaguely off-center about
          this woman, not quite fatal attraction but still a little
          scary.

           stephanie

           (bitterly)
           i just want to know one thing:
           did i do something wrong or are
           you just tired of me or what? i
           have to know.
          phil sighs.

           phil
           (on the phone)
           dan, can i call you back? i've
           just been handed something and i
           better get on it...
           (he picks up some
           papers and rustles
           them for effect)
           ...okay, thanks.

          

           -7-

          
          he takes off the headset, gets up and closes the door for
          privacy.

           phil

           (kindly)
           you didn't do anything wrong,
           stephanie, and i ' m not tired of
           you. it's just that i don't have
           time for a real relationship
           right now. i told you that the
           first time we went out.

           stephanie
           (getting close)
           everybody says that at the
           beginning of a relationship.

           phil
           (gently pushing her

           away)
           i'm different. i really meant
           it! things are really starting
           to move for me now. i ' m not
           going to be doing the weather for
           the rest of my life. i was just
           talking to the cbs guy about a
           network job. i want that. this
           is just the beginning for me. i
           can't waste any more time.

           stephanie
           are you saying our relationship
           was a waste of time?

           phil
           our relationship? we went out a
           total of four times! and only
           twice did anything happen. it
           was fun but i don't see that as
           a big commitment.

           stephanie
           (closing in again)
           i had our charts done. my
           astrologer says we're extremely
           compatible. there may even be
           some past lives involvement here.

           phil
           see? so we've already done this.
           let's move on. next case.

           stephanie
           you know what's wrong with you,
           phil? you're selfish. you don't
           have time for anyone but
           yourself.

          

           -8-

          

           phil
           that's what i ' m trying to tell
           you. you don't want to be with
           me. you can do better. look,
           stephanie, if i ever said or did
           anything to mislead you i'm sorry
           for that, but right now i have to
           do this groundhog thing and i
           don't have a handle on it yet.
          he throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and
          puts on his jacket.

           phil (cont.)
           i'll tell you what. i ' m going to
           do some serious thinking while
           i ' m in punxsutawney, okay?
          he pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her, leaving her
          standing there with a malevolent look on her face.
