          mrs. lancaster is watching tv in the parlor of the hotel. in
          the corridor behind her, phil walks by, dressed in a robe,
          carrying an electric toaster and a towel, heading for the
          bathroom.
          a few moments pass.
          we hear the zap of an electrocution, the lights and tv flicker
          and dim for a moment, then come back on again.
