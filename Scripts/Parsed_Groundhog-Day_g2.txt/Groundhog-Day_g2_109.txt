          ext. park - day

          phil and rita are sitting on a park bench.

           phil
           so do you believe any of this?

           rita
           i don't know. i don't know how
           else you could know so much.
           maybe it is really happening.

           phil
           i used to try to stay up all
           night sometimes. i thought if i
           could stay conscious i could
           figure out what was going on, or
           at least hang onto something from
           the day before. but i gave up on
           that a long time ago.
          rita looks at him with compassion.

           rita
           it sounds so-- lonely.

           phil
           (trying to shrug it

           off)
           it's not that bad. you get used
           to it.
          rita comes to a decision.

           rita
           maybe i should spend the rest of
           the day with you-- as an
           objective witness. just to see
           what happens. okay?

           phil
           yeah, sure. that'd be okay.
