          phil drops rita off and watches as she crosses the street to
          larry who is waiting on the other side.
          across the street, rita takes a wistful glance toward phil,
          then gets in the news van and drives off.
          phil gets out of the car and starts walking, but finds himself
          face to face with ned ryerson.

           ned
           phil! phil connors! i thought
           that was you!

           phil
           ned? ned ryerson! i don't
           believe it. i've missed you so
           much.

          phil gives ned a big hug and keeps holding on for an
          uncomfortably long time, actually giving ned a hickey on the
          neck. ned goes into homophobic shock.

           ned
           uh, i gotta get going. nice to
           see you, phil.
          he hurries off.
