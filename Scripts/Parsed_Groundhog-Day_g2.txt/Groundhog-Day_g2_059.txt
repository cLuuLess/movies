          int. breakfast room - morning

          some elderly guests are sipping coffee and eating breakfast,
          staring uncomfortably at something on the other side of the
          room.

          their pov
          phil is standing at the bookcase, wearing only pajamas,
          absently munching on a danish as he reads from one of the
          books.
          mrs. lancaster approaches him.

           mrs. lancaster
           isn't it a wonderful collection?

           phil
           (not looking up)
           yes, it is. you don't usually
           find this many trashy novels in
           one place.

           mrs. lancaster
           you can take a book up to your
           room if you like.

           phil
           no, thank you. i've actually
           read them all. i was just
           rereading some of the dirty
           parts.
          he finishes and puts the book back on the shelf.

           mrs. lancaster

           (worried)
           how long will you be staying with
           us, mr. connors?

           phil
           indefinitely. i've already been
           here for 211 days.

           mrs. lancaster
           (humoring him)
           really? that's quite a long
           time, isn't it. i hope you're
           finding things to do in our
           little town.

           phil

           (casually)
           yes, well, i'm getting a little
           tired of casual sex so today i
           thought i'd rob a bank and buy
           myself a really expensive car.
