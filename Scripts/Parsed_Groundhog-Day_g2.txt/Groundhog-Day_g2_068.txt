          int. diner - a little later

          phil and rita are at their usual table, drinking coffee.

           rita
           i guess i want what everybody
           wants-- you know, career, love,
           marriage, children. so far i
           don't have any of it.

          

           -62-

          

           phil
           you have a career.

           rita
           i have a job. doing stories on
           the punxsutawney groundhog is not
           my ultimate goal. no offense.

           phil
           how about the other stuff? you
           seeing anybody?

           rita
           this is getting too personal. i
           don't think i ' m ready to discuss
           these things with you. what
           about you? what do you want?

           phil
           what i really want is someone
           like you.

           rita
           o h , please--

           phil
           why not?

           rita
           phil, you know, you have so much
           talent and ability. if you'd
           just drop the attitude and act
           like a decent human being, then
           maybe i ' d --
           (she hesitates)

           phil
           you'd what?

           rita
           i don't know what.

           phil
           then maybe you'd like me?
          she stares hard at him.

           rita
           i don't know. it's sort of like
           the way i feel about ufo's. i'd
           have to see it to believe it.
          larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots rita
          and makes his way over to their table.

          

           -63-

          

           larry
           (to rita)
           you ready? we better get going
           if we're going to stay ahead of
           the weather.

           rita
           yeah, i'll be right out, larry.
          larry scowls at phil and exits.

           phil
           (to rita)
           why don't you stay for a while?
           the road's going to be closed
           anyway. do you really want to be
           stuck in the van with larry for
           three hours?

           rita
           i've got to get back. i'll see
           you later.
          phil watches rita exit.

          phil's pov
          rita gets in the news van and drives off with larry.
          phil stares out the window, more" determined than ever to win
          her over.

           cut to:
