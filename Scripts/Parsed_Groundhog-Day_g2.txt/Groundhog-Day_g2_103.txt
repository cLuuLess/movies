          ext. the bank - day

          the building is surrounded by police, all crouched behind their
          cars with guns and rifles trained on the doors.

          

           -84-

          
          suddenly, the doors burst open and phil comes running out of
          the bank screaming, dressed in camouflage fatigues and armed to
          the teeth with an assault rifle in one hand, an uzi in the
          other and a couple of handguns stuck in his belt. he doesn't
          get three feet before he is shot down in an incredible hail of
          gunfire.
          rita stands beside the camera gaping in horror while larry
          records the grisly massacre.
