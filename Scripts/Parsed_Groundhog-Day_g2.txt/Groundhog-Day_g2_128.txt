          phil is delivering his report. everyone there is silent and
          listening to phil. even the other reporters have turned their
          cameras on him.

           ...when chekhov saw the long
           winter, it was a winter bleak and
           dark and bereft of hope; and yet,
           we know winter's only one more
           step in the cycle. and standing
           among the people of punxsutawney --
           (phil looks directly at

           rita)
           -- basking in the warmth of their
           hearths and hearts, i couldn't
           imagine a better fate than a long
           and lustrous winter.
          phil smiles. rita smiles, too.
