           part ied all night with some
           nymphomaniac biker chicks.

           rita

           (skeptical)
           sounds wholesome. were those the
           new 24-hour disappearing tattoos
           or can i see them?

           phil
           no, they're gone. rita, if you
           only had one day to live, what
           would you do with it?

          she switches off the videotape and steps out of the van.

           rita
           i don't know, phil. what are you

           phil
           no, i mean like what if the
           entire world was about to
           explode?

           p ut the camera. what are you
           looking for, phil-- a date for

          she starts walking toward the center of town. phil sticks
          right with her.

           phil

           fun?

           rita
           (she stops)
           is this real or are you just
           going to make me feel like a
           fool?
