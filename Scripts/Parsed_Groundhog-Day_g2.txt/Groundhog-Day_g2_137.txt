          phil and rita walk into a banquet room decorated with
          streamers, balloons and flowers. there is a long buffet table
          and a punch bowl. another long table is loaded with wedding
          gifts. a small band is playing.
          people are dancing. the wedding party is dressed in rented
          tuxedos and appropriately pouffy bridesmaid dresses.

           rita
           this is incredible. who's
           wedding is this?

          phil grabs two glasses of champagne and hands one to rita.

           phil
           just some friends. dorisi
          the bride, doris, young and cheery, is on her way to see phil.
          she is dragging fred, her groom, with her.

           doris
           hi, mr. connors! come on,
           freddy.

           fred
           hi.

           doris

           fred
           no way!

           phil
           how's it going, fred?

           fred
           hey, i ' d like to thank you for
           making doris go through with
           this.

           phil
           are you kidding? don't buy that
           playing hard to get stuff. she's
           crazy about you, you stud.

           doris
           i ' m really glad you could come.

           phil
           congratulations.
          phil reaches into his pocket, pulls out two tickets and hands
          them to doris.

           doris
           what is this? oh, no way! no
           way! ahhh!
          doris throws herself on fred and jumps up and down. fred grabs
          the tickets.

           fred
           wrestlemania! no way! no way!
          doris throws herself on phil.

           doris
           how did you know?

           phil

           about you two, tried to picture
           what you ' d want more than
           anything in the world and it came
           to me. bing! wrestlemania.

           fred
           thanks, mr. connors. you're a
           real pal.

           doris
           this is the best!
          doris gives phil a kiss. she and fred move on.

           rita
           i don ' t understand . you rush
           from one person to the next in a
           town you only visit once a year,
           you know everything before it
           happens , and you -- - i don ' t know ,
           you seem to be punxsutawney ' s
           leading citizen.
          the band finishes a set. the guests stop dancing and head for
          the refreshments. phil and rita are left alone for the moment

           phil
           what do you want to know?

           rita
           who are you?

           phil
           i really don't know.

           rita
           no, there's something going on
           with you.

           phil
           okay, i wake up in punxsutawney
           on february second -- every day.
           it's supernatural. i don't even
           try to explain it anymore. so,
           i live each day as if it's the
           only day i've got.
          rita stares into his eyes for a very long time, but sees only
          good, true things.

           rita
           that's pretty amazing. "

          

           -115-

          

           phil
           you want to know what's really
           amazing? i've been waiting for
           you every day for ten thousand
           years. i dream of you every
           night of my life. you've been my
           constant weapon against total
           despair, and just knowing you
           exist has kept me alive. how's
           that?
          rita can't even speak. this is clearly the nicest thing
          anybody has ever said to anybody.
          mary the piano teacher notices phil.

           mary
           phil!
           (to her friend)
           this is the guy.

           phil
           hello, mary. rita, this is one
           of punxsey's finest musicians.

           Â·mary
           give me a break. you should
           talk. why don't you play
           something?

           phil
           n o , i--

           mary
           please.

           fred
           hey, mr. connors. go for it.
          phil looks at rita. she nods and shrugs.
          phil walks up to the platform and sits at the piano. he begins
          to play a slow, serious, classical piece. everyone falls
          silent. it's so beautiful, rita is almost in tears.
          then, after a pause to let the serious notes sink in, phil
          transforms the piece into a fast, lively, upbeat jazz romp.
          everyone is delighted, and as the rest of the band kicks in,
          everyone grabs a partner and begins to dance.
          an old coot, uncle leo, grabs rita and the two of them dance up
          a storm.

           leo
           that's a great guy you've got
           there. doctor connors fixed my
           back, you know.

          it is snowing lightly. phil and rita are walking slowly, arm
          in arm, close. they stop and embrace. phil looks at rita.
          she looks like an angel.

          

           phil
           wait! don't move!

          
          phil scoops up some snow and begins packing it down, furiously,
          joyously, then rolling it into a large ball.

          

           rita
           making a snow man? i'll help.

          

           phil
           no, stay there. stand right
           th ere.

          
          ph il lifts the now larger chunk of packed snow and sets it on
          a mailbox. then he looks at her, and starts to sculpt it.

          phil is using a stick and the heat of his bare hands to model
          a delicate fold in the snow sculpture. several bystanders look
          o n with interest as phil stands back from his work.

          

           rita
           can i look?

          

           phil
           o kay, look.

          
          it is an excellent likeness of rita, the snow white as
          alabaster, pure as marble, a beautiful and delicate homage.

          

           rita

           (overwhelmed)
           nobody's ever done this for me.
           not even a drawing. it's
           beautiful.

           phil
           this is how i see you. when it
           all gets too much, i just close
           my eyes and there you are-- just
           like this. take it home and keep
           it in the freezer.
          rita embraces phil. they are about to kiss, looking deep into
          each others eyes.

           phil
           this one's for the frog prince.

           rita
           what?

           phil
           nothing.
          they kiss-- a long, deep, soul-stirring kiss.

           phil
           will you come with me?
          rita nods. they continue standing there, embracing, warming
          each other in the cold night air.

           rita
           (looks back at the ice

           sculpture)
           we're just going to leave her?

           phil
           it doesn't matter. really, it
           doesn't.
          they kiss again.

          phil sits up in bed. he looks around the room. things are
          different, messier. then he sees the covers move. wide-eyed
          now, he looks over and sees rita waking up, snuggling deep
          under the covers.

           phil

           rita
           are you always this jolly in the
           morning?
          phil runs to the window and looks out.

          his pov - the street
          the street ;is virtually empty, the town just waking up. kids
          are throwing snowballs.

           no groundhog! rita! they're all
           gone!

           rita
           you must've had some dream.

           phil

          phil opens the door and runs into the hallway wearing only
          pajama bottoms.

           rita
           phi l? phil!
          rita sits up in bed and waits. suddenly, from somewhere else
          in the inn comes the sound of phil at the piano expertly
          playing a difficult classical piece. he stops after a few
          bars.

           phil (o.c.)
           yeah!!!!
          phil runs back into the room.

           phil
           it really happened! you're
           really here!
          he pounces on rita again.

           rita

           (laughing)
           i'm here, i'm here!
          they kiss, passionately, hungrily.
