          phil and rita are walking down the sidewalk.

           phil
           afer i got over the shock, it was
           kind of fun for the first year or
           two. i had anything i wanted.
           except you, of course.

          phil abruptly pulls rita aside. a big pile of snow slides off
          a roof and onto the sidewalk where they would have walked.
          phil doesn't even look up. rita looks, as if she's seeing a
          miracle.

           rita
           how did this start?

           phil
           i don't know. i just woke up.
           just like always.
          ned ry-erson approaches.

           ned
           hey, phil! phil connors 1

           phil
           rita, this is ned ryerson. he's
           an asshole.

           ned
           he remembers me!
          phil and rita keep walking. rita looks back at ned, perplexed

           phil
           trust me on that one.
