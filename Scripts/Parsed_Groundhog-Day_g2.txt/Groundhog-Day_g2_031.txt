          ext. main street - punxsutawney - continuous

          phil rushes down the street, again failing to notice the old
          bum sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront.

           ned ryerson (o.c.)
           hey, phil!
          ned ryerson approaches with the same obnoxious attitude.

           ned
           phil! phil connors! i thought
           that was you!
          phil just stares at him and keeps walking.

           ned
           my oh my! phil connors. don't
           say you don't remember me, 'cause
           i sure as heck-fire remember you.
           well?

           phil
           ned ryerson?

           ned
           bing! first shot right out of
           the box. so how's it going, ol'
           buddy?

           phil
           to tell you the truth, neddy, i ' m
           not feeling real well. could you
           excuse me?

           ned
           now it's funny you should mention
           your health 'cause you'll never
           guess what i do.

          

           -30-

          

           phil
           (very distressed and
           desperate to get away
           from this guy)
           do you sell insurance, ned?

           ned
           bing again! you're sharp as a
           tack today. do you have life
           insurance, phil? 'cause if you
           do, i bet you could use more --
           who couldn't?" -- but i got a
           feeling you don't have any. am
           i right?

           phil
           (really annoyed now)
           did i say "fuck off, " ned? i
           can't talk to you right now.
          he backs away from ned and steps right into the same deep,
          slushy puddle he stepped in the day before.

           ned

           (braying)
           hey, look .out for that first v
           step. it's a doozyi
          phil looks down at his wet shoes and cuffs and stumbles off
          toward gobbler's knob.

           cut to:

          

          ext . gobbler ' s knob - dawn
          the crowd is gathered as before for the big moment.
          in the press area, rita is having the same dialogue with larry,
          when she spots phil heading into the crowd.

           rita
           here he comes. phill hey, phil!
           over here!
          phil waves to her and heads straight for an obscure corner of
          the knob, gesturing for her to follow.
          larry shakes his head as rita charges through the crowd toward
          phil. she catches up to him just as he is scratching a mark in
          the snow with his foot. she notices immediately that he is
          uncharacteristically dishevelled, his tie askew, his hair
          mussed.

           rita
           where ' ve you been?

          

           -31-

          

           phil
           (nervous, sweat ing)
           i've got to talk to you. i think
           i'm losing my mind.

           . rita
           i know you're losing it. what
           are you doing over here? the
           camera's over there.

           phil
           slap me, rita.

           rita
           what is this?

           phil

           (insistent)
           just slap me-- hard.
          she gives up and taps him lightly on the cheek.

           phil
           i said hardl

          . . .. ... .rita .
           i can't!

           phil
           do it!
          rita shrugs and slaps him very hard.

           phil
           (his cheek smarting)
           better. almost too hard, rita.

           rita
           are you drunk?

           phil
           no, drunk is more fun. can i be
           serious with you for a minute?

           rita
           i don't know. can you?

           phil
           yes. i ' m being serious. i' m
           having a problem-- no, i may be
           having a problem.

           rita
           what are you trying to say?

          

           -32-

          

           phil
           i'm trying to say that if i was
           having a problem, just
           hypothetical ly, i ' d like to know
           that you're someone i could count
           on in a crisis.

           rita

           (worried)
           what did you do last night?
          the crowd begins to hush.

           larry
           we better get started. we're
           going to miss it.

           phil
           were not going to miss it.
           (indicating the other

           reporters)
           they're going to miss it.

           rita

           (emphatic)
           phil. we've been out here for an
           hour. we're cold and tired.
           let's just get this and get out
           of here.

           phil
           okay, put it here.

           rita
           what?

           phil
           put the camera here .
          rita takes a forlorn glance towards the press area, where all
          of the other cameras are set up .

           rita
           phil , there is no tomorrow on
           this one. it's groundhog day.

           phil
           we were in the wrong spot
           yesterday .

           rita

           (irked)
           w ha t? yesterday? what are you
           talking about?

           phil
           just trust me. put the camera
           here .

          

           -33-

          

          
          rita looks at him like he's crazy, then looks at her watch and
          gives up.

           rita
           larry!
          she charges off toward the cameras.
          in the press area, several reporters are already talking to
          their cameras, dribbling on about how "he could appear any
          second now." rita and larry grab their gear and rush back to
          phil.
          larry hurriedly sets up the camera.

           larry
           you want me to roll tape?

           rita
           (to phil)
           are you going to get on your
           mark?

           phil
           no hurry.
          larry glances over at the other news reporters, all talking to
          their cameras and pointing towards the mound.

           larry

           (desperately)
           everyone else is rolling!
          rita looks helplessly at phil.

           rita
           i'm begging you, all right?
           gould we please just do this?
          phil glances down at his watch.

           phil
           okay, let's do it.
          he crosses over to larry and taps him on the shoulder.

           phil
           roll tape.

           larry

           (mumbling)
           prima donnas.
          phil takes the microphone from rita and positions himself
          against the fence.

           larry
           rolling.

          

           -34-

          
          phil does a similar intro to the one he did before, though this
          time it's a bit tentative.

           phil
           (to camera)
           we ll, it's groundhog day-- again--
           and you know what that means.
           everybody's here on gobbler's
           knob waiting in the cold for the
           appearance of the most famous
           groundhog in the world,
           punxsutawney phil, who's going to
           tell us just how much more of
           this we can expect.
          the groundhog club official knocks on the groundhog's door,
          then opens it and retreats.
          phil takes a deep breath and makes his first experimental
          prediction, recalling the previous day.

           phil
           my forecast is we're going to see
           the groundhog peek its head out
           of its hole, look around a little
           bit, then he's going to come out,
           scamper over to this general
           area, look at the crowd for a
           second, make a little burping
           noise and run back into the
           ground.

           rita
           (whispers to larry)
           that's it. i'm going to kill
           him.
          phil looks at his watch.

           phil
           o k ay ? and here we go--
          phil points to the hole and larry zooms in.
          the groundhog sticks his head out, looks left, looks right,
          steps out of the hole, and runs away from the press pool,
          directly over to larry's camera. as he stands there, his body
          casts a long shadow. the groundhog looks right into the
          camera, lets out a squeak, and runs back into the hole.
          rita and larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the
          brief appearance of the groundhog. larry pans back to phil.
          phil just stands there speechless, staring at the groundhog
          burrow.

          

           -35-

          

           rita

           (hisses)
           phil!
          buster greene, the groundhog club official, walks onto the
          mound and hushes the crowd, exactly as before.

           buster
           he came out, and he saw his
           shadow. sorry, ladies and
           gentlemen, but it looks like it's
           going to be a long winter.
          again the crowd lets out a good-natured "awwwwww" in
          disappointment.
          larry pans back to phil just in time to see him walking away in
          a fog, without signing off. then he pans back to rita.

           rita
           (at a loss)
           for channel 9 news, this is rita
           hanson in punxsutawney.
          she holds for a moment then makes the cut sign, drawing her
          finger across her throat.

           phil
           (on the phone)
           i know there's a blizzard, but i
           have to get a call through to my
           doctor in pittsburgh. it's a
           medical emergency. . . .no, don't
           give me the punxsutawney fire
           department. when do you think
           the long distance lines will be
           working again?. . . but what if we
           don't have a tomorrow? we didn't
           have one today, my friend...
           hello...hello?
          he hangs up and shakes his head which is now really starting to
          ache, then he pops a handful of tylenol, lies down and pulls
          the covers up over his head. a moment later, he sits up, takes
          a pencil from the nightstand, breaks it in half and puts the
          pieces back on the nightstand. then he lies back down and
          retreats back under the covers.

           cut to:

          the digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00 am. the
          radio comes on, playing the end of the sonny and cher hit, "i
          got you, babe," just as it did the day before.
