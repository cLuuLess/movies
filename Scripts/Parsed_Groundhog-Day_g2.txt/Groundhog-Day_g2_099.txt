          ext. logger's leap - continuous

          the pickup bursts through a retaining fence and rockets over
          the edge of the cliff.
          the pickup seems to hang in the air for a long time, then it
          begins its slow motion descent, falling ever so gracefully
          until it impacts on the granite rock face far below.
          big explosion. big fireball. flaming wreckage. then a small
          click, followed by "i got you, babe."

          he slowly opens his eyes and blinks. he looks around and
          realizes he's back in his room at the bed and breakfast.

           phil
           ah, nuts!
          phil throws off the covers and hurls himself out of bed.
