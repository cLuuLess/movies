           phil is getting annoyed as the phone connection deteriorates.
           the snow is getting heavier. phil switches on the windshield
           wipers.

           phil

           he slams the phone back into it's cradle, then looks up and
           notices slow traffic up ahead. he honks his horn as the
           traffic comes to a complete stop. he keeps honking but nothing
           moves.
           he rolls down the window and looks up ahead. the highway is a
           parking lot.

           phil
           no. no!
