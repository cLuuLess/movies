ext. hotel pool terrace. afternoon

paul arrives back at the pool, hands bizimungu his briefcase. zozo
gives the beer to the soldiers.

                        paul
            i am worried about thieves and criminals
            coming into the hotel. perhaps you could
            arrange for some police to guard us.

                        general bizimungu
            the police are very busy.

                        paul
            i understand general, but when i last
            talked to the president of sabena he
            promised me that anyone who helped
            protect belgian property would be
            rewarded.

bizimungu understands this is a financial proposition.

                        general bizimungu
            he did.

                        paul
            well rewarded those were his words.

                        general bizimungu
            if i were to spare a few policemen, where
            would i station them?

                        paul
            the front gate would be best, general.

they could check all guests.

                        general bizimungu
            i will see what i can do.

                        paul
            i admire you, general. how do you keep
            command of your men amidst such madness?

                        general bizimungu
            i am strong, paul, like a lion.

                        paul
            i wish i were like you. look at my staff,
            they won't work, they listen to no one.

paul nods over toward gregoire.

                        general bizimungu
            he is staff?

the general gets up.

gregoire, who is lying face down on the deck chair, doesn't see him
approach. the general pulls the deck chair from underneath gregoire and
throws it into the pool. as gregoire tries to scramble to his feet, the
general propels him forward with a massive kick up the ass.

                        general bizimungu (cont'd)
            get to work, you slug.

gregoire races from the pool, followed by his girlfriend.

the general clicks his fingers and his soldiers follow.

                        general bizimungu (cont'd)
            make sure, paul, your guests are
            generous.
