int. hotel lobby. day

paul looks around the lobby. it resembles a refugee center more than a
five star hotel.

he turns to a computer, calls up the register, then hits delete and
erases the register.

he picks up the phone, calls.

                        paul
            send two of the housekeeping carpenters
            to the lobby.

paul strides across the lobby, calls to zozo.

                        paul (cont'd)
            everyone gather together now. zozo get
            them all together.

they herd together quickly.

                        paul (cont'd)
            no one can remain in this lobby any
            longer. i have rooms available. who can
            pay? the rental is six hundred francs per
            day.

about fifty percent of the hands go up.

                        tutsi woman
            i cannot pay?

                        paul
            go with zozo to the ballroom. we will
            find you bedding. this is a hotel. no one
            will be allowed to stay in the lobby.

the carpenters arrive beside paul.

                        paul (cont'd)
            good. i want you to go around and take
            all the numbers off the doors.

                        carpenter
            what shall we put in their place.

                        paul
            nothing. i want no numbers on the doors.
