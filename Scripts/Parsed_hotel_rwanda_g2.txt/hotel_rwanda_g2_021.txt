ext. hotel rear car park. night

paul walks to the employee car park at the rear.

he sees gregoire and another male reception clerk tossing zozo's
pillbox porter's hat between them with zozo trapped in the middle
trying to jump and catch it. gregoire thinks this tease is great fun.

                        gregoire
            come on, zozo, cockroaches can jump, some
            of them can fly.

the clerk sees paul just as he's about to throw, miscalculates, the hat
sails over gregoire's head and lands at paul's feet. zozo scampers to
pick it up.

                        paul
            no.
                 (points to gregoire)
            you pick it up.

gregoire doesn't move.

                        paul (cont'd)
            how are your dish-washing skills,
            gregoire?

gregoire bends, picks up the hat, hands it to zozo, who walks away
quickly. gregoire and his friend turn to head back into the hotel.

                        paul (cont'd)
            gregoire, there are no cockroaches in
            this hotel, do you understand?

                        bik (o.s.)
            cockroaches?

bik has walked out of the rear door and overheard.

                        bik (cont'd)
            don't tell me we have cockroaches, paul?

a sly smile breaks on gregoire's face as he uses bik's arrival to
disappear inside.

                        paul
            no, bik, it's a code word for tutsis.

                        bik
            that's what i came to talk to you about.

                        paul
            excuse me?

                        bik
            the hutu-tutsi thing. the bbc faxed to
            say they would be here on the sixth for
            the peace accords. and the u.n. wants the
            banquet room for that day, a reception to
            broadcast the signing ceremony. can you
            organize monitors and check the satellite
            dish?

                        paul
            leave it to me.

bik leans slightly closer.

                        bik
            also, could you remember to use the
            service entrance at all times?

                        paul
            of course.
