int. van. dawn

the fog has gotten thicker. they can barely see a yard ahead.

                        paul
            are you sure this is the river road?

                        gregoire
            i saw the sign.

the van begins to bump erratically. bump, bump, bump.

                        paul
            stop. you've driven off the road.

you'll put us in the river.

the van jerks to a halt.
