ext. kigali streets. night

paul speeds through the streets of kigali humming along to music on the
radio and eating chocolates from the box. he passes bicycles laden
with produce. the song on the radio ends and local news comes on.

                        radio announcer (v.o.)
            good hutus of rwanda, beware. the
            dictatorship of the tutsi cockroach is
            near. watch your neighbor. identify these
            cockroaches. then rise up and stamp out
            this murderous infestation...

paul turns the station. finds another with music.
