ext. hotel front gate. day

paul jumps from the jeep. waves to tatiana in the van, then gives the
money to the captain.

                        paul
            now let them go.

no response. money in hand, the captain eyes paul with malice.

                        paul (cont'd)
            don't be foolish. there's more money to
            be made here.

                        captain
            you want to buy anymore cockroaches ask
            for captain naramunju.

the captain smiles, then jumps in his jeep and speeds off. paul runs to
the van and jumps in.

inside the van

jubilation, in the rear of the van. odette is in tears.

                        odette
            thank you, thank you, paul.

paul doesn't reply. tatiana hugs him. he gives her a look - a mix of
relief and anger - the crowd in the back almost cost him his family.
