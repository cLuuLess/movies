int. hotel kitchen. day

paul pushes the trolley into the deserted kitchen. at the back door,
several cooks listen to the radio.

                        radio announcer
            'good hutus, we must destroy an
            infestation of cockroaches at the
            technical college.'

                        paul
            turn that off. we have a hotel to run.

the cooks halfheartedly slouch back to the sinks.
