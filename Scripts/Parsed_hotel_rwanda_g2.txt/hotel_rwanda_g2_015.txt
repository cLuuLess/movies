int. hotel bar. day

a luxurious lounge/club called the kigali club - an african
casablanca, complete with animal heads, a statue of a mountain gorilla,
grand piano in the corner. rwandan hutu army officers, (distinguished
by their crisp khaki uniforms, in the style of the french army), arms
dealers, government dignitaries, businessmen and reporters mingle
freely. the few tourists stand out.

paul heads to a table. the center of attention and conversation is
general bizimungu, 40's, dressed in a crisp, heavily decorated
uniform, a strong figure, relaxed, in control.

                        general bizimungu
            paul, this scotch is exceptional.

                        paul
            it's a single malt, glenmorangie. i
            thought you'd like it. anything you need,
            gentlemen, let me know.

                        general bizimungu
            oh, paul, talk to the coat check, please.

paul heads for the lobby. he's intercepted by an zealous young tutsi
reporter benedict who covers the political scene for the local
independent newspaper.

                        benedict
            paul, paul, a moment please.

                        paul
            yes, benedict, what can i do?

                        benedict
            can you get me into the ambassador's
            reception?

                        paul
            i'm sorry, it's a private function.

benedict takes out his reporters notebook.

                        benedict
            at least tell me who is attending. the
            newspaper will be grateful.

paul laughs.

                        paul
            i will be grateful if you keep my name
            out of your newspaper. wait here and you
            will see who has attended as they leave.
