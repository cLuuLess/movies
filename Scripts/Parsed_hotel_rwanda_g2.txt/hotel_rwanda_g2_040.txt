            nonsense. at this moment we are making
            plans to rehabilitate the dissidents into
            our armed forces.

            president as he signs the peace
            agreement.

            of course, the president is a clever man,
            he knows what he is doing. thank you for
            coming to rwanda. (on the move). you will
