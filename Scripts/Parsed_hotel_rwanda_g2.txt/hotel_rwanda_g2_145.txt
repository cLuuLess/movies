paul clambers out, stumbles, falls.

and discovers he's looking at the face of a dead child, a young tutsi
girl, her hands clasped on her ears as though to block the sound of her
own death - an african munz's scream.

paul clambers to his feet, sees that the van is on a road littered with
dead bodies, men, women, children.

the bumps were dead bodies, the van has driven over them.

a breeze from the lake blows the fog clear for thirty feet.

revealing: a carpet of bodies, hundreds of them sprawled all along the
road as far as paul can see. paul wanders stunned among misshapen
corpses, made more ghostly by wisps of fog.

finally, paul clambers shell-shocked back into the van.

                        paul
            go back! go back!

gregoire throws the van into reverse.

they bump back over the carpet of bodies, each shake and crunch another
horror.
