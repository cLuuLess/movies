int. hotel lobby. day

where five minutes before the lobby was a frenzy of wealthy europeans
and aid workers, the groups of clustered black faces are silent except
for the crying of babies and sobbing mothers. paul picks his way among
them. zozo catches up.

                        zozo
            what do we do with all these people?

                        paul
            open up the ballroom, we'll put them
            there. and zozo tell the kitchen to make
            rice and beans - a lot of it.
