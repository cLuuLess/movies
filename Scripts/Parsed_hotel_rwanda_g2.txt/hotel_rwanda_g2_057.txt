ext. undergrowth. night

roger crawls between the shrubs. he hears angry voices.

he peers through the long grass.

sees: hutu soldiers boots, feet in sneakers, bare women's feet. and
among them the glint of machetes, hoes, a club spiked with nails, a
length of chain clanging on the ground.
