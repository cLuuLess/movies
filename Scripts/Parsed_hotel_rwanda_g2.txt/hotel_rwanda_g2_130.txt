int. hotel luxury suite. day

a beautiful two-bedroom suite. xavier lives in comfort compared to the
other refugees.

                        paul
            i'm afraid you will have to move room.

                        xavier
            move? where to?

                        paul
            i'm going to put you on the third floor.

                        xavier
            the third floor are low class rooms.

                        paul
            yes they are. however if the army return
            they will expect important people such as
            yourself to be in these grand rooms.

                        xavier
                 (to his wife)
            pack the bags, we have to move.

                        paul
            also, this is your bill for the last
            week.

paul leaves, xavier looks shocked.

                                                            fade to:

montage
paul and influential refugees, odette, benedict (with a bandage over
his missing ear), xavier and others call, plead, write and send faxes
all around the world. we see this night and day; day and night --

then odette on the phone.

                        odette
            yes, that's right. i helped set up the
            treatment center in nairobi. i'm in the
            mille collines hotel right now with my
            husband, peter, and my two boys. if you
            do not help us we will be murdered.

zozo arrives.

                        zozo
