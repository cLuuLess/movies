int. hotel lobby. day

paul turns, walks past porters ferrying the bbc luggage. he puts his
hand out. gregoire hands him keys.

paul does his rounds. he double checks the banquet room where
technicians install several tv monitors and test the signal.

he looks in the kitchen, frenzied activity.

he wanders behind the bar. everything is 'under control'.

he returns to the lobby, greets connie, her flustered husband and their
friends, followed by a team of porters and luggage.

                        paul
            forgive the hurry but i do not want you
            to miss the lunch buffet on the paddle
            steamer across the lake. it is the most
            spectacular sight in all africa.

                        bob
            lunch? all we do is eat. i thought there
            was famine in africa.

                        paul
            exactly, we can't have our guests
            starving. what would they think of the
            mille collines back in the united states?

gen. bizimungu, takes paul's arm, pulls him aside, hands him his empty
briefcase.

                        general bizimungu
            keep that cockroach benedict away from
            me.

as the general disappears into the bar, paul waves over the coat check,
hands her the briefcase.

                        paul
            same as last time.

she nods, hurries off just as the bbc crew appears. paul hands out
keys, greets each.

                        paul (cont'd)
            the fifth room is your broadcast room.

                        gloria
            good. i'd like to book a massage.

                        paul
            of course.

jock, the scottish cameraman, hangs behind as the others leave, takes
his key.

                        jock
            did you bring any of those wee girls who
            used to sit at the bar in the diplomat
            with you? you know?

                        paul
            i'm sorry, mr. daglish, this is the mille
            collines. no working girls here.

                        jock
            can we phone them in, paul?

                        paul
            i'm afraid i can't do that, mr. daglish.

ah, zozo.

paul calls zozo over.

                        paul (cont'd)
            you remember zozo, from the diplomat?

jock gets the code instantly, as zozo smiles.

                        jock
            zozo! the very man!

the scot and zozo greet, then hurry off.
