int. diplomat hotel office. day

paul enters the manager's office, followed by the general. it has been
stripped clean, except for the safe, which is pock-marked with bullet
strikes.

close on: paul: he sees a big problem. the dial is damaged.

                        general bizimungu
            do your work.

paul goes to the safe and turns the dials, tries the handle - nothing.

it is incredibly hot, and paul is soaked with nervous perspiration, he
takes off his jacket.

                        paul
            it might be damaged, general.

bizimungu's look says: it better not be for your sake.

paul starts again, turns the dials more carefully, tries and opens the
safe door. click.

he pulls it open, sees six bottles of glenfiddich, four bottles of vsop
brandy.

bizimungu is joyous as paul hands him a bottle
bizimungu sits on a window ledge, takes a swig.

                        general bizimungu
            here. (offers) to celebrate.

paul takes a swig.

                        general bizimungu (cont'd)
            you know what the scottish call it?

                        paul
            no.

                        general bizimungu
            ishca baha - the water of life. i went on
            a tour once of the finest single malt
            distillery in the world. have you ever
            been to scotland?

                        paul
            no, sir.

                        general bizimungu
            wonderful country, wonderful golf. i
            wonder - will i ever go back? what do you
            think?

                        paul
            i hope we all get to do many things. can
            we go now?

the soldier arrives with a box. he whispers to bizimungu.

                        general bizimungu
            (to the soldier) pack those carefully,
            put them in my jeep, and guard them.

                        paul
                 (looses his cool)
            please, general, call and put your
            policemen back at the gate.

the soldier packs the bottles. bizimungu pours into paul's cup.

                        general bizimungu
            i am going to do you a great favor.
            (studies glass) i am going to take you
            with us to gitarama.

                        paul
            i do not want to go to gitarama, general.

                        general bizimungu
            you cannot go back to the hotel. the
            crazy men are going there now. better to
            come with me.

paul is now terrified.

                        paul
            the militia are at the hotel?! we must go
            back now, general, please, for my family.

bizimungu, now tipsy, drinks more.

                        general bizimungu
            we are better here.

                        paul
                 (desperate, forceful)
            listen, you need me.

bizimungu laughs.

                        paul (cont'd)
            you are a marked man.

                        general bizimungu
            how so.

                        paul
            the americans, and the un they have you
            as a war criminal. you are on a list.

                        general bizimungu
            i am on a list! what list?

                        paul
            when the europeans left, their soldiers
            gathered lists.

bizimungu grabs paul.

                        general bizimungu
            you lie.

                        paul
            if you do not help me, you will stay on
            that list.

                        general bizimungu
            i committed no war crimes.

                        paul
            who will tell them? you need me to tell
            how you helped the hotel. the others who
            have gone, they blame you for all their
            misfortune. they say you led the
            massacres.

                        general bizimungu
            (nervous now) i led no massacres.

                        paul
            you think they will believe you?

                        general bizimungu
            you will tell them the truth.

                        paul
                 (defiant)
             i will do nothing unless you help me now.

bizimungu reaches for his pistol.

                        paul (cont'd)
            what are you going to do, shoot me? it
            will be a blessing. go ahead shoot. i
            will pay you to shoot my family. you can
            do nothing to me!

bizimungu jumps up, grabs paul, pulls him.

                        general bizimungu
            you will tell them i did nothing.
