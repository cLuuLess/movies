int. hotel kitchen. day

the crate is hefted onto a counter. the top pried off. a crowd of
cooks gathers around paul and zozo as they peer in.

                        zozo
            any of them make it?

                        head chef
            into the sink!
            they hoist up one end of the crate and lobsters spill out. many make
            it into the sink, but some miss and slide across the counter and fall
            onto the floor.

the cooks sort the living from the dead.

                        zozo
            twelve are dead.

                        paul
            how dead?

the cooks smells a dead lobster, shakes his head no.

                        paul (cont'd)
            dump the bad meat, save the shells, fill
            them will ah, a stuffing, something
            local.

                        cook
            cassava, and tipali.

                        paul
            yes. call it 'fresh scottish lobster in a
            cassava and tipali crush'.

paul fixes his tie, very pleased, another crisis solved.
