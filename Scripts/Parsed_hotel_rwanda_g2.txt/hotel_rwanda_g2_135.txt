int. hotel manager's office. day

paul walks in and discovers the office packed with the elite tutsi
refugees including xavier, odette and jean baptiste. paul's puzzled,
there's an air of tension in the room.

                        paul
            yes.

a brief silence, then a tutsi bank manager speaks.

                        banker
            you have no right to charge us rent.

                        paul
            why not?

                        banker
            this is no longer a hotel, it is a prison
            and you are profiteering from our misery.

                        odette
            that is not true.

another accuser speaks up.

                        tutsi accuser
            yes it is. he charges for food, for
            everything. where is all this money
            going? we hear he has a deal with
            bizimungu.

                        tutsi accuser #2
            it is said that you work for the murderer
            george rutagunda.

murmurs of agreement. paul has heard enough.

                        paul
            i confess. ( a beat) it's true i have a
            deal with general bizimungu. he was just
            here. i worked out another money making
            scheme for him. new arrivals will be
            taxed at the gate.

silence.

                        paul (cont'd)
            do you know what my deal is with
            bizimungu. i pay him and he keeps you
            alive. anyone want to take their money
            back?

paul pulls money from his pocket, hands it around, offers it.

                        paul (cont'd)
            here, here take it. and you don't have to
            pay your bill. i will move you into the
            ballroom or out into the gardens.

he walks among them.

                        paul (cont'd)
            and, yes, i work with george rutagunda.
            i buy rice and beans, beer and soap. i
            will have to visit his warehouse soon
            because we are running out of food. who
            wants to come with me?

paul holds the door open.

                        paul (cont'd)
            anyone who wants to come with me stay
            behind. if not, please leave.

they hurry out, duly chastised. but odette and her husband jean
baptiste remain.

                        paul (cont'd)
                 (laughs)
            you are most certainly not coming with
            me. you will get me killed.

                        jean baptiste
            you can't go to that place, they know
            what you are doing here.

                        paul
            george will not hurt me, i am too
            profitable to him.

                        odette
            what if he is not there?

paul hasn't got an answer for that one. he leads them out.
