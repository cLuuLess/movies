int. hotel corridor - day

close on: a door with a placard reading "presidential suite". paul
knocks. the door opens. gregoire answers, half-naked.

                        gregoire
                 (surprised)
            mr. manager.

                        paul
            gregoire, what are you doing here?

                        a woman's voice inside (o.s.)
            who is it?

                        gregoire
            what do you want?

                        paul
            get out of this room and get back to
            work.

                        gregoire
            i don't have to listen to you anymore.

                        paul
            i am in charge now. get back to work or
            i'll fire you.

                        gregoire
            let me ask you mr. manager, do you notice
            a smell of cockroaches? if i were to
            leave this room, i'm sure i could find
            this smell. i know people who could
            cleanse it.(stares) but maybe it doesn't
            bother you? why is that? are used to this
            smell? not me, i need a clean room to
            escape it.

gregoire closes the door. paul's eyes burn with anger, but this battle
will have to wait.
