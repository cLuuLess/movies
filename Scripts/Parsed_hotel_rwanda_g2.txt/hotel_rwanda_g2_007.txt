ext. kigali streets. day

the van speeds through traffic. more traffic jams, zozo edges up on the
sidewalk. then at an intersection they see.

the interahamwe parade - a mass of young men and women, most in the
same colorful uniform. line after line, waves all performing the
interahamwe war dance, in wild hypnotic sync, many wave sticks, spears,
wooden imitation guns. a large banner reads, "hutu power."

a flatbed truck, speakers blare drumbeat music. on it george rutagunda
dances the dance and waves a machete to the crowd.

zozo sinks down behind the wheel.

                        paul
            sit up, smile, zozo, don't attract
            attention to yourself.

                        zozo
            boss, some of those men are my neighbors,
            they know i'm tutsi.

the parade passes. as they wait paul takes out the wad of notes george
gave him, peels off a few dollars.

                        paul
            here, zozo, for your trouble.

zozo takes it.
