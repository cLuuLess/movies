ext. kigali airport. day

a burning white sun high in a clear blue sky,

                                                           pan down to:

a rundown (sixties) airport, peeling in the heat.

a mad traffic jam of cars, vans, motorbikes all stopped at a checkpoint
where a rwandan policeman blows his whistle, waves some and stops
others as bored rwandan soldiers look on.

close on: a white van pulls out of traffic, a balls-out case of line
jumping. horns, obscenities.

a hand: extends from the passenger side of the van, rwandan francs
pressed neatly between thumb and palm.

the van stops next to the policeman.

                        policeman
            mr. rusesabagina, good morning.

in the passenger seat paul rusesabagina, late 30's, flashes a smile. he
is dressed in a sharp blue suit (always dressed in a neat suit and tie,
it is a matter of pride).

a quick shake of hands. money passes from one to the other.
