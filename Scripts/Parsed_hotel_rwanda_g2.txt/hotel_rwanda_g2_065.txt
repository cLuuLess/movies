ext. paul's house. dawn

the captain stops by his jeep, studies his clipboard.

tatiana with roger in her arms, her kids and all the neighbors herded
together.

                        paul
            what is this about?

                        captain
            let me see your identity card.

paul pulls it from his pocket, hands it to the captain.

close on: paul's id - it reads ethnicity: hutu.

the captain studies him, waves for the soldiers to back off.

                        captain (cont'd)
            you heard the tutsi cockroaches murdered
            our president.

                        paul
            yes, it is a calamity for us all.

                        captain
            you work at the hotel diplomat?

                        paul
            no. i work at the mille collines.

the captain looks confused. paul quickly:

                        paul (cont'd)
            i used to work at the diplomat.

                        captain
            do you know how to open the safe there?
                 (paul nods)
            our government needs to use the hotel and
            the room keys are in the safe. you must
            open it.

                        paul
            of course.

paul sees out into the street behind the jeeps: a group of militia in
their colored shirts armed with machetes, have gathered, trying to see
what is going on.

                        paul (cont'd)
            captain, i must take my family.
it is not safe here.

                        captain
            where is your family?

tatiana is beside him now.

                        tatiana
                 (interrupts)
            this is them.

tatiana points to the huddled neighbors. paul is stunned.

                        captain
            all of them! i cannot take them.

                        tatiana
            no, no, good captain, you do not have to.
            we have the car and our van.

she points to the mille collines van.

the captain looks doubtful, then his two-way radio barks - an urgent
message. he listens.

tatiana drags the kids and ushers everyone toward the van. in a second,
they are all clambering in.

                        captain
            let's go.

paul jumps behind the wheel of the van. neighbors are jammed in like
sardines, 15, more, inside. tatiana and their kids are squashed
together on the front bench.

the convoy (jeep - van, car - jeep) starts up and turns out into the
street.

the militia men wave sticks, machetes.
