ext. neighbor's (simon's) yard. night

roger crawls along his grass tunnel. then he hears something. he looks
through the reeds toward the street.

he sees: military boots, a cluster of hutu soldiers in their crisp
khaki uniforms.

he hears whispering.

                        soldier's voice (o.s.)
            that house.
