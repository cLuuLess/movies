ext. kigali soccer stadium. day

the trucks crawl into the chaos of the stadium, a mass of refugees, the
wounded, lost children, abandoned old people, hundreds crammed
together.

paul, tatiana, and the others clamber off the trucks. they hug, cry, an
outpouring of relief. then tatiana spots someone among the crowds.

she rushes over.

                        tatiana
            have you seen my sister fedens?

heads shak no. tatiana moves on, more frantic, pushing through the
crowds.

                        tatiana
            two little girls, twins, an old woman had
            them.

more nos

now shes desperate, pushing, tripping through the crowds, and around
her we see others doing the same, then

                        roger (o.c.)
            mama, mama.

he reaches her, pulls at her dress.

                        roger
            mama, wait.

she takes his hand.

                        roger
            no, mama, look.

tatiana turns .... and sees paul carrying the twins in his arms.

she squeals with joy, runs to him, snatches one from his arms.

                        tatiana
            oh, my babies.

                        paul (cont'd)
            anais, it is so good to see you.

                        carine
            i'm carine!

                        anais
                 (in tatsi's arms)
            and i'm anais!

their laughter mix with tears of joy among the crushing mass of
survivors.

freeze
