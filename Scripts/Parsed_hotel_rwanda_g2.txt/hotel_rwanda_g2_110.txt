paul watches in the rain as the final agency people are being loaded
onto buses.

several white aid workers weep uncontrollably as they are dragged away
from frightened rwandan coworkers.

paul in the rain.

across the parking lot colonel oliver watches from his jeep.

jock and his sound man embrace two beautiful young hookers.

one girl begs jock to take her with him.

                        hooker
            please, please, they will put me on the
            street. they will chop me.

                        jock
            darlin', believe me, if i could...

he digs in his pockets, pulls out money, cigarettes. everything he has
he gives to her.

then he pulls her toward paul, digs out his wallet.

                        jock (cont'd)
            here. here.

he pushes two visa cards into paul's hands.

                        jock (cont'd)
            give her what she wants, room, food,
            anything. charge it all. don't you put
            her out, paul.

                        paul
            i would never do that.

                        jock
            i know that, paul. i'm sorry.

here take this.

jock pulls a rolex off his wrist.

                        paul
            this is a rolex, i can't take it.

                        jock
            take it for christ sake. i wish it was a
            fucking aeroplane.

jock embraces paul, tears in his eyes.

gloria watches from the doorway. embarrassed by jock, she becomes
officious.

                        gloria
            lets go, jock.

                        jock
                 (turns on her)
            go! what the fuck sort of journalists are
            we, running from a war? i'm ashamed. are
            you? well, are ya'?

                        gloria
            youre drunk.

gloria marches onto the bus.

                        gloria
                 (to a french soldier)
            what are we waiting for?

                        french soldier
            we have to evacuate some nuns from a
            convent. they are on their way.

jock kisses the hooker, heaves his camera onto the bus.

then there is a disturbance on the driveway.

a group of french nuns, along with maybe a hundred tutsi women and
children come running up the driveway. they are all terrified. one nun
leads them with a french flag.

french soldiers run forward. a commander orders them to form a line,
blocking the refugees.

french soldiers begin pulling nuns from the terrified crowd.

several nuns begin hysterically weeping, pulling rwandan children with
them. panic breaks out among the crowd.

int/ext. bus. day

jock grabs his camera, pushes off the bus.
