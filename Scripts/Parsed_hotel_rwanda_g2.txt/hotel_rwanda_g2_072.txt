ext. hotel diplomat entrance. day

paul emerges to see:

all of the occupants of the van, tatiana, his kids, odette on their
knees, with their hands on their heads.

the captain hovers over them, pistol in hand, turns, sees paul. he
marches toward him and slaps him hard on the face.

                        captain
            traitor!

paul reels from the blow, but manages to stay on his feet.

the captain snatches a bunch of id cards from a soldier, hurls the
cards in paul's face.

                        captain (cont'd)
            they are all tutsi cockroaches.

                        paul
            let me explain.

he grabs paul by the scruff of the neck, pushes him toward the kneeling
captives. the captain snatches a pistol from one of his soldiers,
shoves it into paul's hand.

                        captain
            shoot them!

paul looks at him.

                        paul
            please, i don't use guns.

                        captain
            there is nothing to it.

the captain raises his own pistol and fires it. everyone jumps with
fright.

                        captain (cont'd)
            shoot them now or you die first.

the captain aims his pistol at paul's head. cocks the hammer.

                        paul
            captain, what could i pay you not to do
            this?

the captain laughs.

                        captain
            you want to pay me?

                        paul
            why not? these are not rebels, look at
            them. soon they will be worthless to you.
            why not take some money, for your work?

                        captain
            how much?

                        paul
            name a price.

                        captain
            ten thousand francs for each one.

                        paul
            i don't have that much.

the captain laughs, snatches the gun from paul, marches toward them.

                        paul (cont'd)
            wait! wait!

paul reaches into his pocket, pulls out the bunch of dollars.

                        paul (cont'd)
            here, here, a thousand us dollars - fifty
            thousand francs for my family. to let us
            drive off to the mille collines.

                        captain
            how many in your family?

                        paul
            six.

the captain looks at his soldiers, at the wad of notes.

                        captain
            pull your family out.

paul runs over, grabs tatiana, roger, the three girls. odette kneels
beside tatiana. paul whispers.

                        paul
            have you any money?

                        odette
            nothing.

paul pushes his family toward the van, looks back, sees the captain
pocket the dollars, move toward the line.

                        tatiana
            paul, don't let them die.

                        paul
                 (urgent)
            get in.

paul pushes them into the van, shuts the door, digs into his soul for
all the courage he can muster, then turns back.

                        paul (cont'd)
            captain, let these people give you some
            money, whatever they have.

the captain hesitates. paul sees this, runs over to the line of
neighbors.

                        paul (cont'd)
            give me everything, everything you have.

a pathetic rain of rwandan francs, useless coins, watches, jewelry
falls onto the ground. paul scoops it all up.

the captain looks at it, takes it, then:

                        captain
            there is only enough for one cockroach.

the captain raises his pistol.

                        captain (cont'd)
            pick one to take with you.

now each terrified neighbor looks to paul, begging.

                        paul
            wait, wait.

paul counts the kneeling figures: ten adults, four kids.

                        paul (cont'd)
            ten.

                        captain
            and four children?

                        paul
            i'll give you a hundred thousand francs
            for all of them.

the captain points the gun.

                        captain
            give me it.

                        paul
            i don't have it here. at the mille
            collines. i can get it for you.

                        captain
            you will run into the hotel and hide
            behind the u.n.

                        paul
            i swear, captain, one hundred thousand
            francs, enough for a house. i will get
            the money, you keep them outside.

the captain smiles.

                        captain
            i will keep your family outside. let's
            go.
