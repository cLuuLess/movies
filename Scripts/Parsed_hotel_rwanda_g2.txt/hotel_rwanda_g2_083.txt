ext. hotel forecourt. day

paul waits, then a car pulls up, an indian businessman, mr. garindi,
gets out, shakes hands, he's shaken.

                        mr. garindi
            terrible times, paul. there are bodies
            everywhere. i cannot stay here.

                        paul
            i need a great favor.

he hands mr. garindi an address.

                        paul (cont'd)
            i need you to go to this address and
            bring my brother-in-law and his family.

                        mr. garindi
            no, no. this is a very dangerous part of
            town. i cannot do this.

                        paul
            this would be an enormous favor to me. i
            am a man of means, mr. garandi. when this
            nonsense is over i will be most grateful.

                        mr. garindi
            i will see what i can do.

mr. garindi climbs back into his car.
