a neat bungalow and gardens behind the high wall. paul parks and gets
out. a dog runs and greets him, barking.

            down, pealiss.

his wife, tatiana, a woman of great natural beauty, emerges from the
house, beside her an even taller, very elegant woman, she has a
doctor's bag and a stethoscope in her hand. this is odette, their
family doctor and close friend.

                        paul (cont'd)
            good evening, odette, who is sick this
            time?

                        tatiana
            i asked odette to take a look at little
            anais. she has a rash.

                        paul
            your brother's here?

                        tatiana
            yes, with fedens and the children.

he wants some advice.

                        odette
            good to see you, paul.

paul embraces odette warmly, kisses tatiana.

                        odette (cont'd)
            i must go, paul.

                        tatiana
            you will not stay for dinner.

                        odette
