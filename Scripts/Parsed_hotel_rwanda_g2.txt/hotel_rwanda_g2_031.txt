int. paulÂ’s kitchen. night

after dinner coffee for the adults. tatiana, thomas and fedens at the
table. paul, in his usual position, at the head, listening, like
solomon.

                        thomas
            i've heard bad things, paul. my assistant
            says we should get out of rwanda.

                        fedens
            why should we leave? i have a new job,
            things have never been better for us.

                        thomas
            what good is it if we are murdered in our
            bed?

                        tatiana
            your assistant, he is hutu?

                        thomas
            yes, and he is in the hutu power militia.

                        carine
            he wants your job.

                        thomas
            no, he is a friend, but he tells me to
            listen to the radio. all day they talk
            about the great slaughter.

                        tatiana
            that station is filth.

paul has listened, now he decides to speak.

                        paul
            today i talked to my friend the american
            ambassador and colonel oliver of the
            united nations. they are preparing a
            banquet for the peace signing. the bbc
            are flying in their best reporters. the
            world is watching. there will be peace.

don't listen to this man.

solomon has spoken. fedens smiles, tatiana rubs paul's arm.
