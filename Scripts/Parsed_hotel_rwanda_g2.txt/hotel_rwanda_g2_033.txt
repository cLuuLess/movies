ext. paul's house. night

paul, tatiana, are by thomas's car. they say good night to their
guests. anais and carine sleep in the car.

paul nods to the old guard to go open the gate. just then roger emerges
from the thicket, wide-eyed, afraid.

                        roger
            there are soldiers.

                        paul
            where?

                        roger
            on the street.

paul nods to tatiana to take roger inside. thomas and fedens grab the
sleeping twins from their car.

paul goes to his big metal gates and peers through the two inch gap
between the gate hinge and the gate post.
