ext. hotel forecourt. day

paul meets the un soldiers, (they are the four ghanians who guard the
gate). they look frightened.

                        un observer
            the policemen have gone. what happened?

                        paul
            i ran out of whiskey. please go down and
            guard us.

then roar of an engine and the crash of splintering wood.

as a battered toyota pickup appears, it races up the driveway. the
truck drags the wooden gatehouse on a rope behind.

crazed militia pack the bed of the pickup.

bang, bang, bang. a militia man fires a pistol into the air.

the tutsi refugees camped on the lawn flee in panic as the militia
truck speeds around the driveway.

the militia taunt and yell at the tutsi refugees.

the truck does a screeching turn and heads back down the driveway,
leaving a trail of splintered wood.

                        paul (cont'd)
            get down there and stop them, please.

now the ghanians are really frightened.

                        paul (cont'd)
            get down and stop them.

                        un soldier
            you know we cannot shoot.

                        paul
            what do you mean you cannot shoot?

                        un soldier
            we are peacekeepers, it is not in our
            mandate to shoot.

                        paul
            then go and pretend you are soldiers.
