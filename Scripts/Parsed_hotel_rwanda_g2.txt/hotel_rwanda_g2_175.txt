paul enters. odette, benedict watch cnn on the tv.

paul shakes his head in disbelief.

                        paul
            we can still get cnn here in hell.

a state department woman gives a press conference.

                        odette
            the americans are talking about us.

on tv:

                        state dept. officer
            from the reports we have received from
            rwanda it appears that acts of genocide
            have been committed.

                        reporter
            excuse me, how many acts of genocide does
            it take to declare this a genocide?

                        state dept. officer
            i, ahh, there is, ahh we have
            terminology, that has been.

                        brit reporter
            you haven't answered the question. how
            many acts of genocide before your
            government will declare this a genocide?

                        state dept. officer
            i'm not prepared to, nor am i able.

everyone in the room is dumbfounded.

then benedict begins laughing, a maniacal laugh, then he bangs on his
chest, and hoots like a chimpanzee.

                        benedict
            i've got it. i have the answer. watch.

they all stare as he begins beating his chest, and hopping about like
an ape.

                        benedict (cont'd)
            we must become mountain gorillas. then
            they can put us on the endangered species
            list. come on, try it. they think we're
            halfway there already.

benedict hops up onto a desk.

the door flies open. it's general bizimungu.

he surveys the room, then points at paul.

                        general bizimungu
            come here.
