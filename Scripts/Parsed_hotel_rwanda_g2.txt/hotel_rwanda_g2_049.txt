int. paulÂ’s car. night

paul's at the wheel, driving. a thick mist. barely a car on the road.

shadows dart past faint house lights. the windscreen clouds. paul
switches on his wipers. a toyota truck, loaded with militia, appears
from the mist, speeds past. paul switches the preset buttons on the
radio as he drives. he can only find fevered drum-based music.
