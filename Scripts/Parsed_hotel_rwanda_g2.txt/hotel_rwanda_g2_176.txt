int. hotel corridor. day.

bizimungu looks terrible, an alcoholic suffering d.t.s.

                        general bizimungu
            where are my supplies?

                        paul
            i'm sorry, general. the cellar is empty.

                        general bizimungu
            you have cockroaches dancing on tables
            and you tell me the cellar is empty? did
            they drink my whiskey?

                        paul
            no. we have no way of finding other stock
            but i have money for you from the guests.

paul pulls a bundle of notes, hands them to the general.

                        general bizimungu
            rwandan francs! they are only good now
            for wiping your ass. there is nothing
            more i can do for you people. no police.
            no protection. you're on your own.

the general storms off.
