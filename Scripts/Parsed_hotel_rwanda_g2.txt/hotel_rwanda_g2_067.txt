the convoy speeds through the deserted streets. slowing only to
maneuver through makeshift roadblocks where militia wave machetes,
nailed clubs and spears as they dance.

further along the road: a group of militia swarm over a car, smashing
the windshield, the windows. inside a family huddles together in
terror, waiting for the windows to give way.

in the gutter by the side of the road, three dead bodies.
