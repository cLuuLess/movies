paul wanders to a bench set back in a manicured grove of bushes. beyond
him a crowd of rwandan refugee children play in the swimming pool,
laughing, jumping, splashing like they were at a municipal pool in
central park.

paul watches. tears stream from his eyes, the stream grows into a
flood, he buries his face in his hands.

then a voice.

                        little boy (o.s.)
            mr. manager.

paul wipes his eyes, turns.

a little boy stands behind him, holding out his arm.

                        little boy (cont'd)
            mr. manager, sir.

then paul sees what is wrong. the boy has a big thorn imbedded in the
muscle of his arm. paul studies it.

                        paul
            that's a big one. (pinches the thorn)
            here we go.

paul pulls on the thorn, the kid doesn't flinch.

paul picks him up, carries him to the pool, throws him in.
