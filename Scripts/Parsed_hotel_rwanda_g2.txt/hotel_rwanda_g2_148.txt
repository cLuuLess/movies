int. hotel paul's room. night

tatiana feeds the children - rice and beans. paul arrives.

                        children
            good evening, papa.

                        paul
            roger, you have no greeting for me.

roger tries to speak, struggles to mouth the words but nothing comes
out, as though he has forgotten. tears form in his eyes.

                        paul (cont'd)
            there, do not worry, no tears.

he hugs him, puts him back at his food, then takes tatiana's hand,
leads her to the door.

                        tatiana
            (whispers) where are we going?

they slip out.
