int. hotel manager's office. day

paul bursts in, sits by the phone and dials.

                        paul (on phone)
            good day, general bizimungu please. do
            you know where he is? please ask him to
            call paul rusesabagina. it is urgent.

phone again.

a series of flash cuts: increasingly frantic calls.

                        paul (cont'd)
            colonel bagsora. where? can you find him?

another call:

                        paul (cont'd)
            who would order such a thing?

another call:

                        paul (cont'd)
            did you find the general?

paul hangs up the phone defeated. he looks at his watch. his head flops
onto the desk, onto the sabena logo. he sees it.
