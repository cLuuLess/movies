int. sabena president's office. day

the sabena president and two vps sit on couches.

                        president
            if british airways abandons the route we
            should bid for it.

his intercom buzzes, he's annoyed then.

                        secretary (on phone)
            i'm sorry, sir. i have a call from paul
            in kigali. he says it's urgent.

the president goes to the phone, hits the speaker button.

                        president
            paul. are you alright?

                        paul (o.s.)
            we have a big problem. the hutu army have
            come and ordered us all of us out of the
            hotel.

the president is baffled.

                        president
            out? where are you going?

                        paul
            i do not know, sir. i think they will
            kill us all.

the president can barely form words to reply.

                        president
            all. what do you mean all?

                        paul
            the staff, the guests.

                        president
            the staff and guests! how many?

                        paul
            now we have eight hundred guests and one
            hundred staff. i have ten minutes left.

i wish i could have done more, sir.

please, thank all my friends at sabena.

you have been good to me and my family.

                        president
            (panicked) paul, wait, wait, i'm going to
            put you on hold for one minute, stay on
            the phone.

he hits the hold button. looks to the other executives. they are
stunned to silence by paul's profound farewell.
