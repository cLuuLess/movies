tatiana protects her kids in a corner, kicking at the hands that grab
for her.

oliver points his pistol.

the crowd backs off slightly.

more are dragged from the trucks. machetes flash in the sun.

then horns, gunfire - rwandan soldiers drive through the crowd in two
jeeps. the crowd scatters, then re-forms as rwandan soldiers push
between the militia and the refugees.

as they do, another militia gunman steps out, fires wildly at the
refugees, but wounds a rwandan soldier in the stomach.

suddenly fights erupt between the militia and the soldiers.
