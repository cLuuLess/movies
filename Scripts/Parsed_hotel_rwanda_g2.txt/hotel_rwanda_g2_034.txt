ext. victor's house. night.

he sees: (two houses down) the group of hutu soldiers, clustered around
jeeps, they whisper and point. it's a raid.

now they move rushing out of view.

the sounds of splintering wood, glass breaking, children's cries, women
screaming.

suddenly there's a face, beside paul's. it's tatiana.

                        tatiana
            what is it?

she looks, sees the soldiers, as they drag a middle-aged man onto the
street.

he is crying, pleading, like a whipped dog.

                        tatiana (cont'd)
            oh, my god, it's victor. why do they want
            victor?

they watch as victor is beaten to the jeep. at this point victor looses
it completely, stops pleading, grabs on to a soldier, clinging,
screaming like a terrified child - like a man who knows he is going to
die. it's a horror.

                        tatiana (cont'd)
            do something.

                        paul
            what?

                        tatiana
            call your friends in the army. call
            someone. victor is harmless. this is a
            mistake.

                        paul
            please, be quiet.

tatiana, moves toward the gate handle.

                        tatiana
            i'm going to talk to them.

paul grabs her.

                        paul
            no.

                        tatiana
            we must do something.

paul takes her by the arm, leads her to the house.

                        paul
            what would you have us do? argue with
            these madmen? we cannot interfere.
