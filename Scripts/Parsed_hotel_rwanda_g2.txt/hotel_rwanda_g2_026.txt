                        paul
                 (a sigh)
            thomas wants advice?

                        tatiana
            he wants your wisdom.

                        paul
            let's have dinner first.

                        tatiana
            of course.

his brother-in-law thomas and sister-in-law fedens come out to greet
paul the patriarch. they hug. kids run everywhere. paul spots his twin
nieces anais (in blue) and carine (in yellow), four years old. he
scoops them up, one in each arm.

                        paul
            hello, anais.

she laughs.

                        carine
            i am carine.

                        paul
            you are not anais?

                        anais
            i am anais.

                        paul
            oh, carine, that is a shame. i have a
            present for anais.

anais reaches out her hand. paul sets them on the ground, takes a
chocolate from his chocolate box, deliberately hands it to carine.

anais jumps up and down.

                        anais
            it is for me.

                        paul
            goodness, i cannot tell. i guess i must
            find another present.

he takes a chocolate gives it to carine, then hands out the chocolates
to his children who are gathered around.
