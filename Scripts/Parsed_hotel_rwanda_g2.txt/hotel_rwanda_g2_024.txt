ext. kigali neighborhood. night

lights burn in windows. kids play soccer in dusty lots. paul's van
turns onto a residential street and slows. he honks twice. the metal
gate to a walled compound swings open. a guard(old, peaked hat, bare
feet, pathetic) stands just inside. paul waves to him and pulls into
the courtyard, two cars are already parked there.
