paul walks into the tourism office. it is decorated with posters and
photos of rwanda's single most important economic asset - the rare
silver back mountain gorillas. there's a picture of the real-life diane
fossey next to the movie poster for "gorillas in the mist". numerous
books and video cassettes. connie denver's older husband, bob, and four
american friends wait.

                        connie denver
            paul, paul. our trip has been cancelled.

                        paul
            yes, i'm sorry madame denver, it is
            because of the rebels.

                        connie denver
            rebels? what rebels?

                        bob
            don't be stupid for christ sake. the
            watusis are invading the country. i told
            you not to come here.

                        paul
            the tutsi rebels are far away on the
            border. and soon there will be peace.

                        bob
            tutsis, watutsis they'll still shoot you.

                        connie denver
            but i came here to see the gorillas?

                        paul
            i will try to arrange something.
