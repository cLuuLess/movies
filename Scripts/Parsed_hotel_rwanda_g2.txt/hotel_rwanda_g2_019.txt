int. hotel banquet room. day

the luncheon is in full swing. paul glides in the background.

close on: the ambassador in deep conversation with oliver.

                        us ambassador
            things will calm down when the president
            signs the peace agreement with the
            rebels.

                        colonel oliver
            our intelligence, mr. ambassador, is that
            the hutu government has been stockpiling
            weapons and are preparing a massacre.

                        us ambassador
            that's not what i hear. excuse me. paul.
                 (paul comes over)
            colonel, you know the house manager, paul
            rusesabagina.

                        paul
            how was your meal, sir?

                        us ambassador
            magnificent.
                 (reads)
            scottish lobster, in rwanda. you see
            general what a genius this man is. you
            want anything, this man can get it?

                        colonel oliver
            how about a battalion of u.s. marines.

                        us ambassador
            now, general, don't ask for the
            impossible.

paul smiles.

                        paul
            i have heard, mr. ambassador, that they
            have discovered oil here, under lake
            kivu.

oliver bursts out laughing.

                        colonel oliver
            you're right, mr. ambassador, paul knows
            how to get anything, even u.s. troops.

the ambassador takes paul's hand, shakes it warmly.

                        us ambassador
            thank you for a wonderful meal, paul.

paul moves away graciously, and in one smooth move checks out, then
pockets, the hundred dollar bill the ambassador palmed him.
