zozo works the horn, weaves in and out of traffic.

                        zozo
            what is it like to fly on a plane, sir?

                        paul
            it depends where you sit zozo. in coach
            it is like the bus to giterama.

                        zozo
            that is why they call it coach?

                        paul
            maybe. but in business class there are
            fine wines, linens, belgian chocolates.

                        zozo
                 (impressed)
            you have taken business class?

                        paul
            many times.

suddenly, zozo slows.

paul looks up, sees: a gathering on the side of the road -- a large
crowd of men dressed in exotically, yet identically colored shirts.

they're members of the interahamwe - the hutu militia.

(interahamwe - the hutu militia will de distinguished by these wildly
colored shirts) they chant, drink beer, dance onto the road,
obstructing cars, threatening the occupants. several of them perform a
rhythmic dance - the interahamwe war dance to thumping drumbeat music
from a boombox.

                        paul (cont'd)
            turn off.

zozo, scared, looks for a side road, studies the traffic behind.

                        zozo
            there is nowhere to turn, sir.

as the van approaches,

                        paul
            slow down.

the van pulls up beside the militia.

                        paul (cont'd)
            boys, do you know the way to mr.

rutagunda's warehouse?

some militia approach. they are suddenly friendly, helpful.

                        militia man #1
            it is one more mile on this road.

paul reaches into his pocket, takes out some rwandan dollars.

                        paul
            this is thirsty work, let me treat you to
            some beers.

as the van pulls away zozo looks to paul, relieved.
