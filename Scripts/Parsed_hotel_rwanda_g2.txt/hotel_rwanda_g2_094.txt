int. hotel banquet room. night

every member of the hotel staff is gathered together. paul addresses
them as zozo hands out copies of a fax.

                        paul
            this is my letter of appointment, signed
            by mr. godefroid, the president of
            sabena. the mille collines is a five star
            establishment, we will run it that way.
            if you don't want to work for me, then
            leave now.

no one moves.

                        paul (cont'd)
            i want the hallways cleaned now, a menu
            prepared for the dining room. where's the
            pianist?

a hand goes up.

                        paul (cont'd)
            i want you on the piano in the kigali
            room tonight. back to work.
