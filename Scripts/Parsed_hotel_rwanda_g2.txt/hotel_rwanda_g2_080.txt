int. hotel lobby. day

at the desk, the same receptionist is overwhelmed.

                        tourist (o.c.)
            he's in charge, that's him.

paul goes behind the desk. rumors fly among the crowd of tourists.

                        tourists
            (staccato) to the airport...my embassy
            ...tried to call... the airport is closed
            ... refund... this is outrageous ...

behind the tourists, tatiana and the neighbors look lost.

paul addresses the frightened western tourists.

                        paul
            please, i am the house manager. return in
            thirty minutes and we will deal with all
            your requests, thank you.

paul turns to the room key boxes, nearly all are empty.

                        paul (cont'd)
            what happened to all the rooms?

finally he finds a key, pushes through to tatiana, hands a key to
odette and jean baptiste.

                        paul (cont'd)
            take this room. tatiana, bring the
            children.

paul starts to lead his family away.

                        tatiana
            (re: neighbors) what about them?

paul looses it.

                        paul
            them. they almost got us all killed. i
            have done enough for them! we cannot look
            after them anymore.

                        tatiana
            what are you going to do? you cannot
            drive them out onto the road. they can
            stay with me.

                        paul
            what!

                        tatiana
            i will not have them on my conscience.
            they will stay in my room.

                        paul
                 (to zozo)
            zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms.
            put these people in them.

                        zozo
            yes, sir.
