ext. hotel corridor. day

paul is in the corridor, talking to tatiana.

                        paul
            has roger spoken yet?

                        tatiana
            no, odette says he's in shock.

                        paul
            how can we help him.

                        tatiana
            he needs to be in a safe place.
                 (a beat)
            have you heard from mr. garindi?

                        paul
            give him time.

there's a clank of metal. paul looks and sees:

a waiter struggling with a trolley of food by a door.

he hurries to help the waiter as jock opens, indicates quiet, waves
paul and the waiter in.
