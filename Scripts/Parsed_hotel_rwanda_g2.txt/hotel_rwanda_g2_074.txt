chaos - un jeeps, hotel vans, dismayed tourists, frightened tutsi
refugees.

close on: bik, the dutch manager, bag packed, anxious, sees paul.

yells.

                        bik
            paul, i have to talk to you ...

but paul ignores bik, barrels his way through the din and crush of the
parking lot.
