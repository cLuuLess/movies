ext. paul's house. night

paul drives in. his compound is curiously dark. his headlights sweep
across his pitch-black house.

                                                              cut to:

the gates swing shut. we pull back as paul turns and faces his house.

paul whistles for the dog, nothing. he goes back to the car, gets a
flashlight, heads for the front door.
