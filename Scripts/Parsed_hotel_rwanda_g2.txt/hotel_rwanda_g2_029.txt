ext. neighbor's (simon's) yard. night

roger crawls along his path. there's a gap a little way down, and roger
shoots through it into the wide open of the neighbors yard. he runs to
a back window of the house and taps on it. soon simon, 12, appears. he
slides it open.

                        roger
            let's feed it.

simon lets roger in.
