paul skirts the little groups of poor families bivouacked on the lawn.

the smoke of cooking fires has replaced the tiki lanterns. the grounds
are a mini refugee camp.

paul joins tatiana, odette and jean baptiste who sit at a table by the
pool.

                        odette
            don't worry, paul, we will make the next
            list.

zozo arrives, with beers, serves them, is about to leave. tatiana grabs
him by the arm.

                        tatiana
            sit with us zozo.

                        zozo
            no ma,am, i am too busy.

                        paul
            zozo you are family, join us.

zozo is shocked by this breach of protocol but sits.

                        paul (cont'd)
            you are my dearest friends. i promise you
            before god that i will not sleep until i
            have you out of here. all of you.

he embraces jean baptiste

                        jean baptiste
            it is good that you are going, paul,
            because now we know we have one person
            who will save us.

odette hugs and kisses him.

                        odette
            we owe you our lives.

paul takes zozo in his arms.

                        paul
            you are my family now, zozo, my brother.
            i will get you out of here.

                        zozo
            thank you, sir.

                        paul
            let us remember this night and tell the
            world that even in hell there are good
            people.

a unbreakable bond of faith with each other.
