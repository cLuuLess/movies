int. hotel bar. day

paul checks out the banques. they appear empty, then a voice.

                        general bizimungu
            paul, join us.

it's general bizimungu, he is sitting with george rutagunda now in a
shiny blue suit. a bottle of whiskey on the table is almost gone.

bizimungu and rutagunda watch the peace celebration across the lobby.

                        general bizimungu
            have a drink.

he pours. george points his glass toward the europeans.

                        george
            look at them, they want to see the tribes
            dance to their tune. here is our dance.

rutagunda staggers to his feet, launches into a drunken version of the
hutu militia war dance.

                        george (cont'd)
            come on, paul. show them our dance.

paul takes george's arm, does two steps of the dance, then appears to
stumble and shoulder bumps the big man.

george falls into his chair.

                        paul
            forgive me, george, my step was off.

rutagunda bursts out laughing, toasts:

                        george
            to our president. may he find peace.

as paul is forced to join in the toast, rutagunda laughs, bizimungu
smiles at some insider joke.
