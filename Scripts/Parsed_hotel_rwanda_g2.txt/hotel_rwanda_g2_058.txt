ext. paul's garden. night

tatiana rushes out the front door, paul after her.

paul catches her and puts his hand over her mouth.

                        paul
            shhhhh.

shouts next door. paul pulls tatiana behind the car. a beat. more
shouts. paul takes his hand from her mouth. she's sobbing.
