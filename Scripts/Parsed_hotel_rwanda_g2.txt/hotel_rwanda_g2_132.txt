paul fills bizimungu's briefcase with scotch, hands two six-packs of
beer to zozo. paul notes his once packed storeroom, now considerably
dwindled in stock.

                        paul
            where has all our beer gone?

                        zozo
            sir, gregoire has been taking beers.

                        paul
            how much beer?

                        zozo
