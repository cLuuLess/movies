ext. rutaganda's warehouse. dawn

the fog still hangs like a cloud. as they pull up, a group of young
militia emerge from toyota trucks.

                        militiaman #1
            what do you want?

                        paul
            we are to meet mr. rutagunda.

                        militiaman #1
            the commander is not here.

                        paul
            he will be here.

                        militiaman #1
            show me your id

paul and gregoire hand over their id cards. the militia man studies
them, then pockets the cards.

                        paul
            excuse me.

                        militiaman #1
            what?

                        paul
            our cards, please.

                        militiaman #1
            what cards?

                        paul
            you have our cards.

                        militiaman #1
            no. but i make cards. would you like me
            to make you two cards?

                        paul
            how much?

                        militiaman #1
            one thousand francs.

then from out of the fog, three toyota trucks roar up. george
rutagunda, heavily armed, in cut-off shorts and an open shirt, his
barrel chest laden with bandoliers, jumps out.

the militia man pulls out the id cards, hands them back.

                        militiaman #1 (cont'd)
                 (apologetic)
            a joke.

rutagunda strides over.

                        george
            paul. my old friend.

paul climbs out, greets george, as a militia man swings open the doors
of the warehouse. they walk in.
