int. rutaganda's warehouse. day

the warehouse is filled with looted televisions, artwork, cars. george
points to the stacks of beer.

                        george
            everything is double the price now, you
            do understand that?

                        paul
            i need rice, beans, beer, and your best
            whiskey.

                        george
            beer yes, but no whiskey.

                        paul
            you have no whiskey?

                        george
            no whiskey, no spirits. your rich
            cockroaches at the hotel, they will have
            to do without their scotch. anyway, i
            have bled that cow enough paul.

paul counts out the rwandan francs.

                        paul
            what do you mean george?

                        george
            their money is no good to them. soon all
            the ineysi will be dead.

                        paul
                 (incredulous) )
            you cannot kill them all.

                        george
            why not? we are half way there already.

paul's stomach heaves. he hides it, turns over the money, gets in the
van with gregoire. george comes to the passenger window.

                        george (cont'd)
            let me give you a tip my friend, our
            generals in the army say 'do not go near
            the mille collines or they will send the
            belgian soldiers back here'. but the
            generals are about to leave, and we will
            be in charge. it is time to butcher your
            cow for the meat. (a beat)
            you can help us paul. you have some very
            important traitors at your hotel. the
            politician xavier. the liar benedict. if
            we were to get them, then maybe we could
            let one or two cockroaches get away. you
            understand, paul.

paul says nothing, but gregoire has been listening very carefully.

                        paul
            let's go.

                        george
            take the river road back. it is clear.

the van takes off.
