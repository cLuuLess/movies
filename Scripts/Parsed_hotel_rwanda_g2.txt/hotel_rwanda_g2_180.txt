int. hotel store room. night

paul, zozo stand amongst the debris: a gaping hole in a wall. the room
is covered in burned note papers, menus brochures for sabena's two
hotels, the mille collines and the diplomat.

odette appears carrying her medical bag.

                        odette
            was anyone hurt?

                        paul
            no. it was only a storeroom.
