ext. hotel gardens. night

paul and tatiana pass the clusters of families around their cooking
fires. they pass the pool, now just a third full. he sits her on the
bench in the grove.

                        tatiana
            we are almost out of water.

                        paul
            we are almost out of everything.

he takes her hand.

                        paul (cont'd)
            we had a good life, you and i. i want to
            make our peace. to thank god for the time
            we had.

he kisses her, total love.

                        paul (cont'd)
            we have to have a plan.

                        tatiana
            what sort of plan?

                        paul
            our children cannot see us die first. if
            the militia comes, you must hurry up to
            the roof. i will meet you there.

                        tatiana
            please do not talk like this.

                        paul
            we have to. if i do not come, you must
            take them all by the hands and jump.

she puts her hands to her ears. he pulls them down.

                        paul (cont'd)
            the machete is no way to die. promise me
            you will do it.

she cries harder and squeezes his hand in fear.

suddenly, a bang, from behind them and then above their heads a trail
of fire - an rpg rocket - zigzags toward the hotel.

a huge explosion on the wall, one-story beneath the roof.

paul throws tatiana to the ground, covers her.

smoke and concrete dust fall around them.
