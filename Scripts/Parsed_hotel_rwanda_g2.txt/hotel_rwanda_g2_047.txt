ext. hotel pool terrace. night

drinks are served at a table as paul listens to thomas.

                        thomas
            my assistant, the hutu power man, says we
            should get out now, that soon it will be
            very bad.

paul stifles his anger.

                        paul
            give me this man's name.

                        thomas
            his name is naramaranga, but please,
            paul, even though he is hutu power, he is
            a friend, he likes me. he told me there
            is a signal. it is "cut the tall trees."
            when they hear the signal, the militia
            are to go to war.

                        fedens
            please, let us take tatiana with us. you
            are hutu, you will be safe.

                        paul
            thomas, fedens, i am a man who looks
            after his family. if there were danger i
            would be the first to leave?

bang - a distant explosion, a flash of light on the far side of the
city. fedens jumps.

                        fedens
            what was that?

                        paul
            calm yourself, it is fireworks to
            celebrate the peace.

                        thomas
            please, paul, tomorrow i will bring you
            my car. you will sell it for me and get a
            fair price. we will go to tanzania until
            there is real peace.

                        zozo
            excuse me, paul, you have a call.

zozo hands paul a cordless phone.

                        paul
            hello. tatsi. yes, they are here. yes. i
            know but i want them to calm down.

thomas and fedens listen.

                        paul (cont'd)
            already the press are packing their bags.
            the bbc man told me there's no story
            here. we are boring now. i'll be home
            soon.

he hangs up.

                        paul (cont'd)
            let us all go home and sleep.
