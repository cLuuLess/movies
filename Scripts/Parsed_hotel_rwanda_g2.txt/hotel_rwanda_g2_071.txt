int. hotel diplomat manager's office. day

paul bursts into the room. the two soldiers follow.

he goes to the hotel's big old combination safe, spins the combination
a few times, tries the handle, clunk! it doesn't open. he's forgotten
the number.

the soldiers look at him impatiently. paul improvises.

                        paul
            gentlemen, you'll find some chocolate,
            and maybe a few beers in the fridge.

don't let them go to waste.

the soldiers fall over each other to get to the fridge.

paul tries the safe numbers again, clunk! it opens.

he sees: a big bunch of keys, a wad of dollars, rwandan francs, a check
book, and several bottles of the best cognac, whiskey, some cristal.

he looks round nervously but the two soldiers are busy fighting over
the beer and chocolates in the fridge.

as they do, paul, hands trembling, stuffs the wads of notes, into his
belt, pulls his shirt over and shuts the safe door.

                        paul (cont'd)
            i've got them.

he is about to leave.

                        soldier 1
            wait!

paul looks back at the soldier.

                        soldier 1 (cont'd)
            sit down.

paul sits, as the two soldiers guzzle beers and stuff chocolate into
their pockets.
