nuns cling to young children. french soldiers wrench the nuns away,
lift them off their feet, carry them to the bus.

jock films, as a french officer screams at him.

the last nun is dragged onto a bus.

jock looks to paul, then gets on the bus.

the convoy - french jeeps, buses, italian jeeps, un jeeps takes off,
through the refugees, turns a corner, gone.

paul, drenched, is left alone to fend for his new guests:

weeping women, frightened children.
