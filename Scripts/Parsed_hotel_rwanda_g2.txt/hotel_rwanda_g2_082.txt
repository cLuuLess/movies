int. hotel room. day
paul leads his family into a one-bedroom suite. the kids drop to the
beds exhausted. tatiana picks up the phone and dials.

                        paul
            what are you doing?

                        tatiana
            trying thomas and fedens. we've got to
            get them here.

paul paces the room. the maids clearly haven't cleaned it since it's
last occupants: the beds are unmade; towels are on the floor; and a
newspaper is scattered across the desk.

                        paul
            (re: room) this won't do.

                        tatiana
            it will do just fine.

so paul tidies the place. as he does,

                        paul
            any luck?

                        tatiana
            no answer. please send someone to get
            them, please.

                        paul
            i'll try.

paul leaves.
