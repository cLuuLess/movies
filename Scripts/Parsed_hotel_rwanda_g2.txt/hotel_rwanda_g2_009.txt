ext. hotel forecourt. day

lush tropical gardens, peacocks wander the well-manicured lawns,an
exotic african paradise. the van heads to a magnificent colonial
building.

                        paul (v.o.)
            pull up at the front door.

a valet opens the front door of the hotel and looks shocked. it's
unheard of for a service van to stop out front.

                        paul (cont'd)
                 (urgent, to the valet)
            help zozo.
