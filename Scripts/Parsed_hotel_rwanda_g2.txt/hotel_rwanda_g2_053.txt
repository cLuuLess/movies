int. paul's living room. night

the door slowly opens. paul steps in quietly, tries the light switch,
nothing. he listens. the only sounds are distant explosions and
gunfire. the beam of his flashlight cuts the blackness, illuminating:

magazines arranged on a coffee table; an empty chair; children's toys
in a basket.
