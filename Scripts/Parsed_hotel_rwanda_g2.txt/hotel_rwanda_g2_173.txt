ext. hotel gardens. day

paul sits alone on his secluded bench in the garden.

a cloud of despair shrouds him.

as he watches several women dip cooking pots into the pool.

he hurries toward them.

                        paul
            what are you doing?

                        tutsi woman
            there is no water from the pipes.

paul heads for the front doors. he's intercepted by the two rwandan
policemen stationed at the gate by bizimungu.

                        gendarme
            where is our beer? you promised us beer.

                        paul
            did you explain to the good general that
            i have temporarily run out of stock?

                        gendarme
            he said to ask mitterand and the french
            to send you more.

                        paul
            you will get it in due time. now, please,
            get back to the gate.
