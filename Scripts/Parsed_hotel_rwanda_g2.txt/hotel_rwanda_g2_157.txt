int. hotel lobby. day

paul is in a horrible mood. the refugees in the ballroom try to push by
the un officer. paul joins him.

                        un lieutenant
            back, please. stay back.

                        paul
            zozo, tell those people to get back to
            the ballroom. they can not be here.

zozo scampers off.

                        paul (cont'd)
            what are we waiting for? come on.

paul herds the convoy people toward the door.

close on: gregoire watching from behind the front desk.

through the doors we see the trucks being loaded.

zozo returns.

                        zozo
            sir, the others want to speak to you.

reluctant, paul walks over to the ballroom dwellers.

                        paul
            yes.

                        tutsi woman
            good, sir we have letters, please take
            them for us.

paul reaches out for the letters, takes them, reads the addresses:

president nelson mandela. pope john paul. president clinton.

                        tutsi man #1
            if you leave, we are certain to die.

                        zozo
            i have a letter, sir.

zozo hands paul the letter. he studies the address. it reads "to the
great man muhammad ali."

others crowd around.

                        paul
            i will get you all visas. i promise. i
            will get you out of here.

paul's at a loss. he has to tear himself away.

afraid to look back, he heads for the convoy.
