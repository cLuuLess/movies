int. hotel paul's room. day.

paul enters, drops to the bed. tatiana curls up next to him.

                        tatiana
            you could leave, paul.

                        paul
            what are you saying, tatsi?

                        tatiana
            your card says hutu. take our children,
            go and get the twins, pay money at the
            roadblocks. get them out. please.

                        paul
            enough of this. we stay together. let me
            rest, i will feel better then.

paul puts on his walkman earphones, presses play, the rich cowboy drawl
of don williams singing.

close on: paul as his eyes droop and to the music.

a kalidiscope of colors filter through drooping eyelids as

close on pauls face, as the music plays.

his eyes open wide, disturbed, music playing

pauls pov, an army lieutenant stands over him, other soldiers around.

the lieutenant reaches down, pulls the earphones from pauls ears.

                        lieutenant
            you are the manager?

                        paul
            yes, sir. what is wrong?

                        lieutenant
            everyone must leave the hotel now.

                        paul
            why sir?

                        lieutenant
            it's an order. get everyone out now.

                        paul
            i...ah...need some time. please give us
            twenty, thirty minutes. people are
            sleeping.

the lieutenant is not impressed.

                        paul (cont'd)
            please, have some cold drinks. i will be
            as quick as i can.

'cold drinks' softens the soldiers' attitudes.

                        lieutenant
            we will be outside, ten minutes.

the soldiers march off. paul goes back inside. the kids, sensing the
menace, sit still and wide-eyed on the floor. suddenly tatiana notices
roger is missing.

                        tatiana
            where's roger?

danielle points to under the bed.

close on:

roger trembling under the bed, as paul's face appears.

                        paul
            come on son, everything is all right.

he slides him out, clutches him in his arms, then turns him over to
tatiana as he phones the front desk.

                        paul (cont'd)
                 (on phone)
            who is this? zozo. i know. get them beer.

he turns to tatiana.

                        paul (cont'd)
            go to the roof now.

                        tatiana
                 (terrified)
            what for paul.

                        paul
                 (forceful)
            do as i say. i will be there soon.

he hurries out.
