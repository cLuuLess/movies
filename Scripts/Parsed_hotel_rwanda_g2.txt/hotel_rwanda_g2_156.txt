int. hotel lobby. day

the lucky families are gathered: tatiana and all her children; xavier
and his wife; benedict; and others.

some of the unlucky ones peer around the door of the ballroom. a un
officer stands in their way.

                        un lieutenant
            back. everyone back. only those with
            letters of acceptance in the lobby.
