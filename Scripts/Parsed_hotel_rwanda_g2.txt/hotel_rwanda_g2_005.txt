int. rutaganda's warehouse. day

at his desk in front of a fan. george rutagunda, late 30's, huge, gold
chains, rolex watch, (like an african mafia boss) but the same
interahamwe shirt. he squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso.

behind him, through his office window, the white van is being loaded
with cases of beer.

george holds out his massive shirt.

                        george
            you will join us at the rally today?

paul sits opposite, sipping coffee.

                        paul
            i will try my best george but these days
            i have no time for rallies or politics.

                        george
            politics is power, paul. and money.

paul studies his watch.

                        paul
            time is money, george. we need extra beer
            today.

                        george
            business is good at the hotel?

                        paul
            very good.

                        george
            i am always glad to see you paul.

george leads paul out into the warehouse.

as a forklift lifts a wooden crate, george angers.

                        george (cont'd)
            hell man, that is not beer, put it back!
                        driver
            but, sir, the carlsberg is behind...

                        george
            forget the carlsberg, give him grolsch.

                 (to paul)
            i won't charge extra.

                        paul
            thank you.

the driver of the forklift, anxiously, spins the machine to return the
crate but it slides off and crashes onto the floor: machetes, hundreds
of them, spill out.

an awkward moment then george picks one of the crude blades.

                        george
            a bargain buy, from china. ten cents
            each, i'll get a dollar.

                        paul
            at least.

off zozo terrified.
