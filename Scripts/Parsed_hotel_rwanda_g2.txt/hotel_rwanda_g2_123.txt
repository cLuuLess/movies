ext. hotel roof. day

paul emerges onto the roof, sees tatiana, his children, and many of the
neighbors sitting huddled together. (they do not know the soldiers have
left.)

tatiana is frozen to the spot.

                        paul
            they have gone.

tatiana grabs him. tears of joy. paul's neighbors swarm him, touch him,
thank him like a messiah. this effects him. he seems genuinely moved as
he shakes hands and hugs them.

            phone for you.
