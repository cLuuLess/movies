int. paul's bedroom. night

paul's light sweeps across the room and illuminates:

eyes - terrified eyes, a room full of faces, staring back.

their pov: a dark figure behind a blinding light.

the dog breaks free, runs to paul.

                        paul
            pealiss!

from among the faces, tatiana's voice heavy with relief.

                        tatiana
            paul!
            paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded
            into this small room. then he sees their friends odette and her husband
            jean baptiste.

                        paul
            jean baptiste!

                        jean baptiste
            our house has been burned.

                        paul
            what is going on?

                        tatiana
            the president has been murdered.

                        paul
            murdered! by whom?

                        odette
            the radio says tutsi rebels.

                        paul
            nonsense. why would the rebels kill the
            president when he agreed to peace?

tatiana pulls paul aside.

                        tatiana
            where are thomas and fedens?

                        paul
            i sent them home. go and call them.

                        tatiana
            i tried already. the phones do not work.

jean baptiste turns on his tiny radio.

                        radio announcer
            our great president is murdered, by the
            tutsi cockroaches. they tricked him, then
            they killed him. we must cleanse this
            country, good hutus of rwanda. we must
            clear the brush. clear the brush of all
            cockroaches. clear the brush!!!

the words are cut short as a grenade blast rattles the window. everyone
jumps, children whimper. paul is shocked but tries to pull things
together.

                        paul
            come on, everyone out of this room, find
            a seat in the living room.

he holds the door open, they file out, frightened. tatiana is last, he
stops her, steps back in, closes the door.

                        paul (cont'd)
                 (in hushed anger)
            is every tutsi in the neighborhood here?

                        tatiana
            they came through the bushes, over the
            wall. what could i do?

                        paul
            send them home. we are not the police.
what do we have to protect them?

                        tatiana
            please. let them stay 'til morning. the
            militia will not come here, they know you
            are a hutu with influence.

                        paul
            they know you are tutsi!

the door knocks. paul gets up, angry.

                        tatiana
            please, paul, 'til first light.

                        paul
            dawn. then they go.

paul opens the door, it's odette, holding the hand of paul's eldest
daughter.

                        odette
            forgive me, paul. danielle says that
            roger has gone.

tatiana comes over instantly, worried.

                        tatiana
            gone where? tell me, danielle.

their daughter danielle answers.

                        danielle
            next door, mama. he was afraid for his
            friend simon. he went to fetch him.
