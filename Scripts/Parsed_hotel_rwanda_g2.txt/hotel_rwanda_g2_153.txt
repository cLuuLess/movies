int. hotel lobby. day

mr. garindi waits nervously in the lobby.

paul arrives.

                        mr. garindi
            it is dangerous to be here. the radio
            says this is a nest of cockroaches.

                        paul
            i need one last favor. go back and get
            the twins.

                        mr. garindi
            (emphatic) no, it is impossible. that
            side of town has been destroyed in the
            fighting. the children are dead.

                        paul
            how do you know?

                        mr. garindi
            everyone is dead there. the dogs eat the
            bodies in the street. i have to go.

                        paul
            i will give you my house.

the businessman turns back.

                        paul (cont'd)
            it's a fine house. here is a paper.

paul spots an elegant woman carrying laundry toward the elevator. he
runs to her.

                        paul (cont'd)
            madame kawunda, please.

paul leads her over.

                        paul (cont'd)
            i need you to witness this signature.

                 (to the businessman)
            madame kawunda is the minister for
            agriculture. she is a very reliable
            witness.

paul signs, then hands the pen to the puzzled woman.

                        paul (cont'd)
            please witness this deed.

she signs. paul pushes the deed into the man's hand.

                        paul (cont'd)
            there, now go and find them. they have no
            papers. no one knows they are tutsi. they
            will be alive.

the businessman heads for the door.

                        paul (cont'd)
            you must be back by 7:00a.m. tomorrow.

paul watches him go.

                        paul (cont'd)
            seven, remember.

the mr. garindi leaves.
