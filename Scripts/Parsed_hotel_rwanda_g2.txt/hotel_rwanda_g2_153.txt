int. hotel banquet room. day

oliver is on the stage, all the refugee guests are crowded into the
room he has a list in his hand.

                        colonel oliver
            the un has been notified that the
            following families have received travel
            visas from the following countries.

he reads.

                        colonel oliver (cont'd)
            abukesu - tanzania, arumangu -zambia,
            bawroanga - kenya,

close on: elation among the chosen families.

                        colonel oliver (cont'd)
            gituaranga - zambi, horangora - belguim

close on - fear on the faces of families who realize they have missed
this alphabetical list, anxiety among the others.

                        colonel oliver (cont'd)
            paramisambi - zambia, rusesabagina -
            belgium.

tatiana kisses paul.

                        colonel oliver (cont'd)
            zamacanga - ghana. a plane will land at
            the airport tomorrow and the named
            families will be flown to kenya. two un
            trucks will be here at 7 a.m. the named
            families must be ready to leave then.

a voice calls out.

                        tutsi woman
            colonel, sir. why not take us all to the
            airport? we can wait there to obtain
            visas.

                        colonel oliver
            i can't do that. our camp at the airport
            is overwhelmed already. we could not
            defend you there. you are better to stay
            here and work to get an exit visa.

oliver jumps from the stage, pushes through the crowd.

paul's pov: odette and jean baptiste are silently devastated. he pushes
through to the colonel now surrounded by those who didn't make the
list.

                        paul
            colonel, odette camundu ... she must be
            on the list.

oliver shakes his head no.

                        colonel oliver
            paul, only those i called can get on the
            trucks. i do not want to have to pull
            people off, you understand?

paul nods yes. tatiana arrives beside him, pulls him aside.

                        tatiana
            i will not leave without the twins.

                        paul
            we have to get out of here tatiana.

                        tatiana
            please, please try one more time.

                        paul
            i'll try but we have to leave, with or
            without them. i want you to promise.

she reluctantly nods yes.
