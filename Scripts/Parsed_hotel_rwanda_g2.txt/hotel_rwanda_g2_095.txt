ext. hotel forecourt. morning

paul emerges to find more refugees, some settled on the lawn, others
gathered in clumps by the doorway.

paul calls over to the valet.

                        paul
            take these people to the rear car park,
            they can't stay here.

suddenly women and children on the lawn scream and run in fear. behind
them bushes shake, then suddenly a bloody figure wearing only boxer
shorts bursts out from among the trees and flees to the middle of the
driveway. it's the journalist, benedict, covered in blood. his ear has
been chopped off.

pandemonium. as paul runs to him, calls to zozo.

                        paul (cont'd)
            get odette!

paul grabs benedict, tries to calm him.

                        paul (cont'd)
            what happened?

                        benedict
            they're killing everyone. the lady
            minister! the un soldiers. they're at the
            gate.

he points down the driveway. this sparks many of the women refugees,
and white guests, to flee inside the hotel.

odette arrives with her bag, leads benedict inside.

jock has been filming all of this.
