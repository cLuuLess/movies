ext. hotel forecourt. dawn

the grey of dawn, before the sunrise.

colonel oliver in his jeep leads a convoy of un trucks past the guard
house and bizimungu's police and up the drive.

                                                               cut to:

the un trucks

parked in front of the hotel. tutsi refugees file up and are helped on
board by un soldiers.

paul helps tatiana and the children onto a truck.

an argument breaks out towards the back of the convoy. paul rushes
toward xavier and benedict who argue.

                        xavier
            they should go one truck at a time. when
            the first truck gets through to the
            airport, then the others will follow.

                        paul
            we can't wait. we all go together or not
            at all.

paul takes matters into his own hands. he locks the doors of the hotel.

there is no going back.

                        paul (cont'd)
            it is time to leave. the mille collines
            is closed.

paul climbs onto the truck. the others follow, some reluctantly.

colonel oliver gives the signal.

the trucks take off down the driveway.
