int. hotel paul's room. night

roger is asleep, on a couch in the living room, several kids sleep on
the floor.

to the bed: where tatiana suppresses bursts of laughter as paul relates
the gregoire story in whispers.

                        paul
            as soon as the general left he came
            running back. (mimics gregoire) help me,
            sir, i have been possessed by a witch.
            (paul's own voice now) a witch you say?
            (mimics) yes, yes, i did not know i was
            in that room. the president's room, why
            would i be in the president's room? (own
            voice) indeed, the general asked me the
            same. (mimics) asked you what? (own
            voice) does gregoire think he is
            president now?

paul mimics gregoire's whimpers of fear.

                        tatiana
                 (laughing)
            stop, stop, we will waken the children.

paul lifts the bottle of fine bordeaux, pours more.

                        paul
            lynch bages, 84. perfect with lamb, or
            fine rare beef.

                        tatiana
            so where is the lamb?

                        paul
            maybe gregoire and the witch ate it.

they both chuckle, then paul remembers, a cloud of anxiety comes over
him.

                        tatiana
            what's the matter?

                        paul
            we're running out of beer and other
            supplies.

she kisses him.

                        tatiana
            the foreigners abandon us and you do
            inventory. you are so conscientious.

she kisses him again, tries to cheer him.

                        paul
            i have to go out to get food.

                        tatiana
            go out! where?

                        paul
            to rutagunda's place. it is close by.

                        tatiana
            no, no.

                        paul
            i have to, tatiana, we are only as
            valuable as the service we provide.

                        tatiana
            you cannot go alone.

                        paul
            i'm not going alone. i'll take gregoire
            with me. he's a good hutu, and he wants
            to impress me now.
