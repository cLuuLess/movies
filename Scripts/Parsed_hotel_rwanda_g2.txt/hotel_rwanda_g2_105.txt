int. hotel bar. day

paul follows the colonel into the kigali club. the place is empty, the
bartender missing, gone to celebrate.

                        paul
            colonel, what can i get you?

paul gets behind the bar.

                        colonel oliver
            anything. strong.

                        paul
            canadian club?

oliver cracks a weary smile. paul pours two drinks, slides one across.

he raises his glass.

                        paul (cont'd)
            congratulations, colonel. you have saved
            us all.

                        colonel oliver
                 (raw cynicism)
            congratulations. you should spit in my
            face.

                        paul
            excuse me, colonel.

                        colonel oliver
            we think you are dirt, less than dirt,
            worthless.

                        paul
            i don't understand.

                        colonel oliver
            don't bullshit me, paul. you're the
            smartest man here. you have them all
            eating out of your hand. you'd own this
            fucking hotel, except for one thing.

paul doesn't answer.

                        colonel oliver (cont'd)
            you're fucking black! you're not even a
            nigger, you're african!
                 (downs his drink)
            they're not staying to stop this thing.
            they're gonna fly right out of here with
            their people.

                        paul
                 (shocked)
            their people?

                        colonel oliver
            they're only taking the whites.
