a thick mist blankets the grounds as paul and gregoire emerge.

                        gregoire
            (fearful) where are we going, sir?

                        paul
            for supplies, you drive.

                        gregoire
            the fog is too heavy, sir.

                        paul
            just drive, gregoire.
