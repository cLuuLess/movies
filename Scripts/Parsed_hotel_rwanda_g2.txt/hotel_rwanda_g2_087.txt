ext. hotel forecourt. day

paul approaches the bbc reporter gloria and colonel oliver as their
interview concludes.

                        gloria
            do we know who fired the missile that
            killed the president?

                        colonel oliver
            no. but i fear it's intention may have
            been to kill the peace accords and spark
            a civil war between the hutu militia and
            the tutsi rebels.

                        gloria
            we've heard reports of reprisal killings.
            will the un intervene to stop the
            bloodshed.?

                        colonel oliver
            unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers
            not peace makers, we can't take an
            aggressive role.

                        gloria
            if the un changes your mandate could you
            stop the bloodshed?

                        colonel oliver
            yes. with some re-inforcements i'm
            confident we could impose order.

                        gloria
            have you requested re-enforcements?

                        colonel oliver
            yes we have.

                        gloria
            what was the response?

                        colonel oliver
            we're awaiting a decision, excuse me.

colonel oliver shakes gloria's hand then moves off toward paul.

                        colonel oliver (cont'd)
            paul, i've sent my soldiers to rescue the
            lady prime minister, she'll need a room.

                        paul
            yes sir, but these people (points) they
            cannot stay here. i've heard you have a
            refugee center at the airport stadium?

                        colonel oliver
            i'm sorry, i can't possibly take them
            paul. i'm overrun with refugees. as soon
            as we can stabilize the situation we'll
             take them.

paul moves to the door, where jock and gloria argue beside a saloon car
with the word press spelt out in tape on the wind sreen

                        jock
            for fuck's sake, gloria there's a big
            news story out there! we need to get out
            and cover it.

                        gloria
            were not going outside the hotel grounds
            unless we have an armored car. that's the
            ground rules.

                        jock
            ground rules! where the fuck do you think
            you are, wimbledon?

                        gloria
            we cover the story from here until we
            can get proper protection.

she walks off.
