ext. hotel forecourt. day

militia swarm around the front of the hotel.

the jeeps race through, scattering them. they screech to a halt.

several refugees sit, huddled and battered. bizimungu jumps out,
snatches an a.k. from a soldier, fires in the air.

                        general bizimungu
            get back! (to his soldiers) get them out
            of here.

paul does not wait.
