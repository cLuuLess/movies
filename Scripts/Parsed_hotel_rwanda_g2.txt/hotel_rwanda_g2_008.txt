ext. hotel entrance. day

the van turns off the street into the milles collines hotel driveway
and honks twice as it pulls down a short drive lined with tall shrubs.

an armed guard rushes from his booth and lifts the gate. perfectly
timed. the van doesn't even have to slow as it passes. a sign on the
guard house reads "welcome to the hotel mille collines".
