            children, go into the hallway.

tatiana and the children stop what they're doing, puzzled.

                        paul (cont'd)
             (to the kids) please, go.

the kids leave.

                        tatiana
            what's wrong?

paul takes her hands in his.

                        paul
            all the whites are leaving.

tatiana's grip tightens.

                        paul (cont'd)
            they are being evacuated.

                        tatiana
            what about us?

                        paul
            we have been abandoned.

tatiana clings to hope.

                        tatiana
            the soldiers will stop the killers.

paul looses it.

                        paul
            listen to me woman. i said all the whites
            are leaving. the french, the italians,
            even the belgian un soldiers.

                        tatiana
            but who is left?

                        paul
            i don't know. colonel oliver says the un
            has three hundred soldiers for the whole
            country. black soldiers, pakistanis.

he looks up at her.

                        paul (cont'd)
            the most the colonel can spare for the
            hotel are four men, and they're not
            allowed to shoot.

he takes her hand, makes her sit down.

                        paul (cont'd)
            if anything should happen, if the militia
            arrive, you must take the children and go
            to the roof.

tatiana's eyes are wide with fear.

                        tatiana
            what for?

paul takes his anger out on tatiana.

                        paul
            do what i say, woman. you hear me? i will
            meet you there.

he storms out.

                                                               cut to:
