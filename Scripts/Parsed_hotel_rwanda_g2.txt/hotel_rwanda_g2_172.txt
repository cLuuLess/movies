ext. hotel front gate. day.

paul's van speeds toward the gate.

then - a loud metallic screeching noise

as a un jeep, its tires shot out, sparks cascading from wheel rims,
screams up to the guard house.

paul slams on the brakes.

the jeep is followed by the two trucks, their canvas slashed fluttering
in the wind.

paul throws the van into reverse and clears the way.

the convoy pulls up in front of the hotel.

bloody and battered, the terrified refugees fall from the trucks.

paul and odette run among the casualties. then he sees them:

tatiana, clothes torn, scratches on her face.

the kids screaming in terror.

paul runs to them, grabs, kisses, weeps louder.

battered refugees everywhere, other hotel residents looking on -
equally terrified because: they know they are doomed.

paul sees roger, trembling, tears soak his face.

                        roger
            papa! papa!

he grabs roger up. tatiana struggles to paul, embraces.

                        paul
            thank god you are safe.

tatiana breaks from the embrace.

                        tatiana
            did he bring the twins?

paul shakes his head no.
