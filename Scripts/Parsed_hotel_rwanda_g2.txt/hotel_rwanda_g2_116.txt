int. hotel corridor. day

paul's door opens, his head appears round the corner.

the corridor is empty of soldiers. now, frightened tutsis peer out from
their rooms. a group of men, among them the politician xavier, are
gathered in the hallway. paul spots one man holding a pistol. he runs
up.

                        paul
                 (to the man with the pistol)
            are you mad? they will gun us all down.

                        pistol man
            better to die by the bullet than the
            machete.

paul pulls the gun off him.

                        paul
            wait here, please.

paul hands the gun to xavier, hurries off.
