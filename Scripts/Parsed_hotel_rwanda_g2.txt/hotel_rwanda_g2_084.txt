int. hotel lobby. day

paul stops just shy of the lobby. around the corner is a mob of angry
guests. paul takes a moment to gather himself: straightens his tie;
button his jacket; flick a piece of lint from his shoulder. then he
takes a breath and steps around the corner.

                        paul
            thank you for your patience, ladies and
            gentlemen. now, how can i help you.

the mob rushes him.

                                                             cut to:

paul works the front desk as angry guests surge all around him. zozo
emerges from the office with two tourists.

                        paul (cont'd)
            where are the receptionists? where's
            gregoire?

                        zozo
            he has taken the presidential suite.

                        paul
            what!
            paul storms off.
