int. hotel bbc room. day

the room is set up as a make-shift broadcast center.

gloria is on a phone to the bbc in london, she hangs up.

                        gloria
            okay, were feeding through live now.

she fixes her outfit, sits straight up in the chair. behind her two
monitors show footage of a plane crash and bodies along roads.

                        gloria
            okay london .... and five four three two
            one ...thats correct tom. today's
            gruesome ambush of a ten man belgian
            patrol has left the un peacekeeping force
            in a state of disarray. its commander has
            called for re-enforcements. however, the
            general council is deeply divided. the
            united states, still smarting from the
            un's disastrous somalia mission, has
            indicated that it will veto any moves to
            reinforce. meanwhile, the slaughter goes
            on. gloria brooks in kigali, rwanda.

gloria on the phone, listens.

                        gloria
            and, cut ...good, give me a call guys,
            let me know youve got it.

jock turns to paul.

                        jock
            perfect timing.

                        paul
            this goes out live?

jock points skyward.

                        jock
            satellite feed.

                        gloria (on phone)
            great. (listens) no kidding, when will
            they be here? excellent. yes, call then.

she hangs up.

                        gloria (cont'd)
            the news room has heard that the french
            and the belgians are putting together an
            intervention force.

                        paul
            when will they be here?

                        gloria
            very soon.

                        paul
            thank god.

jock's is at the window scanning with his camera, getting b roll, then
he sees something.

                        jock
            hey peter, hook me back into the
            monitors.

jocks filming as peter makes the connection.

                        jock (cont'd)
            holy shit! holy shit.

                        gloria
            what is it?

jock focuses

on the monitor: blurry focus of a shanty town on a hill.

now focus: of a crowd hovering close to a group of rwandan tutsis
seated on the ground. two militia emerge from the crowd, waving
machetes. they slash their way along the line, savage, powerful blows,
butchering people like cattle. (author note: we will use real
news footage of this)

                        jock (cont'd)
            you fucking see that!

                        gloria
                 (shock)
            oh my god!

on screen: the crowd run off, waving machetes.

gloria snaps out of her shock, snatches the phone, dials.

                        gloria (cont'd)
            it's gloria. listen we've footage,
            unbelievable footage! a massacre!
            machetes, murderers, dead bodies. you
            have to lead with this. well send it
            through right now. wait 'til you see
            this.

she puts the phone down, turns to the others, triumphant.

an embarrassed silence in the room. jock is disgusted by her glee. he
picks up a plate from the trolley.

                        jock
            (to gloria) here, have a sandwich.

                        gloria
            fuck you.

she storms out. paul fills the embarrassed silence.

                        paul
            i'm glad you filmed this. now the west
            will have to stop it. excuse me,
            gentlemen.
