ext. hotel corridor. evening

the businessman mr. garindi knocks on room 211. paul opens the door,
sees him, then turns back to tatiana.

                        paul
            tatsi, come.

tatsi appears at the door with several of the kids.

                        paul (cont'd)
            (to the kids) go back inside.

the kids do as they're told. paul and tatsi shut the door and join the
businessman in the hall.

                        paul (cont'd)
            did you find the twins?

tatiana clings to paul, fearful of the news.

                        mr. garindi
            i made it to the house but it was empty.
            it had been robbed.

                        tatiana
            oh god.

                        paul
            was there blood?

                        mr. garindi
            no blood. as i left a neighbor, an old
            woman, waved to me. i went to her house.
            she has the little girls. they are safe.

                        tatiana
            my brother, his wife. did this woman know
            of them? did they leave the children with
            her?

the businessman shakes his head no. tears run down tatiana's face. she
holds paul's arm to stop from falling to the floor.

                        paul
            this is not bad news, tatsi. perhaps they
            fled or could not make it home. there is
            hope.

                        tatiana
                 (to the businessman)
            please go back, bring the children to us.

                        mr. garindi
            (frightened)no ma'am, i cannot do that.
            the roadblocks are everywhere. they are
            looking for children. they shout, "kill
            the babies to clear the infestation."
            leave them be, they are safe. i have to
            go now.

paul takes a small wad of notes from his pocket, presses it into the
businessman's hand.

                        paul
            thank you for your help.

he leaves. tatiana pulls paul to her.

                        tatiana
            my sister is dead, paul. they would not
            leave the children.

                        paul
            no. they are not dead. stop this.
