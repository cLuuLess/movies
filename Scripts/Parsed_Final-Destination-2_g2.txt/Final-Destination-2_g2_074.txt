int. truck - continuous

kimberly "comes to" at the wheel -- flailing desperately at the
steering wheel. she even claws at thomas who tries to control the
neglected steering wheel.

                        clear
               slow down! we're...

kimberly looks up as the truck comes around a blind curve, where cars
are backed up at a stop sign. kimberly screams and slams on the
brakes.

the truck skids on wet leaves, completely out of control, towards a
landscaping truck parked on the shoulder.

kimberly's truck hits the loading ramps and launches itself twenty
feet into the air, dukes of hazzard-style.

and lands miraculously without a scratch! on a parallel road. and
keeps going. dumb, insane fucking luck.

kimberly shakes off her premonition and looks out the rear window.
she turns around with a cocky smile.

she rubs her throat and floors it again to thomas' horror, more
determined.

                       clear
                     (eyes darting)
              what did you see? what am i
              looking for?

                       kimberly
              no, it's not here. this one was
              different. more like the pile up
              and the van going into the lake.
              it wasn't just a sign, i was there.

                       clear
                     (confused)
              another premonition?

                       kimberly
              yes. i was in a hospital. there
              was screaming... a nurse was
              choking me. i couldn't tell wh at
              she looked like, but the name tag
              was right in my face. kalarjian.

                       thomas
              kalarjian?

                       kimberly
              i think a nurse named kalarjian is
              going to choke isabella to death!
