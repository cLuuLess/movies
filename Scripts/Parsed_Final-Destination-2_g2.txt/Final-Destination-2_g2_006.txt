int. a room - continuous

kat, eugene, nora, tim, and rory sit in a large room, waiting to give
statements. unlike evan, these witnesses are clearly distraught.


                      kat
             not to sound insensitive, but how
             much longer is this going to take?

                      eugene
             if i don't get back to my classroom
             soon, the kids'll tear the room
             apart.

                      nora
             those poor people. to think it
             would've been us if not for...

pan over to reveal kimberly. she's still in shock, her mind far away.
thomas sits close to her, speaking softly.


                      thomas
             tell me again how it started.

                      kimberly
             like i said, it was like i was
             there. i remember everything. the
             sounds of the crashes, the smells,
             the look on shaina's face...

                      thomas
             do you remember what triggered it
             all?

                      kimberly
             the log truck...and everybody i
             guess. everyone was driving like a
             maniac. and somehow i knew
             something horrible was going to
             happen, even before it did.

something clicks for thomas, but he forces himself to speak calmly,
like a lawyer leading a friendly witness.


                      thomas
             you knew? you just mean a hunch,
             right? a bad vibe, maybe?

the other drivers stare at kimberly.


                       kimberly
              more than that. all the songs on
              the radio were about car crashes.
              some kid's banging toy cars
              together.
                  (lookin g at her)
              she was dialing her cell phone with
              her headset on.
                  (points to rory)
              his car was leaking oil all over
              the road.

                       rory
              hey, don't be knockin' the
              chevette.

but the others listen intently now. especially kat, who spies her
headset buried deep in her purse.


                       kimberly
              billboards about accidents. kids
              yelling "pile up" for no reason.
              it all felt...just wrong.
              just like...
                  (swallows; hesitates)

                       thomas
              like what?

kimberly sighs and looks down. the room becomes eerily silent, except
for the flicker of a florescent light.


                       kimberly
              i know this sounds crazy...but you
              all heard about flight 180, right?
              the kid who got off the plane?

thomas' eyes widen -- then a startling crash as rory, le aning back in
his chair, tips over. thomas rolls his eyes as rory grins sheepishly
and picks himself up.


                       thomas
              you mean alex browning.

                       kimberly
                  (looking down)
              ...my premonition was just like
              his.

                       nora
              what are you talking about?

                       eugene
                  (sarcastic)

              oh, you must have read about that
              kid who had a dream about a plane
              crash so he got his buddies off the
              plane? then the thing blew up just
              like in the dream?

                         nora
              maybe...

eugene sees nora and tim are hooked and speaks in scary campfire
tones.


                       eugene
              but this is where it starts to get
              freaky. so a month goes by,
              everything seems cool, but then the
              survivors start dying one boy one.
              'cause when your number's up, it's
              up, right? some people said death
              itself started coming for them,
              hunting down every last one, until
              they were all dead.

everyone tenses up.


                       thomas
              well, not quite all of them. clear
              rivers checked herself into a
              padded room at stoneybrook.

kimberly, affected, looks to thomas for confirmation.


                       kimberly
              you do believe me, don't you?

bang! everyone jumps as detective suby pounds on the door and opens
it.


                       detective suby
              officer burke? could i see you in
              here?
