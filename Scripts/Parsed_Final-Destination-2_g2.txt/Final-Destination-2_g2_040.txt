ext. gas station - day

close up - gas dripping

from the nozzle in thomas' car. thomas fills the tank, watching for
signs of danger. clear's hand is poised over the gas pumps' emergency
cut-off valve

some skate rats exit the mini -mart with a pack of camels, followed by
kimberly, who carries a couple of red bulls and hands them out.

                       thomas
              new life defeats death? follow the
              signs? where the hell did you find
              that guy?

                       kimberly
              yeah, i thought he was supposed to
              be helpful.

                       clear
              he was. if we can use your ability
              to see the signs, we can cheat
              death long enough to figure out
              what "new life" means.
                     (off their looks)
              i know, it worries me that i

                understand him.

thomas tops off the tank. some gas spills to the ground. quick looks
all around -- sure enough, one of the skate rats is about to strike a
match.

clear's hand slaps the kid in the back of the head, stopping him mid -
motion.

                         clear
                what the fuck are you thinking?

the startled skate rat shrinks back from clear's rage.

                         skate rat
                i'm thinkin', suck my junk, bee
                yatch.

thomas chuckles to himself and looks at kimberly who --

smash cut to:
