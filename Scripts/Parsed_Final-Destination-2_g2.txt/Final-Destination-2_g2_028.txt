the receptionist appears next to the fallen fish food with a vacuum.
she plugs it in an outlet below the fishtank.

a startling grind as the vacuum turns on and coughs up a nail. she
vacuums up the fish food around nora's feet.

the dead fish gets sucked into the water filter in the fishtank which
sputters and stops. the water level rises, spilling water over the
side of the tank. the water trickles closer to the outlet.
