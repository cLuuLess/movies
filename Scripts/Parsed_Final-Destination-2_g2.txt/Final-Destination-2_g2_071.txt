the background.

                      staff

             take her pressure and ctg. one
             centimeter dilation. prep the
             epidural stat.

isabella breathes lamaze style in the hospital bed, her feet in
stirrups. a nurse rocks isabella's body back and forth, until her
back arches almost unnaturally forward.

in the bg, an obstetrician, 50s, sterilizes his hands in a scrub
sink.

a female anesthesiologist hustles over, swabbing a long epidural
needle. the nurse places a mask over isabella's face. the
anesthesiologist lowers the needle to the base of isabella's spine.

                       anesthesiologist
              she's going to have to stop moving
              if i'm going to --

the nurse sneezes.

                       anesthesiologist
              goddamn it, keep her still!

                       nurse
              sorry, doctor.

xcu needle

angle on bumblebee

it buzzes about the room, darting between the he ads of the doctors
and nurses, hovering above the --

anesthesiologist, who traces the long needle down isabella's spine,
finding the proper vertebrae.

                       anesthesiologist
              perfectly still now...

everyone freezes. silence. as the tip of the needle presses the skin
down --

the bee lands on the anesthesiologist's ear. and stings!

flinch!

the needle sinks in - a nurse gasps. did something go wrong?

                       anesthesiologist
              done.
                     (tears welling)
