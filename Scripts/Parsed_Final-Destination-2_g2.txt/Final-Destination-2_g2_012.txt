int. police station - computer room - night

thomas sits at the computer terminal. he checks to make sure no one's
watching as he enters a search for alex browning.

ten websites come up, all devoted to the flight 180 curse. thomas
scrolls around, seeing the death pix and autopsy photos of flight 180
"survivors".

headlines blare, "freak accident?" "bizarre coincidence?" describing
the way the victims died. as thomas begins a localized search of the
word, "premonition" --

spooky humming from behind him.

thomas whirls around to see det. suby looking over his shoulder,
humming the music from an old monster movie. suby presses one hand to
his forehead, the other polishing an apple against his vest.


                      detective suby
                    (as if entranced)
             ooooh, i see it now. your
             future... a transfer to another
             department.

suby bites the apple, casually offering nothing more. thomas,
embarrassed, flicks off the computer, stands.


                       thomas
              you've made your point.

                      detective suby
             good. cause we just got some new
             info and i don't ne ed you getting
             freaky on me.

                      thomas
             what?

                      detective suby
             evan shaeffer's dead. guess he
             wasn't as lucky as we thought.

detective suby shrugs and walks away, munching the apple. thomas
looks stunned.
