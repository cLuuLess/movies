int. gas station - day

kimberly

comes to thomas' arms - gasping uncontrollably for breath. terror-
stricken. she begins hyperventilating.

                         thomas
                what is it? what did you see?

it's so bad, kimberly can't speak. she coughs and gags as if recently
drowned. clear scans the perimeter for immediate dangers.

quick cuts:

a power repairman

on a cherry picker messes with the transformer, a lawn boy pull-
starts a weed whacker close to broken glass, a mechanic on a tall
ladder changes out the gas price numbers, a female dog walker with
three dogs approaches the ladder.

                         clear

             you have to tell us now.

                        kimberly
             i...i...

clear shakes her head by the shoulders and barks commands like an
angry drill sergeant.

                      clear
             you're strong. do you hear me?
             you're a fucking warrior. nothing
             scares you. in fact you happen to
             be the single most powerful woman
             on earth. now what did you see?

the words slowly take affect. kimberly becomes centered, getting her
breath back, and speaks without a hitch.

                      kimberly
             i was driving a white van. it
             must've gone out of control because
             it crashed into a lake and i
             drowned. it was...horrible.

                      clear
             you were there?

                      kimberly
             i can practically taste the water
             in my throat. and something else.
             the smell of flowers...

                      clear
                    (confused)
             then it wasn't just a sign. it was
             a premonition?

thomas gently releases her, paces.

                      thomas
             remember the onramp? there was a
             pregnant woman in a white delivery
             van.

                      clear
             holy shit. he said "only new life
             can defeat death."
                    (off looks)
             if she gives birth to a baby that
             was never meant to be born, a brand
             new soul that was never part of
             death's design...

                      kimberly
             it throws the entire death list out
             of whack. and a new list has to be
             rewritten f rom scratch. we all
             start over with a clean slate.

                       thomas
              it sounds all well and good, but

             what if we're wrong?

                      clear
             please, what else could it mean?

                       kimberly
                     (to thomas)
              so if you give us the pregnant
              lady's number, we can warn her
              about the lake and she'll live long
              enough to have the baby.

                       clear
              so let's do it.

                      thomas
                    (realization)
             shit, i don't have her number. she
             was never interviewed. she took
             off right after the accident.

                      kimberly
             how are we going to find her?
             there must be thousands of white
             vans in this state.

                      thomas
             hey, i'm a police officer,
             remember?
