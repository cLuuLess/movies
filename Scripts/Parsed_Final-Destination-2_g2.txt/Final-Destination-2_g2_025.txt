ext. kimberly's house - day

as kimberly pulls into her driveway, she's surprised to see a strange
car parked there. then --

thomas, wearing street clothes, peers through the front window of the
house. he guiltily backs away as kimberly gets out.


                       thomas
              i tried calling last night but your
              father --

                       kimberly
              evan shaeffer's dead.

thoma s nods and leans against the large glass windows that reflect
the sky behind them.


                       thomas
              i know. i've gotten calls all
              morning from everyone who was on
              the onramp. we're all meeting at
              my apartment tonight.

                       kimberly
              then you believe all this?? that
              death is working off a list?

thomas hesitates before answering.


                       thomas
              i didn't. until i was dispatched
              to clean up one of the flight 180
              survivors.

                       kimberly
              clean up? i don't...

suddenly through the reflection of the window glass, kimberly sees
hundreds of pigeons dive bomb her at once!

like a scene out of the birds, kimberly must duck and cover as the
pigeons assault her from every angle.

but when kimberly turns away from the reflection, toward the actual
pigeons, they're gone. all in her head.


                       ki mberly
              did you see that??

thomas, concerned for her, saw nothing.


                       kimberly
              pigeons... it's a sign! if clear's
              right about the order, then nora
              and tim are going to be attacke d by
              pigeons!

                       thomas
              i'm not following you --

                       kimberly
              they're next on the list.   we have
              to find them.
