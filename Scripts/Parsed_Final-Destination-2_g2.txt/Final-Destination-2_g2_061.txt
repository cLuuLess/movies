int. winding roads - day

deputy steve speeds the white van up the narrow winding road.
isabella breathes lamaze- style through intense pain.

                       isabella
              promise me...i won't have the

              baby...in this van.

speeding up the incline, steve tries to speed around a volkswagon
beetle, but cars scream by in the opposite direction.

                       isabella
              get around it!!!

steve leans on the horn and stomps the gas, dangerously riding the
shoulder around the beetle.

way ahead of the beetle, on the left side, is a lake.
