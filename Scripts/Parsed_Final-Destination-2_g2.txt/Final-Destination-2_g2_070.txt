ext. westchester county - moments later

kimberly drives thomas and clear in the gibbons' truck. all are numb.

                      thomas
                    (buckling up)
             hurry up. there's no time.   she's
             about to give birth.

kimberly unbuckles her seatbelt and floors it.

                      clear

             what are you doing?     you're going
             to kill us!

                      kimberly
             no. if anyone dies from a crash
             now, it'll be me. but i can't die
             if eugene and isabella are still
             alive. i'm last on death's list.

                      clear
             are you crazy? what makes you
             think you'd survive?

                      kimberly
             what happened when eugene tried to
             kill himself out of turn?

                      clear
                    (considering)
             six duds in a row.

                      kimberly
             and when it was rory's turn to die,
             and thomas was in the way?

                      thomas
             that branch fell and saved my life.
             you're right, death's maintaining
             the order.

                       kimberly
              let's pray that isabella's still
              alive.

the truck speeds into the horizon.
