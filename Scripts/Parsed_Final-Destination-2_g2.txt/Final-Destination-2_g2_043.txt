int. a/v room - police station - later

thomas works a vcr, scanning backwards through the video footage from
the patrol car camera. we see the suv's explosive collision with the
jack- knifed semi. kimberly is taken by surprise by the sight of the
crash.

                       kimberly
              oh god...

thomas sees kimberly and quickly flicks off the monitor.

                       thomas
              i, uh...sorry.

kimberly notices clear watching her and toughens up. she forces back
the tears and qui ckly wipes the rest away.

                      kimberly
             i know, i know. we need my eyes.

clear sits beside kimberly.

                      clear
             it's all right.    i'll take watch.

kimberly looks grateful, and a moment passes between them, but she's
already buried the need to cry.

                       kimberly
              i'm okay. just caught me by
              surprise. put it back on.

clear does, watching the cars seemingly pass in reverse.

                       clear
              make sure all these people will be
              at the meeting tonight.

                       thomas
              taken care of.

the monitor

back, back, back until the patrol car slowly creeps backwards down
the onramp.

                       kimberly
              there it is.

                        thomas
              got it.

thomas hits play and we see footage from the patrol car cruising past
the white van. a clean shot of the license plate. jackpot.

as thomas slides his chair to a data base and types in the plate
number, the pause function dislodges, slowly advancing the tape frame
by frame.

                       clear
              i don't get it. why is everything
              happening so fast? after flight
              180. a month went by before anyone
              died. and now five people are dead
              in less than a day.

thomas' computer screen finally fills with information.

                       thomas
              here we go. the vehicle's a
              delivery van registered to jorge
              and isabella cruz. and christ,
              there's almost a dozen domestic
              disturbance complaints on these
              two.

                       clear
              we need to hurry.

they all get up and leave.

ominously, the monitor shows the next vehicle creeping behind nora's
pacer - a white van!
