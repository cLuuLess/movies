ext. kimberly's neighborhood - day

kimberly burroughs, 19, puts a folded aaa map in her mouth. she opens
the back of a red nissan suv, and pla ces her duffel bag inside.

that done, she lets the map drop from her mouth, catches it in her
free hand and turns to hug her father, mr. burroughs.


                        kimberly
               thanks, dad. i'll call you.

                      mr. bu rroughs
             you have everything, kimberly?
             credit card, cell phone, aaa card?

                      kimberly
             relax, dad. it's daytona, not
             mongolia.

                       mr. burroughs
                     (playful)
             fix -a-flat? road flares?
             sunblock? mace?

                      shaina (o.s.)
             condoms, handcuffs, lube?

kimberly and mr. burroughs turn to see --

shaina, 19, tall leggy brunette. tan, tight tube top revealing her
pierced navel, kimberly's best friend. she walks up the driveway with
her bags.


                      shaina
             just kidding, mr. b. don't worry,
             i'll keep an eye on her.

                       mr. burroughs
                     (sarcastic)
             oh, that makes me feel a lot
             better.

shaina throws her bags in, shuts the back and climbs in the suv.
kimberly hugs her dad, kissing him on the cheek.


                      kimberly
             i know this is the first time we've
             been apart since. but everything's
             gonna be okay.

                      mr. burroughs
             i know, honey. i just --

kimberly hugs him tighter. cutting him off.


                      mr. burroughs
             your mother would have been so
             proud of the way you've handled
             yourself through all of this...

                      kimberly
                    (softly)
             i know, dad.

                       shaina (o.s.)
              hello, the guys are waiting!

kimberly gives him a quick kiss, jumps behind the wheel, starts the
car and pulls away as shaina cranks up the stereo.


                        mr. burroughs
               buckle up!

mr. burroughs waves as the girls roar off. as he looks down he spots
an oil stain left by kimberly's suv. as he drags his shoe across the
stain, a slight breeze blows past his face.

camera pushes in as a look of concern crosses his face.
