int. clear's padded room - continuous

reveal clear rivers

while still beautiful, this young woman bears few traces of her
former self. her eyes dart around suspiciously, maddened by chronic
paranoia. her hair is patchy, her eyes dark and haunted. bordering on
savage. her movements are fidgety, erratic, always distracted by
something unseen.


                      kimberly
             clear rivers?

clear looks kimberly up and down and steps back, allowing her inside
her inner sanctum. a mattress on the floor, a plastic bottle of
water, some paperbacks and a bedpan.

kimberly's jaw drops when she sees the far wall: a shrine to flight
180. the wall is papered with art icles about all the survivors (as
seen in the opening title montage).

the door slams. kimberly jumps.


                      clear
             kimberly burroughs, eh?    what do
             you want?

                      kimberly
             i thought...i thought you might be
             able to help me.

                      clear
                    (snicker)
             yeah, how?

                      kimberly
             i had a premonition about the route
             18 pile up. .. i saved some people.
             and now i think death is after me.

                      clear
             nice work. maybe if you're real
             lucky, you'll wind up in here with
             me.
                    (gives kimberly the once
                         over)
             but i doubt you'll survive that
             long.

kimberly flinches.


                      kimberly
             it's not just about me. someone i
             saved died last night in a freak
             accident. what if the others are
             in danger, too?

                      clear
             well, if you put them on the list,
             they're already tits up.

                      kimberly
             what list?

                       clear
              death's list. the precise order
              you're going to die in.

clear's eyes bore into a terrified kimberly's.


                      clear
             the survivors of flight 180 died in
             the exact order they were
             originally meant to die in the
             plane crash. that was death's
             original design.

                      kimberly
                    (sudden realization)
             exact order? then i'm next! i was
             meant to die with my friends, so
             i'm next!

clear backs away from kimberly as if she were lethal, then stops
short.


                      clear
             but you said someone else died last
             night. that means death skipped
             past you. someone must have
             intervened.
                    (off kimberly's confusion)
             sometime yesterday you must have
             nearly died, but someone saved you.

kimberly nods, recalling the events.


                      kimberly
             officer burke pulled me away from
             the crash that killed my friends.

                      clear
             congratufuckinglations. that makes
             you last to go. but don't worry,
             once the others are dead, it'll
             come back for you. always does.

                      kimberly
             that still doesn't make sense. you
             said you die in the same order you
             were originally meant to. but evan
             shaeffer died last in my
             premonition, not first.

clear seems very disturbed by that.


                        clear
               it's moving backwards?    are you
               sure?

kimberly reluctantly strains to remember something...

hard cut to:

the final moments of the pile up

nora's pacer folds like an accordion, then explodes, followed by evan
screaming in the trans am, which gets creamed by the semi!

back to:

kimberly, shaken, does the math.


                        kimberly
               yes. in my premonition that nora
               woman and her kid died first, then
               evan and then...my friends.

clear is oblivious when kimberly breaks into silent sobs.


                        clear
               backwards...that's new.

clear sees kimberly crying and softens.


                        clear
               that's good. get all your tears
               out now, you'll need your eyes.
                      (off kimberly's confusion)
               for the signs.

                        kimberly
               signs?

                        clear
               if you have the same power as alex,
               you'll be seeing signs soon. when
               you see anything creepy or ominous,
               an in-your- face irony kinda thing?
               don't ignore it. it usually means
               the difference between life and
               death.

                        kimberly
                      (to herself)
               the songs on the radio.
                      (to clear)
               but wait. i don't understand.       why
               is this even happening to me?

                      clear
             that's what alex used to ask
             himself right up until...

for an instant, we see a gentle side of clear.


                      kimberly
             it's obvious you know what you're
             talking about. you beat it. you
             have to help us.

clear suddenly toughens up, an abrupt mood shift.


                      clear
             i didn't beat it; i hid from it.
             if you were smart you'd put a down
             payment on a burial plot and say
             goodbye to the dog, because what
             little life you have left is over
             as you know it. don't make new
             friends, don't fall in love, and
             don't ever bother trying to save
             others. that's the worst killer of
             them all.

                      kimberly
             how can you say that?    what kind of
             monster are you?

at once, clear, enraged, is in her face, speaking through clenched
teeth.


                       clear
              my family is dead.   my friends are
              dead. and alex...

clear angrily peels a polaroid off the wall and shows it to kimberly.
while we don't see the photo, kimberly's horrified face paints a
gruesome picture on its own.


                      clear
             and yes, that's the blade of a
             fucking ceiling fan in his head.

clear pounds on the door, apparently done with kimberly. a guard
opens the door. kimberly, devastated, turns to leave, then summons
her courage and turns back to clear.


                      kimberly
             know what? i think you're a
             coward. i think you hide out in
             here because you're too damn bitter
             and selfish to care about another

              living soul. in my opinion, you're
              already dead.

kimberly leaves, giving clear something to think about.
