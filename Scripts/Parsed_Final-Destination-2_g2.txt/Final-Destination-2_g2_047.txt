int. thomas' apartment - later

reveal - nora, rory, and kat, mortified, sit on a couch. it's obvious
the bomb's been dropped, reality has set in. clear and kimberly await
their reactions. nora raises a trembling hand.

                        nora
               does anybody have a valium?

kat opens her purse and hands her a blue pill.

                        kat
               you'll want to take --

nora pops it in her mouth.

                        kat
               -- half of that.

nora chews, her eyes half dead from bereavement. across the loft,
thomas paces, phone in hand.

                        thomas
                      (quietly, into phone)
               any word yet on the dodge van?
               damn.

eugene alone seems unafraid. he uses a grabber - a long pole with
movable claw on the end - to open the skylight. when done, he
balances the long pole precariously against the wall.

an ominous breeze enters. clear notices magazine pages blowing over
the desk by the couch.

                      nora
             so that would mean... i'm next.

                      eugene
             nobody's next. this is crazy.
             first death's stalking us and now
             premonitions?

                      kat
             this can't be happening. my
             career's at a peak, i finally met a
             cute guy, i just bought a new
             house...

                      rory
             just shut the fuck up and maybe
             you'll live.

kat's hands ball into fists. the hatred is mutual. clear reaches for
a nearby cardboard box on the desk, noticing magazine pages blowing
over until their weight tips over a pencil holder which spills pens
out. she takes the box to nora.

                      clear
             you're not next, nora. nobody has
             to be next. that's the point.
             last time, we didn't plan. we
             weren't organized. now we can help
             each other.

she reaches into the box and passes out cell phones to nora and the
others.

                      clear
             think what would have happened if
             kimberly had been able to warn you
             with the word pigeons...

nora's head falls. kimberly senses her anguish and takes over.

                      kimberly
             the point is, as long as you know
             what to beware of, you have a
             fighting chance. it can be beaten.
             if i call you and say subway, get
             to a high rise fast. a place where
             no subway could possibly go, get
             it?

everyone nods in understanding. rory fidgets, sniffling, then pounds
the table in frustration. startling kat.

                      rory
             why the hell did i ever get on
             route 18 in the first place?
             that's me, mr. dumb fucking luck.

clear, very alert, looks at the tipped pencil holder. pens roll
toward the end of the desk, toward a large white pages directory
which hangs precariously off the edge just so.

                       clear
              anyone read today's paper?   the
              article on evan shaeffer?

no one says a word.

                      clear
             the only reason he was on route 18
             was because he own the lottery and
             had to collect the winnings.

                       rory
              that lucky bastard.

                      clear
             what about the rest of you?
             kimberly, you were driving to
             daytona. was route 18 your first
             choice?

                      kimberly
             the new freeway was faster, but
             route 18 was the way my mom used to
             take, so...

they take turns going around the room.

                      thomas
             route 18 is drake's assignment, but
             he called in sick so i got...
                    (blanches)
             drake's never sick.

                       kat
              i was my first day of jury duty.

                      eugene
             jury duty? that's randomly
             selected by social security
             numbers.

                      clear
             random, sure.

                      eugene
             what, you think death planned for
             each of us to die in the pile up
             weeks ago? you're nuts.

clear fumes. rory looks ill and reaches into his wallet.

                      rory
             last july i dialed a wrong number
             and got a radio station by
             accident. they asked me what
             number means "good luck" in jewish.

                       kat
              eighteen. and it's "hebrew".

                       rory
              anyway, i guessed it right and won
              these.

rory holds up two yankee tickets.

                       rory
              the best way to get to yankee
              stadium is route 18.

                       kimberly
              i don't know what's weirder, the
              dialing a wrong number part or that
              death would set you up nine months
              in advance.

                       thomas
                     (realization)
              whoa, nine months?

                       kimberly
              are you thinking what i'm thinking?
