int. thomas' apartment - continuous

the nervous group finishes safe-proofing the apartment.

rory, standing on the couch, pulls a police academy diploma off the
wall - and slips - stumbling backwards into the closet.

staggering, he accidentally knocks some coat hangars and a volleyball
trophy from the high shelf to the floor.

thomas whips around and sees that rory's not hurt. he then lowers his
gaze and sees --

the figurine of a volleyball trophy is framed by a tangled jumble of
wire coat hangars. suddenly, streetlight flickers on for the evening.
oddly, it only illuminates the trophy/hangar array.

from rory's vantage point, it looks like a surreal sculpture of a man
with hooks emanating from his body. the sodium vapor lamp casts an
ominous glow around the image.

                      rory
             ...man with hooks. i see a man
             with hooks. someone?!?!

the others look over, trying to see what he does.

                      thomas
                    (unsure)
             i kinda see it, yeah. so...nora's
             going to be killed by a man with
             hooks?

kimberly and clear stare at the volleyball trophy - the street lamp
ominously flickers out and dies.

everyone looks around for a hesitant beat, then thomas picks up his
cell phone. clear first walks, then runs out the door.
