clear, kimberly and thomas dash toward the main desk.

                       clear
              isabella cruz.    what room's she in?

                       receptionist
              i'm sorry, i can't give out that
              info unless you're a relative.

                       clear
              i'm her sister.

the receptionist eyes her dubiously.

                      receptionist
             i'll have to see your id, ms. cruz.

clear vaults over the counter, straight-arms the receptionist and
seizes the computer. thomas and kimberly look on, stunned.

                      clear
             delivery rooms are downstairs.
             i'll find eugene and catch up with
             you.

kimberly and thomas hurry to the elevator banks...then reconsider and
enter the stairwell.
