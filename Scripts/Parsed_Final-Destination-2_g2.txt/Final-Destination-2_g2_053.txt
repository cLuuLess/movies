int. elevator - continuous

eugene stares blankly at the concave mirror in the upper corner. he's
disturbed by the warped reflection of:

the gaunt man leans closer to nora's hair and as the doors finally
close, he leans over and smells it. creepy.

                      eugene
             um, by the way, your shoe's untied.

nora bends down to tie her shoelace (the one that snapped). she tries
tying the long dangling shoelace to the stubby one as eugene's cell
phone vibrates in his hand. startled, he drops it to the floor. then
looks embarrassed.

                      eugene
             probably for you, anyway.

nora picks it up. static crackles. it's hard to make out thomas'
yelling.

                          nora
                 officer burke?   i can't hear...

a beat of confusion, then she slowly turns to see the clawed hooks
and hands of the prosthetic limbs. terror. she freezes.

                      eugene
             what is it? what's wrong?

but nora's too frightened to speak. eugene grabs the phone, hearing
unintelligible static.

intercut clear

as she frantically hits the elevator button. when it fails to come,
she runs downstairs.
