int. hospital corridor - continuous

a hospital administrator briskly strides up to the orderly.

                      administrator
             what are you doing? the henzels
             are still waiting for you in the
             children's ward --

the orderly smacks his forehead - shit. totally forgot.

                      orderly
             right, right, right.     gregory's big
             day.

                      administrator
             and mrs. dempsey in hydrotherapy
             can't feel her legs.

the orderly, nodding rapidly, is halfway down the hall by now. the
administrator shakes his head in disgust and walks past.

the huge cart. which now blocks the door on eugene's room.
