int. crematorium

oddly there is no one there. as they enter, passing the furnace, a
momentary whoosh of flames startles them all!

they jump back - bumping right into:

mr. bludworth, the dark, sinister mortician from fd1, who has
inexplicably appear behind them.

                       mortician
              hello, clear. i've been keeping an
              eye out for you.

the mortician rolls a metal gurney carrying evan's eyeless body
toward the firing oven. kimberly and thomas are scared.

                       kimberly
              oh my god. that's evan shaeffer.

clear, however, seems to expect nothing less.

                       mortician
              come to... pick my brain?

the mortician slides a gleaming set of medical pliers into evan's
mouth. and yanks out a gold tooth. kimberly recoils as he discards
the bloody tooth on a metal tray.

                      mortician
                    (to kimberly)
             flesh and bone require 1,600
             degrees for cremation. gold,
             prosthetics and other metals must
             be removed before the final --

                       clear
                     (not falling for this
                          again)
             just a simple question and we'll
             leave you alone with your new
             friend.

the mortician grins; he likes the new clear. he crosses the room and
hits a lever. ka- chunk! the oven begins to blaze.

                      mortician
             fire away.

                      clear
             how do you cheat death once and for
             all?

the mortician, recrossing the room, passes kimberly and stoops down
to sniff, no inhale, a terrified kimberly's essence.

                        mortician
              dead.   but still fresh.

kimberly shudders as the mortician moves back to evan's body. clear
has had about enough.

                      clear
                    (to the mortician)
             look, we drove a long way to get
             here. so if you happen to know how
             to get this death monkey off our
             backs, it sure would be swell if
             you told us.

the mortician now clamps the pliers around evan's nipple ring.

                       mortician
              for what purpose? you seek a back
              way out of a room with but one
              door. you can't cheat death; there

              are no escapes.

                       clear
              bullshit. you told me death has a
              distinct design, a blueprint,
              unalterable. but alex and i
              cheated death not once, but dozens
              of times. if the design is flawed,
              it can be beaten.

a sick smile crosses the mortician's lips. he yanks the nipple ring
off! kimberly looks on both horrified and awed when clear doesn't
flinch back from the pliers, where a bloody nub dangles.

                       mortician
              such fire in you now. people are
              always most alive just before they
              die. don't you think?

clear steps back from him, hate flashing in her eyes.

                       clear
              it can be beaten.   and you know it.

creeeaaak -slam! the mortician rolls evan's body into the oven.

                        mortician
              some say that there is a balance to
              everything. an equilibrium that is
              the connective tissue of the
              universe. they say that for every
              lif e there is a death, and for
              every death a life...

his words hang in the air. an ominous breeze enters.

                        mortician
              solus novus anima licet evinco
              mortis; only new life can defeat
              death.
                     (off their confusion)
              the list of life is forever set by
              the divine plan, the guiding hand
              that plots the course of the
              universe, down to its tiniest
              element s.

thomas looks to clear; what's he talking about? the mortician focuses
on kimberly as if the others had ceased to exist.

                       mortician
              the list accounts for every life;
              from the dawn of man to the great
              apocalypse. but the introduction
              of life that was not meant to be, a
              soul forbidden to roam the earth,
              that could invalidate death's list,
              shatter its very existence.

evan's other eye pops , startling thomas and kimberly.

                       thomas
              what the hell does that mean?

                       mortician
                     (with finality)
              to figure that out you'll have to
              follow the sign s.

the mortician grabs kimberly.

                       mortician
              but be warned. to disrupt the
              grand design is to unravel the
              tapestry of the universe. when you
              pull all the threads apart, you may
              find yourself hanging from them.

the mortician finally lets kimberly go.

                       clear
              one last question. why is death
              working backwards this time?

the mortician glances at his watch - evan's bran d new rolex.

                       mortician
                     (shakes head; a sick
                          smile)
              sorry, time's up.
