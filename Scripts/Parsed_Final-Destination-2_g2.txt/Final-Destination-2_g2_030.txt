int. dentist office - continuous

tim looks petrified as dr. lees unveils a tray full of pics, carvers
and extracting forceps.

the ka-chung of construction outside makes it im possible to
concentrate, but, hands trembling slightly, dr. lees picks up a pic
and mirror and starts examining tim's mouth. cu of pic gently
prodding tim's teeth.

                      dr. lees (o.s.)
             i'm a little disappointed, tim.
             does your mom know you've been
             smoking?

tim groans "uh-uh", then suddenly flinches.

                      dr. lees (o.s.)
             yeah, that'll have to be filled.

a bang from the window startles dr. lees. his hand jerks, but luckily
the pic was removed from tim's mouth.

dr. lees whips around in time to see a pigeon flutter away from the
window.

                     dr. lees
             jesus. every day at the same damn
             time. now this'll only sting for a
             moment.

dr. lees picks up a large syringe and moves it toward tim's open
mouth.

                       dr. lees
              open big. wiiiiider...

tim's eyes radiate fear. the mouth opens. reluctantly. tim nervously
eyes the window as the needle enters...

angle on

needle heading toward his gumline --

bang! another pigeon takes a header into the reflection. dr. lees'
hand jerks, nearly jabbing tim's tongue. tim squirms violently. dr.
lees looks towards the window angrily.

                      dr. lees
             how the hell do they expect me
             to... would you rather have the
             laughing gas?

tim nods his head ferociously.

                         dr. lees
             jean?     i need you in here.
                       (waits)
             jean??!
