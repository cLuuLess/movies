int. evan's stairwell - day

a dingy singly light bulb illuminates the narrow stairwell. evan
appears in the darkness, carrying a brand new television with some
packages on top. he's unable to s ee the long rickety stairwell he
climbs.

the stairs are littered with chinese take out menus and a tonka truck
apparently left by some kids.

as evan slowly climbs the staircase, a fat man comes down, forcing
evan to lean against -

the railing - which creaks and bends. after the fat man passes, evan
slowly continues up again, tearing his shirt on a nail.


                      evan
             motherfucker.

a heating duct clicks on. the air blows a tonka truck slowly toward
the center of the staircase, directly in evan's path - but evan just
misses it!

he continues past more toys, nearing the top stair -

the airduct coughs, sending menus fluttering toward evan's feet and
he slips on them! he juggles the tv - but ultimately rights himself
and continues down the hallway.
