int. kitchen - day

kimberly sits at the table. mr. burroughs sets down a cup of tea
before her. both are shaken.


                      kimberly
             i know it's crazy, but i'm really
             scared for the others. i've got
             this terrible feeling.

                      mr. burroughs
             what feeling?

                      kimberly
             that it's not over yet.

she picks up the tea, it clatters in her trembling hands.


                       mr. burroughs
             don 't worry. everything will be
             fine, you'll see.
