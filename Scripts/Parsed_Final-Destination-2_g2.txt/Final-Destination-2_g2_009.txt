int. a room - continuous

kimberly, nora, tim, kat, eugene and rory now seem affected by what
they've heard.


                       kat

               what if it's true? what if it's
               happening all over again?

the fluorescent light above flickers ominously. nora, disturbed,
stands up in a huff, grabbing tim's arm.


                        nora
               you're all certifiable, you know
               that? i can't believe i've been
               listening to this crap. come on,
               tim, let's go outside.

                        tim
               jeez, mom, stop trippin'.

                        eugene
               look lady, we're just yankin' your
               chain.

                        rory
               yeah, you're acting like we all
               just got the diff'rent strokes
               curse or something.

eugene and rory burst out laughin g. nora shakes her head, disgusted.


                        nora
               what's wrong with you people?

nora pulls a reluctant tim out of the room. as she opens the door,
the others watch detective suby and thomas appear from nowhere to
calm her down . when the door swings shut, an awkward silence.
suddenly, the door opens again and thomas leads mr. burroughs inside.
mr. burroughs sees kimberly and chokes back tears.


                        mr. burroughs
               kimberly...

the sight of her fath er crying is enough to make kimberly's own dam
burst. she rushes over to him and buries her head in his chest,
sobbing.


                        mr. burroughs
               can i take her home?

thomas nods.


                        detective suby
               sure, you can all go.

by now, the fluorescent light flickers out of control. when rory, kat
and eugene stand up, thomas looks helpless.

                      kat
             first i'm stuck with jury duty, now
             this nonsense.

                      rory
             yeah, i hate to love and leave ya,
             but i've been over this x-files
             shit since the sixth season.

as thomas watches them file out, the fluorescent light pops. then
darkness.
