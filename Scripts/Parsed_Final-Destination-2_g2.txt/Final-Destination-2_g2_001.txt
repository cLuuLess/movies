int. dark room - night

titles over:

a padded wall is papered with newspaper clippings that date back to
the early 1900s:

"local fowler brothers lose $35 tickets to board titanic" appears
over "fowler brothers killed in coal mine mishap." another series of
articles reads, "jewish professor denied admittance to hindenburg"
and "professor rabinowitz killed in avalanche." etc...

continuing along the wall, the newspaper articles all focus on the
fates of the original survivors of the flight 180 crash.

we dissolve between the various headlines depicting the gruesome
deaths of tod, terry, ms. lewton, billy hitchcock, carter and alex
browning.

also in the mix are various crime scene photos of the deaths.

decapitated torsos, crushed, mangled bodies, the charred remains of
another and the face- down body of alex browning.

maps line the walls as well, pinpointing the locations of numerous
deaths, perhaps seeking a pattern. charts that timeline bizarre
deaths, seating charts of downed aircraft, etc...

latex -gloved hands tear out the last article, apply fun- tack to its
corners and place it in the center of all the others:

a remembrance for the victims of flight 180

friday marks one year anniversary.
