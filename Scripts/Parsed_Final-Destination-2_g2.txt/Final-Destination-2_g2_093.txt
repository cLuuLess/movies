int. hospital corridor - continuous

relaxed and invigorated, kimberly and thomas giddily exit the
delivery room as clear runs up to them.

                      clear
             a guard grabbed me before i could
             find eugene.

                      thomas
             don't sweat it.   it's over.

                      clear
             she had the baby?

                      kimberly
             new life defeats death. we've done
             it. death has to rewrite the list.
             we're safe.

steve watches, confused, as clear whoops with delight and hugs the
others.
clear laughs with a relief that seems completely foreign to her.
kimberly laughs with her, then is suddenly rocked by a vision --

hard cut to:

unkown pov

looking up a the eeg machine. flatlined!

                        thomas (o.s.)
               kimberly! are you okay?!
