int. private room - day

wiping frame, a nurse enters a room and reads a clipboard on an
unseen patient's bed.

reveal eugene lying in a hospital bed, wired to the latest medical
hardware. nearby, a respirator plunges up and do wn, the respirator
tube snaking down eugene's throat.

the nurse's hand reaches down to eugene's neck...

eugene winces when the nurse gives the tube a friendly little shake
to check if it's stable.

                       nurse

              sorry. can you feel that in your
              trachea?

eugene rolls his eyes. stupid question.

                       nurse
              quite complaining. i got burnt
              babies in the children's ward
              braver than you.

she sticks an electri c thermometer in his ear. eugene opens his mouth
as if to speak.

                       nurse
              don't bother. you won't be talking
              for at least a month. think you
              can handle that, jabberjaw?

eugene looks ready to cry. the nurse sits on the bed, jarring eugene
enough to make him wince again.

                       nurse
              don't worry. everyone learns to
              love me once they get used to my
              sense of humor, okay?

eugene looks grat eful to see a humane side to this creature.
