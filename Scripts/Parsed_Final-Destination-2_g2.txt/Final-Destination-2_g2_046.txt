int. thomas' apartment building - night

rory follows some people into the elevator. the elevator doors close
on his shoe -- trapping rory in an awkward position.

one man frantically pushes the doors open button to no avail.
finally, as the elevator rises, rory yanks his foot free.

                        man
               jesus christ. i wrote to
               management two weeks ago about
               these friggin' bumpers.

rory bends down and inspects his shoe.

                        rory
               damn, is that dogshit?

rory briefly holds the shoe too close to the man's face - see? -
before disgustedly slipping it back on.

ding. the doors open. the man hurries out and the elevator doors
close on rory's smirking face.

hard cut to:
