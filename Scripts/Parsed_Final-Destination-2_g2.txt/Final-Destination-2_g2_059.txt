int. sheriff's station - day

isabella, pissed, is in a holding tank. small town deputy steve
adams, 30's, cleans his gun in her direction.

                         isabella
                what do you mean "grand theft
                auto?" this is insane.

                          steve
                hopefully the district judge can
                straighten it all out by monday
                mor ning.

                         isabella
                       (figures it out)
                jorge. when i get out of here i'm
                going to sue his cheating ass off.

as she fumes, a rivulet of water streaks down her leg.

                          is abella
                 oh my god.

steve, at first confused, sees the water and gasps.

                         steve
                are you kidding me?!   oh, man.

he rushes across the room, pulls a lever, unlocking the cell.

                         steve
              c'mon.    let's go.

as steve throws on his jacket, we reveal its prominent emblem:
greenwood lake sheriff department.
