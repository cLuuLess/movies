int. private room - day

the oxygen hose hisses, but is drowned out by the volume of the tv.
eugene's eyes dart frantically as a blaring fast food commercial
ends. the n, a news report comes on. the banner:

route 18 tragedy

footage showing grieving families, wreaths on doors, yellow ribbons,
and emergency crews pulling wreckage apart, dissolve together over:

                       anchor    woman (o.s.)
             mor e tears were    shed this morning
             in the wake of     yesterday's tragedy
             that rocked the     tri -state area...

suddenly, the frayed electric cord of eugene's tv begins sparking.
the sound drops out, the picture sputters.

eugene goes white with terror. he looks back to --

the broken oxygen tube. hissing softly. the beeps of the eeg machine
frantically increase. eugene reaches for the nurse call switch.
mockingly out of reach by mere millimeters.
