int. mental ward - day

a physician in a lab coat leads a nervous kimberly down the center of
a long corridor. the physician consults a clipboard.


                      physician
             ...at the request of the patient,
             you are to relinquish any sharp
             objects such as nail files,
             pencils, pens, safety pins, bobby
             pins, no matches, lighters, belts,
             belt buckles, earrings, chokers,
             shoelaces...

kimberly watches carefully as the physician comes to a door and
punches "4514" into the electronic lock. they continue down another
corridor.

lights flicker,patients cackle and moan in the b.g.


                      physician
             ...paper clips, watches, food,
             drinks, keys, poisons, pills and
             medications.
                    (looks at kimberly)
             you have a cell phone on you?

kimberly nods, hands it over.


                       physician
              then i think we're all done.

they arrive at a door to a padded room. the physician punches in
another code.


                      kimberly
             wait. is she...dangerous or
             something?

                      physician
             no honey, but she expects you are.

                      kimberly
             jesus, how long are you going to
             keep her locked up this way?

                      physician
             depends on her, i guess.   she's
             voluntary.

the door hisses open.
