int. private room - day

angle on

oxygen valve. pan over and down to

eugene tries to watch a news flash of his accident on the tv across
the room, but a bulky orderly blocks his view.

                      anchor man (o.s.)
             ...ironically impaled through the
             head as a result of an emergency
             airbag deploying.

as eugene shudders with dread, the orderly pushes a huge cart in
front of him, again obscuring his view. eugene frantically pantomimes
writing.

                       orderly
              need a pen? sure. if you like,
              i'll bring crosswords for you, too.

eugene tries nodding his thanks, but the tube in his throat hampers
his movement.

                       anchor woman (o.s.)
              ...police have speculated that one
              of the deaths may have been

              narcotics related and urge children
              to stay away from d rugs.

finally, the orderly pushes the cart away, revealing the tv. an
anchor man taps his pages on the desktop.

                      anchor man
             good advice, sue. and stay in
             school. up next, johnny showers
             has the weather...

a weatherman dressed as a frog points out cloud formations.

eugene, tormented, stares at the screen as the orderly begins pushing
the huge cart out of the room.

the sound of a skidding car fills the room. it comes from the tv
which shows a psa featuring crash test dummies.

                       orderly
              jeez, it's freezing in here.

the orderly flicks the thermostat and one by one, vents close just
below the ceiling.

eugene's eyes fill with terror - he knows something's wrong.

angle on oxygen hose -

bursting. it hisses softly. we follow the oblivious orderly out of
the room.
