int. thomas' apartment building - continuous

the elevator finally comes. eugene and nora get inside, standing in
front of a gaunt looking man holding a cardboard box full of
prosthetic limbs.

muzak plays ac/dc's highway to hell.

                      eugene
             going down, right?

the gaunt man says nothing. the doors close.
