angle on

woman's n ike shoe on a down-moving escalator. reveal nora taking her
son tim to a dentist's office. the shoelace snags on a bolt of one of
the steel side panels, untying it...

                       tim
                     (mischievous smile)
              you think the tooth fairy's gonna
              come tonight? i'm thinkin' like
              fifteen bucks.

                       nora
              nice try, kiddo.

tim smiles, then winces from the pain in his mouth.

the dangling shoelace heads straight for the escalator grate. it gets
swallowed up. as tim steps off, nora trips forward. her caught
sneaker is pulled tighter into the innards of the metal staircase.

                       tim
              mom!

tim watches helplessly as nora reaches down, tug ging at her sneaker,
fear mounting. tim also grabs her sneaker and yanks. finally, the
shoelace snaps, and nora's free again.

                       tim
              you okay?

nora puts on a brave face and begins tying one long shoelace to the
stubby one.

                       nora
              sure hon. i'm fine.   let's shake
              it, we're late.

tim nods. the wind picks up as they continue past a --

construction crew

who apply industrial suction cups to large, thick sheets of plated
glass .

tim stares in childlike fascination as they pass jackhammers, a
cement mixer, and an excavator.
