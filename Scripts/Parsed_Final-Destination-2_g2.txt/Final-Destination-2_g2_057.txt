kat's ford expedition winds its way through rural new york.

a sports car speeds past on the left, then as it pulls in front of
the exped ition, its slipstream sucks over some debris from the
shoulder; a thin metal piece of trim, which bounces in front of kat's
expedition's left front tire.

cu kat's wheel well -- the metal trim is shot upward into the wheel
well, where it lodges firmly, its sharp metal edge grinding against
the rubber.

inside the car

kat drives, thomas reading directions in the shotgun seat. kimberly,
eugene and rory ride in back. in the cargo area, clear scans out the
rear window for danger.

rory fidgets.

                         rory
                is this safe, guys? i mean,
                someone in this car is about to get
                whacked. do the rest of us really
                feel like sitting next to him?
                       (off kat's glare)
                or her. hopefully her.

an uncomfortable beat.

                         thomas
                guys, let's not panic.   isabella's
                safe.

                          kimberly
                 how do you know?

                         thomas
                you said she was going to drive
                into a lake. how can she when
                she's in protective custody?
