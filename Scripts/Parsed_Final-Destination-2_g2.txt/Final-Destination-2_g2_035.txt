ext. kimberly's house - day

thomas' car turns into the driveway and parks. kimberly holds up her
hand and watches it tremble.

                        kimberly
               it's happening again.   it's fucking

              happening again. i hoped we'd get
              there and they'd be okay, that
              clear rivers was full of shit and
              evan's death was just a freak
              accident...

thomas kills the engine to listen.

                       kimberly
              but we're all going to die. we
              can't stop it. it's just a matter
              of time. i'm so scared.

thomas takes her hand and squeeze s it reassuringly.

                       thomas
              i am too. but you can use that
              fear. it'll sharpen your
              instincts. keep you alert fro
              signs. it's the only way you'll be
              able to sav e the others...and me.

kimberly, seeming overwhelmed, pulls her hand back. thomas senses
he's losing her, and softens her approach.

                       thomas
              i know you didn't ask for any of
              this, kimberly. but i don't think
              you have it in you to quit either.

kimberly stares straight ahead, the weight of the world sinking in.
bang! a startling pound on the roof of thomas' car.

kimberly jumps, then spins around to see:

clear rivers - standing in the driveway. a determined, powerful
presence. kimberly exits the car. a moment where kimberly and clear
stare each other down.

                       kimberly
              clear/thomas. thomas/clear.

clear nods absently to thomas, still focused on kimberly.

                       kimberly
                     (bitter)
              the second one just dies.   a 16
              year old kid.

                       clear
                     (nods; a faint trace of
                          guilt)
              i hope you're ready for this.
