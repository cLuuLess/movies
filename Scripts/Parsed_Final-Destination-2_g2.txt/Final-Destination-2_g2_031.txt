int. dentist office - continuous

after a minute, dr. lees angrily switches on two compressors: oxygen
and nitrous oxide.

by now, the no mask has been attached around tim's nose. as tim

                       dr. lees
              open big. wiiiiiider.

excruciating sounds of the drill going through enamel.

intercut kimberly and thomas

racing to the medical complex throughout.

the waiting room

the water trickles into the outlet. the vacuum sparks and dies just

back in dr. lees' office

bang! sfx: broken glass - it sounds like a pigeon finally crashed

angle on fish mobile

spinning from a new breeze. suddenly, a small round puffer fish falls
directly into tim's mouth.

soft, gurgling and choking.
