ext. winding roads

brian gibbons, 15, cheerfully drives a tractor hauling a whoodchipper
across the high crest of the empty road toward a pile of thick
branches.

the tractor unexpectedly stalls in the middle of the road. he tries
the ignition, pumps the gas. nothing...

only by standing on the tractor can brian see the white van speeding
up the hill toward him. he jumps down and frantically tires starting
the tractor. once, twice, nothing.
