int. hospital corridor - back to present

kimberly, on the ground, looks frazzled as she snaps out of her
trance. thomas helps her to her feet.

                        thomas
               are you okay? you just face
               planted!

                        kimberly
               i know how it feels to be dead.

her lips blue, kimberly shivers uncontrollably. clear sees two
security guards round a distant corner and quickly walks the others
toward an emergency loading zone.

                        clear
               what did you see?

                        kimberly
               i was dead. and came back to life.
               an eeg machine. where's eugene?

                        thomas
               but it's over. isabella's baby was
               the key. you saw her die and
               everything, right?

                        kimberly
               i don't...what if i made a mistake?

                        thomas
               impossible. she was on the onramp.

kimberly reluctantly closes her eyes and remembers.

cut to:

previously unseen

moment of the pile-up premonition. a white van in fr ont of kimberly
suddenly slams on its brakes and pulls onto the shoulder.

kimberly screams, swerving around the van just in time to avoid an
accident.

back to:

kimberly, overcome with self- doubt.

                       kimberly
              i'm not sure... i don't think
              isabella was ever destined to die
              in the pile -up.

                       thomas
              then what's the premonition of the
              lake supposed to mean?

                       clear
              can you remember anything about it?

kimberly shuts her eyes, remembering:
