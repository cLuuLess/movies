int. rory's apartment - continuous

it's a party. rory, surrounded by buddies, shakes a triumphant fist
at the television. he whoops with delight, spilling popcorn
everywhere.


                     rory
             whoohoo! you see that shit? right
             there? that's my fuckin' car right
             there! oh god, that's dope.

after high-fiving his peeps, he bends to table level and snorts a
freshly chopped line.


                      anchor man (o.s.)
             in other news, a freak accident
             took the life of a lotto winner.

rory looks up to see the dmv photo of evan. as he takes in the
report, his mood radically shifts. he looks like he's been hit by a
train.

montage

of kimberly, nora, tim, eugene and kat watching. they all take the
news very hard as the footage shows evan's body being carried away by
emt workers. eugene, however, shakes his head sadly but goes back to
grading blue books.

tim's bedroom - later

tim's eyes are glued to the latest stephen king novel. nora peers in.


                      nora
             come on, tim, lights out already.

tim starts at her voice, then reluctantly puts down the book.


                        tim
             mom?

                        nora
             yeah?

                      tim
             you think... you think those guys
             were b.s.-ing us today or what?

nora swallows, trying to seem brave.

                      nora
             oh, please. some people just need
             some serious rewiring, that's all.

but neither of them are convinced.


                      nora
             get some sleep.

nora kisses his forehead and leaves the room. after she leaves, tim
opens his nightstand drawer, pulls out a dusty nightlight and plugs
it in.
