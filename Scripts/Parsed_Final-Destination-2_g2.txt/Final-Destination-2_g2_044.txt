int. cruz house - night

thomas pulls up to an upper-middle class house. thomas, kimberly and
clear get out and start up the unlit path. it's dark, hard to see
where they're going, so they negotiate by feeling the bushes aligning
the walkway.

                      thomas
             let's lay this on her gently now.
             the stress alone could upset the
             pregnancy.

kimberly nods, ever creeping closer to the front door -- when
automatic lights flash from over the garage.

all three freeze for a moment, during which we hear stomping emanate
from within the house, and the lights shut off.

but nothing else happens. no one comes to a door. thomas sighs, and
as if suddenly remembering his status, he walks fearlessly and
purposefully to the front door.

he makes a fist, is about to knock - when the door flings open and a
rottweiler lunges for his throat - only to have its collar snagged at
the last second by its owner -

jorge cruz, late 30's, handsome, cocky. he speaks above rotty's
barking:

                       jorge
             what?

                      thomas
             i'm officer burke.    i'm looking for
             an isabella cruz.

suddenly, with an unexpected fury, jorge screams at his dog.

                      jorge
             shut up!!!

the rottweiler cowers, and jorge shoves it to the floor, where it
lands on its feet and fearfully trots away. jorge's face is once
again pleasant, but it's a thin veneer.

jorge sees clear and kimberly behind thomas and frowns.

                      thomas
             are you jorge cruz?

                        jorge
              maybe.   what's this about?

                       thomas
              may we come in?

                       jorge
             no.   what's this about?

angle on clear - eyeing what appears to be drops of blood on the tile
floor. she takes in what she can see of --

the room

as if a tornado had hit it. wedding photos smashed and torn.
furniture over-turned.

                       thomas
                     (a little stern)
              it's about your wife, isabella.
              now is she here?

jorge's eyes flicker ever -so- involuntarily behind him.

                        jorge
              no.   i'm alone.

but by now, thomas has seen everything clear has and more. he stares
through the house, into a bedroom and sees -

a female foot lying half0buried under the bedspr ead.

                       thomas
              look, pal, it's probably nothing.
              but i need to see --

jorge is already closing the door.

                       jorge
              forget it. you'll need a warrant.
              i know, i'm a lawyer.

clear rushes the door, shoulders it and expertly wriggles past
jorge's grasp.

                        jorge
              stop!!!   you can't go in there!!!

clear tears into the bedroom, grabs the bedspread and throws it to
the floor to reveal a young woman, naked, trembling with fear, takes
a closer look at clear.

                       young woman
              we never meant to hurt you
              isa...you're not isabella!

meanwhile, jorge yells at thomas.

                       jorge
              i'm going to sue your ass!

                       kimberly
              whose blood is that on the floor?

defensively, jorge holds up his arm. freshly cut.

                        jorge
               mine, you idiot. the dog went nuts
               this afternoon. now arrest her!

                        kimberly
               where's isabella? did you finally
               kill her you fucking wife beater?

jorge flinches. it's time to come clean.

                        jorge
               we had a fight. some things got
               broken, the dog went crazy, she
               left me. wouldn't say where she
               was going.

                        thomas
               what was the fight about?

                        jorge
               take a guess.

                        thomas
               does she have a cell phone?   a way
               we can contact her?

                          jorge
               she did.

he eyes a shattered cell phone on the floor.

                        clear
               we're wasting time with this piece
               of shit. let's just get to the
               meeting.

jorge turns to soothe the frightened young woman in the bed.

                        jorge
               hey, when you find her, tell her
               the kid's half mine.

clear mutters something as they exit the house.

                        clear
               we can only pray it doesn't come
               out retarded.

jorge hisses something at the rotty, which charges them and springs!
but thomas slams the door on the frothing dog just in time.

dissolve to:
