int. kimberly's room - continuous

mr. burroughs tucks a still-shaken kimberly into bed. in one of his
hands is a nearly empty glass of scotch.


                      kimberly
             it's okay, dad. i'm not ten
             anymore.

mr. burroughs catches himself being overprotective.


                      mr. burroughs
             i'm sorry. i'm just so happy that
             you're safe.

                       kimberly
              i love you too, dad.     goodnight.

but mr. burroughs isn't ready to leave. he finishes his drink.


                      mr. burroughs
             you know, after your mother died...

kimberly tenses, bracing for the worst.


                      mr. burroughs
             there were so many times i didn't
             think i could last another day. i
             can't even tell you some of the

               things i th ought about.

                        kimberly
               i used to have those feelings, too.
               but that's when i'd think of mom.
               her strength...and courage. and
               i'd pray that maybe i'd grow up to
               be as brave as she was. and the
               bad thoughts would go away.

                        mr. burroughs
                      (choking up)
               i don't know what i'd do if i lost
               you.

mr. burroughs leans over, kisses her forehead and leaves. just as
he's out the door, he braces at the distant sound of a car skidding
out of control. the endless screech is nerve shattering. mr.
burroughs stands frozen, tensing for the inevitable crunch. but there
is none. and he leaves.
