     int. hotel paraiso room - night

     electra is still at the table, staring at the diagrams, in
     another world.

     rath pours a glass of bourbon and sets it in front of her.

                             electra
               this has been the longest day of my
               life.

     rath nods, pouring himself a drink.  electra looks at the
     drink, downs the whole glass.  he refills it.

                             electra
               do you have ulcers?

                             rath
               no.

                             electra
               i think i got one today.

                             rath
               five million dollars will buy a lot
               of rolaids.

     she smiles.  they both gulp down their drinks and he fills
     them again.

                             electra
               what do you suppose he's doing now?

     rath shrugs.  he is no longer looking at her; staring at
     the board, moving his mind into the chess game.

     she watches him and then begins to study it with him, the
     way a child does, almost imitating him.  she does not want
     to be left alone right now.

     she reaches over and moves a white knight.

     he blinks.  his eyes shifting, sorting the possibilities.

     he picks a bishop and counters.

     after another sequence, he takes her bishop and she takes
     his knight.

                             rath
               why did you trade a bishop for a
               knight?

                             electra
               i hate bishops.  they're useless.  i
               like knights.

                             rath
               they're worth less points.

                             electra
               so?

     there is no point in arguing.

     as they continue to play, we begin to hear in the
     distance, the couple in the adjoining suite making very
     vigorous love.

     electra watches rath to see if he hears them.  he shows no
     sign of it, concentrating on the game.

                             electra
               do you hear them?

     he looks up.

                             electra
               listen.

     he hears it.  not interested.

                             electra
               did you think they were newlyweds?

                             rath
               i didn't notice them.

                             electra
               when i first saw them i thought they
               were married.

                             rath
               how do you know they're not?

                             electra
               i went into their room this
               afternoon.

                             rath
               what?

                             electra
               it was no big deal.  i saw them
               leave, i went in.

                             rath
               jesus, if someone had --

                             electra
               nobody ever sees me.   

                             rath
               why in the hell would you take that
               chance?

                             electra
               i heard them last night and it made
               me want to know something about
               them.  i wanted to, so i did.

     rath shakes his head.  in the b.g., the woman is almost
     screaming.

                             electra
               she is married, but not to him.
               another man, much older.  she has
               four kids.  the young guy works for
               her.  and i think she likes kinky
               sex.

                             rath
               thank you.

                             electra
               isn't it interesting though?  i
               mean, look at us, in this room.  or
               yesterday, when we were walking in
               the plaza market.  i mean, we look
               like just another couple.  but what
               are we?  doesn't it seem so crazy?

                             rath
               no.

                             electra
               no?

                             rath
               it's always been that way.  the
               world has always functioned on two
               levels.

                             electra
               i know.  it makes me crazy.

                             rath
               why?

                             electra
               i don't know.  when i was in
               college, i was forced to go to a
               psychiatrist because i was caught
               drilling holes in my dorm room
               floor.

                             rath
               and you were drilling these
               holes...?

                             electra
               so i could watch the girl that lived
               under me.

                             rath
               apparently this doctor was unable to
               cure you.

                             electra
               he told me that my curiosity became
               unnaturally entangled with my sense
               of self-preservation.

                             rath
               did he explain how this happened?

                             electra
               he believed it all went back to one
               night, when as a little girl.  i
               watched my parents have this big
               fight, really big.  i thought my
               mother was going to kill my father.
               then they went into their room and
               made up.  and i watched them make
               love through the keyhole.

     the woman screams a final time in climax.

     electra moves her queen, taking his other knight.

                             rath
               what are you doing?

                             electra
               what?

                             rath
               that's a ridiculous move.

                             electra
               why?

                             rath
               because, i'll take it.

                             electra
               i'm playing white, remember.  you
               can't tell me which pieces to move.
               it doesn't work that way.

     he shrugs and takes her queen, the game continuing.

                             electra
               can i ask you something?

                             rath
               i'm sure you will.

                             electra
               am i attractive?

     this gets his attention.

                             rath
               yes.

                             electra
               are you attracted to me?

                             rath
               yes.

                             electra
               why?

                             rath
               why?  i don't know.

                             electra
               is it a physical thing, or a mental
               thing?

                             rath
               both.

     a good answer.  electra smiles.

                             electra
               is that why you didn't want to talk
               about women before?

                             rath
               i didn't want to complicate the
               situation.

                             electra
               attraction is a complication?

                             rath
               it can be.

                             electra
               it happened to you before?

                             rath
               yes.

                             electra
               who was she?

                             rath
               someone like me, like you.  a pro.

                             electra
               what happened to her?

                             rath
               she was taken.

                             electra
               did you --

                             rath
               no.  i tried to stop it.  i
               couldn't.

                             electra
               was she the only one?

                             rath
               after her, i realized that to
               survive i had to live without...
               it's dangerous to let things become
               complicated.

                             electra
               is this becoming complicated?

                             rath
               i'm not sure that i care anymore.

     he looks up from the game.

                             electra
               were you attracted to me right away?

                             rath
               no.

                             electra
               when did it start?

                             rath
               honestly?

                             electra
               uh-huh.

                             rath
               when i gave you my gun and you
               almost shot me.

                             electra
               maybe you should see a psychiatrist.

                             rath
               why?

                             electra
               that doesn't sound normal.

                             rath
               i'm not normal.

                             electra
               i know.  that's why i'm attracted to
               you.  i mean, you make me nervous.
               you're intimidating.  maybe it's my
               curiosity/self-preservation thing,
               but all i can really think about
               right now is kissing you.

     they rise up from the table, together, knocking over the
     chess game.  the pieces fall to the floor.

     they grab at each other, kissing, both of them hungry,
     aggressive.  they tear at each other's clothes and at
     their own clothes; it has a very awkward sense to it, as
     they become naked in front of each other.  there is
     nothing smooth or fluid about it, which makes it seem very
     real.

     he takes her, lifting her onto the table.

     she scoots and wiggles back, the chess pieces falling out
     of the way.

     she opens her legs and he moves in between them.

                             electra
               i wanted to tell you --

     her breath rushes out, then back in.

                             electra
               my real name is anna.

     he smiles.

                             rath
               martin.

                             electra
               martin.

     her legs wrap up around his hips and he pushes deeper into
     her.

                             electra
               nice to meet you, martin.
