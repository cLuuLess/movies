     int. burned hotel room

     the room has been heavily burned, stained black from
     smoke.  the charred carpet crunches and cracks, as bain
     walks across it to the window.

     as he nears the exterior wall, several floor boards break
     with a brittle snap and he almost falls through.

                             bain
               shit.

     he pulls his leg free.

     outside the window, across the plaza, he sees the bank; a
     perfect site.

     quickly he unzips the bag and lifts out the gun.

     he grabs a magazine and snaps it into place.

     he aims down at the bank's bright white stairs.  a man is
     walking down the steps and bain finds the center of his
     forehead in the cross-hairs of the scope.

     bain makes a gun noise, followed by the sound of a head
     bursting open.

     he giggles.

     leaning against the wall, in the shadows of the window,
     the gun in his lap, he waits.

     time slows to a crawl.

     without taking his eye from the bank, bain rummages
     through his bag and finds a pack of cigarettes.  he pulls
     one out with his lips and lights it.

     taking a deep drag, he lets the smoke slowly leak out and
     drift up into the night.

                                                 dissolve to:

     sun

     white hot.
