     bain has returned to room 1414.  wearing rubber gloves, he
     clicks open a black leather attache and pulls out a can of
     rug cleaner.

     he picks up the phone for room service.

                              bain
               hi.  this is room 1414 --

     behind him, in the bathroom mirror, we see one of the
     japanese men hanging from the shower by his feet.  he is
     naked.

                             bain
               yes, could you send up a pot of
               coffee and my friends are going to
               need some more towels.  thanks.

     he hangs up the phone and walks over to one of the large
     blood stains on the carpet.  he points the rug cleaner at
     the stain covering it with white foam.
