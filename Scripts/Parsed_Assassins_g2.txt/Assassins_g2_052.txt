     int. hotel room

     laying on the bed, in a patch of sunlight, nikita watches
     electra rush about.

     electra grabs the sheet from under the comforter and yanks
     it out.

                             electra
               excuse me, your highness.

     nikita casually walks off the bed.

     electra takes the sheet to the open duct and tears off a
     long piece of duct-tape.
