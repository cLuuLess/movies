     int. electra's apartment

     there is a system set up that is not unlike rath's system;
     all of the same components, though the equipment is
     bigger, more powerful and less portable.

     on a table there is a bank of phones, several cellular.
     electra is talking on one.

                             woman (v.o.)
               electra, they are not paying you to
               sit at home and watch television.

     electra is fiddling with five plastic computer disks; each
     has a microcell trademark and is labeled "back-up."

                             electra
               i wasn't watching television.

                             woman (v.o.)
               the point is, they are paying for
               information.  real information.  not
               tooth paste brands.  not whether he
               wads of folds his toilet paper.  and
               no 16 hours of recorded phone sex.
               you are wasting everyone's time with
               this shit.

                             electra
               i thought it was interesting --

                             woman (v.o.)
               god damnit, electra.  this is not a
               game.  this is business.

                             electra
               right.  in my hands i have five
               back-up disks he made of all of his
               work last night.

                             woman (v.o.)
               jesus!  why didn't you tell me?

                             electra
               i'll make my usual arrangements and
               expect my usual bonus.

                             woman (v.o.)
               electra --

                             electra
               a pleasure doing business with you.

     she hangs up.
