     int. bedroom

     rath stares at the board.  the crying grows louder.  he
     stands and walks to the door.  he starts to knock but
     stops himself.

     like electra with jennifer, rath would like to help, he
     just has no idea how to.  he turns back to the desk, to
     his chess game.
