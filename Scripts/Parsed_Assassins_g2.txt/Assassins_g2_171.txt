     int. bank

     the sun clock reads six o'clock.

     there is no one left in the bank except for employees and
     guards.

     the official is at rath's elbow leading him towards the
     metal gates.

                             official
               we are closed, senor.  thank you for
               banking with us.

     it is happening as it happened ten years ago.  rath knows
     that he is unable to stop it.
