     int. burned hotel room

     there are five cigarette butts ground into the blackened
     window sill, where bain extinguishes another.

                             bain
               what in the fuck are you doing in
               there?

     the room is hot, a streak of sweat up his back and front.
     it is difficult to breathe.

     a man walks out of the bank, wearing a suit similar to
     rath's.  bain's body snaps erect, rifle instantly leveled.

     he sights the man's head, his finger tightening on the
     trigger, but he is not sure it is rath.

     he looks over the scope, looks back.  the man reaches the
     bottom of the stairs.  bain's body sags.

                             bain
               that's not him.  jesus, bain, baby,
               chill the fuck out.

     he takes a deep breath and wipes the sweat from his
     forehead, leaving a smear of black from the charcoal wood.

     he again fumbles through his bag, finding a container of
     bottled water.  he chugs the whole thing.
