     int. hotel suite - night

     the room is dark and still.

     a man is standing at a wall of windows that glow from the
     amber wash of urban light.

     snow is falling, heavy white flakes glittering in the
     city's electric night.

     the man finishes his bourbon, ice clinking in the empty
     glass.  he is slightly drunk and he sways forward until
     his forehead rests against the window.

     in the dim light, we recognize the man as rath.

     outside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for
     christmas.  he watches the snowflakes drift to the
     distant street below.

     he is wondering what it would feel like to let himself
     fall, when there is a knock at the door.

     crossing the room, he opens the door.  backlit by the
     bright hallway light is a woman.  she has already removed
     her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see
     that her dress is very short and very tight.

                             escort (woman)
               hi.  did you call --

                             rath
               yes.  please come in.

     her high heels tap against the tile foyer as she enters
     and he takes her coat.

                             escort
               goodness, it's so dark...

     she reaches for the wall switch but he stops her.

                             rath
               i prefer it like this.

                             escort
               how can a beautiful man like you
               be shy?

     he smiles.

                             rath
               i prefer it, that's all.

     she moves closer to him, the sexual confidence of her
     body radiating like heat.

                             escort
               it's okay, honey.  we can do it
               anyway you want.

     rath is obviously uncomfortable.

                             rath
               would you like a drink?

                             escort
               i'd love one.  whatever you're
               having.

     they move into the room, from a distance, as featureless
     as two shadows.

     she stands at the windows watching the snow-bubble of a
     city night.

                             escort
               beautiful.

     he hands her the drink.  her smile is bright and perfect.

                             escort
               good will towards men.

     their glasses clink as he drains half his drink.  if she
     drinks at all, we can not tell.

                             rath
               why are you working today?

                             escort
               holidays are our busiest days.  no
               one likes to be alone on holidays.
               i know i don't.

     she touches his face, the caress and her expression of
     tenderness seemingly genuine.

                             rath
               you're very good at this aren't
               you?

                             escort
               i think you're supposed to answer
               that question.

     her hand slides down his chest, but before it goes any
     farther rath turns away, returning to the bar.

                             rath
               i know what you expect, but i
               don't want...

     he pours himself another drink.

                             escort
               that's okay, hon, i always expect
               the unexpected.

                             rath
               i called because i just want... i
               need to talk.

     she sits on the couch, her body language changing, as she
     becomes a listener.

                             rath
               i've been thinking about my life,
               about things i have done... what i
               do for a living is in some ways
               similiar to what you do.

     he sits on the other end of the couch, his words thickened
     by the alcohol.

                             rath
               i know that everything has a
               price.  i want you to understand
               that i'm willing to pay.

     he takes out an envelope and puts it between them.  she
     picks it up, glancing inside at a stack of hundred
     dollar bills.

                             escort
               for what?

                             rath
               honesty.

     she puts the envelope down.

                             rath
               i just want to ask you some
               questions.

     uncomfortable, she waits as he searches his drink for
     the right words.

                             rath
               do you ever regret things you've
               done?

                             escort
               everyone regrets something.

                             rath
               but when you finlsh a job,
               afterwards do you think about
               them?

                             escort
               sometimes.

                             rath
               do you think about their wives or
               their families?

                             escort
               no.  they call me, i don't call
               them.  if they didn't call i
               wouldn't exist.

     rath nods.  his next question is barely audible.

                             rath
               do you ever think about starting
               over?

                             escort
               all the time.

                             rath
               can you tell me about it?

     for the first time we really see her take a drink.  she
     closes her eyes.

                             escort
               sometimes i dream that i meet a
               man, this good, honest man and we
               fall in love.  i imagine us living
               on a boat, reading books, sailing
               to places where no one knows who
               we were or cares what we did.

     she opens her eyes and looks at him.

                             rath
               and what if you never meet that
               man?

     she smiles.

                             escort
               then, i'll sail alone.

                             rath
               do you believe that?

                             escort
               are you asking me if i believe in
               another life?

     rath nods.

                             escort
               i have to.

     she finishes her drink.

                             escort
               is that all you want?

                             rath
               yes.

     she picks up the money and stands.

                             rath
               thank you.

                             escort
               anytime.
