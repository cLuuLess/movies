     int. hotel suite - night

     rath is working at the desk.  he is tallying numbers,
     materials, totaling his estimate.

     spread out over the table are several faxed photos of
     the old italian, leevio valli, usually surrounded by
     bodyguards.

     the file details valli's life and his daily routine.  it
     includes:  phone bills, credit card and bank account
     statements, driver license and vehicle registration, the
     real estate listing of his house and even a copy of his
     income tax return.

     satisfied with his figures, rath plugs the phone into the
     modem and makes a call.

     the network comes on-line as the general contractor
     types:

                             contractor/screen
               you're too late, robert.

     rath types.

                             rath/screen
               what?

                             contractor/screen
               the contract was stolen.

     rath stares at the screen.

                             rath/screen
               who?

                             contractor/screen
               a new player.  he's using the name
               nicholai.

     the name hits rath and he sits, unable to breathe.

                             contractor/screen
               you know what must be done.

     the screen goes black as the network shuts down.

     rath looks down at the pile of assembled facts.  he lifts
     a credit card bill on which the name of a restaurant
     appears every friday.  the name of the restaurant has been
     circled in red pen by rath:  "trattoria roma."
