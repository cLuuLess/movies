     int. hotel suite - dawn

     rath is at a desk where he has set up his computer
     office; a cellular phone is plugged into a modem with
     cables winding through a scrambler and then into a fax
     machine and the latest high-powered lap-top computer.

     on the table near the desk, we see the .22, dismantled
     and cleaned, spread out on a white towel.

     he types in a complicated access code sequence, then
     waits, staring at the blank screen.

                             contractor/screen
               where have you been, robert?

                             rath/screen
               sick.  the flu.

                             contractor/screen
               i don't believe you.

                             rath
               i don't give a fuck --

                             rath/screen
               it's true.

                             contractor/screen
               i have been sitting on a contract
               from cleveland for six days
               because of you.

                             rath
               fuck you, fuck cleveland, and fuck
               your contracts --

                             rath/screen
               i need a rest.

                             contractor/ screen
               that's impossible, robert.  you're
               at the top of your field.  these
               are the best contracts.  to stop
               now would be self-destructive.

     he looks away from the screen and sees the chess game on
     the table.

                             rath/screen
               send the file.  i'll have the
               estimate tonight.

                             contractor/screen
               i'm worried about you, robert.

                             rath
               you fucking should be --

                             rath/screen
               don't be.

     on the screen the word "transmitting" appears.  rath
     slowly gets out of his chair.

     the fax machine clicks and huxs to life as a photograph
     of a smiling, old italian man curls onto the desk.

     rath begins destroying the hotel room, smashing anything
     he can get his hands on.
