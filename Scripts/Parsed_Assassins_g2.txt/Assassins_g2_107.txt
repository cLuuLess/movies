     ext. costa blanca - day

     american tourist dollars have built up the coasts, but
     much of the out-lying city is very poor.

     the old hotel paraiso is a five story blackened husk.  the
     face of the building is burnt black and it seems to hang
     in space as something non-corporeal, like the shadow of
     the building rather than the building itself.

     rath stares at it, remembering.

     electra is behind him, standing in the midst of the plaza
     del sol.

     he looks up to the fifth story window, then turns directly
     opposite of that.

     the international banco de mexico, an enormous, beautiful
     old building; its exterior walls are white-washed
     concrete, blindingly bright white.

     electra looks at the bank and smiles.

                             electra
               so, that's where all that s & l
               money is?

     rath is not listening to her.  he is somewhere else.  he
     turns back to the fourth story window.

                             rath
               that's where he'll be.

                             electra
               what?

                             rath
               i wasn't expecting this.  i need to
               think.
