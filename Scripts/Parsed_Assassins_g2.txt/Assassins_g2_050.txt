     int. hotel room - day

     electra is pacing, talking into the cellular phone.

                             electra
               i'll call you again in twenty
               minutes.

     she punches a button and shoves the antennae down.

     the hotel room looks like her apartment.  there is a
     computer and a series of monitors stacked on top of the
     wood laminate desk.  cables whip and wind across the
     carpeted floor to the central air duct.

     the panel has been removed and intertwined black and gray
     coaxial run up inside the duct.

     immediately, electra is busy finishing her preparations.
     she snaps in several power cords and the system comes on-
     line.

     on the monitor screen, we see an empty hotel room that
     looks exactly like the one she is in.
