     int. international banco de mexico - day

     it is a strange and beautiful bank.

     the ceilings are vast, the suspended lights elaborate,
     baroque, the enormous clock on the wall, built to resemble
     a sun.

     it looks almost as though it could be a museum, with its
     massive oil paintings and bronze statues of important
     mexican figures.

     already it is crowded, people and security guards moving
     about beneath us.

     rath steps onto the checkered floor and remembers.
