     int. costa blanca hotel - night

     bain is laying on the floor in the dark.  the rifle is
     under him as he aims out of his balcony, down the street
     at the statue.

     he looks up from the scope, checking the street.  it is
     dark and empty and he shifts back looking into the sight.

     his finger squeezes, the gun almost silent, as --

     intercut with:

     statue

     a chunk of stone explodes out the head of the statue.
     again, the gun spits and another cloud of dust and rock
     bursts from the head.  his finger is pumping the trigger,
     until the head cracks and falls.

     he's laughing, hysterical, looking down the street at the
     headless statue.

     he rolls onto his side still laughing.  then, suddenly, he
     stops, staring up at the stars in the night sky.
