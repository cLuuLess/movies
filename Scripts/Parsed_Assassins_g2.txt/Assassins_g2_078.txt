     int. electra's car

     rath sees the entrance for the expressway.

                             rath
               get on the expressway.

                             electra
               where are we going?

     rath glances back.

                             rath
               nowhere yet.

     electra turns onto the highway and nikita howls from the
     "travel kitty" in the back seat.

                             electra
               nikita, hush.

     nikita wants out and howls again.

                             electra
               she won't stop unless you let her
               out.

     rath reaches back and opens the box.  nikita springs into
     the front seat onto rath's lap.

                             rath
               nikita?  she helped me find you.

                             electra
               what?  how did you know i had a cat?

                             rath
               took a guess.  lucky for you, i
               guessed right.

                             electra
               who the fuck are you?  who do you
               work for?

                             rath
               i work for the government.

                             electra
               yeah?

     she studies his face, his eyes.

                             electra
               bullshit.

                             rath
               yeah.

                             electra
               you're one of them, aren't you?  a
               fucking pro.

                             rath
               i'm part of the game, just like you.

     electra pounds the steering wheel.

                             electra
               jesus!

     he reaches into the back seat, grabbing her bag.

                             electra
               what do you think you're doing?

     rath plucks out the bundles of money.

                             rath
               twenty large?  that's all?

                             electra
               what do you mean, 'that's all'?
               what in the hell do you know?

                             rath
               the bonus on the contract for you
               was one million dollars.

     electra seems ready to jump out of her skin.  the
     speedometer is floating around 90.

                             rath
               slow down.

     he pulls out the disks.

                             rath
               i figure that means these are worth
               ten times that, maybe more.

                             electra
               ten million --

                             rath
               now you understand why i'm here.

     electra wants to scream.  the speedometer is climbing over
     100.

                             rath
               i really think you should slow down.
