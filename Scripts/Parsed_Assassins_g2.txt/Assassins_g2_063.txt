     int. hotel suite

     when the japanese men enter the suite, we realize that
     this is the image on electra's monitors.  surveillance
     camcorders and microphones are mounted in various
     locations to display every inch of the room.  the group
     hesitates for a moment, under the electronic eyes.

     the four goons have their hands in their jackets.

     a small laptop computer sits on the coffee table humming
     softly.  it is the only noise in the room until a speaker
     crackles.

                             electra/speaker (v.o.)
               good morning, gentlemen.  i
               apologize for the arrangement, but
               we all know those aren't business
               cards you're reaching for.  if
               anyone leaves this room, the deal's
               off.
