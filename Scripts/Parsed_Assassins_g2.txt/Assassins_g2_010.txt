     int. trattoria roma

     bain looks out the window at the dark street.

     he turns and searches through the people huddled on the
     floor.  he aims his gun.

                             bain
               you!  get up!

     a quivering wine steward stands.

     he points to another.

                             bain
               you, too!  up!
