     int. hotel room

     electra is sitting on the bed, her back against the wall.
     in her hands is a paperback romance novel that she is
     looking over the top of, staring intensely across the
     room.

     we can hear rath, his breathing deep and even.  he is
     doing tai chi, wearing only his boxer shorts.  his body is
     coated in a sheen of sweat, his muscles strained as he
     moves fluidly through space.

     electra begins to breath with him.

     she moves her body slightly, her hips rising as though to
     meet his.

     he empties his lungs entirely in one exhale and stops, his
     eyes closed, rested.

                             electra
               that was beautiful.

     he looks at her.

                             electra
               tai chi, right?

     he nods.

                             electra
               where did you learn it?

                             rath
               taiwan.

                             electra
               not that i would know, but you look
               like you're really good at it.

                             rath
               thank you.

                             electra
               i've always wanted to learn
               something like that.

                             rath
               you should.  it's very important,
               that the body release the energy
               that builds in it.

     electra nods, watching him bend, reaching for a change of
     clothes.

                             rath
               i'm going to shower.  if you're
               hungry, go ahead and order some
               dinner.

     electra nods again.
