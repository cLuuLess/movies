     int. hotel suite - night

     rath is at his computer system.

     he is staring at it, like it is a living thing, a person
     that he despises, the blank screen reflecting his own
     face.  it is an effort to bring himself to touch the
     keyboard, to type in his code.

     he waits.

                             contractor/screen
               hello, robert.

     rath wants to type something but hesitates.

                             contractor/screen
               i know what happened.

                             rath
               i bet you fucking know!

                             contractor/screen
               it cost us.

     rath jumps out of his chair, screaming at the screen.

                             rath
               i give a fuck?  i'm done!  i quit!
               do you fucking hear me!  i'm fucking
               gone!

                             contractor/screen
               he stole another contract.

     rath turns from the monitor, pacing.  trying to collect
     himself.

                             rath
               i'm being set up.  fucking set up!

     he looks at the chess board.  he hovers over it, the
     pattern completely familiar.

                             rath
               is this how it went, nick?

                             contractor/screen
               robert?  robert?

     rath turns back to the screen, speaking as he types.

                             rath/screen
               how did he know?

                             contractor/screen
               know what?

                             rath/screen
               the fucking contract!  how in the
               fuck did he know.

     a long beat.

                             contractor/screen
               such language in front of a lady.

     rath still talking and typing.

                             rath/screen
               i don't know what the fuck you are.

                             contractor/screen
               i know.  it was a joke.

     rath stands, no longer typing.

                             rath
               a joke?  a joke?

     rath takes out his gun and levels it at the face of the
     screen.

                             rath
               you think this is a fucking joke?

                             contractor/screen
               $1,000,000.

     rath looks at the number.

                             contractor/screen
               that's the bonus on the contract.

     rath puts the gun down.

                             rath/screen
               deadline?

                             contractor/screen
               tomorrow.  the buyer is japanese.
               his retirement a condition of the
               bonus.

     the fax machine comes to life, printing an inky image.

                             rath/screen
               who is the mark?

                             contractor/screen
               freelancer.  a woman.  surveillance
               specialist.

                             rath
               a player?

                             contractor/screen
               we have an m.o... her system is
               protected by her 'pussy virus.'

     rath looks at the fax; almost entirely black except for
     the wide, slit-iris cat eyes.
