     int. hotel (costa blanca) - night

     a small hotel in the city, away from the beaches, built
     before there was such a thing as central air conditioning.

     bain is naked, except for a small pair of camouflage
     jockeys and his walkman strapped to his shoulder.  his
     head is pumping wildly with the speed metal thrashing in
     his ears.

     he is tearing open a long box wrapped in "happy birthday"
     paper.

     inside the box is a massive black hi-tech assault rifle.
     he smiles.

     he assembles it quickly, snapping it together with
     automatic ease.  when the sight is tightened in place, he
     jumps up.

     in the mirror over the dresser, he poses down with the
     gun.

     not satisfied, he grabs his shades and checks himself
     again.  he starts moving with the music, playing with the
     gun, first as a guitar, then whipping it around, spinning
     it expertly, like a drum and bugle corpsman.  the gun zips
     and flashes around as he whirls in place, then freezes.

     the butt of the rifle to his shoulder, he peers down the
     scope at his own head reflected in the mirror.  he is
     sweating and breathing, but the barrel does not move.

                             bain
               you're dead, motherfucker.
