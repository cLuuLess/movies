     int. apartment hall

     electra's front door opens slowly.  timidly, she steps out
     of her apartment and walks down the hall until she is
     standing in front of jennifer's door.

     she starts to knock, but stops herself.  she isn't sure
     she should do this.

     she paces, then turns to the door.

     she knocks, so softly it's almost impossible to hear.

     she stands, trying to force herself to knock again, when
     she hears jennifer.

                             jennifer (o.s.)
               hello?  ken, is that you?

     electra panics.

     the door knob turns, the door opens and jennifer looks out
     into the hall.  it is empty.
