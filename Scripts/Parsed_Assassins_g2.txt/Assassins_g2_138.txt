     int. burned hotel paraiso

     the center of the hotel is open.  interior hall balconies,
     which line each floor, look down onto an old atrium
     courtyard.  the fire did the most damage here, spreading
     easily throughout the entire building.

     the skylight and ceiling at the top of this open area, has
     been destroyed and sunlight streams through throwing
     broken patterns of shadow and light onto the blackened
     floors and walls.

     bain enters, and carefully begins climbing the charred
     staircase to the fifth floor.
