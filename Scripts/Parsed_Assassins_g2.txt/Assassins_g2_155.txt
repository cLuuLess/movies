               listen to me, bain.  two days ago,
               you contacted your contractor, who
               told you that they knew when and
               where i was going to pick up the
               transferred money from microcell.
               you don't know how they got the
               information.  it bothered you, but
               you didn't care.  how do i know
               this?  because ten years ago, i was
               sitting in that chair, as scared
               shitless as you are now.

                             bain
               i ain't scared of you.

                             rath
               yeah you are and you hate it.  you
               hate the fact that your hand is
               shaking and mine isn't.  that you're
               sweating your balls off and i'm not.
               you've got fear and hate in your
               belly like battery acid, all because
               of me.

                             bain
               if you think you can take me, quit
               fucking bullshitting and try it.

                             rath
               all right, bain.  pay attention,
               because this is where everything
               changes.
