     int. hotel room

     the breakfast trays are empty.  rath is sipping coffee,
     scribbling notes and diagrams on a piece of paper.

     electra comes out of the bathroom dressed for the beach.

     he stops working.

                             electra
               i know what you are thinking.  i'm
               not going to disappear, okay?  i'm
               not going anywhere, just down there,
               to that beautiful beach.  i got to
               get out of this room, just for a
               little while.

                             rath
               okay.

                             electra
               really?

                             rath
               he won't be looking for you.  just
               be careful.  buy a book.  keep your
               sunglasses on.

                             electra
               book.  sunglasses.  great.
