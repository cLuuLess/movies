     int. electra's car

     electra drives, obviously nervous, as rath watches out the
     rear window.

                             rath
               turn here.

     no one follows.  he turns back to her.

                             rath
               how many bodies were there?

     he checks his watch.

                             electra
               what?

                             rath
               he has to clean up.  how many bodies
               were there?

                             electra
               um, five.

                             rath
               one hour per man.

     rath sets the timer on his watch for five hours.
