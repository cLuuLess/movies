     int. san francisco airport - day

     several passengers walk through the gate into the
     terminal.

     across from the gate, rath sits in a grungy airport
     cafeteria, reading a folded paper.

     he is wearing an airport security uniform, a gun holstered
     to his side.

     taped inside the newspaper is a faxed interpol photograph
     of a japanese man wanted for "industrial espionage."

     at the gate, five japanese men emerge.  leading the group
     is the man in rath's photo.  the other four are obviously
     muscle.

     rath watches as they walk down the crowded terminal hall.
     when they are almost out of sight, he folds his newspaper
     and begins to follow.

     his pace and manner is that of a cautious predator.  his
     focus shifts continually from face to face, expecting to
     find bain's.

     his hand hovers near his gun.

     ahead of him a thin young man, wearing a long blue trench
     coat, stops.  rath cannot see his face.

     the man starts toward a drinking fountain.

     rath catches a glimpse of his face.  it could be bain, but
     he isn't sure.

     the young man bends over and slurps at the stream of
     water.  he rises into the barrel of rath's .22.

     a mouthful of water coughs from his mouth.

     it is not bain and in the next instant, the gun is gone.

                             rath
               sorry.  my mistake.

     rath continues.  they young man is unable to move.
