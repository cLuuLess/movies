     int. hotel suite - night

     it is the same room but now it is very cluttered, room
     service trays and empty liquor bottles tossed about.

     he has been here for a while.

     he is sitting at the table, staring intensely at a chess
     game; we see the board and all of the pieces set in the
     same positions as in the opening sequence.

     he rubs at the whiskers that have darkened his face and
     then finishes off another bottle of bourbon.

     he flings the empty bottle across the room as he reaches
     over the board and moves one of white knights, taking a
     black rook.

     a sequence begins, obvious, and he works through it moving
     both the black and white pieces.  suddenly he stops.  he
     gets up and shifts to the other side of the board,
     studying the game from white's perspective.

     another sequence emerges and he trades the pieces through
     it as he moves around the table, returning to his place
     behind the black king.

     the games reaches its end as black is check-mated.

     he slumps down onto the table and looks across at the
     white king.

                             rath
               fuck you, nick.
