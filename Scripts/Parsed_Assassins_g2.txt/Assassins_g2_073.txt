     int. hall

     electra explodes through the door and suddenly freezes.
     she is staring down the barrel of rath's .22.

                             rath
               don't be stupid and you will live.

     the elevator behind rath opens and closes against a hotel
     lobby ashtray.  he waves her into the elevator with his
     gun.

                             rath
               hurry.
