     int. hotel paraiso room - night

     rath checks his watch.  it's after eight o'clock.  he
     lifts the phone and plugs it into the modem.

                             rath
               i'm going to call.

     electra drops her book and climbs off the bed.

     he dials, types the code and waits.

                             contractor/screen
               hello, robert.

                             rath/screen
               the contract?

                             contractor/screen
               paid in full.

                             electra
               oh, my god.  ten million dollars.

                             contractor/screen
               transferred to the specified
               account.

     rath stares at the screen.

                             contractor/screen
               goodbye, robert.

     rath disconnects.  the phone hums.

     electra picks it up, placing it back in the cradle.

                             rath
               sit down.

     she does.

     he opens a case and pulls out his gun, some paper and pens
     and two small mikes that look like hearing aids.

                             rath
               okay --

     he starts drawing several squares on the paper, as electra
     picks up the mike.  she looks over it, frowns.

                             electra
               two way?

                             rath
               transmits and receives.

                             electra
               cheap as shit.

     he looks at her.

                             rath
               i paid a lot for these.

                             electra
               they saw you coming a mile away.  if
               i had known we'd be using --

                             rath
               it's too late now.  okay?  we'll have
               to deal with these.

                             electra
               fine.

     he goes back to his drawing.

                             rath
               this is the bank.  this is the
               hotel.  in the morning i will enter
               the bank.

                             electra
               check.

                             rath
               he will be hidden somewhere out
               here, probably somewhere low, in the
               crowd.  he'll stay there until he
               sees me enter the bank.

                             electra
               but he won't shoot you right then?

                             rath
               no.  it would be amateur.  a risk.
               he'll wait for the prime shot, that
               he knows is coming.  once i'm
               inside, he'll move to the hotel.
               he'll go up the back, too much
               traffic in the front.

     he draws another square.

                             rath
               you'll be here.  a restaurant.  a
               public place far enough away that he
               won't notice you, but with a good
               enough view you'll be able to see
               him when he moves inside.

                             electra
               okay.  then what?

                             rath
               then, we wait.

                             electra
               aiiee.  more waiting?  i don't know
               if i like this plan.

                             rath
               it will take the entire day, but he
               will begin to doubt himself.  he
               will begin to believe that he missed
               me, that somehow i slipped by and am
               already on a plane to europe.

     he describes this as though remembering it.

                             rath
               the sun will be low, almost dark,
               the air cool and the bank will
               almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  he
               will put the rifle down, he will get
               up and he will walk across the plaza
               to the bank.

                             electra
               why won't he wait until the bank
               closes?

                             rath
               he won't be able to.  he'll have to
               go inside.  he'll have to see with
               his own eyes, whether or not i am
               there.  if the bank closes, he won't
               know for sure.  he'll come.  i'm
               sure.  and when he does you'll go
               into the hotel, go upstairs and take
               the gun.

                             electra
               what?  what if he brings it with
               him?

     he shakes his head.

                             rath
               he can't.  the bank has an expensive
               security system; metal detectors and
               x-ray machines.

                             electra
               that means you won't have a gun.

                             rath
               that's right.

                             electra
               and with the mikes, i'll tell you
               when he leaves the hotel and you'll
               tell me when he leaves the bank.

                             rath
               if things go well, i don't have to.
               you'll already be in a rented car
               waiting for me.

                             electra
               you'll have the money.  how do i
               know that you won't --

                             rath
               i'll be walking out of the bank,
               unarmed.  you'll have the gun and
               i'll drive the car.

                             electra
               we split the money?

                             rath
               five million apiece.  you get on
               your plane, i get on mine.

                             electra
               sounds pretty well figured out.

                             rath
               i've been thinking about it for a
               long time.

                             electra
               except --

                             rath
               what?

                             electra
               except, if he doesn't come out of
               the hotel.

                             rath
               i told you, he will.

                             electra
               you can't know for sure, how can
               you?  i mean, you're not him.

                             rath
               i was.

     she waits for him to explain.

                             rath
               ten years ago, i sat there in that
               same hotel window, sweat pouring off
               of me waiting --

                             electra
               for nicholai?

                             rath
               yes.

                             electra
               you killed him here?  in this city,
               outside that bank?

     rath nods.

                             electra
               what is it?  i don't like this at
               all.  what is going on here?

                             rath
               i don't know.  it just happened.  i
               was here ten years ago, i'm here
               now.  that's it.

                             electra
               i don't believe that.

                             rath
               it wasn't planned or premeditated.
               i swear.  things happened beyond my
               control.  i understood; i saw where
               they were leading and i suppose that
               it just made sense.

                             electra
               ten years ago.

                             rath
               yes.

                             electra
               what happened?

                             rath
               i waited until i was insane and then
               i walked into the bank.  he was
               sitting there, very calm, waiting
               for me.

                             electra
               what did he want?

                             rath
               he wanted what i want now; to get
               out of the business.  to disappear
               to some empty greek island.

                             rath
               what did he say?

                             rath
               he said i couldn't win.  that no one
               wins at this game.

                             electra
               was that it?

                             rath
               then he offered me one million
               dollars to walk away, to quit the
               business.

                             electra
               you didn't take it.

                             rath
               no.  i went back to the hotel.  and
               waited.

                             electra
               ten years later, here you are again.

                             rath
               yes.  here i am again.
