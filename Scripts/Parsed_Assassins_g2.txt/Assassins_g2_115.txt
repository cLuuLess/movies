     ext. hotel paraiso - day

     electra leans out over the railing, smiling, inhaling the
     warm air, the scent of the shimmering blue-green sea.

     rath stands in the shadow of the door frame.

                             rath
               breakfast.

                             electra
               why don't you bring it out here?
               it's beautiful out here.

     rath steps a little farther out.  he looks down either
     side of the building, checking sight lines.  he looks out
     and sees another hotel with windows facing them.

     he turns to her.  says nothing.  moves back inside.
