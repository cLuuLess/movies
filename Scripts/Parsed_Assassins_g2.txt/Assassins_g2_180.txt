     int. burned hotel

     bain, lying on his back, aims the rifle at her footsteps.

                             bain
               die, bitch!

     he fires, finger pumping, bullets erupting through the
     floor around her feet.

     screaming, she leaps out of the room, into the hall.

     his shoulders oozing blood, bain clenches his teeth and
     rises, listening as --

     she sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall.

     beneath, he moves to the railing and aims at the
     staircase, waiting, until --

     electra freezes at the top of the stairs, realizing that
     they are exposed.

     she flashes her head, quickly dipping back as the wall is
     perforated with bullets.

                             bain
               fuck!  god damn bitch!  what are you
               doing?  i don't believe this is
               happening!

     she can hear him coming, his voice echoing through the
     hollow building.  she looks down the stairs, the hall,
     above; there is nowhere to go.

                             bain
               you're dead!  you're fucking dead!
               i'm going to kill you a hundred
               fucking times for this!

     bain fires up at the ceiling, the bullet tearing through
     the floor, whizzing past electra's head.  if she moves
     he'll know her position.

     he fires another.

     electra sinks down, her back against the wall and aims at
     the floor.

     another shot.

     she fires back.

     bain closes, as they both start firing, silenced weapons,
     flashing, pumping lead at unseen targets.

     her gun empties first.

     he laughs hearing the click.

                             bain
               game over, bitch!

                             rath
               bain!

     rath's scream echoes up through the building.

     before bain can target him, rath is gone; a shadow, a
     ghost.  he scans the hotel's courtyard.  the last light
     from the setting sun slips through the slits, cracks and
     broken window panes, casting patterns; a surreal dream-
     like grid resembling a chess board.

     electra sees her chance.  she leaps to her feet, throwing
     the gun over the balcony.

     the two men watch the gun clatter to the floor as she
     races back to the room.

                             bain
               fuck no!

     rath grabs the gun tracking bain hurling up the stairs to
     the fifth floor.  rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun
     is empty.

                             rath
               shit!

     bain reaches the top of the stairs before electra gets to
