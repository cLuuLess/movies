     the official walks over to rath with a number of papers to
     sign.

                             official
               your signature, senor.  everything
               is ready.

     rath signs them, but does not get up.

                             official
               excellent, senor.  if you could
               follow me?

                             rath
               i'm sorry, but i am waiting for an
               associate.  can you hold everything
               for me until he arrives?

                             official
               of course, senor.
