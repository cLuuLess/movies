     int. burned hotel room

     the sun is getting low.  the room much darker now.

     bain sits at the window; his body a knot.

     a large group of tourists flow out of the bank and bain's
     eyes light up.  one by one, the scope passes over each
     face.

     they trickle down the steps and into the plaza.

     the stairs are again empty.

     bain screams, pounding the butt of the gun down, splitting
     open the floor.

     he looks at the bank.  nothing.  he checks his watch.  in
     fifteen minutes the bank will close.

     he stands up.
