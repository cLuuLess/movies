     int. hotel suite - night

     the room is immaculate; near the door, several over-sized
     suitcases line the wall.

     bain is sitting at the desk.  his walkman is on, music
     blasting, as he flips casually through the telephone
     directory.

     his finger eases down a column stopping at "morgan
     jennifer."

     there is a knock at the door.

     he smiles and tears out the page.

     there is another, louder knock which bain hears this time.
     he turn off the walkman and opens the door; a bellboy is
     waiting with a luggage cart.

                             bellboy
               hello, sir.  have you some luggage
               you need carried.

     bain gives him a wink and a smile.

                             bain
               indeed i do.
