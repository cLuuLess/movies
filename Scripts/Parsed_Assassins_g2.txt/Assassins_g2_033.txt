     ext. city street intersection

     a brand new cab is sitting at a red light.

     the cabby looks into the rearview mirror, as a pair of
     headlights roll up behind him.  the car gets closer, the
     lights brighter; they don't stop.

     he shrieks as the car smashes into his, tearing off his
     bumper.

     the cabby jumps out, rattling off a string of obscenities.

     rath gets out of the white car, starting to apologize, as
     the cabby moves toward him.

     when he's close enough, rath decks him, knocking him
     unconscious.

     he picks him up and puts him in the white car.

     rath then gets in the cab and when the light changes to
     green, he drives off.
