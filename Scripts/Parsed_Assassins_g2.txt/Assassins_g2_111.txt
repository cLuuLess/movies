     rath is sitting in a desk chair staring out of the sliding
     balcony doors at the dark gulf water.

                             electra
               did you see them?

     electra moves about the large suite.

                             electra
               they looked like they were in love.

     rath says nothing.

                             electra
               well, i think i'll take a bath.
               come on, nikita!

     the two of them walk into the bathroom, leaving rath to
     himself.
