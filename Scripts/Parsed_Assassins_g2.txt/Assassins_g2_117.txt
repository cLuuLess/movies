     int. hotel hall

     electra steps out of the hotel room ready for the beach.
     at the end of the hall, she sees the newlywed couple get
     on the elevator.  she starts to call to them to hold it
     for her, but she stops herself.

     the elevator closes.

     she edges slowly down the hall, stopping outside the door
     to their suite.  she touches it with the tips of her
     fingers.
