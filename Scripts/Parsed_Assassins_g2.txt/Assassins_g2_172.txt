     int. burned hotel

     bain is rigid, cast in iron, the rifle rammed under his
     chin, sight tight to his eye, finger wrapped around the
     trigger.

     electra silently, ever so delicately opens her bag,
     lifting out her gun.

                             bain
               make me shit, you sorry ass piece of
               mark meat!  come on, come on.  it's
               over!  i know it!  you know it!  we
               know it!

     in the...


     telescopic sight

     we watch rath step out of the bank, the doors closing
     behind him.


     back to scene

     bain smiles.


     inside closet

     electra slowly rises, still watching bain.
