     int. patrol car

     the two officers are outside the car talking with the
     sergeant.

     bain, laying low beneath the windows, peeks up at the
     shadowy parking garage.  he smiles.

     the two policemen get in the car, the second picking up
     the radio.  the driver guns the engine and the black and
     white rumbles down the street.

                             cop #2
               this is 181, returning with suspect
               involved in multiple shooting at
               trattoria roma.  repeat, en route
               with suspect.

     he hangs up the radio and looks back at bain through the
     metal caging.

                             cop #2
               jesus christ, do you know who you
               shot in there?

     bain almost laughs.

                             cop #2
               what are you?  some kind of a
               hitman?

     bain looks out the window.

                             cop #2
               you know what we call guys like you?

     bain looks at him.

                             cop #2
               sizzle lean.  they're gonna fry your
               ass.

     he laughs at his own joke, looking at his partner, who
     chuckles.
