     int. airplane - day

     rath and electra are sitting in the first class section,
     which she is obviously enjoying, smiling and sipping
     champagne.

                             electra
               god, i love first class.  i remember
               when i was a little girl, i would
               wonder what it was like up here.  i
               would always try to peek through the
               curtains.

     rath says nothing, staring out the window.

     electra shakes her head.

                             electra
               i hope nikita's all right.

     he still does not respond.

                             electra
               hey, where are you?

                             rath
               thinking.

                             electra
               about?

                             rath
               nothing.

     electra sips the last of her champagne.

                             electra
               i've never been to the gulf of
               mexico.  is it as nice as they say?

                             rath
               i don't know.

                             electra
               you were there?

     a long beat.

                             rath
               yes.
