     int. parking garage

     rath looks over his scope, talking to himself.  he is
     sweating.

                             rath
               shit.  what are you doing, old man?
               you're too fucking slow.

     he looks back into the scope and begins scanning the line
     of cars.

                              rath
               okay.  which one?  which one is
               yours?
