     ext. plaza del sol - day

     bain moves through the market, booths lining the edges of
     the plaza.  his eyes shift rapidly behind his sunglasses.

     he buys an apricot and strolls into the center of the
     plaza.

     he looks at the bank, at the military-style security
     guards that patrol the front.

     he turns in the plaza, checking the perimeter, his gaze
     falling on the tall, burned-out building.

     he looks back at the bank, imagining the sight line.

     he bites into the apricot, its juice gushing, running down
     his chin.
