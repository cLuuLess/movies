     int. bedroom

     when electra comes out of the bathroom, rath is again at
     his chess game.  she sits down across from him and sets
     the gun on the table between them.

     rath looks up at her.

                             electra
               listen -- i don't even know your
               name.

                             rath
               rath.  robert rath.

                             electra
               electra.

                             rath
               just electra?

                             electra
               yeah.

                             rath
               as in daughter of agamemnon?

                             electra
               no.  just electra.

     the conversation dies.

                             electra
               what i'm trying to say is that --
               i'm not sure i can do this, help
               you, unless i know more about you.

                             rath
               what do you want to know?

                             electra
               if bain hadn't taken the contract on
               me, would you have?

     he stares at her.

                             rath
               no.

                             electra
               why?

                             rath
               because i'm done.

                             electra
               this is crazy.  i can't trust you.
               you can't trust me.  how can we
               possibly help each other?

     they sit in silence, the gun and the chess game lying
     between them.

                             rath
               do you play?

     she looks at the chess board.

                             electra
               with computers.

                             rath
               it's not the same, is it?

                             electra
               better than playing with yourself.

     he smiles.

                             rath
               i had an opponent.

     she understands that he is trying to tell her something.

                             electra
               had?

                             rath
               he was russian.  nicholai
               tachlinkov.  a legend in the
               business when i was just starting.
               i admired him.  when i heard he
               loved chess i became obsessed with
               the game.

     electra studies the board.

                             electra
               he was white?

     rath nods.

                             electra
               it looks like white's game.

                             rath
               we played with a code using the new
               york times obituaries.  over three
               years we played twelve matches.  i
               never won.

                             electra
               why didn't you finish this game?

     she reaches over and lifts a white knight and takes a
     bishop.  rath counters, taking her knight.

                             rath
               he was... taken.

                             electra
               he was killed.

     rath nods.

     throughout the entire conversation they continue to play
     out the chess game.

                             electra
               by who?

     a long beat.

                             rath
               i killed him.

                             electra
               why?

                             rath
               because that's how it works.  that's
               what it's about.  he was the best.
               he was on top.

                             electra
               where you wanted to be?

                             rath
               yes.  as soon as you get into this
               business, all you can think about is
               getting to the top.  that's all
               there is.  until then, there is
               nothing.  you are nothing.

                             electra
               how did you get into the business?

                             rath
               the same way everyone does; the
               government, the agency.

                             electra
               the c.i.a.?

                             rath
               more or less.

                             electra
               how old were you?

                             rath
               they recruited me when i was in high
               school.

                             electra
               jesus -- why?

                             rath
               languages.  i was already fluent in
               nine languages.

                             electra
               you were like a boy genius?

                             rath
               some people said that.  i never
               thought so.

                             electra
               why not?

                             rath
               i was just different.

                             electra
               you went from high school to the
               agency?

                             rath
               no.  i graduated from george
               washington university.  then i
               entered the agency training program.

                             electra
               they didn't give you a choice, did
               they?

                             rath
               no, they didn't.

                             electra
               but you knew what they were training
               you for?

                             rath
               of course.  i was going to be james
               bond.

                             electra
               ahhhh...

                             rath
               they are very good at what they do.
               it's very seductive.  the training,
               the weapons, the travel --

                             electra
               the exotic women.

                             rath
               women?  no... not really.

                             electra
               why not?

                             rath
               women... i don't... i don't want to
               talk about women.

                             electra
               why?

                             rath
               because you are a women.

                             electra
               why did you leave the agency?

                             rath
               the same reason everyone does.  you
               hear your name on c-span and you
               realize you're a skeleton in
               someone's closet and they're coming
               to bury you.

                             electra
               they tried to kill you?

                             rath
               yes.  it didn't matter much to them
               as long as i disappeared.

                             electra
               then you went freelance?

                             rath
               the only thing different about the
               private sector is that a general
               contractor takes less of a
               percentage than the government, so
               you make more money.  then once you
               make the transition, you realize you
               were never working for the
               government; it was always the
               private sector, the vested interests
               and it's the same vested interests
               that continue to buy your plane
               tickets.

                             electra
               tell me about the first time.

                             rath
               my first take?

                             electra
               yes.

                             rath
               why?

                             electra
               because i want to know.

                             rath
               it was... mechanical.  very precise.
               it was exactly like the training
               drill except for the adrenaline.

                             electra
               are they usually like that?

                             rath
               no.  just the first one.

                             electra
               after that?

                             rath
               they become complicated... messy.

                             electra
               did it ever bother you?

                             rath
               did it ever bother james bond?

                             electra
               that's fiction.

                             rath
               this is fiction!  don't you see
               that?  this is another reality.  and
               the people that come into the world
               to play this game -- nobody forces
               them!  they're here, they know the
               rules, the stakes, the risks!  do
               you understand what i am saying?  no
               one is innocent -- including you!

                             electra
               does that mean it didn't bother you?

     rath leans back and stares at her.  she waits.

                             rath
               you get a job swinging a hammer, the
               first day you get a blister, it
               tears open, it bleeds and it stays
               sore a long time.  you keep swinging
               the hammer, you get a good hard
               callous that covers that spot and it
               never bothers you again.

     electra says nothing.  he leans forward and slides a rook
     into her back row.

                             rath
               check.

     he leans back.

                             rath
               is that what you wanted to hear?
               something cold blooded... something
               remorseless...

                             electra
               no.  something honest.

     a beat.  rath likes this woman.

     she moves her queen.

                             electra
               mate.

     he smiles.

                             electra
               i hope your plan is better than your
               game.
