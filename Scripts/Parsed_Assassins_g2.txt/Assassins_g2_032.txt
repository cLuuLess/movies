     ext. street

     orange flames lick up from the belly of the overturned
     patrol car.  oil black clouds billow into the night sky.

     rath's car cruises past.

     rath sees the back seat window shattered, kicked out.

     bain is gone.

                             rath
               i'm not done yet.
