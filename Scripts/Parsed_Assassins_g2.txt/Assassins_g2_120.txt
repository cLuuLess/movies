     int. hotel room

     rath is leaning back in the bed, nikita purring in his
     lap.

     he did not sleep last night and is very tired.  his eyes
     fight to stay open.

     the sound of the television momentarily hangs in the hotel
     room as he sleeps.  the program is a spanish dubbed
     version of goldfinger.

     the door bangs open and rath springs off the bed, a gun
     flashing in his hand, leveling it at a dazed, blinking
     electra.

     rath sighs slowly, letting the hammer of the gun click
     back into place.

                             rath
               you should knock.

                             electra
               sorry.

                             rath
               how was the beach?

                             electra
               the beach?  it was nice.

     she smiles.
