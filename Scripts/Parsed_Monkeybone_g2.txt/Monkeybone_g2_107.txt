int. death's office - night

the big creaky swivel chair swings around, revealing death.

                           death
            now, if i may ask - what kind of idiot sneaks
            into the land of death twice?

the party he's addressing is stu - who's stretched out horizontally,
strapped to a medieval torture rack, with a whole posse of grim reapers
standing guard around him.

                           stu
            you're mad at me. great. you have every right to
            be. but we're both mad at dark town. we're both
            mad at hypnos.

                           death
            oh, sure. now you're gonna tell me it was all
            his idea. you were completely innocent -

                           stu
            i'm not going to tell you that. i wanted that e-
            ticket. i wanted it so bad i'd stare you right
            in the face to get it - and i'd do the same
            again.

                           death
            why??

                           stu
            i have a girl up there. and i never - i
            should've - i just want to tell her i love her.

                           death
            i'm a simple man. i'm just doing my job. i enjoy

            my job. why does everyone want to make it
            difficult for me? stealing tickets, switching
            bodies...it is so irresponsible.

                           stu
            death, i'm trying to make things right. take my
            soul. turn me into a paper doll. but give me
            just one lousy hour.

                           death
            well - you'd need a body.

death gestures for the reapers to unshackle stu.

                           death
            if it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, i
            wouldn't be doing this. but a good chuckle is
            darned hard to come by.
                 (chortling)
            that one where monkeybone stole the soap cake
            out of the urinal - i thought i would die.

                           stu
            coming from you, that's quite a compliment.

                           death
            de nada. now, come here...bend over...before i
            change my mind.

                           stu
            bend over?

death rears back and kicks him, full-force, smack in the ass. the
supernatural might of the blow sends stu rocketing upward through the
ceiling!!
