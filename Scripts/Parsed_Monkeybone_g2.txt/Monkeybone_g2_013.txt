int. car - that moment - night

as stu pulls into the intersection he sees a delivery truck approaching
in the opposite lane, with a cardboard likeness of monkeybone mounted
atop the cab. he chuckles...

                           stu
            that damn monkey is everywh--

suddenly his view of the street disappears. the monkeybone banner has
fallen directly across his windshield, like a huge shroud. all he can
see is a great, grinning monkey face!!

julie screams. stu screams. unable to see, he slams on the brakes and
jerks the wheel right.

off screen: horns blaring. tires squealing. the horrible crunch of metal
on metal.

but stu's car comes to a halt untouched. after a moment he opens his
eyes...and julie opens hers...

                           stu
            did we just - hit something?

                           julie
            i don't think so.

                           stu
            are you okay??

she thinks it over, nods. stu takes a moment to catch his breath, then
opens the door gingerly. a horn blares as a car speeds past in the
opposite lane, nearly taking stu's door off. he jumps back inside,
waits, opens the door again...
