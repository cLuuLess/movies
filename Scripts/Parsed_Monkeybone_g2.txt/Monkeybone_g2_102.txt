int. sleep lab - day

the usual gang sitting around at their computer terminals, etc. julie is
coolly reading notebook entries into a tape recorder.

                           julie
            "4/17: subject, when unaware of observation,
            prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet.
            successfully carves turkey roll holding eating
            utensils...with feet."

                           alice
            they had a case like that at johns hopkins.
            wires got crossed between hands and feet.

                           clarissa
            great lead. i'll try and find it on the net.

                           julie
            "4/18: subject climbs backyard tree...to perform
            elimination. when confronted with product...
            blames it on family dog."

dead silence from the mortified group. they never had a case like that
at johns hopkins. julie somehow keeps a stiff upper lip - deeply
embarrassed for stu, but a scientist nonetheless.

                           hutch
            seems perfectly obvious. he's been possessed by
            a monkey!

the others all glower at hutch for this egregious display of bad taste.
