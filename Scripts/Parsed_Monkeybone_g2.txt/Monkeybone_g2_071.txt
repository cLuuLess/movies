ext. stu and julie's house - day

stu's back from the hospital. julie is removing his bags from the trunk
of kimmy's car while stu and kimmy chat in the front seat.

                           kimmy
            i just couldn't stand the thought of you
            suffering. i love you so, i would never have...
            forgive me, stu. please forgive me.

                           stu-bone
            kimmy. chill. we've still got a pact. if
            anything ever happens to you, i'll be right
            there to return the favor.
                 (baring his teeth)
            so drive carefully! from now on.

he climbs out. kimmy is so rattled that she smacks bumpers with the car
parked in front of her. she peels out with the hand brake still on.
