stu-bone in pajamas and a head bandage, reading the morning funnies. he
pounds the table, practically weeping with hilarity at the monkeybone
comic strip.

                           stu-bone
            priceless! priceless! this stuff just kills me!

                           julie
            i'm heading in to work, baby. are you sure
            you'll be okay?

                           stu-bone
            oh yeah. there's just one thing i don't get.
            "monkeybone creator awakens from coma" that's a
            big story! that's front page news! but i can't
            find a word of coverage in this stinkin' rag!
                 (shuffling through the paper)
            hey. don't i have a tv show?

                           julie
            they only made the one episode. they've shown it
            about nineteen times.

                           stu-bone
            i need a new pr guy.

julie grins, plants a goodbye smooch on his forehead, and exits. he
waits a minute, then reaches for the phone.
