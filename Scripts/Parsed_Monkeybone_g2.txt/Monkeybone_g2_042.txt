int. hypnos's bedroom - on bed

...and they rotate away from the party. privacy at last.

                           hypnos
            now death is not what you would call a people
            person, like me. death is a putz - and i should
            know. i'm his little brother.

                           stu
            you're death's brother?

                           hypnos
            oh yeah. mr. by-the-book, stick-up-the-ass, my-
            way-or-the-highway death. believe me - over the
            course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired
            of that schtick.
                 (spreading his hands)

            so i need a job. he sticks me in this broke-down
            amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it.
            i'm supposed to be grateful?

                           monkeybone
            the penthouse is pretty swank, though.

                           hypnos
            thank you. i decorated it myself.

                           stu
            guys, i don't mean to be rude, but i only have
            eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...

                           hypnos
            oh, right. cheating death. there's one thing you
            might try. only one guy in history ever pulled
            it off. well, actually two. actually, no, there
            was that other guy who...well, very few people
            have done it.

                           stu
            hyp, i'll do anything.

                           monkeybone
            me too. and i mean anything. ask the chicks in
            the back room.

                           hypnos
            you've seen those e-tickets, right? well, what
            you gotta do...is go into the land of death...
            and steal an e-ticket right out from under
            death's nose.

                           stu
            land of death. how do i get there?

                           hypnos
            kid, listen: that's all i'm saying. and you
            didn't hear it from me.

hyp hits the remote. the bed begins to rotate outward again.

                           hypnos
            you've heard of a fate worse than death? that's
            what's waiting for you if you screw up.
