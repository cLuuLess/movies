ext. dark town gates - night

a long stone stairway leads to decorative wrought-iron gates. shadowy
carved sphinxes sit on either side. as stu races up the steps, a
sputtering neon sign comes to life overhead:

                               d rk town

a fanfare blows as the creaky gates begin to part. a spotlight hits the
sphinxes - and they come to life! they rise up on their hind legs, put
on boater hats. one of them blows a note on a kazoo...

                           singing sphinxes
            weeee...welcome you to dark town
            and while you're in your coma
            this odd amusement park-town
            will be your home sweet homa -

stu bolts through the gates, with the roadkill trio right on his heels.
the indignant sphinxes exchange a look of outrage.
