int. kitchen - that moment - night

alice finds julie holding a bottle of champagne - veuve clicquot la
grande dame 1989 - all wrapped up in a bow and ribbon.

                           alice
            special occasion?

                           julie
            i don't know. i guess it was...

she bursts into tears. alice sits her down at the kitchen table and
takes the champagne from her.

                           alice
            don't get all poignant. we're keeping this
            bottle on ice. when he comes around you're going
            to need it.
