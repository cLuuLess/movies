int. screening room - on audience (live-action)

a roomful of live humans watching the cartoon, heads turning in sync
with the kids onscreen. tv-industry hipsters, ad execs, manufacturer's
reps...they're all guests at this sneak preview of the monkeybone show,
and they're laughing uproariously.

in the midst of the crowd is a handsome young couple: julie mcelroy and
stu miley. julie's a research scientist, brainy, professional,
abnormally well-adjusted - and pretty enough that she'd be intimidating
if it weren't for a prominent goofy streak.

stu is the one guy in the auditorium who isn't laughing at the cartoon
on the screen. in fact, he's solemn as a judge - peering nervously
around to see how the rest of the audience is responding.

why? because he's the cartoonist who created the characters on screen.
in his looks (gangly, disheveled) and manner (sardonic, self-
deprecating), he's the obvious model for the character of stanley.
