ext. trolley - moving

a tiny roller-coaster car descends from dense clouds down the length of
an impossibly long and rickety metal track. the track leads through a
vast black void...

...to a tiny island floating in the darkness...an island that looks not
unlike a disembodied fist.

and, as the car draws closer, the fist begins to open - tulip-like -
turning into a hand, with a full-sized town nestled in its palm! in the
town, carnival lights begin to glitter. music begins to tinkle...
