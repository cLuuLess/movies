int. shrink's office (animated)

a cuckoo pops out of a wall clock. adult stanley's thumb pops out of his
mouth. he awakens from his trance in a cold sweat.

                           stanley
            how about it, doc? can you help me?

                           shrink
            not overnight. these imaginary monkey cases take
            time. i vould estimate...roughly...

on the desk is a catalogue, open to a two-page spread depicting a 40-
foot cabin cruiser. "new for summer! only $229,999.95!" with his free
hand, the shrink is working a calculator...

                           shrink
            twelve years and three months ought to do it.

the shrink hustles stanley to the door and shakes his hand.

                           stanley
            one question, doc - what did you mean when you
            said "imaginary"?

                           shrink
            all in good time, my boy. all in good time.

the shrink shoves stanley out and slams the door behind him. two beats.
then he doubles over, weeping with laughter.

                           shrink
            vot a crackpot! monkey on ze back - hah!! roll
            out ze wacky wagon!!

now he notices a backpack, which stanley has left on the couch. it
twitches slightly - of its own free will.

                           voice in backpack
            imaginary, huh? you quack.
