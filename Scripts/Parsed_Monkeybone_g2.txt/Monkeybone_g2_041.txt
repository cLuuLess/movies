int. hyp's hideaway - that moment - night

stu is being dragged across the dance floor by the yeti and jumbo the
elephant god. hand woman brings up the rear.

                           jumbo
            who invited this schmuck, anyway?

                           hand woman
            oh, it's my fault. i thought he was cooler than
            that.

                           stu
            listen. please. it's my girlfriend. i've gotta
            get a message to her...

but just then a hush falls over the room, and someone screams...

                           woman's voice
            hyp!!!

a wall panel does a 180-degree turn, and a circular bed rotates into the
room. languishing atop it, garbed in a silk robe which exactly matches
the black & white checkerboard pattern of the bedspread...

...is a chubby, grinning, sleepy-eyed satyr, with horns and hooves. two
wasp women are with him on the bed, brushing his furry goat legs and
feeding him grapes.

as stu fights his way over, he sees an odd lump wriggling under the
bedcovers. out pops monkeybone, clutching a bottle of champagne!

                           monkeybone
            i knew i left it in there somewhere.

he shakes the bottle, pops the cork, and sprays spurting bubbly at
hypnos, the girls, and everyone else within firing range!

                           hypnos
            haw! i like a monkey with vision!

                           monkeybone
            you said it, partner!

hilarity all around. stu snatches monkeybone off the bed -

                           stu
            how'd you get in there?

                           monkeybone
            stu... it's a party.

                           stu
            mr. hypnos - sir - i needed to talk to you -

                           hypnos
            wait a minute. stu miley, right? boys and girls
            ...mr. stu miley, in the house!
                 (leading a round of applause)

            this is an honor. we see a lot of nightmares
            down here, but yours are like caviar, man. you
            da shits!!

                           stu
            mr. hypnos, i saw a dream. my girlfriend was
            having it. she dreamed they were pulling the
            plug on me. she was watching me die.

                           hypnos
            uh huh. and?

                           stu
            well, i have to get a message to her. i have to
            let her know i'm okay. until i can get out of
            here...

a vaguely embarrassed look crosses hypnos's face. all the nearby
darktowners stare at their shoes, clear their throats.

                           stu
            ...which is actually what i wanted to talk to
            you about. see, i've been here three months -

with a brusque gesture, hypnos sends the party girls packing. he slings
one arm around stu's shoulder and pulls him aside.

                           hypnos
            kid - didn't they tell you about this party?

                           stu
            tell me what?

                           hypnos
            it's a special kind of party. a farewell party.
            do you...get what i'm saying?

                           stu
            farewell? you mean - you mean i'm -

stu explodes with joy. he practically dances a jig.

                           stu
            i'm going home! i'm waking up! hey, everybody!
            i'm outta here. i...

one by one, the celebrants turn their backs and slink discreetly away.

                           stu
            i think i...i'm about to... am i mistaken, or
            don't i get to... is there some...

                           hypnos
            y'see, stu, as i understand it, you made this
            pact with your sister...no life support?

monkeybone's jaw drops. he slaps himself across the forehead.

                           monkeybone
            pact? pact? no life support??

                           stu
            well - yeah - but that doesn't...apply. it was
            different then. i was depressed. my life is
            great now. i'm in love!

monkeybone marches back and forth across the bed, wearing a dimwit's
expression as he mocks stu in a singsongy voice...

                           monkeybone
            pull the plug! pull the plug! take my organs! i
            don't need 'em! i don't need no! life support!
            i'm an idiot! pull the pl--

stu grabs the monkey and clamps a hand over his mouth.

                           stu
            besides, julie wouldn't...she'd never...

                           hypnos
            actually, stu, julie doesn't get to decide.
            that's why she was having the nightmare.
                 (an embarrassed shrug)

            they're pulling the plug at nine am.

                           stu
            nine am! but that's - twelve hours.

in checking his watch, stu removes his hand from monkeybone's mouth. the
singsong resumes...

                           monkeybone
            i'm so dumb! i deserve to die -

                           stu
            mr. hypnos, you run this place. i'm begging you.
            there's gotta be something i can do.

                           hypnos
            stu, i like you personally, i admire your work,
            but i'm just the god of sleep. this is death's
            bailiwick.

                           stu
            maybe you could talk to death!

                           hypnos
            me? me, go crawling to death? my friend, it will
            be a cold, cold day in las vegas, nevada, before
            i go crawling to that piece of -

hyp shuts up. looks around the room, as if he's afraid of being
overheard. then he gestures to the boys to join him on the bed.

they climb aboard eagerly. hypnos hits his remote...
