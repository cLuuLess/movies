ext. garage - afternoon

stu-bone and herb are standing outside the garage in formal attire as a
crew of zoo workers load monkeybone dolls into a pickup.

                           herb
            you're really gonna pop the question?

                           stu-bone
            got the ring. got the airline tickets. soon as
            they break that pi√±ata, we'll grab a cab - and
            it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.

                           herb
            i can't believe you. you used to hate being the
            center of attention. now you're proposing, in
            public, at a benefit.

                           stu-bone
            yeah, i was thinking...i mean, i'm a celebrity
            now, do i really want to get married? but on the
            other hand, if you're married, they can't
            testify against you.

herb wonders if this is a joke, decides it is, and forces a chuckle.
