int. stu's room - night

stu's readout monitors are registering frantic nightmare activity when
julie and alice enter. julie sets her purse on stu's bedside table -
removes a syringe and a test tube filled with purplish fluid.

                           julie
            what's the maximum safe dose?

                           alice
            most we've ever used is half a cc.

                           julie
            five cc's.
