int. hallway - night

the beaker clatters loudly as it rolls through the lab door. stu-bone's
hands grope through the doorway - but the female baboon has got him by
the pants leg and won't let go, no matter how much he rattles the cage.
he can't quite pull himself through the door...

he unbuckles the belt. unzips his pants. keeps clawing toward the
beaker. but he still can't quite make it, and the baboon won't let go.

now his pants are down around his knees. he keeps wriggling until his
pants legs are entirely inside out - and still he can't quite reach the
beaker! his shoes are caught in his pants cuffs! rrrrrippppp...

freedom! minus his pants, he grabs the beaker.

in fg through all this is a dim teenage janitor pushing his electric
floor polisher. he has his walkman on and he can't hear any of the
mayhem behind him. he sings along atonally with the music:

                           janitor
            gettin' jiggy wit' it - gettin' jiggy wit' it...
