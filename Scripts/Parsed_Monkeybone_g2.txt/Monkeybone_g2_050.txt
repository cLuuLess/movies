int. death's office - back to scene

the reaper in front of the boys stares at the e-ticket, crestfallen.

                           death
            take this to dark town. sad to say, he's gonna
            live another forty years.
                 (a consoling pat on the shoulder)
            sorry. nobody said this job would be easy.

the assistant hands the reaper a yellow mailman's pouch containing the
e-ticket. but before he can depart, the stained reaper - aka stu and
monkeybone - jumps to the front of the line.

                           monkeybone
            say, death, just out of curiosity, could we
            maybe swap jobs with that other guy? see, we've
            been meaning to drop in on dark town - i mean
            i've been meaning to...

death is stunned by this unprecedented breach of protocol. the other
reapers in the line are abuzz.

                           death
            ...i beg your pardon?

                           monkeybone
            i got relatives there. i...eep!!

closeup - on stu - under shroud

an enraged stu is yanking on monkeybone's tail, signalling him to shut
up. monkeybone, in pain, squeals repeatedly. finally he reaches down and
punches stu in the nose.
