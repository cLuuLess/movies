int. dungeon - right

stu's curled up on the dank floor when he's awakened by the sound of a
visitor in the corridor outside - kitty. she passes a sack containing
food and bottled water through the bars - and shushes the astonished stu
before he can speak.

                           kitty
            shh! you'll need it when you're traveling.

glancing back at the guards, she pulls a key from her cleavage.

                           kitty
            don't ask where i got it.

                           stu
            you can't do this! you'll get in trouble!

                           kitty
            you're the only true-hearted man i ever met. you
            find a way back to that girl of yours and make
            her happy.

                           stu
            how am i gonna get past the guards?

                           kitty
            i'll worry about the guards.
                 (loudly)

            okay, stu. see you in a day or two.

she turns down the corridor. stu stands there for a beat, gaping at the
key in his hand.

then he hears the sound of carnage outside. a ferocious, bloody battle
seems to be underway. realizing that kitty must be in trouble, he uses
the key to unlock the dungeon door.
