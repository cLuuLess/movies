ext. back yard - that moment - night

camera tracks in on the twitching face of buster, and we see

buster's dream (black & white)

a german-expressionist nightmare, all low angles and heavy shadows.
we're in some kind of operating room, where a struggling patient is
being wheeled in on a tall, creaking gurney. four orderlies in surgical
masks are holding him down.

the patient is buster. and the orderlies...are cats.

a cat surgeon draws the sheet back. looks at the spreadeagled buster.
and brandishes a big nasty pair of garden shears.
