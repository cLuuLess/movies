ext. trainyard - on bicycle - that moment

stu pedals onto the central turntable area. the batwings on the rear of
the bike flap feebly, but the flying bike just won't fly.

monkeybone looks over his shoulder. a small army of reapers, anned with
scythes, is pouring into the trainyard behind them.

                           monkeybone
            stu...stu...

                           stu
            it's not working.

                           monkeybone
            there's a thing here! there's a switch!

monkeybone fiddles with the ignition switch. a black cloud of exhaust
belches violently from the rear of the bike, almost pitching them off
their seat. the batwings start to flap faster...

sput. blap. the engine backfires and dies. stu fiddles with the switch,
but it's no go.

                           monkeybone
            stu...look!

                           stu
            what?

                           monkeybone
            isn't that lulu?

lulu is still sitting in her little car at the edge of the tracks, eyes
crossed, mouth agape. monkeybone waves brightly. then a mob of reapers
appears on either side of lulu's car, swarming out onto the tracks! stu
starts pedaling for his life.

he makes for the train tunnels in the far wall of the station.
illuminated signs over the tunnels read: calcutta...hong kong...waco, tx
...and directly ahead...

dark town!! by now they're well out onto the turnaround. stu pedals
frantically, bouncing over tracks and ties. monkeybone bites his
fingernails down to the quick as he watches the column of reapers
pursuing them onto the tracks.
