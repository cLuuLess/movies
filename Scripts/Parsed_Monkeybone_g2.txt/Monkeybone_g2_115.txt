ext. zoo - grounds - day

as herb is walking toward the refreshment table, an odd look crosses his
face. all at once he begins to tug at his collar. he yanks his tie off
...doffs his jacket onto the pavement...

pov herb - psycho-vision

the nightmare drug is kicking in! the whole zoo swims around him. all at
once he's being attacked...by a horde of empty clothes!!
