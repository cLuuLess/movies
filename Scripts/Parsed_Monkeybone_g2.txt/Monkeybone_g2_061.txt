ext. trainyard - on flying bike

monkeybone is sitting on stu's shoulder, facing backward, thumbing his
nose at the reapers. stu glances back as well, laughing, unable to
believe his own good luck.

since they're both looking the wrong way, neither of them sees the
sheer, monolithic wall rising up directly in their path.

it's no ordinary wall. it's stu's painting - the one alice found in the
closet, the wolf-surgeon canvas from his scary period -

- and as the bicycle slams into it, it begins to topple over - pinning
stu against the ground underneath!

stu's dreamscape

no bike. no monkey. just stu - who finds himself on an operating table,
with the world of the painting coming to 3-d life around him. the wolf-
faced surgeons are closing in on him, baring their fangs, brandishing
their scalpels and their metallic replacement parts...

suddenly the fabric of this weird reality tears - just like a rip in a
canvas. a furry paw reaches through - grabs stu by the hand...

                           monkeybone
            this ain't my nightmare!
