int. lobby - that moment - continuous

                           herb
            go? there's a potload of money here, pal. you
            got three major toy companies...you got the guys
            from burger god over here...

                           stu
            burger god. the ones that found the pig hair in
            the french fries?

                           herb
            never proven. they're ready to pop for a pre-
            emptive endorsement. kids love burger god -

the merchandisers shoot stu an expectant wave. stu waves back and turns
in the opposite direction. herb grabs him by the sleeve.

                           stu
            herb, it's too much. it's all out of hand.

                           herb
            do you know what kind of opportunity you have
            here? you gotta strike. i'm talking mansions.
            lamborghinis. champagne for mouthwash when you
            brush your teeth!

                           stu
            i don't want to be rich. it's just a trap!

                           herb
            being rich is not a trap. that is a dirty lie
            perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures
            from killing them.

                           stu
            herb. i have to go.

                           herb
            why?

                           stu
            i got the ring.
                 (beat)
            tonight's the night, herb. tonight's the night.

he nods toward julie, who's at the open bar grabbing two glasses of
punch. herb realizes a proposal is in the works.

                           herb
            oh my god...you're proposing?

                           stu
            my life was totally crappy, herb, and she...
            fixed it. she made me happy. which i'd never
            been. she loves me the way i am - right now.
                 (beat)

            i don't want everything to change. i don't want
            her saying yes to some big success. i just want
            her saying yes to me.

                           herb
            ...in some weird way i respect that.

julie's over by the punchbowl. she sees the two boys staring at her
conspiratorially - makes a face at them as she waves back.

                           herb
            okay then. if i get you out of here - you pop
            the question - tonight. or else. get me?

stu nods gravely.
