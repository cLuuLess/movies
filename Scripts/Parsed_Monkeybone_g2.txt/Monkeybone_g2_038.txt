int. hospital room (nightmare orb)

comatose stu stands in the center of the room, upright and immobile in a
party hat. a weird umbilical cord extends from his navel to a huge
groaning bellows device - like an artificial lung, it's all that keeps
him breathing.

edelstein hands a pair of oversized ceremonial scissors to kimmy, and
she cuts the cord, as if opening a new mall. applause all around. julie
races toward stu in slo-mo, shrieking -

- as he deflates into a limp puddle of flesh before her eyes!!

                           julie
            no. no. stu!
