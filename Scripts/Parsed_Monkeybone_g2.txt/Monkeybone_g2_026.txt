int. icu - morning

julie, in her white lab coat, wanders through intensive care and finds a
woman hunched over stu's bed, bawling her eyes out.

                           julie
            kimmy...?

kimmy looks up. she's crying so much she can barely recognize julie.

                           kimmy
            oh, julie...my poor stu...my poor baby
            brother...

                           julie
            when'd you get in?

                           kimmy
            an hour ago.
                 (gathering herself)
            i tried to prepare myself, but i didn't know he
            would be like, like this. i can't even bear to
            look at him... how about you? you're okay?

                           julie
            i'm fine, kimmy. fine.

                           kimmy
            i had so much i always wanted to say to him. at
            least he had a chance to give you the ring.

                           julie
            the ring...

                           kimmy
            grandmama's ring. the engagement ring. he asked
            me to send it to him -

julie turns to look at stu in the bed. the certain knowledge that he was
about to propose is like a knife in her heart. kimmy feels bad as well,
having let the cat out of the bag, but before they can hash it out -

                           voice from behind
            mrs. brewster? julie? i'm dr. edelstein.

cheery dr. edelstein enters. he shakes hands with the women, then checks
stu's readouts, making notations on his clipboard.

                           dr. edelstein
            vital signs have stabilized. that's good.

                           kimmy
            can you give us a realistic sense of my
            brother's chances?

                           dr. edelstein
            he's held on this far. we can't do much but wait
            and see.

                           kimmy
            but these...machines are what's keeping him
            alive, is that right?

this remark sends a shiver down julie's spine, but she keeps silent.

                           dr. edelstein
            at the moment, yes.

                           kimmy
            can you give me a realistic idea...of how long
            this is going to last?

                           dr. edelstein
            comas are unpredictable. he could wake up today,
            tomorrow, a month from now...

                           kimmy
            honey, i have to clarify this. the thing is, dr.
            edelstein, my brother has an absolute horror of
            doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -

                           julie
            kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. he
            doesn't even know he's in a -

                           kimmy
            please, julie. this is not easy for me. our
            father took a long time to die. a long time. it
            just about killed us all. and stu and i made a
            pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let
            it drag out.

                           julie
            it's too soon even to - talk about that!

                           kimmy
            give me a date, doctor.

                           dr. edelstein
            three months.
                 (pause)

            there's always some brain damage. but at three
            months...the chances of coming back shrink
            dramatically with every day.

                           kimmy
            i want him to have every chance, doctor. we can
            certainly give it...three months.

no one says anything. but both women look at stu, and then at each
other, and everyone knows exactly where everyone else stands. julie has
a sinking feeling that stu is working on a 3-month deadline.

                                                dissolve to:

insert - television screen

a beauty pageant - shapely ingenues in evening gowns being introduced by
an emcee with enormous teeth.

                           emcee
            and now the last of our five finalists...miss
            michigan...george t. willoughby!

george is a pudgy shmoe with a small pencil mustache who's wearing
glasses, a necktie, and nothing else. he steps forward, holding a
briefcase in front of his crotch, looking extremely mortified.

                           emcee
            and now george will give us his analysis of
            heisenberg's uncertainty principle as it
            pertains to third-world economics!!

camera pulls back - and we realize we're in:
