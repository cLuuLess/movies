int. hospital - operating room - day

a team of surgeons. the lead surgeon has his arm buried up to the elbow
in the open torso of an organ donor.

                           surgeon
            okay...detaching the left kidney...

screams all around as the organ donor sits bolt upright! the startled
surgeon drops the kidney back into place.

                           organ donor
            what the - who the hell am i??

                           surgeon
            you're an organ donor!

                           organ donor
            am i dead?!?

                           surgeon
            the chute didn't open. we kind of assumed -

                           organ donor
            i need this body. just for a few minutes. i'll
            bring it back, okay?

the organ donor grabs a lab coat from a nearby rack and races out. (and
since stu is temporarily occupying the donor's body, we will henceforth
refer to him as o.d. stu.)
