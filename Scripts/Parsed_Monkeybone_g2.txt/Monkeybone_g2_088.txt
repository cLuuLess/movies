int. bedroom - night

a disheveled stu-bone, back from his secret mission, is trying to take
his clothes off so he won't wake julie. but she starts to rouse, so he
jumps into bed fully dressed and pulls up the covers.

                           julie
            stu? is that you? where did you go?

                           stu-bone
            me? nowhere. i was asleep.

                           julie
            baby, don't lie. i know you went out.

                           stu-bone
            not me. nope. you must've been dreaming.

she pulls the covers back. he's still wearing his topcoat, shoes, socks,
and shorts...but no pants.

                           julie
            you're wearing a topcoat, stu. - where are your
            pants?

                           stu-bone
            well, miss smarty, if i didn't go out, i
            wouldn't need any pants. now would i?

he pulls the covers up to his chin. the two of them lie there in the
dark staring up at the ceiling.
