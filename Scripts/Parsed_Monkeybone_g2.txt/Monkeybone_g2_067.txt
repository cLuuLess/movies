ext. dark town plaza - that moment - right

onlookers applaud as the robot lifts its mallet and lets fly. ding!! the
tiny figure of monkeybone soars toward the swirling colors. his dart-
helmet strikes the black hole dead center.

stu watches helplessly as monkeybone penetrates the veil of the sky and
vanishes. he's still screaming when the cackling darktowners drag him
out of the plaza by the heels...

                           stu
            no! julie! no-o-o-o!

aerial shot - on monkeybone

rocketing upward through the clouds in his dart-helmet, a look of sheer
exhilaration on his simian face. somewhere a clock begins to chime the
hour...
