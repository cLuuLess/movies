int. hospital room - that moment - night

tight on an eeg monitor. there's a sudden blip on the readout.

                           nurse
            just a spike, ma'am. it happens. it's perfectly
            natural with coma patients.

                           julie
            i'm a doctor too. i know this man's brain -

julie strokes stu's limp hand. he's comatose, cocooned in a tangle of
wires and tubes. his head and shoulders are heavily bandaged. he's
hooked up to as much machinery as you can cram into one room.

                           doctor
            go home, doctor. rest. come back when you can do
            us some good.
