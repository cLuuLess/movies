int. car - night - moving

stu backs out of his space. the small parking lot is full of delivery
trucks from would-be merchandisers - all too large for the spaces
they're parked in. stu has to keep backing up because the exit lanes are
blocked. it's like negotiating a labyrinth.

                           stu
            look at this! he won't let us leave!

                           julie
            who?

                           stu
            the monkey!! he's everywhere! he'll take over
            both our lives if we let him.

                           julie
            stu - stop it. that monkey is good luck. you
            thought him up, and everybody loves him, and
            he's probably going to make you rich. so relax!
            enjoy it!

                           stu
            i'm trying. it's weird, that's all. i never had
            any good luck, until i met you...what if it's
            all just another bad dream?

                           julie
            what's the "bad" part?

                           stu
            i might wake up.

                           julie
                 (laughing; taking his hand)

            if you do, i'll be right there beside you. so
            face it. you're just going to have to be happy!

                           stu
            i am happy. it just so happens this is the
            happiest night of my life.

he says it so solemnly that she cracks up. after a moment he joins in.
