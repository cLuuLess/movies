ext. parking lot - that moment - night

a plastic banner stretches between two poles on either side of the entry
to the lot. it shows monkeybone in a typical languorous pose:

                  it's his world. we just live in it!
                               monkeybone
                        sunday nights this fall

two guys on extension ladders are taking the sign down as stu's car
idles at the exit below. there's a strong wind tonight, and one guy
loses hold of his end of the banner just as he gets it detached...
