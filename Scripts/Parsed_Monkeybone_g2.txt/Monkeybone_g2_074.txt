int. hallway - a moment later

all at once the air is full of barry white's lush baritone on the
bedroom cd player. through the bedroom doorway we see stu-bone and julie
waltzing romantically, belly to belly, still wrapped up in the single
robe.

the only jarring note is buster's frantic barking. the poor dog is stuck
behind an accordion gate in the hall, going crazy, trying to warn his
mistress about the imposter in stu's body. the dog is almost drowning
out barry white -

- so stu-bone stops kissing julie long enough to reach over with one
foot and kick the door shut.
