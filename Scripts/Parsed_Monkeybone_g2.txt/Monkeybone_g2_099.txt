int. hyp's hideaway - that moment - night

the dark town audience is scratching its collective head at buster's
dream, which is showing in one of hyp's nightmare orbs. an angry hypnos
slams down the phone and storms across the dance floor to his big
circular bed.

                           hypnos
            dog dreams!! that stinkin' monkey. i can't
            believe it. we give him a body, and he sends us
            ...dogs.

a feline beauty embraces him from behind, pulls him onto the bed.

                           kitty
            let's not think about dogs. let's think about
            pussycats. meeowwwwwwrrrr....

she draws one sharp claw lightly down his chest. he gives her a now-
you're-talkin' grin and hits a switch - causing the big circular bed to
rotate off the dance floor and into the boudoir.

as it turns, we see kitty's paw closing discreetly around a key chain on
the nightstand...
