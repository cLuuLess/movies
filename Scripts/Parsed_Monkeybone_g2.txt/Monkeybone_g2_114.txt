ext. stu and julie's house - day

o.d. stu exits, ring in hand. behind him, buster is throwing a fit -
barking, flinging himself at the screen door. he wants to come along!

a bus pulls up at the corner, and o.d. stu boards it. buster throws
everything he's got at the door - and it gives! he takes off after stu.
