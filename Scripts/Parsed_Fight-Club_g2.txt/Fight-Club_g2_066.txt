     ext. paper street - night

     a street sign: "paper street."  a paper mill stis on one
     side, facing a lone house on the other.  the rest of the
     land is grass and weeds.  it's a grand, old three-story,
     long abandoned.  tyler leads jack toward it.

                             jack
                 where's your car?

                             tyler
                 what car?

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i don't know how tyler found the
                 house, but he'd been there for half
                 a year.
