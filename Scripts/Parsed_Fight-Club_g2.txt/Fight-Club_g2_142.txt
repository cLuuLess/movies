     int. airplane cabin - on ground - day

     two airplane maintenance,men, with bruised faces, rip open
     a box from a print shop.  they dig up airplane safety
     instruction cards and begin inserting them into each
     seatback.  we see a card - it shows passengers screaming
     and flailing about in terror.
