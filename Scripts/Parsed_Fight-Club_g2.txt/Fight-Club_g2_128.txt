     int. kitchen -- morning

     jack has his briefcase on the table, looks at paperwork.
     tyler wanders in, carries a dirty pot to the sink.  jack
     takes out a cigarette, lights up.  he offers the pack...

                             tyler
                 no thanks, i quit.

                             jack
                 you quit?

                             tyler
                 yeah.  where you headed?

                             jack
                 work.  going to work.

     tyler scratches his chin absently.

                             jack
                 what... ?

                             tyler
                 nothing.  do what you like.

     tyler walks out the way he came.
