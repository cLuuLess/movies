     int. living room - moments later

     jack opens the door.  ricky stands on the porch, staring
     ahead in subordinate military style.  he's in black pants,
     black shirt, black shoes, holds a paper bag, with an army
     surplus mattress rolled-up at his feet.

                             jack
                 um... what can i do for you, ricky?

     tyler steps up beside jack, looks ricky over.

                             tyler
                 you're too young.  sorry.

                             jack
                 wait a minute...

     tyler comes back inside, shuts the door.

                             jack
                 "too young?"

                             tyler
                 if the applicant is young, we tell
                 him he's too young.  old, too old.
                 fat, too fat.

                             jack
                 "applicant?"

                             tyler
                 if the applicant waits at the door
                 for three days without food, shelter
                 or encouragement, then he can enter
                 and begin training.

                             jack
                 "training?"  tyler...
