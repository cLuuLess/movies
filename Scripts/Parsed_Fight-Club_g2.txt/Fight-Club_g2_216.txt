     int. lobby

     jack hurries to the front door, his suitcase half-broken
     open, passing the front desk.  a desk clerk calls after him.

                             desk clerk
                 sir... sir?  are you checking out?

                             jack
                 yes.

     the clerk follows the length of the counter, waves a paper.

                             desk clerk
                 please initial this list of phone
                 calls.

                             jack
                 bill me!

     jack goes out the door, freezes.  he rushes back in, going
     to the desk -- snatches the bill, studies it: many numbers.

                             jack
                 wait...when were these made?

                             desk clerk
                 it says right there, sir... between
                 two and three-thirty this morning.

     jack looks at the clerk, at the bill, at the clerk.

                             jack
                 i need a copy of this.
