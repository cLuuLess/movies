     tyler and jack share the cracked mirror.  tyler's clipping
     at his hair with blunt, ill-suited scissors.  jack's
     brushing his teeth, spitting out pink foam.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 fight club became the reason to cut
                 your hair short and trim your
                 fingernails.

                             tyler
                 any historical figure.

                             jack
                 okay... ghandi.

                             tyler
                 good answer.

                             jack
                 you?

                             tyler
                 abe lincoln.  big reach.  skinny guys
                 fight till they're burger.

     jack reaches in his mouth, exploring, pulls -- yanks a
     tooth.  jack looks at it.  tyler puts scissors down, done.

                             tyler
                 remember, even the mona lisa's
                 falling apart.

     jack drops the tooth in the sink with tyler's hair.
