     int. airplane cabin - in flight - night

     jack sits next to a frumpy woman.  they chat.  jack turns to
     look at his food, takes a bite.  he turns back and it's...

     --a bald man next to him, talking.  jack takes another bite,
     turns back and it's...

     --a businessman next to him.  jack takes another bite, turns
     back, and it's...

     --a business woman next to him.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 the people i meet on each flight --
                 they're single-serving friends.
                 between take-off and landing, we have
                 our time together, but that's all we
                 get.
