     int. kitchen - night - (resuming)

     the mechanic looks up from bob's corpse.

                             mechanic
                 they shot bob... they shot him in the
                 head.  those fuckers...

     jack walks away from bob's corpse, distraught, holds his
     head, turns to look back, his eyes filling with tears.

                             another space monkey
                 we gotta do something.

                             ricky
                 we got to get rid of the evidence.
                 we have to get rid of this body.

                             angel face
                 bury him...

     jack looks around in disbelief.

                             jack
                 what... ?

                             angel face
                 the garden.  take him there.  move,
                 people.  let's do this!

     several space monkeys gather around bob's body.

                             jack
                 no... !

     space monkeys stop.  jack gets between them and bob, shoves
     a few space monkeys back...

                             jack
                 get your hands off him!  get off...!
                 what the hell do you think you're
                 doing... ? evidence?!  this is a
                 man... !  you killed him!

                             angel face
                 he was killed in action.

                             jack
                 no!  look at you!  you're... you're
                 running around in ski masks,
                 exploding things...

                             angel face
                 he was killed serving project mayhem.

                             ricky
                 it's what he would have wanted, sir.

                             jack
                 what he wanted?  look... look at him.
                 look at him!  what does he want?
                       (wipes tears,
                        points at bob)
                 this is a person.  this is not a cog
                 in your machine...

                             ricky
                 but, this is project mayhem.

                             jack
                 no, no.  this is a man -- this man
                 has a name...

                             ricky
                 but, in project mayhem, we have no
                 names.

                             jack
                 no!  wrong!  this man's name is
                 robert paulson.

                             ricky
                 robert paulson?

                             jack
                 robert paulson is dead.  he's dead,
                 because of you...

                             mechanic
                 i understand.

     everyone just stares at jack.

                             mechanic
                 in death, a member of project mayhem
                 has a name.

                             jack
                 no -- !

                             mechanic
                 his name is robert paulson.

                             ricky
                 his name is robert paulson!

                             jack
                 no!

                             all space monkeys
                 his name is robert paulson!

                             jack
                 stop that -- !

                             all space monkeys
                       (louder)
                 his name is robert paulson!  his name
                 is robert paulson...

     jack backs away, surrounded, pushes his way out of the room.
