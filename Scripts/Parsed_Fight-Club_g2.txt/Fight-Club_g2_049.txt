     int. baggage claim area - night

     utterly empty of baggage.  no people except for jack and a
     security task force man.  the security tfm, smirking, holds
     a receiver to his ear from an official phone on the wall.

                             security tfm
                       (to jack)
                 throwers don't worry about ticking.
                 modern bombs don't tick.

                             jack
                 excuse me?  "throwers?"

                             security tfm
                 baggage handlers.  but when a
                 suitcase vibrates, the throwers have
                 to call the police.

                             jack
                 my suitcase was vibrating?

                             security tfm
                 nine time out of ten, it's an
                 electric razor.  but, every once in
                 a while ...
                       (whispers)
                 ...it's a dildo.  it's airline policy
                 not to imply ownership in the event
                 of a dildo.  we use the indefinite
                 aricle: "a dildo."  never "your
                 dildo."

     jack sees, through the window, tyler, at the curb, throwing
     his briefcase into the back of a shiny, red convertible.
     tyler leaps over the door into the driver's seat and peels
     out.  jack turns away, looks at the security tfm.

     in the background, a harried man dashes after tyler and the
     convertible, screaming.

                             jack
                       (to security tfm)
                 i had everything in that bag.  my
                 c.k. shirts... my d.k.n.y. shoes...

                             security tfm
                       (into phone)
                 yeah, uh huh... yeah?
                       (pause, still on phone)
                 oh...
