     ext. parking lot of tavern - resuming

     tyler and jack come out the back door.

                             jack
                 i don't know about this.

                             tyler
                 i don't know, either.  i want to find
                 out.  i've never been hit, have you?

                             jack
                 no.  that's a good thing, isn't it?

                             tyler
                 i don't want to die without any
                 scars.  how much can you really know
                 about yourself if you've never been
                 in a fight?  come on... you're the
                 only person i've ever asked.

                             jack
                 me?

     jack stares at him.

                             tyler
                 why not you?  i'm letting you go
                 first.  do it.

                             jack
                 this is crazy.

                             tyler
                 alright, go crazy.  let 'er rip.

                             jack
                 where do you want it?  in the face?

                             tyler
                 surprise me.

     jack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse -- hits tyler's
     neck -- makes a dull, flat sound.

                             jack
                 shit.  sorry.  that didn't count.

                             tyler
                 like hell.  that counted.

     tyler shoots out a straight punch to jack's chest.  jack
     falls back against a car.  his eyes tear up.

                             tyler
                 how do you feel?

                             jack
                 strange.

                             tyler
                 but a good strange.

                             jack
                 is it?

                             tyler
                 we've crossed the threshold.  you
                 want to call it off?

                             jack
                 call what off?

                             tyler
                 the fight.

                             jack
                 what fight?

                             tyler
                 this fight, pussy.

     jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under
     tyler's ear.  tyler punches jack in the stomach.  tyler and
     jack move clumsily, throwing punches.  they breathe heavier,
     drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact.
