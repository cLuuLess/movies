     int. basement - day

     jack sits on basement stairs, watching as tyler, knee-deep
     in water, works at an open fusebox, flipping breakers in a
     certain order, showing jack how it's done.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 when it rained, we had to kill the
                 power.  by the end of the first
                 month, i didn't care about tv.  i
                 didn't mind the warm, stale
                 refrigerator.
