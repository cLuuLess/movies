     ext. sculpture park - night (flashback)

     a sculpture adorned with a giant globe on top.

                             mechanic (v.o.)
                 we were supposed to kill two birds
                 with one stone:

     a series of explosions blasts the globe free.  it rolls...

                             mechanic (v.o.)
                 a piece of corporate art...

     the globe rolls downhill, to the street -- rolling over one
     parked luxury car after another, crunching car roofs and
     causing windows to explode...

                             mechanic (v.o.)
                 ... and trash a trendy coffee bar.

     then, the globe arrives at the lobby of a hotel...
     broadsides a limo, ricochets... rolls directly into the
     front of a closed arrosto coffee bar, smashing windows...
     decimating coffee push-pats...
