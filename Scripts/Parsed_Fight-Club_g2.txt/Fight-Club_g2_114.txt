     jack's leaving, looks like a war casualty, passing coworkers
     who coldly stare at him.  his face is totally passive.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i got right in everyone's hostile
                 little face.  yes, these are bruises
                 from fighting.  i'm comfortable with
                 them.  i am enlightened.
