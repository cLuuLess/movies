     int. projectionist room - theatre - night

     jack, in the foreground, faces camera.  in the background,
     tyler sits at a bench, looking at individual frames cut from
     movies.  near him, a projector rolls film.

                             jack
                 tyler was a night person.  he
                 sometimes worked as a projectionist.
                 a movie doesn't come in one big reel,
                 it's on a few.  in old theaters, two
                 projectors are used, so someone has
                 to change projectors at the exact
                 second when one reel ends and
                 another reel begins.  sometimes you
                 can see two dots on screen in the
                 upper right hand corner...

     tyler points to the side of our frame and the two dots
     briefly appear onscreen.

                             tyler
                 they're called "cigarette burns."

                             jack
                 it's called a "changeover."  the
                 movie goes on, and nobody in the
                 audience has any idea.

                             tyler
                 why would anyone want this shitty job?

                             jack
                 it affords him other interesting
                 opportunities.

                             tyler
                 -- like splicing single frames from
                 adult movies into family films.

                             jack
                 in reel three, right after the
                 courageous dog and the snooty cag --
                 who have celebrity voices -- eat out
                 of a garbage can, there's the flash
                 of tyler's contribution...

     in the audience, children suddenly start squirming,
     confused, looking at each other.

     a woman abruptly stops sucking her soda straw, feeling
     vaguely terrible.  her uncomfortable husband slowly leans
     back in his seat.

     jack and tyler watch from the projection booth window.

                             tyler
                 one-forty-eighth of a second.  that's
                 how long it's up there.

                             jack
                 no one really knows that they've seen it.
                 but they did.

                             tyler
                 a nice, big cock.

                             jack
                 only a hummingbird could have caught
                 tyler at work.
