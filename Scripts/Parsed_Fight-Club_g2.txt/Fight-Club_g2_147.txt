     ext. behind the convenience store - moments later

     the back door opens and tyler brings the store's clerk out
     at gunpoint, forces him to his knees.  jack follows,
     freaked.  tyler points the gun at the clerk.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 on a long enough time line, the
                 survival rate for everyone drops to
                 zero.

                             clerk
                 please... don't...

                             tyler
                 give me your wallet.

     the clerk fumbles his wallet out of his pocket and tyler
     snatches it.  tyler pulls out the driver's licence.

                             tyler
                 raymond k. hessel. 1320 se benning,
                 apartment a.  a small, cramped
                 basement apartment.

                             raymond
                 how'd you know?

                             tyler
                 they give basement apartments letters
                 instead of numbers.  raymond, you're
                 going to die.

     tyler rummages through the wallet.

                             tyler
                 is this a picture of mom and dad?

                             raymond
                 yesssss...

                             tyler
                 your mom and dad will have to call
                 kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up
                 your dental records, because there
                 won't be much left of your face.

                             raymond
                 please, god, no...

     raymond begins to weep, shoulders heaving.

                             jack
                 tyler...

                             tyler
                 an expired community college student
                 id card.  what did you used to study,
                 raymond k. hessel?

                             raymond
                 s-s-stuff.

                             tyler
                 "stuff."  were the mid-terms hard?

     tyler rams the gun barrel against raymond's temple.

                             tyler
                 i asked you what you studied.

                             jack
                 tell him!

                             raymond
                 biology, mostly.

                             tyler
                 why?

                             raymond
                 i... i don't know...

                             tyler
                 what did you want to be, raymond k.
                 hessel?

     raymond weeps and says nothing.  tyler cocks the gun.
     raymond gasps.

                             tyler
                 the question, raymond, was "what did
                 you want to be?"

     a beat.

                             jack
                 answer him!

                             raymond
                 a veterinarian!

                             tyler
                 animals.

                             raymond
                 yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---

                             tyler
                 stuff.  that means you have to get
                 more schooling.

                             raymond
                 too much school.

     tyler shoves raymond's wallet back into raymond's pocket.

                             tyler
                 would you rather be dead?

                             raymond
                 no, please, no, god, no!

     tyler moves the gun right between raymond's eyes.

                             raymond
                 nooooo!

     tyler uncocks the gun, lowers it.

                             tyler
                 i'm keeping your license.  i know
                 where you live.  i'm going to check
                 on you.  if you aren't back in school
                 and on your way to being a
                 veterinarian in six weeks, you will
                 be dead.  get the hell out of here.

     raymond staggers to his feet, heads down an alleyway.  jack
     and tyler watch raymond flee, then tyler looks at jack.

                             jack
                   i feel sick.

                             tyler
                   imagine how he feels.

     tyler brings the gun to his own head, pulls the trigger --
     click.  empty.

                             jack
                 i don't care, that was horrible.

     tyler walks away.

                             tyler
                 tomorrow will be the most beautiful
                 day of raymond k. hessell's life.

     jack watches tyler go.

                             tyler
                 his breakfast will taste better than
                 any meal he has ever eaten.

     jack turns to look the direction raymond ran.  he finally
     turns back, following after tyler.
