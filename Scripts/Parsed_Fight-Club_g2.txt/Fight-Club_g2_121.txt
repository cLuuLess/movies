     int. jack's office - day

     jack sits at his desk, playing a game on his computer,
     smoking a cigarette.  boss enters.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 he was wearing a yellow tie.  it must
                 be thursday.  i didn't even wear a tie
                 to work anymore.

     boss slaps a piece of paper down on jack's desk.

                             boss
                 "the first rule of fight club is you
                 don't talk about fight club."

     jack snuffs his cigarette in an ashtray, stares up stoically.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i must've left the original in the
                 copy machine.

                             boss
                 "the second rule of fight club...
                 is this yours?

                             jack
                 hmm?

                             boss
                 you don't get paid to abuse the copy
                 machine.

                             jack
                 "abuse" the copy machine.  there's an
                 image.

                             boss
                 pretend you're me.  you find this.
                 what would you do?

     jack rises slowly, walks to his door, shuts it.

                             jack
                 me? i'd be very careful who i talked
                 to about this.  it sounds like
                 someone dangerous wrote it... someone
                 who might snap at any moment,
                 stalking from office to office with
                 an armalite ar-10 carbine-gas
                 semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round
                 after round into colleagues and co-
                 workers.

     jack moves very close to boss, picks up the paper and starts
     tearing it into pieces.

                             jack
                 might be someone you've known for
                 years... somebody very close to you.
                 or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing
                 me every little piece of trash you
                 pick up.

     jack puts the paper in his trash.  bass stares with a tinge
     of outrage, a tinge of fear.  phone rings.  jack answers it.

                             jack
                 compliance and liability.

                             marla's voice
                 my tit's going to rot off.

                             jack
                 just a second.
                       (to boss; smiles)
                 could you excuse me?  i need to take
                 this call.

     boss goes to the door, stares at jack a beat, then leaves.

                             jack
                       (into phone)
                 what are you talking about?

     intercut with - close up of marla...

                             marla
                 would you do something for me?  i
                 need you to check and see if there's
                 a lump in my breast.  i can't afford
                 to throw money away on a doctor.

                             jack
                 i don't know ...

                             marla
                 please.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 she didn't call tyler.  i'm neutral
                 in her book.
