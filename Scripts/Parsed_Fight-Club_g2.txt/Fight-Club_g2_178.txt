     ext. porch - day

     jack looks out the window.  bob stands motionless.  there's
     another "applicant," a short guy, beside bob.  ricky comes
     out the front door with the broom...

                             ricky
                       (to bob)
                 you're too fucking old, fatty!  we
                 don't want your kind here!
                       (to short guy)
                 you're too short.  go away, stumpy!
                 go back to the circus!

     ricky hits them with the broom, then goes in, slams the door.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 so it went...
