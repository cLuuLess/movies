     int. lou's tavern - same

     jack and tyler sit in the back, with a pitcher of beer.

                             jack
                 you buy furniture.  you tell
                 yourself: this is the last sofa i'll
                 ever need.  no matter what else
                 happens, i've got the sofa issue
                 handled.  then, the right set of
                 dishes.  the right dinette.

                             tyler
                 this is how we fill up our lives.

     tyler lights a cigarette.

                             jack
                 i guess so.

                             tyler
                 and, now it's gone.

                             jack
                 all gone.

     tyler offers cigarettes.  jack declines.

                             tyler
                 could be worse.  a woman could cut
                 off your penis while you're asleep
                 and toss it out the window of a
                 moving car.

                             jack
                 there's always that.

                             tyler
                 i don't know, maybe i'm wrong.  maybe
                 it's a terrible tragedy.

                             jack
                 ...no ...no ...

                             tyler
                 i mean, you did lose a lot of nice,
                 neat little shit.  the trendy paper
                 lamps, the euro-trash shelving unit,
                 am i right?

     jack laughs, nods.  he shakes his head, drinks.

                             tyler
                 but maybe, just maybe, you've been
                 delivered.

                             jack
                       (toasts)
                 delivered from swedish furniture.

                             tyler
                 delivered from armchairs in obscure
                 green stripe patterns.

                             jack
                 delivered from martha stewart.

                             tyler
                 delivered from bullshit colors like
                 "cobalt," "ebony," and "fuchsia."

     they laugh together.  then, silence.  they drink.

                             jack
                 insurance'll cover it.

                             tyler
                 oh, yeah, you gotta start making the
                 list.

                             jack
                 what list?

                             tyler
                 the "now i get to go out and buy the
                 exact same stuff all over again"
                 list.  that list.

                             jack
                 i don't... think so.

                             tyler
                 this time maybe get a widescreen tv.
                 you'll be occupied for weeks.

                             jack
                 well, i have to file a claim...

                             tyler
                 the things you own, they end up
                 owning you.

                             jack
                 don't i?

                             tyler
                 do what you like.

                             jack
                       (looks at watch)
                 god, it's late.  i should find a
                 hotel...

                             tyler
                 a hotel?

                             jack
                 yeah.

                             tyler
                 so, you called me up, because you
                 just wanted to have a drink before
                 you... go find a hotel?

                             jack
                 i don't follow...

                             tyler
                 we're on our third pitcher of beer.
                 just ask me.

                             jack
                 huh?

                             tyler
                 you called me so you could have a
                 place to stay.

                             jack
                 no, i...

                             tyler
                 why don't you cut the shit and ask if
                 you can stay at my place?

                             jack
                 would that be a problem?

                             tyler
                 is it a problem for you to ask?

                             jack
                 can i stay at your place?

                             tyler
                 yes, you can.

                             jack

                 can.
