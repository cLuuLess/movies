     ext. street - day

     ricky trips a passing yuppie.  the yuppie falls.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 not as easy as it sounds.  people'll
                 do just about anything to avoid a
                 fight.

     the yuppies gets up, angry, and ricky punches him...

                             yuppie
                 hey!  wha... what the hell... what
                 are you doing?!  who are you?!!

     the yuppie backs away.  ricky follows...

                             yuppie
                 get away from me!  keep away!
                 no... !

     ricky tackles the yuppie.  the yuppie struggles spastically.

                             yuppie
                 who are you!?  why are you attacking
                 me... ?!

     having no recourse, the yuppie begins trading blows.
