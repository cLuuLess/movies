     convenience store.  jack wears a backpack.

                             tyler
                 let me have that a minute...

     tyler takes the backpack, unzips it, searching the contents.

                             jack
                 what are we doing?

                 homework assignment.

                             jack
                 what is it?

     tyler takes out a handgun, hands the backpack back.

                             tyler
                 human sacrifice.

     jack turns white, staring at the gun.
