     int. first methodist church meeting room - night

     jack stares at a group of men, including bob, who are all
     listening to a group member speak at a lectern.  the speaker
     has pale skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying.

                             speaker
                 i... wanted three kids.  two boys and
                 a girl.  mindy wanted two girls and
                 one boy.  we never could agree on
                 anything.

     the speaker cracks a sad smile.  some men chuckle, happy to
     lighten the mood.

                             speaker
                 well, she had her first child a month
                 ago, a girl, with her new husband...
                 and, thank god.  i'm glad for her,
                 because she deserves...

     the speaker breaks down, weeps uncontrollably.

     jack watches.  a couple of the men go up to the speaker,
     comforting him, leading him away.  a leader takes the stand.

                             leader
                 everyone, let's thank thomas for
                 sharing himself with us.

     jack, uncomfortable, joins everyone else:

                             everyone
                       (in unison)
                 thank you, thomas.

                             leader
                 i look around this room and i see a
                 lot of courage.  and it gives me
                 strength.  we give each other
                 strength.

     jack looks around.  many of the men are sniffling, sobbing.
     jack squirms in his seat.

                             leader
                 it's time for the one-on-one.  let's
                 follow thomas's example and open
                 ourselves.

     everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off.
     jack stands, uncomfortable.

                             leader
                 can everyone find a partner?

     bob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward jack,
     shuffling his feet.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 the big moosie, his eyes already
                 shrink-wrapped in tears.  knees
                 together, invisible steps.

     bob takes jack into an embrace.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 bob was a champion bodybuilder.  you
                 know that chest expansion program you
                 see on tv?  that was his idea.

                             bob
                 ...using steroids.  i was a juicer.
                 diabonol, then, wisterol -- it's for
                 racehorses, for christsake.  now i'm
                 bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids
                 won't return my calls...

                             jack (v.o.)
                 strangers with this kind of honesty
                 make me go a big rubbery one.

     bob breaks into sobbing, putting his head on jack's shoulder
     and completely covering jack's face.  after a long beat of
     crying, bob raises up his head, looks at jack's nametag.

                             bob
                 go ahead, cornelius.  you can cry.

     they look at each other.  slowly, jack's eyes grow wet.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 then... something happened.  i was
                 lost in oblivion -- dark and silent
                 and complete.

     bob pulls jack's head back into his chest.  jack tightens
     his arms around bob.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i found freedom.  losing all hope was
                 freedom.

     jack pulls away from bob.  on bob's chest, there's a wet
     mask of jack's face from how he looks weeping.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 babies don't sleep this well.
