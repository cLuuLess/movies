     jack, bewildered, enters carrying beers.  tyler does not
     follow.  bob, ricky and several other fight club guys sit in
     front at the tv, chanting not too loudly, all also dressed
     in fatigues and splattered with paint.

                             ricky
                 you are not your job.

                             others together
                 you are not your job.

                             ricky
                 you are not how much money you have
                 in the bank.

                             bob
                 shhhh, wait... they're back to it...

     bob goes to turn up the tv.  one guy, sixteen years old with
     an angelic face, angel face, gets up to take beer from jack.

                             angel face
                       (to jack)
                 great, thanks.

     angel face starts distributing beer amongst his cohorts.

                             bob
                 shhhhh!  watch!

     jack looks to the tv -- it shows a live shot of the "parker
     morris building."  the building has a giant, grinning face
     painted on it -- two broken windows for eyes, with flames
     pouring out... firetrucks spray water.

                             reporter (v.o.)
                 police commissioner jacobs has just
                 arrived... just a second... excuse
                 me, commissioner, could you tell us
                 what you think has happened?

     commissioner jacobs, a wrinkled official, turns to camera.

                             commissioner jacobs (v.o.)
                 we believe this is related to the
                 recent acts of vandalism around the
                 city.  it's some kind of organized
                 group, and we are coordinating a
                 rigorous investigation.

     jack turns, sees tyler in the archway, watching him.  tyler
     tips his beer to toast, pulls back, out of sight.

                             jack
                 what did you guys do?

     they all burst into laughter.  they look at jack and shake
     their heads.  jack doesn't get it.  suddenly, the guys'
     faces turn to stone.  bob sits rigid.

                             bob
                 the first rule of project mayhem
                 is... you do not ask questions.

     jack stares at them.

                                                      cut to:
