     marla walks with authority up to an unwatched dryer.  she
     takes out clothes, picks out jeans, pants and shirts.

                             marla
                 i'll take the parasites.

                             jack
                 you can't have both parasites.  you
                 can take blood parasites --

                             marla
                 i want brain parasites.

                             jack
                 okay.  i'll take blood parasites and
                 organic brain dementia --

                             marla
                 i want that.

                             jack
                 you can't have the whole brain!

                             marla
                 so far, you have four and i only have
                 two!

                             jack
                 then, take blood parasites.  it's
                 yours.  now we each have three.

     marla gathers the chosen garments and heads out past jack...
