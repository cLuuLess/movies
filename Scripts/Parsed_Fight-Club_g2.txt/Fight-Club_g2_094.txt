     int. marla's building, hallway - same

     marla's in the hall, on the payphone, twisting the phone
     cord around her neck.

                             marla
                 where have you been the last few
                 weeks?

                             jack
                 marla?

     jack looks through the archway and sees tyler, in his gummy
     flannel bathrobe, doing sit-ups.  jack leans, cups the phone.

                             jack
                       (quietly)
                 how did you find me?

                             marla
                 the forwarding number.  i haven't
                 seen you at any support groups.

                             jack
                 that's the idea -- we split them.

                             marla
                 you haven't been going to yours.

                             jack
                 i found a new one.

                             marla
                 really?

                             jack
                 it's for men.

                             marla
                 like testicular cancer?

                             jack
                 look, this is a bad time...

                             marla
                 i've been going to debtor's
                 anonymous.  you want to see some
                 truly fucked up people?

                             jack
                 i'm just on my way out...

                             marla
                 me too.  i got a stomach full of
                 xanax.  i took what was left of a
                 bottle.  might've been too much.

     jack looks exasperated, turns to look into the camera.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 picture yourself watching marla
                 singer throw herself around her
                 crummy apartment.

                             marla
                 this isn't a for-real suicide thing.
                 this is probably one of those cry-for-
                 help things.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 this could go on for hours.

                             jack
                 so you're staying in tonight?

                             marla
                 do you want to wait to hear me
                 describe death?

     jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the
     hook, walks out the back door.

                             marla's voice
                 do you want to listen and see if my
                 spirit can use the telephone?

     thru the archway: tyler leans to look in, curious.
