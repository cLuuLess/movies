     int. jack's office - same

     jack, sipping, stares blankly at a starbucks bag on the
     floor, full of newspapers and fast food garbage.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 when deep space exploration ramps up,
                 it will be corporations that name
                 everything.  the ibm stellar sphere.
                 the philip morris galaxy.  planet
                 starbucks.

     jack looks up as a pudgy man, jack's boss, enters, starbucks
     cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on jack's desk.

                             boss
                 i'm going to need you out-of-town a
                 little more this week.  we've got
                 some "red-flags" to cover.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 it must've been tuesday.  he was
                 wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.

                             jack
                       (listless management speak)
                 you want me to de-prioritize my
                 current reports until you advise of
                 a status upgrade?

                             boss
                 you need to make these your primary
                 "action items."

                             jack (v.o.)
                 he was full of pep.  must've had his
                 grande latte enema.

                             boss
                 here are your flight coupons.  call
                 me from the road if there are any
                 snags.  your itinerary...

     jack hides a yawn, pretends to listen.
