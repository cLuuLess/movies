     ext. fenced-in biohazard waste dump site - night

     tyler stands inside the fence.  jack's atop the fence,
     struggling to cross barbed wire.  he wobbles, gets over,
     snags his shirt.  jack falls, rippppp.  tyler helps.

     footsteps.  a flashlight beam.  tyler pulls jack behind a
     dumpster, one of dozens.  a silhouette of a security guard
     moves along the perimeter, flashlight first.  he walks away.

     move back to tyler and jack, who emerge from hiding.  tyler
     eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster.

                             tyler
                 the best fat for making soap --
                 because the salt balance is just
                 right -- comes form human bodies...

     tyler lifts the lid -- it creaks.

                             jack
                 what is this place?

                             tyler
                 a liposuction clinic.

     from the dumpster, tyler pulls out an industrial-sized,
     thick plastic bag full of pink goo.

                             tyler
                 paydirt.  from society's richest
                 asses and thighs.

     time cut: tyler and jack climb back over the fence, carrying
     bags of fat.  one of jack's bags rips, spilling the goo down
     the chain-link fench.  jack slips and slides.  tyler laughs.
     tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag.
