     int. conference room - day

     a slide show progresses, run by a chipper salesman, walter.
     jack sits, deadpan, with a puffy lip and a bruised cheek.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 thursday mornings, all i could do was
                 think about next week.

     boss gives jack a dubious look.  walter's next slide: a
     computer screen.

                             walter
                 the basic premise of cyber-netting
                 your office is -- make things more
                 efficient.

                             boss
                 can i get the icon in cornflower blue?

                             walter
                 absolutely.

     walter continues, his sales pitch drowned out by jack's v.o.:

                             jack (v.o.)
                 walter, the microsoft account exec.
                 walter, with his smooth, soft hands.
                 maybe he was thinking about the free-
                 range potluck he'd been to last
                 weekend, or his church-group car-wash
                 fund-raiser.  or, probably not.

     walter moves to jack and slaps him in the shoulder.

                             walter
                 i showed this already to my man here.
                 you liked it, didn't you?

     jack smiles.  his teeth are red with blood.  they glow
     eerily in the dim light.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 you can swallow a pint of blood
                 before you get sick.

                             walter
                 jesus, i'd hate to see what happened
                 to the other guy.

     jack keeps the smile frozen on his face.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 screw walter.  his candy-ass wouldn't
                 last a second wednesday night.
