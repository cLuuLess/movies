     a giant corrugated metal door opens.

                 on a long enough time line, the
                 survival rate for everyone drops to
                 zero.

     two technicians lead jack to the burnt-out shell of a
     wrecked automobile.  jack sets down his briefcase, opens it
     and starts to make notes on a clipboarded form.

                 i'm a recall coordinator.  my job is
                 to apply the formula.  it's a story
                 problem.

                 here's where the infant went through
                 the windshield.  three points.

                 a new car built by my company leaves
                 somewhere traveling at 60 miles per
                 hour.  the rear differential locks up.

                 the teenager's braces around the
                 backseat ashtray would make a good
                 "anti-smoking" ad.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 the car crashes and burns with
                 everyone trapped inside.  now: do we
                 initiate a recall?

                 the father must've been huge.  see
                 how the fat burnt into the driver's
                 seat with his polyester shirt?  very
                 "modern art."

                             jack (v.o.)
                 take the number of vehicles in the
                 field, (a), and multiply it by the
                 probable rate of failure, (b), then
                 multiply the result by the average
                 out-of-court settlement, (c).  a
                 times b times c equals x...
