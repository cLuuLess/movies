     int. interrogation room - later

     detective stern and three detectives stand, staring at jack,
     who's seated.  on the table are the phone bill and files.

                             jack
                 there are probably several hundred
                 members in the metropolitan area.
                 chapters are sprouting in at least
                 five other major cities.  they're
                 tightly-regimented, with many cells
                 capable of operating without a
                 central leader.  check this address:
                 1537 paper street.  you'll find the
                 body of robert paulson buried in the
                 garden.  you'll also find numerous
                 tubs used to make gallons of
                 nitroglycerin.  the plan, i believe,
                 is to blow up these credit card
                 headquarters and the trw building.

                             stern
                 why these buildings?

                             jack
                 you are not your job.  you are not
                 how much money you have in the bank.

                             stern
                       (to other detectives)
                 keep him talking.

     stern leaves.  a beat, then, the remaining detectives smile
     at jack with reverence.

                             flat-top detective
                 i really admire what you're doing.
                 you're a brave man to order this.

                             jack
                 what?

                             redhead detective
                 you're a genius, sir.

     they grab jack and force him on his back on the table.
     flat-top has a rubber band; the bald detective has a knife.

                             bald detective
                 you know the drill.  you said if
                 anyone ever tries to interfere with
                 project mayhem, even you, we got to
                 get his balls.

     flat-top pulls jack's pants completely off, tosses them
     aside.  jack screams.  flat-top holds his legs.

                             flat-top
                 it's useless to fight.

                             redhead
                 this is really a powerful gesture,
                 mr. durden.  it'll set quite an
                 example.

                             jack
                 no... you're making a mistake!

                             flat-top
                 you told us you'd say that.

                             jack
                 i'm not tyler durden!

                             baldy
                 you told us you'd say that, too.

                             jack
                 okay, i am tyler durden and i'm
                 ordering you to abort the mission!

                             flat-top
                 you said you would definitely say
                 that.

                             baldy
                 what's our best time for a "cut and
                 run?"

                             flat-top
                 four minutes.

                             baldy
                 is somebody timing this?

                             redhead
                       (looks at his watch)
                 wait till the second hand gets to the
                 twelve.

     a knock at the door.  flat-top slaps a hand over jack's
     mouth.  he and redhead block view of the table as baldy
     opens the door a crack.  stern mutters:

                             stern
                 some of this info checks out.  let's
                 go to the place on paper street.

     baldy glances back at the other detectives, leaves, closing
     the door.  the two remaining detectives continue.  jack kicks
     and screams and writhes.  the detectives wrangle him, but
     with more difficulty, now that baldy's gone.

                             redhead
                       (checking his watch)
                 mr. durden, you're going to fuck up
                 the time!

     jack gets one leg free, kicks, knocks flat-top backwards --
     flat-top slams the wall, falls.  redhead lets go of one of
     jack's arms, jams his elbow into jack's throat... cutting
     off the airway.  jack's face reddens... he's choking...

     jack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls redhead's gun
     and points it at him.  redhead backs off. jack gets up,
     gasping for air, pistol-whips flat-top as he rises.

     jack grabs one of the files off the table.
