     int. office - day

     jack enters.  angel face reads a book, marks on a chart.
     space monkeys shuffle papers and news clippings.  walls are
     lined with files, each labeled with a street address, under
     signs: "mischief," "disinformation," "arson."

     jack's eye lingers on "arson." he starts flipping through
     a file.  angel face comes to take the file from him.

                             angel face
                 that wouldn't interest you.

                             jack
                 where's tyler?

                             angel face
                 the first rule of project --

                             jack
                 right, right.

     as angel face replaces the file, jack notices -- a lye-
     burned kiss-scar on the back of angel face's hand.
