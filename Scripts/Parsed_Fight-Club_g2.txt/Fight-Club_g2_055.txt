     ext. condo building - continuous

     jack walks past smoking, charred debris -- a flash of orange
     from the yang table, a clock face from the hall clock, part
     of an arm from the green armchair.  his feet crunch glass.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 how embarrassing.

                             doorman
                 do you have somebody you can call?

     jack comes to his refrigerator lying on its side.  he
     reaches down and takes a note: "marla --" and a phone
     number, from under a banana magnet.

     close shot - jack's stove

     hissing.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 the police would later tell me that
                 the pilot light might have gone
                 out... letting out just a little bit
                 of gas.
