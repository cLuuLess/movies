     int. living room/dining area/kitchen

     the armchair appears.  pan over next to armchair...

                             jack (v.o.)
                 or the rislampa wire lamps of
                 environmentally-friendly unbleached
                 paper.

     the lamps appear.  pan over to wall...

                             jack (v.o.)
                 even the vild hall clock of
                 galvanized steel, resting on the
                 klipsk shelving unit.

     the clock appears as the shelving unit appears on the wall.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i would flip through catalogs and
                 wonder, "what kind of dining set
                 defines me as a person?"  we used to
                 read pornography.  now it was the
                 horchow collection.

     a dining room set appears.  jack, the cordless phone still
     glued to his ear, walks into frame and continues.

                             jack
                 no, i don't want cobalt.  oh, that
                 sounds nice.  apricot.

     jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i had it all.  even the glass dishes
                 with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
                 proof they were crafted by the
                 honest, simple, hard-working
                 indigenous peoples of wherever.

     he rummages through the refrigerator.  it's practically
     empty.  jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses
     a butter knife to eat it.
