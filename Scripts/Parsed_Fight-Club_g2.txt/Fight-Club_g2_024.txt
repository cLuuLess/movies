     jack, in underwear, is cross-legged on the floor, assembling
     ikea furniture, cordless phone shouldered to his ear.

                             jack
                       (into phone)
                 no, i just can't believe that card is
                 declined -- okay, okay, let me give
                 you a different card number.

     jack gets his wallet off the floor, pulls out another card
     and, mos over the following, he reads it into the phone.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 next group, after guided meditation,
                 after we open our chakras, when it's
                 time to hug, i'm going to grab that
                 little bitch, marla singer, pin her
                 arms against her sides and say...
