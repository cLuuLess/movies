     jack, in work clothes, interlocks his fingers and pops his
     knuckles, picks up a saucepan with coffee and sips.  tyler,
     in waiter's uniform, comes to have jack straighten his tie.

                 most of the week, we were ozzie and
                 harriet.

     jack picks up his briefcase and walks out the door.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 but, wednesday night, ever wednesday
