     ext. park - aerial view - (flashback continuous)

     bob, the mechanic and ricky flee, laughing at their
     handiwork.  they split up, running o.s.

                             mechanic (v.o.)
                 we had it all worked out, man.  it
                 went smooth... until...

                             harsh voice
                 police!  freeze!

     o.s. sounds of gunshots and flashes of muzzle fire.
