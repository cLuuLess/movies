     int. tavern basement - same

     a bomb-shelter.  concrete walls.  one bare bulb above, tyler
     standing directly beneath it.

                             tyler
                 welcome to fight club.

     the guys mill around, finding partners.  everyone brims with
     eagerness, but tries to act cool.  chatter gets louder.
     everyone spreads out, forming a circle, tyler at center.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 every week, tyler gave the rules that
                 he and i decided.

     peaking chatter, till tyler raises his arms and the chatter
     dies.  a couple of coughs, feet shuffling, then, silence.

                             tyler
                 the first rule of fight club is --
                 you don't talk about fight club.  the
                 second rule of fight club is -- you
                 don't talk about fight club.  the
                 third rule of fight club is -- when
                 someone says "stop" or goes limp, the
                 fight is over.  fourth rule is --
                 only two guys to a fight.  fifth
                 rule -- one fight at a time.  sixth
                 rule -- no shirts, no shoes.  seventh
                 rule -- fights go on as long as they
                 have to.  and the eighth and final
                 rule -- if this is your first night
                 at fight club, you have to fight.

     tyler steps back.  a short guy, ricky, and a goateed man
     take off shirts and shoes and step to the center.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 this kid, ricky -- supply clerk --
                 couldn't remember whether you ordered
                 pens with blue ink or black ink ...

     the two fighters circle, then begin throwing punches...

                             jack (v.o.)
                 but ricky was a god for ten minutes
                 last week when he trounced an actuary
                 twice his size.

     harder, faster punches between the two.  sweat flies.
     shouts become deafening.  ricky's getting the best of
     goateed man, pounding him...

                             jack (v.o.)
                 sometimes all you could hear were
                 flat, hard packing sounds over the
                 yelling, or the wet choke when
                 someone caught their breath and
                 sprayed...

                             goateed man
                       (spittle-lipped)
                 ssssstop... !
