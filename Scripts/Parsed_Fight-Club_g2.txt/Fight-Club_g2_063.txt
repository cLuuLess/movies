     int. service elevator - night

     jack turns and we pan to tyler, standing by a cart with a
     giant soup tureen.  his hands are at his open fly and he's
     in position to piss into the soup.

                             jack
                 he was the guerrilla terrorist of the
                 food service industry.

                             tyler
                 don't watch.  i can't if you watch.

     jack waits.  the sound of a stream of liquid is heard.

                             tyler
                 ... oh, yeah.  oh, yeah.

                             jack
                 he farted on meringue; he sneezed on
                 braised endive; and, with creme of
                 mushroom soup, well...

                             tyler (o.s.)
                 go ahead.  say it.

                             jack
                 you get the idea.
