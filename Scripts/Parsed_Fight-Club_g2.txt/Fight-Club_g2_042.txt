     jack stands on a conveyor belt, briefcase at his feet.  he
     watches people moving past on the opposite conveyor.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 if you wake up at a different time
                 and in a different place, could you
                 wake up as a different person?

     jack misses seeing tyler on the opposite conveyor belt.
     they pass each other.
