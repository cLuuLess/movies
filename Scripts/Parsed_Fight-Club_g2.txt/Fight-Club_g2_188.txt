     jack enters.  ricky crawls, bleeding from a gunshot wound to
     the leg.  space monkeys begin a rudimentary job of treating
     the wound.  other space monkeys carry in a dead body in
     black clothes and ski mask, putting it on the table.

                             jack
                 what's going on?

     space monkeys stare at the body.  the mechanic, sweating,
     gets to his knees and pulls the ski mask off the corpse --
     it's bob, with a gunshot wound to the head.

                             jack
                 bob... oh, christ...

     jack pushes past a space monkey, stares down, stricken...

                             jack
                 what... what happened... ?

                             mechanic
                       (out of breath)
                 we were on assignment...
