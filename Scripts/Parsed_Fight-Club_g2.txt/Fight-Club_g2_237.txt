     jack manages to break tyler's grip, kicks tyler away.
     tyler springs to his feet, runs, heading for a staircase.

     jack gets up, breathing hard, holding his head, follows...

     on the stairs, tyler reaches the loft level, above the
     lobby, disappears around a corner.  jack's right behind,
     turning the corner -- tyler's not there.

     jack receives a sharp slap on the back of the head.  he
     wheels.  tyler isn't there.  a tap on his shoulder.  jack
     turns around -- wham! -- tyler punches his face.  jack falls
     against the loft railing.  tyler comes forward, swings...

     security monitor p.o.v.

     jack punches himself square in the nose!
