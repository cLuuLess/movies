     int. lou's tavern - basement - night

     loud.  an enormous crowd of guys, including jack and bob,
     stands around tyler, who's in the center of the circle,
     holding up his hands to quiet them...

                             tyler
                 i look around... i look around and
                 see a lot of new faces.

     an enthusiastic rumble from the crowd.

                             tyler
                 shut up!  which means a lot of you
                 have been breaking the first two
                 rules of fight club.

     a glum silence falls.  guys look at each other.

                             tyler
                 i see in fight club the strongest and
                 smartest men who have ever lived --
                 an entire generation pumping gas and
                 waiting tables; or they're slaves
                 with white collars.
                             (more)

                             tyler (cont)
                 advertisements have them chasing cars
                 and clothes, working jobs they hate
                 so they can buy shit they don't need.
                 we are the middle children of
                 history, with no purpose or place.
                 we have no great war, or great
                 depression.  the great war is a
                 spiritual war.  the great depression
                 is our lives.  we were raised by
                 television to believe that we'd be
                 millionaires and movie gods and rock
                 stars -- but we won't.  and we're
                 learning that fact.  and we're very,
                 very pissed-off.

     the crowd erupts into a deafening chorus of agreement.  jack
     looks at the blazing excitement in the eyes of the crowd.

                             tyler
                 we are the quiet young men who listen
                 until it's time to decide.

     a fat, middle-aged man stomps down the stairs, pushing into
     the crowd, followed by a tall, hefty thug who holds a gum.

                             tyler
                 who are you?

                             fat man (lou)
                 who am i?!  there's a sign on the
                 front that says "lou's tavern." i'm
                 fucking lou.  who the fuck are you?!

                             tyler
                 tyler durden.

     tyler extends his hand for a shake, but lou slaps it away.

                             lou
                 who told you motherfuckers you could
                 use my place?

                             tyler
                 we have a deal worked out with irvine.

                             lou
                 irvine?  irvine's at home with a
                 broken collarbone.

     everyone glances guiltily at each other.

                             lou
                 he don't own this place, i do.  how
                 much money's he getting for this?

                             tyler
                 there is no money.

                             lou
                 really?

                             tyler
                 it's free to all.

                             lou
                 ain't that something?

                             tyler
                 yes, it is.

                             lou
                 look, stupid fuck, i want everyone
                 outta here now!

                             tyler
                 you're welcome to join our club.

                             lou
                 did you hear what i just said?!

                             tyler
                 you and your friend.

     lou slugs tyler in the stomach, doubles him over.

                             lou
                 you hear me now?

     tyler gains his breath, determined.  he looks up, turns his
     head, looking to jack.  jack watches, wide-eyed.

     tyler straightens, facing lou.

                             tyler
                 no, i'm sorry, i didn't hear you.

     lou punches tyler in the face.  some of the guys move
     forward, but the thug points his gun.  jack-runs forward
     anyway -- lou punches him in the face.

     more guys move forward, but tyler waves them off, facing lou.

                             tyler
                 we really need to use this place.

     lou proceeds to beat the shit out of tyler, punching his
     face, his stomach.  tyler collapses to the floor.  lou
     starts kicking his.  tyler bleeds from the mouth and face.

                             tyler
                 that's it.... that's good.  get it
                 all out.  you'll feel better.

     lou flushes red with exasperation, kicks more.  finally,
     sweating, bewildered, lou stops.  he looks to the thug, who
     is just as bewildered.

     suddenly, tyler springs up, grabs onto lou...

                             tyler
                 yes, i am shit and crazy, to you and
                 this whole fucking world...

     tyler's blood spatters on lou.  lou tries to shake tyler
     off, but tyler bites lou's necktie.  the thug grabs tyler
     and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling lou.  lou
     slaps at tyler's face, but recoils from the blood.  tyler
     spits and shouts through clenched teeth...

                             tyler
                 you don't know where i've been.

     tyler bear hugs lou, pulls him to the floor.  tyler rubs his
     bloody face into lou's face.  the thug lifts tyler.  tyler
     clings to lou's belt, dragging lou as he is dragged...

                             tyler
                 we need this place.  we need it.
                 please let us keep it, please...

     blood dribbles out of tyler's mouth, spattering lou.

                             lou
                 what are you doing?!

                             tyler
                 pleeeeeease!

                             lou
                 okay!  okay, fuck it!  use the
                 basement!  get off me!

                             tyler
                 we need some towels, lou.  we need
                 replacement light bulbs.

                             lou
                 alright, christ!  fucking let me go!

                             tyler
                 thank you.  thank you, sir...

                             lou
                 let go of me!!

     tyler lets go of lou's belt.  lou scrambles away.  the thug
     drops tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood.  lou gets to
     his feet, looks at tyler, then at the rest of the guys.  he
     and the thug back away... slamming the door behind.

     fight club surrounds tyler.  they help him up, move him to
     a crate.  tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his
     breathing labored... then, he sits back, crossing his legs
     and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike.

                             tyler
                 this week, each of you has a homework
                 assignment.  you're going to go out
                 and start a fight with a total
                 stranger...
                       (pause, drooling blood)
                 you're going to start a fight... and
                 you're going to lose.

     jack beams in appreciation.
