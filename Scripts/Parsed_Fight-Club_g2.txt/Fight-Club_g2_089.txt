     int. bus - dusk

     the bus is crowded.  as tyler and jack walk toward the back,
     jack studies the faces of other passengers...

                             jack (v.o.)
                 we all started seeing things
                 differently.  wherever we went.

     they hold hand grips.  jack looks up at an advertisement; a
     calvin klein ad featuring a tan, bare-chested muscle stud.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i felt sorry for all the guys packing
                 into gyms, trying to look like what
                 calvin klein and tommy hilfiger said
                 they should.

     tyler looks at jack, looks at the c.k. advertisement.

                             tyler
                 self-improvement is masturbation.
                 self-destruction is the answer.

     a man in a suit knocks tyler's shoulder as he passes.  the
     man takes a handle, close by.  jack's pissed, staring at the
     man, who stares back.

                             jack
                       (to tyler, so the
                        man can hear)
                 you could take him.

     tyler looks to jack, glances over his shoulder at the man.
     tyler casually picks a small scab off jack's nostril.

                             tyler
                 the trick is not to care.

     tyler stares forward.
