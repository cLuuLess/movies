     int. small protestant church - later

     everyone stands and mills about, pairing-off.

                             leader
                 pick someone special to you tonight.

     jack sees the ghastly spectre of chloe ambling towards him.
     he tries to smile.  she smiles with a twisted, dying mouth.

                             chloe
                 hello, mr. tayler.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i never gave my real name at support
                 groups.

                             jack
                 hi, chloe.

                             chloe
                 we've never actually talked.

     chloe's eyes are eerily bright with desperation.  jack, in
     a sincere attempt at levity, chokes out:

                             jack
                 you look good.  you ... look ... like
                 a pirate.

     chloe laughs, a little too much.  jack squeezes out a laugh.
     then he sees marla, off by herself.  someone heads for her.

                             jack
                 excuse me, i have to...

     jack gives a quick nod to chloe and darts towards marla.
     chloe watches him go.

     stay on jack and marla as jack clamps his arms around her.
     he whispers into her ear.

                             jack
                 we need to talk.

                             marla
                 sure.

                             jack
                 i'm on to you.  you're a faker.  you
                 aren't dying.

                             marla
                 what?

                             jack
                 okay, in the sylvia plath philosophy
                 way, we're all dying.  but you're not
                 dying the way chloe is dying.

                             leader
                 tell the other person how you feel.

                             jack
                 you're a tourist.  i saw you at
                 melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular
                 cancer.

                             marla
                 and i saw you practicing this...

                             jack
                 practicing what?

                             marla
                 telling me off.  is it going as well
                 as you hoped... ?
                       (reads his nametag)
                 "... mr. taylor."

                             jack
                 i'll expose you.

                             marla
                 go ahead.  i'll expose you.

                             leader
                 share yourself completely.

     marla puts her head down on jack's shoulder as if she were
     crying.  jack pulls her head back up.  she deadpans at him.

                             jack
                 why are you doing this?

                             marla
                 it's cheaper than a movie, and
                 there's free coffee.

                             jack
                 these are my groups.  i was here
                 first.  i've been coming for a year.

                             marla
                 a year?  how'd you manage that?

                             jack
                 anyone who might've noticed either
                 died or recovered and never came back.

                             leader
                 let yourself cry.

                             marla
                 why do you do it?

                             jack
                 i... i don't know.  i guess... when
                 people think you're dying, they
                 really listen, instead...

                             marla
                 -- instead of just waiting for their
                 turn to speak.

                             jack
                 yeah.

     brief recognition between them, broken as the leader passes.

                             leader
                 quietly, now.  share with each other.

     jack waits till the leader's out of earshot.

                             jack
                       (warning)
                 it becomes an addiction.

                             marla
                 really?

     jack sighs, then pulls back.

                             jack
                 look, i can't cry with a faker
                 present.

                             marla
                 candy-stripe a cancer ward.  it's not
                 my problem.

                             jack
                 please.  can't we do something... ?

     marla starts out of the room.  jack follows her.

                             leader
                 now, the closing prayer.
