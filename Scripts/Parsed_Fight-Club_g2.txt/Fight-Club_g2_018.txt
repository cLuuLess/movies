     int. first methodist church meeting room - resuming

     jack's still in an embrace with bob.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 bob loved me because he thought my
                 testicles were removed too.  being
                 there, my face against his tits,
                 ready to cry -- this was my vacation.

     marla singer enters.  she has short matte black hair and
     big, dark eyes like a character from japanese animation.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 and, she ruined everything.

     marla looks around, raises a cigarette to her lips.

                             marla
                 this is cancer, right?

     bob and jack stare, dumbfounded.
