     ext. basement door - electronics warehouse - later

     everyone sneaks out of this new location - we've seen none
     of these guys before - it's a new chapter.  jack and bob
     stagger out last, jack being in worse shape.  they both grin
     with religious serenity.  bob hugs jack.

                             bob
                 thank you.  thank you.

     bob relaxes the hug and jack drops to the ground like a
     sack, completely enervated from the beating he took.

                             jack
                 you're welcome.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 fight club -- this was mine and
                 tyler's gift... our gift to the world.
