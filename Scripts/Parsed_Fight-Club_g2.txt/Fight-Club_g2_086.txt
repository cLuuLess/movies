     int. photocopy room - day

     jack stands over a copy machine, hit by flashes of light.
     he glances over his shoulder, watches ricky, wearing an
     apron, push a supply cart.  ricks nods at jack.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 you weren't alive anywhere like you
                 were there.  but fight club only
                 exists in the hours between when
                 fight club starts and when fight club
                 ends.
