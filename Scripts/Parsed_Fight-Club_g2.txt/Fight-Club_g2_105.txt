     int. kitchen - morning (resuming)

     tyler chuckles, shakes his head.

                             tyler
                 unbelievable, huh?

                             jack (v.o.)
                 he was obviously able to handle it.

     tyler stands across from jack, gets a cigarette from a pack.

                             tyler
                 i mean, this girl... uh, you're not
                 into her or anything... ?

                             jack
                 no.  not at all.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i am jack's raging bile duct.

     tyler lights his cigarette.

                             tyler
                 you're sure?

                             jack
                 yeah, i'm sure.

                             tyler
                 good.  this chick was up on the table
                 with her legs in the stirrups before
                 the doctor even walked in the room.
                 the things that she said... i've
                 never heard a woman talk like that...
