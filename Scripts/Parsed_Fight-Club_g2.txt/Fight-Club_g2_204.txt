     int. dank basement - continuous

     jack enters this dark basement, walks ahead in the dim
     light.  the place is damp and empty.  jack stops, looks down.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 everywhere i went, i felt i had
                 already been there.

     at his feet -- dried blood on the concrete floor.
