     int. first methodist church meeting room - another night

     jack watches... marla's eyes are closed, her head on the
     shoulder of the man she's embraced by.  she opens her eyes,
     catching jack's stare.  jack looks away.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 marla -- the big tourist.  her lie
                 reflected my lie.

     marla rests her chin on the man's shoulder.  tears roll down
     her cheeks.  she wipes at them.
