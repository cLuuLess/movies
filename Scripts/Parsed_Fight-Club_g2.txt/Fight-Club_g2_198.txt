     the proprietor, his head bandaged, is confronted by jack.

                             jack
                 i need to know where tyler is.  can't
                 you help me?

                             bandaged proprietor
                 sir, you're disturbing the other
                 patrons with your laudish behavior.

                             jack
                       (pointing)
                 there's no one else here.

                             bandaged proprietor
                 i'm sorry, i haven't the faintest
                 idea what you're talking about.

                             jack
                 look at my face.  i'm a member.  i
                 just need to know if you've seen
                 tyler durden.

                             bandaged proprietor
                 i'm not disclosed to bespeak any such
                 information to you, nor would i, even
                 if i had said information you want,
                 at this juncture be able.

     jack looks around, incredibly frustrated.

                             jack
                  you are a moron.

                             bandaged proprietor
                  i'm afraid i have to insist you leave.

     jack gives up, shoves his way out the door.
