     int. church meeting room - night

     men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones.
     near the door, a sign on a stand: "remaining men together."

                             jack (v.o.)
                 this was a support group for men with
                 testicular cancer.  the big moosie
                 slobbering all over me was bob.

                             bob
                 we're still men.

                             jack
                 yes.  we're men.  men is what we are.

                 six months ago, bob's testicles were
                 removed.  then hormone therapy.  he
                 developed bitch tits because his
                 testosterone was too high and his
                 body upped the estrogen.  that was
                 where my head fit -- into his huge,
                 sweating tits that hung enormous, the
                 way we think of god's as big.

                             bob
                 they're gonna have to open my pec's
                 again to drain the fluid.

     bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into jack's eyes.

                             bob
                 okay.  you cry now.

     jack looks at bob.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 wait.  back up.  let me start earlier.
