     jack looks at the doorman.  tyler's business card falls from
     the filofax.  jack catches it.

                             doorman
                 if you don't know what you want, you
                 end up with a lot you don't.

     the doorman walks away.  jack stares at tyler's card.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 if you asked me now, i couldn't tell
                 you why i called him.

     jack re-deposits the quarter, dials tyler's number.  it
     rings... and rings and rings.  jack sighs and hangs up the
     phone.  a moment, then the phone rings.

                             jack
                 hello?

                             tyler's voice
                 who's this?

                             jack
                 tyler?

                             tyler's voice
                 who's this?

                             jack
                 uh... i'm sorry.  we met on the
                 plane.  we had the same briefcase.
                 i'm... you know, the clever guy.

                             tyler's voice
                 oh, yeah.

                             jack
                 i just called a second ago.  there
                 was no answer.  i'm at a payphone.

                             tyler's voice
                 i star-sixty-nined you.  i never pick
                 up my phone.  what's up?

                             jack
                 well... let me see... here's the
                 thing...
