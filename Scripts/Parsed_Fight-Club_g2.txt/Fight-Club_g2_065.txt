     ext. curbside - later

     jack and tyler sit on the curb, watching sparse headlights
     on the nearby freeway.  their eyes are glazed with endorphin-
     induced serenity.  they look at each other, laugh.  look away.

                             tyler
                 if you could fight anyone... one on
                 one, whoever you wanted, who would
                 you fight?

                             jack
                 anyone?

                             tyler
                 anyone.

     jack thinks.

                             jack
                 my boss, probably.
                       (pause)
                 who would you fight?

                             tyler
                 my dad.  no question.

     a long pause as jack studies tyler's face.

                             jack
                 oh, yeah.
                       (nodding)
                 i didn't know my dad.  well, i knew
                 him, till i was six.  he went and
                 married another woman, had more kids.
                 every six years or so he'd do it
                 again -- new city, new family.

                             tyler
                 he was setting up franchises.  my
                 father never went to college, so it
                 was really important that i go.

                             jack
                 i know that.

                             tyler
                 after i graduated, i called him long
                 distance and asked, "now what?"  he
                 said, "get a job."  when i turned
                 twenty-five, i called him and asked,
                 "now what?"  he said, "i don't know.
                 get married."

                             jack
                 same here.

                             tyler
                 a generation of men raised by women.
                 i'm wondering if another woman is the
                 answer we really need.

     another pause.  jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles.

                             jack
                 we should do this again sometime.

     tyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to jack.
