     jack brushes his teeth.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i became the calm, little center of
                 the world.  i was the zen master.

     haiku is being typed in a trendy, italicized font.

                              "worker bees can leave
                               even drones can fly away
                               the queen is their slave"

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i wrote little haiku poems.
