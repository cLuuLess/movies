     a cop, detective stern, refers to a file.

                             detective stern
                 this is detective stern with the
                 arson unit.  we have some new
                 information about the "incident" at
                 your condo.

                             jack
                 yes?

                             detective stern
                 i don't know if you're aware... your
                 front door -- it seems someone
                 sprayed freon into the lock, then
                 tapped it with a chisel to shatter
                 the cylinder.

                             jack
                 no, i wasn't aware...

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i am jack's cold sweat.

                             detective stern
                 does this sound strange to you?

                             jack
                 yes, sire, strange.  very strange.

     jack starts to sweat, scrubs his pants obsessively.

                             detective stern
                 the dynamite...

                             jack
                 dynamite?

                             detective stern
                 yes.  it left a residue of ammonium
                 oxalate and potassium perchloride.
                 do you know what that means?

                             jack
                 what does that mean?

                             detective stern
                 it means it was homemade.

                             jack
                 this is... really a shock...

                             detective stern
                 whoever set this homemade dynamite
                 could've blown out the pilot light
                 days before the explosion.  the gas,
                 it seems, was just a detonator.

                             jack
                 who do you think could've done this?

                             detective stern
                 i'll ask the questions, son.

                             tyler
                       (whispering in jack's ear)
                 tell him...

     jack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see tyler
     standing right next to him.

                             jack
                 huh?

                             tyler
                       (overlap w/below)
                 "the liberator who destroyed my
                 property has re-aligned my paradigm
                 of perception."

                             jack
                 shhhhhh!
                       (into phone,
                        overlap w/above)
                 i don't know what to make of this,
                 sir, i really don't...

                             detective stern
                 do you know anyone who'd have the
                 expertise or motive to do something
                 like this?

                             tyler
                 "i reject the basic assumptions of
                 civilization, including material
                 possession."

     jack pushes tyler away, cups the receiving.

                             jack
                       (into phone)
                 no.  no, sir.  i loved that condo.
                 i loved every stick of furniture.
                 the lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were
                 me.  the dishes were me.  the plants
                 were...

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i'd like to thank the academy...

                             detective stern
                 well, if any ideas come to you, give
                 me a call.  in the meantime, don't
                 leave town.  i may need to bring you
                 in for questioning.

     end intercut

     jack hangs up.  tyler shrugs.

                             tyler
                 could be worse.  you could be cursed
                 with the three terrible karmas.  you
                 could be beautiful, rich and famous.

     jack turns away, continues to scrub his pants.  marla's
     footsteps can be heard coming downstairs...

     jack really grinds the soap against the pants, splashing
     water.  he turns, sees marla enter.  tyler is gone.  marla
     lights a cigarette.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 except for their humping, tyler and
                 marla were never in the same room.

                             marla
                 i got this dress at a thrift store
                 for one dollar.

                             jack
                       (keeps scrubbing)
                 worth every penny.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 my parents pulled this exact act for
                 years -- one came in, the other
                 disappeared.

     marla begins a slow, exotic dance, moving very close to
     jack.  she lifts her dress dangerously high, dancing close
     to jack's body, almost touhcing.

                             marla
                       (seductive)
                 it's a bridesmaid's dress.  someone
                 loved it intensely for one day, then
                 tossed it.  like a christmas tree --
                 so special, then, bam -- it's
                 abandoned on the side of the road,
                 tinsel still clinging to it...

     jack becomes very aware of having no pants on, presses
     against the counter.  marla pulls her hemline further up.

                             marla
                 like sex crime victims, underwear
                 inside-out, bound with electrical
                 tape.

                             jack
                       (coldly)
                 it suits you.

     she leans in very close to jack's ear, whispers hoarsely:

                             marla
                 you can borrow it sometime.

     jack takes a step away, keeps scrubbing.  marla blows smoke
     in his face.  jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the
     sink.  marla backs away, fed up, storms out, going upstairs.

                             tyler (o.s.)
                 get rid of her.

     jack turns to see tyler in the doorway.

                             jack
                 you get rid of her.

                             tyler
                       (pointing at jack)
                 don't mention me.

     marla's footsteps are coming downstairs.  jack looks to the
     archway, then back at -- tyler's gone.  marla enters, shoes
     and balled up clothing under one arm, looking for something
     on the junk strewn table.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i'm six years old again, passing
                 messages between my parents.

                             jack
                 i, uh... think you should go now.

     marla ignores, still searching the table, tossing things,
     pushing other things off to the floor.

                             jack
                 it's time for you to leave.

                             marla
                 don't worry, i'm leaving.

     marla finds what she wanted, a pack of cigarettes.  she
     moves up into jack's face.

                             marla
                 you're such a nutcase, i can't even
                 begin to keep up.

                             jack
                 goodbye.

     she laughs, spins on her heels.  as she exits the back door,
     she sings "this merry-go-round" from "valley of the dolls."
     jack watches her through the kitchen window.

                             tyler (o.s.)
                 nice work.

     jack turns.  tyler's right behind him.  through the window,
     marla can be seen walking away.  tyler picks up the remnant
     of soap jack's been using, holds it up to jack.

                             tyler
                 to make soap, first we have to render
                 fat.

     jack looks at tyler.

     close up - sign: "danger - biohazard."
