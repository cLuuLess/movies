     int. kitchen - moments later

     jack sits at the table, sips coffee.  he's pale, dazed,
     seems broken.  he hears the faint sound of sawing and
     hammering, unsure of where it's coming from.

     marla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the
     counter.  her back is to jack as he looks at her.  she pours
     ccffee and lights a cigarette.  a beat of silence, then:

                             marla
                 i'll be out of your way in a sec.

     she seems to be as weak as jack.

                             jack
                 you... don't have to... leave.

                             marla
                 whatever.

                             jack
                 really... i mean it.
                       (pause)
                 have you been going to your groups?

                             marla
                 chloe's dead.

                             jack
                 when?

                             marla
                 do you care?

                             jack
                 i don't know.

                             marla
                 it was the smart move on her part.

     marla turns to face jack, a grim expression on her face.
     there's a bruise on her arm.  jack gets up, moves closer.

                             jack
                 why are we both... caught up like
                 this... with... ?

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i came so close to saying tyler's
                 name, i could feel it vibrate inside
                 my mouth.

     marla looks a him, waiting.

                             jack
                 i don't understand.  why does a weak
                 person have to go out and find a
                 strong person... to hang onto?

                             marla
                 what do you get out of it?

     faint sound of sawing and hammering.  jack can't quite
     figure where it's coming from.

                             jack
                 you hear that?

                             marla
                 hear what?

                             jack
                 that... sawing and hammering.

                             marla
                 have we been talking too long?  must
                 we change the subject?

     jack turns -- through the crack of the open basement door,
     tyler's staring at jack from the bottom of the stairs.

                             tyler
                       (harsh whisper)
                 you're not talking about me, are you?

     jack reacts, turns back to marla.

                             jack
                       (to marla and tyler)
                 no.

                             marla
                 that day you came over to my place to
                 play doctor... what was going on
                 there?

                             tyler
                       (still a whisper)
                 what are you talking about?

                             jack
                       (to marla and tyler)
                 nothing.

                             marla
                 nothing?  i don't think so.

                             tyler
                       (whisper)
                 this conversation...

                             jack
                 this conversation...

                             tyler
                 ... is over.

                             jack
                 ... is over.

     marla comes to touch jack's hair.  jack closes the basement
     door.  marla sees the kiss-scar on jack's hand, grabs his
     hand.  jack tries to pull it back, but marla keeps a grip.

                             marla
                 what is this?  who did this?

                             jack
                 ... a person.

                             marla
                 guy or girl?

                             jack
                 why would you ask if it's a guy or a
                 girl?!

                             marla
                 why would you get bent if i asked?

                             jack
                 let go of me...
                       (pulls his hand free)
                 leave me alone.

                             marla
                 you're afraid to say.

     marla backs away, closes her eyes, struggling with
     frustration.  she leaves out the back door, not looking back.

     jack leans against the wall.  after a moment, he opens the
     basement door, heads downstairs...
