     int. kitchen - night

     jack and tyler each stir a boiling pot.

                             tyler
                 as the fat renders, the tallow floats
                 to the surface.  remember the crap
                 they taught you in boy scouts.

                             jack
                 hard to imagine you in boy scouts.

                             tyler
                 this clear layer in glycerin.  we'll
                 mix it back in when we make the soap.

     tyler sticks a spoon into a pot, lifts up a scoop of the
     glycerin layer.  then, he crabs a can, opens it.

                             tyler
                 lye -- the crucial ingredient.
                       (adding lye to mix)
                 ancient peoples found their clothes
                 got cleaner if they washed them at a
                 certain spot in the river.  why?
                 because, human sacrifices were once
                 made on the hills above this river.
                 year after year, bodies burnt.  rain
                 feel.  water seeped through the wood
                 ashes to become lye.  the lye
                 combined with the melted fat of the
                 bodies, till a thick white soapy
                 discharge crept into the river.

     tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet.  he takes
     jack's hands and kisses the back of it.

                             tyler
                 the first soap was made from the
                 ashes of heroes.  like the first
                 monkeys shot into space.

     the saliva shines in the shape of the kiss.  tyler pours a
     bit of the flaked lye onto jack's hand.

                             tyler
                 without sacrifice, without death, we
                 would have nothing.

     jack's whole body jerks.  tyler holds tight to jack's hand
     and arm.  tears well in jack's eyes; his face tightens.

                             tyler
                 this is a chemical burn.  it will
                 hurt more than you've ever been
                 burned and you will have a scar.

     jack looks -- the burn is swollen, glossy, in the shape of
     tyler's kiss.  jack's face spasms.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the
                 back of my hand.

                             tyler
                 look at your hand.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 guided meditation worked for cancer,
                 it could work for this.

     tyler looks at jack's glazed and detached eyes.

                             tyler
                 come back to the pain.  don't shut
                 this out.

     jack, snapping back, tries to jerk his hand away.  tyler
     keeps hold of it and their arms knock utensils off the table.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i tried not to think of the words
                 "searing" or "flesh."  i imagined my
                 pain as a ball of healing white light.

     tyler jerks jack's hand, getting jack's attention...

                             tyler
                 stop it.  this is your pain -- your
                 burning hand.  it's right here.  look
                 at it.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i was going to my cave to find my
                 power animal.

     tyler jerks jack's hand again.  jack re-focuses on tyler...

                             tyler
                 don't deal with this the way those
                 dead people do.  deal with it the way
                 a living person does.

     fur coat, turning her head to look towards us.  resume:

     jack tries to pull his hand free.  tyler won't let go.
     jack's eyes glaze over again.  jack speaks, whiny from pain:

                             jack
                 i... i think i understand.  i think
                 i get it...

                             tyler
                 no, what you're feeling is premature
                 enlightenment.

     shot of a green forest without rain.  resume:

     tyler slaps jack's face, regaining his attention...

                             tyler
                 this is the greatest moment of your
                 life and you're off somewhere,
                 missing it.

                             jack
                 no, i'm not...

                             tyler
                 shut up.  our fathers were our models
                 for god.  and, if our fathers bailed,
                 what does that tell us about god?

                             jack
                 i don't know...

     shot of embers pouring from the hellish forest fire.  resume:

     tyler slaps jack's face again...

                             tyler
                 listen to me.  you have to consider
                 the possibility that god doesn't like
                 you, he never wanted you.  in all
                 probability, he hates you.  this is
                 not the worst thing that can happen...

                             jack
                 it isn't... ?

                             tyler
                 we don't need him...

                             jack
                 we don't... ?

     shot of inside ice cave - naked marla pulls jack down on top
     of her - jack kisses her - cigarette smoke comes from her
     mouth - jack coughs.  resume:

     jack is a wide-eyed zombie...

                             jack
                 ... marla ... ?

                             tyler
                 fuck damnation.  fuck redemption.  we
                 are god's unwanted children, with no
                 special place and no special
                 attention, and so be it.

     jack looks at tyler -- they lock eyes.  jack does his best
     to stifle his spasms of pain, his body a quivering, coiled
     knot.  he bolts toward the sink, but tyler holds on.

                             tyler
                 you can go to the sink and run water
                 over your hand.  look at me.  or you
                 can use vinegar to neutralize the
                 burn, but first you have to give up.
                 first, you have to know that someday,
                 you are going to die.  until you know
                 that, you will be useless.

     jack spasms with a shiver of pain...

                             jack
                 you ... you don't know what this
                 feels like, tyler.

     tyler shows jack a lye-burned kiss scar on his own hand.
     tears begin to drip from jack's eyes.  tyler grabs a bottle
     of vinegar -- pours it over jack's wound.

     jack closes his eyes, holds his hand... slumps to the floor.

                             tyler
                 congratulations.  you're a step
                 closer to hitting bottom.
