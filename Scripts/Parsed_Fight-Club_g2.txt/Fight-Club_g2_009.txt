     the intern walks away from jack, picks up a chart.

                             jack
                 i'm in pain.

                             intern
                       (facetious)

                 methodist tuesday nights.  see the
                 guys with testicular cancer.  that's
                 pain.

     the intern moves into the other room.  jack stares after him.
