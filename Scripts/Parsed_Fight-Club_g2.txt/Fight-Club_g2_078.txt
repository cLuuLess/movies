     ext. street - night

     jack walks along.  he stops, looking at a church with
     support-group-people milling around the entrance, drinking
     coffee and sodas.  marla's there, amongst them, smoking.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 .... i should have been upset about
                 my nice, neat, flaming little shit.

     jack's face shows no reaction.  he continues to walk.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 but i wasn't.
