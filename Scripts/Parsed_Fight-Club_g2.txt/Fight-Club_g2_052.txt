     int. taxi - moving - night

     along a residential street.  jack looks ahead, sees a tall,
     grey, bland building on the corner.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 home was a condo on the fifteenth
                 floor of a filing cabinet for widows
                 and young professionals.  the walls
                 were solid concrete.  a foot of
                 concrete is important when your next-
                 door neighbor lets her hearing aid go
                 and has to watch game shows at full
                 volume...

     the taxi turns a corner and jack sees the front of the
     building.  a diffuse cloud of smoke wafts away from a blown-
     out section of the fifteenth floor.  firetrucks, police cars
     and a mob are all crowded around the lobby area.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 -- or when a volcanic blast of debris
                 that used to be your furniture and
                 personal effects blows out your floor-
                 to-ceiling windows and sails flaming
                 into the night.
