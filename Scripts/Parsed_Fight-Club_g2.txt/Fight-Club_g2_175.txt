     ext. porch - morning

     ricky's there.  bob is now next to him, in black, with a
     paper bag in hand, mattress at his feet.  tyler steps out.
     jack stays in the doorway, locking eyes on bob.  to all the
     following questions, ricky answers "sir!" --

                             tyler
                 you have two black shirts?  two pair
                 black trousers?  one pair black
                 boots?  two pair black socks?  one
                 black coat?  three hundred dollars
                 personal burial money?  go inside.

     ricky goes in.  tyler turns to bob.

                             tyler
                 you're too old.  sorry.  and, you're
                 too fat.  nice seeing you.

     bob looks genuinely hurt.  he picks up his mattress and
     starts away.  tyler looks at jack and rolls his eyes.  jack
     follows bob...

                             jack
                 bob... bob, wait...
                       (leading bob back)
                 let me explain this to you...
