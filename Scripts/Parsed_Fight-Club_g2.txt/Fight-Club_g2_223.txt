     ext. diner - momests later

     jack pushes out the door, files under one arm, catching up...

                             jack
                 i can't explain.  you wouldn't
                 believe me anyway.  i'm trying to
                 protect you...

     jack grabs her arm, tries to hail a taxi, but the taxi races
     past.  marla pulls free, screaming at him...,

                             marla
                 let go of me!

                             jack
                 do this for me, marla.  do this for
                 me, if you never do anything else...

     jack spots a bus idling further up the street.

                             marla
                 leave me alone!  i don't ever want to
                 see you again!

                             jack
                 okay, if that's what it takes, you'll
                 never have to see me again.
                       (digs in his pocket)
                 here... here...

     he pulls money from his pocket, holding it out.

                             jack
                 take this money, get on this bus...
                       (pointing to bus)
                 get on, and i promise you, i'll never
                 bother you again, if that's what you
                 want.  please...

     marla looks at jack, numb.

                             marla
                 tyler...

                             jack
                 i'm begging you.  get on the bus.
                 get on the bus.

     marla takes the money from tyler, walks towards the bus.  as
     they approach it, jack shields his eyes, afraid to look...

                             marla
                 why are you doing this?

                             jack
                 i can't let myself see where you're
                 going.  go wherever it takes you,
                 remember... keep away from major
                 cities...

     marla stands at the doors of the bus, heartbroken, gives one
     last look at jack.

                             marla
                       (holds up the money)
                 i'm not paying this back.  i consider
                 it "asshole tax."

                             jack
                 yes, fine.  just, get on.  stay away
                 a couple of weeks, at least.

     jack's still covering his eyes.  marla gets on the bus.

                             marla
                 tyler...

     jack finally looks to her.

                             marla
                 you are the worst thing that ever
                 happened to me.

     doors hiss shut.  the bus leaves, heading away.  jack seems
     relieved.  then, a scream is heard from marla...

     jack turns, looks... through the bus windows: the bus is
     filled with bald men in black: space monkeys.

     jack sprints after the bus...

     the bus speeds away.  onboard, space monkeys subdue marla.

     jack falls to the asphalt, rolls, files-flying.

                             jack
                 son of a bitch!
