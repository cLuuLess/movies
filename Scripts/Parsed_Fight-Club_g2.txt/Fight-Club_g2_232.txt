     int. top-level parking area - seventh floor

     jack enters, heaving.  again, no cars.  he moves from one
     support post to another, searching.  he finally spies,
     across the garage, nine large canisters, heavily-wired.

     jack runs to the bomb, frantic.  he walks around it.
     there's a digital clock, ticking down from "10:05"...

     jack moves to pull the lid off one canister, looks inside..

                             tyler
                 could be worse...

     jack looks -- tyler's seated, his back against one post.

                             tyler
                 you could be standing under 37
                 stories of steel and concrete with a
                 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped
                 to the support... oh, maybe it
                 couldn't be...

                             jack
                       (points at bomb)
                 you... you can't be serious about
                 this.

                             tyler
                 what a ridiculous thing to say.

                             jack
                 i can't let you...

                             tyler
                              ...go through with this?
                 what are you going to do?

                             jack
                 i'm going to...

                             tyler
                           ...stop me?

                             jack
                 i'm not going...

                             tyler
                            ...to let this happen!

                             jack
                 stop finishing...

                             tyler
                         ...your sentences!  they're
                 our sentences.  get your mind around
                 that.

     tyler gets up walks to jack.

                             tyler
                 what are you doing running through
                 the streets in your underpants?  we
                 both use that body.

                             jack
                 since when is project mayhem about
                 murder?

                             tyler
                 the buildings were evacuated thirty
                 minutes ago.  everything's proceeding
                 exactly as planned.

                             jack
                 you don't know that.  there could
                 still be people inside.

     tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms.

                             tyler
                 maybe.  maybe a couple of guys with
                 shaved heads couldn't synchronize
                 their watches.  good riddance.

     jack looks back to the bomb, goes to it, wipes sweat off his
     face.  he starts finger the many wires, sorting them.

                             tyler
                 i wouldn't be doing that.  unless you
                 know which wires, in what order...

                             jack
                 if you know, i know.

     jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go
     through the tangle of colored wires.

                             tyler
                 or... maybe i knew you'd know, so i
                 spent the whole day thinking about
                 the wrong ones.

     jack chooses one wire, green, holds it in his fingers.

                             jack
                 if i'm wrong, we're both dead..

                             tyler
                 this is not about martyrdom.

     jack twists the green wire around his finger.

                             jack
                 i'm pulling the green wire.

                             tyler
                 green?  did you say green?

     tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look,
     seems genuinely concerned.

                             jack
                 yes...

                             tyler
                 don't pull the green wire.  pull
                 anything but the green wire.

                             jack
                 fuck you.

                             tyler
                 i'm serious.  that's the wrong one.

     jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers
     trembling.  the sound of a vehicle is heard from below...

                             tyler
                 hear that?  marla's here.  just in
                 the nick of time, eh?

     jack looks to tyler.  tyler points towards the sound...

                             tyler
                 see for yourself.

     jack releases the wire, walks to a railing, gun in hand,
     keeps an eye on tyler.  jack looks over the railing...

     below, a bus idles.  the doors open and marla's dragged out,
     kicking and screaming, carried by six space monkeys...

                             marla
                 you motherfuckers...

     they carry marla into the building's entrance.

     jack leans against the railing, exhausted.

                             tyler
                 i've got everything.  the bombs.  the
                 army.  i've got marla.

                             jack
                 bob is dead, tyler.  the police blew
                 a hole in his head.  was that part of
                 your plan?

     tyler thinks, shrugs.

                             tyler
                 bob was a grown man.  in any great
                 struggle, there will be casualties.
                 wouldn't that be implicit in the
                 name?  project "mayhem."

                             jack
                 fuck your struggle.  i want out.

                             tyler
                 you want out?

                             jack
                 i quit.

                             tyler
                 not an option, for the most obvious
                 of reasons.  you need to get with the
                 program.
                       (looks at his watch)
                 seven minutes.  let's get out of here.

     tyler's walks away.  jack looks at the gun in his hand.  he
     points the gun at tyler...

                             jack
                 tyler...

                             tyler
                       (still walking away)
                 what?

                             jack
                       (cocks the gun)
                 defuse the bomb.

     tyler stops walking.

                             tyler
                 ask me nicely.

                             jack
                 defuse the bomb, please.

                             tyler
                 defuse the bomb?

                             jack
                 yes.

     tyler strides towards the bomb.  jack trains the gun...

                             jack
                 please.

     tyler looks at the bomb, reaches over to it.  he grips the
     green wire, yanks it out -- the clock stops.

     jack lowers his gun.

                             tyler
                 i did that for you.  as a gesture.
                 now, how fast can you run?  there are
                 ten other bombs, in ten other
                 buildings in the immediate area.  if
                 you're going to get them all, you
                 better get cracking.
                       (looks at watch)
                 six minutes.  green wires, remember.
                 i'll be upstairs.

     jack's stunned.  tyler walks across the parking garage, past
     jack, heading for the stairs.

     jack aims the gun at tyler's back, fires!

     tyler ducks to one side, impossibly quick, avoiding...

     tyler spins to face jack.

                             tyler
                 whoa!  what was that all about?

     jack aims... fires!

     tyler dodges behind a post as the bullet throws concrete.

     jack edges forward, gun held in both hands, moves around the
     post... tyler is not there.  jack turns, takes slow steps,
     moving the gun from side to side...

     suddenly, a fist enters frame -- slugs jack's face.

     jack falls.  the gun goes clattering across the floor...

     jack turns, looking... tyler's gone.  jack looks to the gun,
     scrambles to his feet, running to pick up the gun...

     tyler kicks jack in the chest, sends jack sprawling.

     jack rolls, holding his chest.  he looks up, sees tyler run
     into the stairwell.  jack grabs the gun and follows...
