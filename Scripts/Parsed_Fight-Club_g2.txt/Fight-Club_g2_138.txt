     ext. large parking lot - day

     jack and tyler, in work gloves, armed with tools, work
     together to lift the entire metal plate of exit spikes from
     the ground.  they reverse it, then replace it.

     moments later

     jack and tyler walk away, each carrying a 4x4 plank of wood.

                             jack
                 there's fight club in delaware city.

                             tyler
                 i heard.  local 15, monday nights.

     as they pass parked cars, they swing the planks against
     front bumpers -- activating alarms and inflating air bags...

                             jack
                 local 8 just started in penns grove.
                 and, bob said he was at fight club in
                 newcastle last week.

                             tyler
                 newcastle?  did you start that one?

                             jack
                 i thought you did.

     in the background, a car quickly exits the parking lot --
     front tires exploding, wheel rims throwing sparks.
