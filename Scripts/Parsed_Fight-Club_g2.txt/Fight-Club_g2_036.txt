     jack hesitates, unsure, then run/walks to catch up to her...

                             jack
                 um... marla, should we maybe exchange
                 numbers?

                             marla
                 should we?

                             jack
                 in case we want to switch nights.

                             marla
                 i suppose.

     jack takes out a business card, writes his number on the
     back, hands it to her.  she takes the pen, grabs his hand
     and writes her number on his palm.  she walks into the
     street, causing more screeching and honking.  she turns,
     holds up the card.

                             marla
                 it doesn't have your name.  who are
                 you?  cornelius?  mr. taylor?  dr.
                 zaius?  any of the stupid names you
                 give each night?

     jack starts to answer, but the traffic noise is too loud.
     marla just shakes her head, turns, and keeps moving.  a bus
     moves into view, obscuring her.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 this is how i met marla singer.
