     int. lou's tavern - same

     the men, including jack and tyler, enter and stand against
     the back wall, waiting.  the bartender, irvine, calls out:

                             irvine
                 drink up people.  we're closing.

     irvine flicks on the lights.  drunken customers squint and
     get the message.  they plop down money, leaving.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 it was right in everyone's face.
                 tyler and i just made it visible.

     irvine hits a button and the jukebox loses power.  members
     of the waiting army begins to share secret looks.  finally,
     one buy locks the door.  two other guys close the blinds.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 it was on the tip of everyone's
                 tongue.  tyler and i just gave it a
                 name.
