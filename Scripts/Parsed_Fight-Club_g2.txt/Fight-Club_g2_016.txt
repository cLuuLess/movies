     jack walks along, moving through an ice cavern...

                             leader's voice
                 that's right.  you're going deeper
                 into your cave.  and you're going to
                 find your power animal...

     jack comes upon a penguin.  the penguin looks at him, cocks
     his head to signal jack forward.

                             penguin
                 slide.

     the penguin jumps onto a patch of ice and slides away.
