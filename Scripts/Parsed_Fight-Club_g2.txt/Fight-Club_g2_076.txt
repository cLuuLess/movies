     int. reading room - night

     candles burn.  tyler and jack are seated across from each
     other on the buckled floor, reading magazines.  rain drips
     from the ceiling.  no furniture.  thousands of magazines.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 the previous occupant had been a bit
                 of a shut-in.

                             tyler
                       (of magazine)
                 hum.

                             jack
                 what?

                             tyler
                 oh, a new riot control grenade...
                       (reading)
                 "...the successful combination of
                 concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash-
                 blasts and simultaneous high-velocity
                 disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."

     tyler begins ripping the article from his magazine.

                             jack
                       ("reader's digest")
                 "i am joe's lungs."  it's written in
                 first person.  "without me, joe could
                 not take in oxygen to feed his red
                 blood cells."  there's a whole
                 series -- "i am joe's prostate."

                             tyler
                 "i get cancer, and i kill joe."

     tyler tosses his article in a pile of other articles,
     chooses another magazine.

                             jack
                 what are you reading?

                             tyler
                 soldier of fortune.  business week.
                 new republic.

                             jack
                 show-off.
