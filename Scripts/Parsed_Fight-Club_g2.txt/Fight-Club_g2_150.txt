     viewed out 3rd story window: tyler uses a rake, dragging it
     across rocks and dirt.  he stops a moment, rake on his
     shoulder, staring off.  then, back to work...

                             tyler
                       (muttering quietly)
                 ... you are not how much money you
                 have in the bank.  you are not the
                 shoes you wear.

     tyler's marking a large square in the weeds and rubble of
     the backyard, kicking rocks away, dragging the rake...

                             tyler
                 you are not the contents of your
                 wallet...
