     int. kitchen - morning (resuming)

     tyler laughs, shakes his head.  jack's gripping his reader's
     digest just a little too tight.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 how could tyler not go for that?
                 night before last, he was splicing
                 sex organs into "little mermaid."

     tyler sits, studies jack's face.

                             tyler
                 you're okay with this?

                             jack
                 i'm fine.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 put a gun to my head and paint the
                 wall with my brains.

     tyler smokes.

                             tyler
                 she is a wild, twisted bitch.  stay
                 away from that one.

                             jack
                 oh, and my pace is more librarians.

                             tyler
                 hey... don't knock librarians.

                             jack
                 marla doesn't need a lover.  she
                 needs a case worker.

                             tyler
                 she needs an exorcist.  this isn't
                 love.  this is sport-fucking.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 she'd invaded my support groups, now
                 she's invading my home.

                             tyler
                 listen... do me a favor... sit here
                 a minute...

     tyler pulls out a closer chair, motions to it.  jack puts
     down his reader's digest and moves to that chair.

                             jack
                 what?

                             tyler
                 you've gotta understand something
                 about me.  i have a little rule,
                 okay?  don't ever talk to her about
                 me.  ever.  i can't stand that kind
                 of shit.

     tyler fixes jack with a friendly, but firm stare.

                             tyler
                 if you ever say anything about me or
                 about what happens here in this
                 house, to her or anyone -- i will
                 find out.  and you'll never see me
                 again.  promise me.

                             jack
                 okay.

                             tyler
                 promise you won't.

                             jack
                 yes, i promise.

                             tyler
                 promise?

                             jack
                 i said i promise!

                             tyler
                 that was three times you promised.

     tyler smiles, gets up and leaves.  jack sits smoldering.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 if only i had wasted a couple of
                 minutes and gone to watch marla die,
                 none of this would have happened.
