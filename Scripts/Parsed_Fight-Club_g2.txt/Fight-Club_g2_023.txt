     ext. first methodist church - night

     marla walks out,  the support group's dispersing.  jack
     exits amongst them.  he spots marla walking away.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 and suddenly, i felt nothing.  i
                 couldn't cry.  so, once again, i
                 could not sleep.

     jack stares after marla for a long moment.  he walks away.
