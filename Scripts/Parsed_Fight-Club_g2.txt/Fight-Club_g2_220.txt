     int. tyler's room

     jack sits by the phone, pulls out the hotel bill, runs his
     finger up and down the list of phone numbers...

                             jack (v.o.)
                 deja vu, all over again...

     jack finger stops on a number.  he dials, phone to his ear.

                             voice
                       (from phone)
                 eighteen-eighty-eight.

     jack sees a file on the wall: "1888 century park east."

                             jack
                 who is this?

                             voice
                 maintenance.

                             jack
                 listen, something is going to happen,
                 something terrible...

                             voice
                 very good, sir.

                             jack
                 excuse me?

                             voice
                 don't worry about us, sir.  we're
                 solid.

                             jack
                 now wait, there's been a mix-up.
                 everything's changed...

                             voice
                 you told me you'd say that.

                             jack
                 abort the plan.

                             voice
                 you told me you'd say that, too.

                             jack
                 did i tell you i'd call you a fascist
                 dickhead?!

                             voice
                 well, sir, you said you might.

     jack hangs up, desperately dials the next number on the bill.

                             different voice
                       (front phone)
                 twenty-one-sixty.  maintenance.

     jack sees a file: "2160 pico boulevard."  he throws the
     phone, pocketing the bill.  he grabs up all the files.
