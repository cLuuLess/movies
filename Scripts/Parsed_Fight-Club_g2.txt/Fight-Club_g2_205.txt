     int. another bar - day

     jack walks in.  the place is empty.  he walks to a kitchen
     door, opens it and peers in at... a group of kitchen workers
     solemnly stand in a circle, chanting...

                             kitchen workers
                 his name is robert paulson.  his name
                 is robert paulson...

                             man's voice (o.s.)
                       (from behind jack)
                 welcome back, sir.

     jack whirls, startled -- facing the wounded bartender, who
     wears a neck brace, his nose a smashed eggplant.

                             wounded bartender
                 how have you been?

                             jack
                 ... you know me?

                             wounded bartender
                 is this a test, sir?

                             jack
                 yes... it's a test.

                             wounded bartender
                 you were in here last thursday night.

                             jack
                 what?

                             wounded bartender
                 you were standing right where you are
                 now, asking how good our security is.
                 it's tight as a drum.

                             jack
                 who do you think i am?

                             wounded bartender
                 is this part of the test?

     jack nods slowly.  the bartender holds up his hand, shows
     the kiss scar on the back of his hand...

                             wounded bartender
                 you're the one who did this to me.
                 you're mr. durden, sir.  tyler durden.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 please return your seatbacks to their
                 full upright and locked position.
