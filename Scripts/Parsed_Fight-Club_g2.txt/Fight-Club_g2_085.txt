     int. office park restaurant - day

     jack, eating lunch, watches the broken-nosed waiter with a
     goatee -- from the above fight -- converse with a maitre d'.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 even if i could tell someone they had
                 a good fight, i wouldn't be talking
                 to the same man.

     the goateed waiter approaches jack and sets a refill soda
     down on the table.  the two of them briefly make eye contact.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 who you were in fight club is not who
                 you were in the rest of the world.
