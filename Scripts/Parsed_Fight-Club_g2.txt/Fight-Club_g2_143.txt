     int. business office - night

     huge office.  rows and rows of desks.  fight club members
     work: one guy moving from computer monitor to computer
     monitor, using a drill to drill a hole into the top of each.

     other guys follow behind, with funnels and cans of gasoline,
     filling each monitor with gasoline.
