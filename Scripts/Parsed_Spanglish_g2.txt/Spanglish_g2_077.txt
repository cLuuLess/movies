78   int. restaurant - cooling room - day                      78

     again there is a kind of strange rapidity to the conversation
     sparked by john..

                         john

               what's up? what's wrong?

                         peter

               i've gotten a fantastic offer for
               my own place..everybody wants to
               back me since the paper came out.

                         john

               what's your reaction?

                         peter

               honestly? because i've had this
               very unusual reaction.

                         john

               yeah.

                         peter

               i've had a hard on almost all day
               and it won't go away. like i'm
               riding on the back seat of a bus
               with bad shocks and every other
               passenger is a gorgeous woman with
               a yellow sports top whose leaning
               over. it's like every dream i ever
               had and some even i didn't have the
               balls to dream..

                         john

               so you're considering taking it?...
                   (he looks at him)
               okay, here's the thing. i can't
               lose you and still keep the hours
               i'm keeping. i can't do my life
               unless i can hold onto you.
                   (sudden thought)
               i think i just gave you an
               incredible bargaining position.
