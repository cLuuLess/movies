159   int. john's car - late night                                159

      two pissed-off people..jaws set...breathing labored..as the
      car starts and flor looks back, she lets out a guttural and
      explosive shout...

                           flor

                     (a quick and mighty vent)
                 arrchhhhhyeeeeiii!
      for john, the first clear thing he has heard in a while..

                           john

                 yes! exactly! well put! teach me
                 that word sometime. i can really
                 use it.
      she nods..there is almost a moment of relaxation..then the
      anger fires an immediate need..she leans across the seat to
      deliver an urgent message to him. the words come out
      exponentially too forcefully.

                           flor

                 i quit this job!
      his spontaneous and forceful reaction surprises her..

                           john

                 i quit this job!!!!!
      as he turns onto sunset.




                                                      106.








                    flor

          that's the bus stop.

                    john

          i'll take you home.

                    flor

          no. drop me at a bus.

                    john

          oh, shut up and stop telling me
          what to do.

                    flor

          okay...then let's do something
          besides driving me home where my
          daughter isn't.

                    john

          okay..we'll do something.

                    flor

          and i'm supposed to figure out what
          because i'm a housekeeper and you
          don't have to think.

                    john

          oh, don't do the class thing,
          man..you don't know where i come
          from.

                    flor

          alright, i know. but i can't be
          responsible no more for making sure
          nothing happens. that's another
          terrible job i quit.

                    john

          what are you talking about? i take
          responsibility for anything within
          a block. you have nothing to worry
          about. that's my job.

                    flor

          excellent. so you're going to
          figure out what we do, right?

                    john

          yes. okay. big man figure out!

                    flor

          stop there.
she points to a mall..he looks at her and pulls in.
