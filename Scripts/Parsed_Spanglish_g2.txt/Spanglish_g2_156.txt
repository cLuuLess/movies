157   int. entrance hall - night                               157

      as they arrive at the interior entrance, john comes down the
      stairs just as flor opens the front door.

                            john

                  where you going?

                            flor

                  i'm leaving....i have finally..

                            john

                  me too..i'll drive you.

                            flor

                  no.

                            john

                  yes..come on...it's past midnight
                  here.

                            flor

                  if you truly don't know why i say
                  "no" let me at last say the reason.
                  at least that will be a relief.
                  have you no idea that i....




                                                             104.







      before she can there is the sound of scratching toes on the
      floor and a ball comes into lower frame with a dog's
      snout..flor loses her thought and tosses the ball.

      other angle.

      as chum, now the only happy creature in the house, fetches it
      and returns.

                           john

                 look i have to get out of here
                 right now..

                           flor

                 go..
      john exits to driveway...flor makes one last toss..these
      tosses have not made a dent in her anger and frustration.

                           flor (cont'd)

                 goodbye, chum.
      another toss and flor follows john out the door.

      on chum.

      no longer happy. he has lost his only easy mark. he stares at
      the closed door..the ball drops from his mouth to the floor.
