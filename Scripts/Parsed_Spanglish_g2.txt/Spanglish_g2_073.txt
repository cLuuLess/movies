74   int. clasky master bedroom - day.                            74

     the claskys are engaged in sex. john's brief sounds are
     exuberant..they shift position so that deborah is on top
     bringing deborah into a close single. suddenly her smile
     fades - she hits the skids.

                          deborah

                oh, damn it --- what am i going to
                do? everything seems so surely
                pointless...

     on john.

     this is weird. and then the small, distinctive sound of deb's
     climax...then, in a relatively small voice.

                          deborah's voice

                okay here...okay there...good,
                good, good.
     she falls off him...an arm across her eyes, lying on her back
     down the bed from him...

     on john.

     puzzling over what just happened..a few false starts forming
     his thought...then finally..hesitantly...

                            john

                hey, deb?

                           deborah

                    (from the vortex of
                      depression)
                yeah?
     he scoots to her side.

                          john

                you know, i guess i got used to you
                getting a little blue after
                intercourse...but during..??

                          deborah

                something else i do wrong.
     she grabs something and starts walking toward the bedroom.




                                                             50.








                         john

               you've gotta stop walking away.

                         deborah

                   (turning)
               if i stay, i will say awful things
               to you that i might not even
               mean..you pick.

                            john

               see ya.
     she exits to the bathroom.
