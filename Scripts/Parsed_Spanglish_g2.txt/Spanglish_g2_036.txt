     flor smiling..enjoying the canyon..as she walks the mile plus
     from the bus stop to work..one of a straggly line of
     domestics. deborah jogs into view.

                         deborah

               hi, flor..see you up there.
     deborah runs past..she is clearly upset..she is also more
     than a stay-in-shape jogger. she is an athletic woman fueled
     by an ever flickering pilot light of anxiety. this makes her
     seriously quick. she is highly aware of passing
     everybody..she needs to pass everybody..her voice trails
     behind her as she announces to all as she approaches.."left,
     please," "left," "left."
