165   int. restaurant kitchen - night                             165

      as john starts cooking up a storm...there is some velocity to
      his cooking...he still seethes. then reacts as spanish music
      starts to play. he clears his throat as if he must make a
      speech. then does so again..some vocal spasm paying tribute
      to the increasingly intoxicating tension he feels.
