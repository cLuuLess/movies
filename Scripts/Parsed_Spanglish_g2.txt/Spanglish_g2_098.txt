99    ext. clasky rented beach house - day.                        99

      evelyn is sitting on the patio making sangria..flor enters.
      she is pissed.

                          evelyn

                what's wrong?
      she shows her the letter. evelyn reads it and hands it
      back..she is about to offer something..flor waves it off and
      enters the house..john comes in from the beach with his
      kids..boogie boards...evelyn hands him the letter..

                          evelyn (cont'd)

                she's wild-eyed over this..
      john moves after flor as bernie reads the letter..

                           bernice

                aw, shit..
                    (then quickly)
                sorry about the word, georgie.

                             georgie

                it's okay.

                          bernice

                you want to know what happened?

                          georgie
