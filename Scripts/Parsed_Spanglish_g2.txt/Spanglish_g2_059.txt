     angle on deborah & killer hill:

     two young athletic men and one woman considerably ahead of
     her on the steep incline.

                         deborah

               left..left..

     on runners.

     they turn and look confused at deborah who is so far behind
     them she has no need to pass..they turn away. deborah
     struggles to turn it on and does so...huffing to just behind
     them where she utters one more strained:

                         deborah (cont'd)

               left.
     and then passes.
