75   int. john's car - day.                                    75

     very upset as he drives. then comes to the red light at the
     end of the street and sees flor walking with others. an
     awkward beat as he waits for the light to change and they
     acknowledge each other..the light remains red..she confers
     with another woman.

                         flor

                   (to woman)
               yo leÌ la crÌtica buena.
     the woman tells flor how to say it in english.

                         flor (cont'd)

                   (parroting woman)
               i read your good review.
     he nods..still the light doesn't change.

                            flor (cont'd)

               it's nice.
     the light changes.

                         john

               not so far...how you doing?
     the light has changed - cars are beeping..she is about to let
     him go off but realizes he will wait for her answer.

                            flor

               i do fine.
     he nods and drives off.
