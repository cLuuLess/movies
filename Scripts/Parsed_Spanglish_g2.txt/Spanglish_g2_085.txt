86   ext. pch - day                                               86

     as she leads flor along the highway side of carbon beach -
     passing houses until she sees a hispanic man washing
     someone's car in a driveway. evelyn is many steps back.

                          deborah

                oh, good. do you speak english?

                             hispanic man

                yes, i do.

                          deborah

                would you translate for me?
     he looks at flor..my god.

                          hispanic man

                sure...forever.
     he speaks to her in spanish..a lavish, poetic compliment.
     flor, in full control, says, in spanish.."would you please
     just find out what she wants." evelyn joins them.

                          deborah

                wait till i say something before
                you start in..
                    (he looks at her)
                i rented a house here for the
                summer and now she must sleep at
                the house because of the bus
                schedule.
     he translates along with deborah's speech.

     on flor.

     stricken. she turns to deborah.

                          flor

                no.. sorry.

                             deborah

                what? why?
     flor talks briefly in spanish.

                          hispanic man

                she can't because of her daughter.

                          deborah

                you have a daughter? you have a
                whole daughter you haven't
                mentioned..how old?

                             flor

                twelve.




                                                        57.








                     deborah

              (to evelyn)
          it's a little crazy that i don't
          know that.
the man translates.

                    deborah (cont'd)

              (to man)
          don't translate asides.
the man says in spanish to flor.."you work for her?"--flor
answers, "just tell her that i can't live here." deborah
doesn't like that the man has initiated more conversation.

                      deborah (cont'd)

          hey!

                    hispanic man

          she can't live here. her daughter.

                    deborah

          okay..
              (beat then big decision)
          her daughter can also live with us
          for the summer..
the man tells flor..she answers directly to deborah..

                     flor

              (big decision)
          no, sorry.

                      deborah

          why?
the man asks flor who speaks in spanish..

                    hispanic man

          i don't know. she just doesn't want
          to.

                    deborah

          will you please just tell me what
          she said.

                    hispanic man

          she said, "i just don't want to."

                    evelyn

          if she didn't tell us about her
          child she has to have a deep sense
          of privacy. we can figure out how
          she can still live at home. hell, i
          don't mind driving her at night.




                                                             58.








                         deborah

               let's spare the world you on the
               roads.
                   (to flor)
               well, what do we do?
     the hispanic man translates the last sentence. deborah and
     flor stare at each other..deborah's next words are somber and
     have enough body language to transcend the need for
     translation...the jig is up.

                         deborah (cont'd)

                   (big decision)
               i'm sorry, my friend, this is what
               i need. it's just for the summer. i
               don't want to lose you. but ....
     flor indicates there is no need to translate. a beat.

                         flor

                   (enormous decision)
               yo vivo aqu√å.

                         hispanic man

               she'll live here.
     the man says something in spanish to flor as she starts to
     walk away and she is thrown enough by the statement to
     actually stumble as she looks back at him...then, before
     deborah can admonish him.

                         hispanic man (cont'd)

               i said, "god protect you from that
               boss."
