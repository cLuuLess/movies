      deborah and cristina standing in a grass bordered parking
      lot...deborah, feigning upset, tearing into her bag but her
      focus is elsewhere as she periodically looks off. she is
      clearly stalling.

                          deborah (cont'd)

                can't find my keys..
      another woman, arlene folsom, calls to her..

                             arlene

                deborah...

                          deborah

                    (acting surprised)
                hi, arlene..
                    (to cristina)
                come on.
      they walk to greet arlene.

                          deborah (cont'd)

                hi. this is cristina..the girl i'm
                always raving about..this is arlene
                folsom..the school director.

                             arlene

                hi..

                          cristina

                    (barbara boxer couldn't do
                     it better)
                hello..a pleasure to meet you, ms.
                folsom. i couldn't believe how
                beautiful the grounds were as we
                drove in. i just think the balance
                of the buildings to open ground is
                so wonderful and must have been
                very difficult to achieve.
      deborah smiles with pride at the elegant first impression
      cristina is making..all are grinning...the two adults
      suspiciously so...sharing their delight.

                          arlene

                would you like a little tour?

      moving camera..

      first showing cristina in foreground and her pov of this drop
      dead gorgeous rich kids school in the background and then we
      move closer on cristina. we see lust in her reaction.

                          narrator

                the experience was literally mind
                boggling. my mind did boggle. my
                cranial cells stunned. even if i
                had enough sense of wonder to
                imagine such a school existed; my
                sense of fairness made it
                unthinkable that any school could
                offer this much more than my own..
