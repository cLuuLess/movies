51   int. stairwell - early evening                               51

     flor one step behind john and deborah who are moving quickly
     down the stairs...john pissed..deborah feeling the futility
     of anyone understanding her point even as she makes it.




                                                              38.








                         deborah

               she's right between the two
               sizes..i thought about it..what am
               i supposed to do encourage
               her...what is it? - denial? or
               motivate her to get herself in
               shape.
     flor tries to slide by..something surreptitious in her
     behavior..deborah suddenly turns to flor.

                         deborah (cont'd)

               flor..
     she holds out her hand in a "we women understand" gesture.
     flor does not waver..just meets her eyes.

                         flor

               me puedo ir?..go..can go?

                         deborah

                   (a bit nonplussed)
               sure. go.

                         john

               i'll drive you to the bus stop.
     and that fast they are gone.
