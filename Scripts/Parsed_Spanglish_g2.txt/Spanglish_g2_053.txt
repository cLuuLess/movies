54   ext. bus stop - early evening..                             54

     as flor is dropped off...the goodbye awkward.

                         narrator

               the job was taxing her. she had no
               template for confusion let alone
               frustration.
     while waiting for the bus, flor suddenly turns and runs a few
     yards...and then back..and waves off the looks from her
     colleagues - many of whom are overweight..many of them
     adorable. all puzzled for the moment as they watch flor
     unsuccessfully try to shake off her day.
