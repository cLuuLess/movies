103   int. flor's room - evening                                  103

      music in: action, purpose, energy.. flor is dictating in
      spanish as cristina writes it down in english on a pad.
      cristina enormously uncomfortable.

      insert - the pad.

      the pad, in effect, lends subtitles to flor's words. cristina
      winces with the words she records even while punctuating
      perfectly.

                            pad writing

                  you cannot take my child without my
                  permission..and, if you had asked
                  me i would not have given
                  permission. is this why you did not
                  ask? because you knew this. you
                  have no rights over my private
                  life.

      on flor..

      reaching a decisive conclusion.

                            pad

                  if you have any disagreement with
                  this, i no longer wish to work
                  here.

      on cristina's look

      this is awful news.

      on flor.

      for a decisive nod of affirmation. she adjusts her daughter's
      hair to the way it was, takes the note and exits.
