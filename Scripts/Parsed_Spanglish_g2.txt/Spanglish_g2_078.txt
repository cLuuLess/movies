     as john and deborah lay next to each other.

                         deborah

               so you gave away twenty percent of
               the restaurant without talking to
               me about it.

                         john

               yeah. if i didn't do it - i'd have
               been coming home just to sleep.




                                                             53.








                         deborah

                   (trying to make livid more
                    attractive)
               remember the other day when you
               asked me the perfect response to
               something i said?...i'm asking you
               now..what would you like my
               response to be to your giving away
               twenty percent of the business
               without asking me?

                         john

                   (with great enthusiasm)
               "you're ma man!"

                         deborah

               okay! so that would be???

                         john

               my dream response from you, yes.

                         deborah

                   (measured)
               i'm not quite there..actually, i
               just had this flash that the reason
               women in the old days used to faint
               was to avoid doing acts of violence
               against men.
                   (a beat then)
               and i was all worried about
               figuring out the timing just to
               talk to you about renting a place
               for the summer.

                         john

               well, i think you got your timing.
