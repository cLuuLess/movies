82   ext. convertible - day..                                     82

     deborah's hair whips across her face...it's bothersome.

                         deborah

               i'll never be one of those girls
               whose hair blows perfectly in a
               convertible.

                         realtor

               move your seat forward..
     puzzled, she uses the electric lever and the seat budges
     forward..

                         realtor (cont'd)

               a little more..just..good.
     the realtor uses his switches and raises his window a
     bit..her window a bit less and monkeys the position of the
     half windows in back...deborah turns around checking out the
     odd tweaking and then faces forward. her hair blows perfectly
     and beautifully behind her...

                         deborah

               oh, you must be trouble.
     on his small laugh...
