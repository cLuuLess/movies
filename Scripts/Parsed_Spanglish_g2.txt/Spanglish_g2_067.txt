68   int. clasky house - georgie's room                          68

     we move with john and georgie to georgie's room where he goes
     to his collectibles..he holds up a card..

                         georgie

               he says he'll give me any three
               silvers for him.

                         john

               i don't know...this is the one you
               started with..you really want to
               give up your first card?
     note: this is an involved discussion on both their
     parts..nothing in john thinks it is trivial.

                         georgie

               i know..that's why i needed you.

                         john

               ..this is your favorite..

                         georgie

               i think he'd go higher.

                         john

               but it's not numbers..it's.....
     they are interrupted by a never quite heard before sound of
     exultation..
