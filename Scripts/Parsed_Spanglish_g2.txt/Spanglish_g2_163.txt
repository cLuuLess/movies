164   int. john's restaurant - night...                           164

      as they enter the main restaurant...

                            flor

                  i've never seen your place. very
                  perfect.
      he heads for the kitchen.

                            john

                  i'm going to cook, beautiful.
                      (on a dime correction)
                  i'm going to cook beautifully.

                            flor

                  hey..please..
      he turns.

                            flor (cont'd)

                  we both were not normal because we
                  are angry and we act like we are
                  angry with each other and we are
                  not..i am not. i am glad to be with
                  you. it feels comfortable to be
                  with you. if i just left the job
                  and never spoke with you it would
                  have been sin. you understand?

                            john

                  ummmmmmmmm...yes.
      he stands next to her and, for want of a better physical
      expression, pats her on her back..she eyes him, almost
      critical about the lame extent of his aggression....he can't
      quite look at her...he pats her again..

      rear angle..the pat on the back.

      the pat is becoming a rub..he cups her back..slides his
      hand..she responds just a bit..

                            john (cont'd)

                  i think i'm inventing a horrible
                  new way of making out..

                            flor

                  not so horrible.....
      his hand keeps going..he now hugs her to him even though they
      both still face front.. like a loving couple on a walk to the
      market. his hand squeezes her shoulder.

                            john

                  my hand is the only sane part of my
                  body..every other part wants to
                  jump off a cliff.




                                                             109.








                           flor

                     (digging this/almost
                      growing a sense of humor)
                if the other hand could cheer up,
                you could lift me up and carry me
                off.
      he laughs. he takes his hand from around her. it is a bit
      awkward.

                          john

                i don't know how to handle that
                one. i think i already broke my
                record for smooth.

                          flor

                i don't understand.

                          john

                it's me. i'm not making sense. but
                i can get you fed.
      he goes to the kitchen. she begins to explore a little. she
      goes to a cabinet and opens it to find a cd player. she digs
      in her purse and takes out a cd.
