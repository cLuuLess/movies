      john does not answer immediately. the brief pause is noted.

                           flor (cont'd)

                no?

                           john

                sure.

                          john

                    (as they exit to beach
                     with a nervous laugh)
                you have me a little worried...
      he glances back, hoping to have his fears assuaged, they are
      not.
