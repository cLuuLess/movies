     as they enter holding the paper. she has been smacked in the
     heart by gleeful and prideful emotions...it is disorienting
     for her to experience the rush of pleasure.

                         john

               for god's sake..why did you...

                         bernice

               aren't you screaming?..

                         john

               i'm getting there..just the stunned
               thing has to get dealt with...

                   (reading from newspaper)
               john clasky, who at 25 made his
               mark on the new york restaurant
               scene when jammed lived up to and
               survived its silly name, has re-
               emerged as a young and confident
               veteran taking chances with his
               combinations in so subtle a
               manner.."

                         georgie

               if he gave me six...

                         john

                   (catching her excitement)
               wait a minute, your sister's
               talking.
     evelyn indicates to flor that the good news is about
     john..and so she studies him a bit..

                         bernice

               "...beginning with the succession
               of appetizers, each one with its
               own stunning and fully realized
               agenda, is constantly yet casually
               daring."
                   (emotional and earnest
                    aside)
               ah, dad...this is so great...
                   (to others)
               now here's the thing...
     she tears up...evelyn rubs bernie's back..looks at flor and
     taps her heart...flor indicates she should leave and does.
     bernice continues reading with a lovely sense of mission and
     moment. john is taken with his daughter's delivery.

                         bernice (cont'd)

               "eating at this perfect smaller,
               passionate restaurant inspires
               one's own abandonment of caution.
               to wit: john clasky is the best
               chef in the united states."

                         john

                   (genuinely enthusiastic)
               look how great you read it.

                         bernice

                   (massive irony)
               perfect, dad.
     evelyn and bernice hug him..

                         evelyn

               john..john...oh, my god you even
               look different to me....

                         john

                         bernice
