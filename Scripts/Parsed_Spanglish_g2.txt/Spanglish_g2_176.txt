177   int. maid's room - night...                              177

      the first time we've seen this room since flor was working
      the sewing machine...john enters. he is down, longing and
      finality make for a brutal cocktail..he rubs his head and
      sits near the sewing machine..he glances over and sees flor's
      spanish/english dictionary..there is a knock on the door.

                          john

                deb, i'm done tonight. i don't
                think we can jam anything else in.

                          bernice's voice

                it's me, dad.
      he springs from the bed and opens the door.

                          john

                what's up, honey?

                          bernice

                just thought i'd check that you
                were back and okay and all.

                          john

                    (feigning innocence)
                because?

                          bernice

                mom was crying for six hours
                straight and grandma was in with
                her all that time mostly saying,
                "he'll be back..he'll be back."
                i've got to get back to georgie.

                          john

                i just hate that you had that kind
                of a night.

                          bernice

                it's good for me to worry about
                something that really matters
                instead of the stupid stuff that's
                usually on my mind...

                          john

                like?




                                                               122.








                              bernice

                       (a big grin)
                   surviving.

                             john

                   you're fantastic, bernie...i love
                   you.

                             bernice

                   it's a slant...
                       (pause then)
                   hey..i know there's a lot you went
                   through but i knew all along that
                   grandma was right about you coming
                   back..i mean totally knew it so i
                   wasn't that worried. but still i...
                       (some emotion out of
                        hiding)
                   i really appreciate it, dad.
                   thanks....stop staring at me..what?
                   you don't know what to say?

                             john

                   right. i don't know what to say.

                             bernice

                   just what you taught me..you're
                   welcome.

                             john
