175   int. downstairs..                                        175

      john turning a light on when deborah bursts into the room.




                                                               120.








                          deborah

                i'm so glad to see you
                    (correcting self)
                ..that you're back.
      john looks up at her - not knowing what to say...he is
      thrown. his demeanor has changed...deeper..serious..

                          john

                it's late, deborah.
      the wrong words start to form..she stops herself..

                          deborah

                well, i just wanted to say.. what i
                said..
      she is on the stairway..he turns to go in the opposite
      direction.

                          deborah (cont'd)

                    (way too loud)
                uhhhh..
      he turns back to her...she stops herself from straying into
      untried words but gestures whether he is coming upstairs to
      bed.

                          john

                    (a beat then)
                i can't sleep upstairs with you..
                just can't for now.
      this rocks her..panicked she grabs at her life preserver.

                          deborah

                i'm just so glad you're back.
      deborah's suddenly classy demeanor provides just the barest
      of footings for them...he looks at her directly for the first
      time since she told him.

                          john

                yeah..okay.
      she nods..then goes back up the stairs..
