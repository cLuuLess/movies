      as john moves past evelyn on his way to work. she looks at
      him a little wild-eyed as they both stand in the doorway.
      straining a bit for breath.

                          john

                you feel okay?

                          evelyn

                no. i've given up drinking.
                    (he looks at her/she sadly
                     nods affirmation)
                i had to do it john..i need every
                brain cell to watch out for all of
                us..given the current climate.
                anyway. john, i think you're great
                and i'm going to act accordingly.

                           john

                    (totally confused)
                good deal.

                          evelyn

                let's hope.
