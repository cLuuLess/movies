180   ext. clasky pool - day.                                    180

      evelyn, bernice and georgie are in the pool..cristina,
      wearing a bathing suit, is on a chaise reading...

                             cristina

                   hey, mom...is it okay if we don't
                   leave right away?
      the others call greetings..save evelyn who studies the
      situation and gets out of the pool..flor is awkward..no idea
      how to handle this...so she goes direct.




                                                       123.








                     flor

          no...
              (as cristina begins to
                protest)
          no..and we must say "goodbye." i
          don't work here anymore.
she then talks spanish to cristina..admonishing her not to
embarrass them..something about flor being prepared to go
nuts all over her daughter if she hurts their dignity...but
it is said with total calm.

                    georgie

          do i have to get out?

                    flor

          no, georgie..stay. i think you are
          a wonderful boy..be good..like you
          are. there are no monsters.

                    georgie

          thanks..thanks. okay.
bernice climbs out of the pool. meanwhile, a flabbergasted
cristina is staring at her mom who gives quiet two and three
word proddings in spanish.

                    bernice

              (severely to georgie)
          i can't believe you didn't get out.

                       georgie

          flor said.

                    bernice

              (to flor)
          i don't want to get you wet.

                    flor

          get me wet.

                    bernice

              (rushing to hug her)
          thanks.
bernice hugs her. evelyn hugs cristina..

                    evelyn

          you...are...a...trip.

                    flor

              (to bernice)
          you're a beauty. amazing girl.




                                                                124.







      despite herself, bernice starts to cry..moans to herself over
      the display...now, in the background, we hear a subliminal
      human voice. incrementally it will grow louder and be
      recognizable as deborah calling flor from the master bedroom
      window..bit by bit, the others will become aware of this as
      flor ignores it...bernice goes to embrace cristina.

                          bernice

                my last chance to have some of you
                rub off on me..
                    (cristina doesn't
                     understand)
                i'm sorry you're so sad but this
                could have been so much worse.

                             cristina

                       (from her depths)
                how?
      and now deborah calling "flor" is getting hard to ignore but
      flor manages..

                          evelyn

                    (to cristina)
                why don't you run upstairs and say
                goodbye to deborah?
      flor flashes a look of thanks.

                          flor

                i'll be in front.
      upset, cristina runs off. she kisses bernice..and walks
      toward the house. as she passes under the bedroom..

                          deborah

                please come see me.
      and then a crying cristina appears on the deck. flor glances
      up and keeps moving underneath the deck where she faintly
      hears the beginning of their exchange

                          deborah's voice

                it's okay, honey..we'll see each
                other at school..i'm going to keep
                an eye on you..i will.
      flor enters the house...
