102   int. clasky rented beach house - day                        102

      evelyn, bernie and flor are gathered in the living room. all
      staring at her.

                          deborah

                what? something bad happen?

      on cristina..

      enormously anxious on reading her mother's mood.

                          deborah (cont'd)

                cristina, tell your mother i just
                played around with your hair..she
                can put it back..no hurt feelings.

                          cristina

                not right now.
      flor puts an arm around her shoulder, leading her off and
      speaking to her forcefully in spanish.

                           deborah

                what? --

                          evelyn

                you can't just take someone
                else's.....

                          deborah

                nuh-uh, mom..don't go there..or
                i'll go there and you know where
                "there" is.
      evelyn stops on a dime. she leaves. deborah crosses to
      bernice, who is highly concerned about flor, and puts an arm
      around her. a pleasant surprise..




                                                                 68.








                            deborah (cont'd)

                  can you believe what flor is making
                  this into..shoot me if i ever get
                  that hard to deal with.
      bernice, unseen by mom, does a long, muted, mock scream.
