186   int. bus - day.                                           186

      almost empty - it's saturday. mother and daughter sit
      together by the giant window in the center of the bus.
      cristina eyes her mother who is bearing her own heartbreak
      with stoic dignity. the girl is becoming less inconsolable
      and more in need of mothering.

                           narrator (cont'd)

                for that reason should you choose
                to grant me your scholarship my
                mother, at my request, will be
                relocating to the new york
                metropolitan area so that she can
                stay close during my time at
                princeton.
      cristina moves closer to flor, who senses it immediately and
      wraps her in her arms.. kisses her head.

                          narrator (cont'd)

                i hope my essay has done her
                justice. i love her with all my
                heart.
