176   int. master bedroom - night                                 176

      evelyn, who has been standing close to the doorway, stands
      clear to let her enter. as deborah flies in wildly vulnerable
      - her breath racing.

                          deborah

                i am literally choking on unsaid
                words..seriously. if this were a
                restaurant ten people would have
                their knuckles in my sternum.

                the fact that you didn't just make
                things worse should fill you with
                hope..
      in her current state, she has to process that one..and does.
      her breath slows.
