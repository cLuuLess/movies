152   int. master bedroom - night...                           152

      john enters the room on the double...passes deborah without
      knowing it..(she is partially obscured by the drape or some
      such). as he passes....camera holds on deborah..she is a
      mess...goopy tear stains..seeing him and his concern brings
      her grief to a higher ground...a sinner humbled by
      goodness..a trembling lip of childlike vulnerability...

                             john

                   deb..deb?..where are you?
      he is about to leave the room...she is about to let him but
      an instinct leads her astray once more.

                                deborah

                   here i am.

                             john

                   baby, what?

                             deborah

                   "baby?" stay there, john...sit
                   down..i suddenly get what i have to
                   do...i just have to get the guts.

                             john

                   is it absolutely necessary to make
                   it this...this scary..can you just
                   say it?

                             deborah

                   not so easy.

                              john

                       (tender/ready for the big
                         healing)
                   yeah..come on..it's me. we can
                   talk.

                             deborah

                   do i ever hope so...i've been
                   seeing another man for the last
                   eleven weeks and it was nothing and
                   i ended it tonight..at first it was
                   just keeping an eye on the real
                   estate market..then it was...what?
                   me being insecure and looking for
                   some ridiculous vali...

      on john...





                                                        99.







a shock victim..he holds up a hand to stop her..

                    john

          go -- hold on...hold on...i'm
          missing what you're saying..you
          can't just keep talking and expect
          me to follow it when you start the
          way you did.......

                    deborah

          just what did you hear?

                    john

          well there was the crack in the
          planet. that was noisy...
she looks at him...a solid beat...

                    john (cont'd)

          there's an actual noise in my
          head.....no kidding..
briefly he does the noise...

                    deborah

              (slowly)
          i met him about...
john holds up a hand to stop her...he needs to gather himself
to hear this..she waits...and waits...as he waits he grows
flushed and stunned with dread. finally a word..

                    john

          you..
she takes that as a cue to start..

                    deborah

          i met him..
he puts up his hand..

                    john

          if you talk that fast...i'll never
          hear you..there's a lot going
          through my mind....have you said
          yet whether you slept with him?

                    deborah

          so far i've just been talking about
          a flirtation because the really
          important thing for you to know...

                    john

          have you said yet whether you've
          had sex with someone else? because
          i really am missing most of your
          words. so help me out here..




                                                          100.








                    deborah

          i've been trying to explain that
          for the first ten weeks there was
          almost nothing to ...

                     john

              (sincerely checking but
               wild)
          you still haven't said, right?

                    deborah

          is this your way of...

                    john

          this is my way of...this is my way
          of asking you whether..
he stops... staggering on the threshold of a diminished
future.

                    john (cont'd)

          oh man, once i ask it...give me a
          second.
              (several beats then some
               conversational good
               manners for keeping her
               waiting)
          i'm just trying to figure out
          whether there's any way to avoid
          knowing..no, damn
              (quickly closing this
               argument with himself)
          there's not...
              (to her)
          okay, you're on..real short answer,
          huh? have you had sex with
          another..

                    deborah

          i know you're very angry?

                    john

              (considering/then
               repressed answer)
          ahhhh...i'm getting there, yes.

                    deborah

              (softly)
          john?
              (on his look)
          i think if you let me tell you the
          full everything of this we'd be in
          a position to deal with it
          better..because eleven weeks ago
          when...




                                                             101.








                          john

                you don't believe that i miss your
                words..i get three or four
                tops...and then just see your mouth
                moving with nothing coming out and
                then i spin out and there's this
                noise...but there's no way to miss
                a "yes" or "no."

                          deborah

                    (blurts)
                yes..

                          john

                    (core simple/eight years
                     old)
                really?

                          deborah

                    (this gets her)
                i made up my mind that i would
                answer every question you had..i'll
                answer anything and everything and
                more.

                          john

                    (perplexed)
                what other questions could there
                be?

                          deborah

                are you really that much nicer than
                me?

                          john

                well, you don't set the bar real
                high.
      he get up and starts to exit..

                          deborah

                no. please, please, please..i
                think if you listen to exactly what
                happened and then do whatever you
                need to...we'll..just let me tell
                you everything..
      the doorbell rings...it's quite late...deborah wondering
      what's up..she looks out the window.

                          deborah (cont'd)

                oh, it's just flor.
