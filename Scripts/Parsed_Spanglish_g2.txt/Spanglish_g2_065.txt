      as john, growing tense, walks toward the front gate..chum
      proffers a ball and accepts defeat as he bends down to pick
      up the new york times. john's body chemistry launches a
      surprise attack...anxiety and dread...he takes his newspaper
      to a wire bench in the front driveway..he finds the
      section..opens to the page..and just like that his life
      changes forevermore.
