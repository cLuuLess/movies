     flor at work..chum, ball in mouth, comes to her and nudges
     her.

                         flor

                   (to dog)
               lo siento. no.
     chum, momentarily depressed, walks away..bernie enters. she
     is a bit overwhelmed -- her voice breaking a bit even with
     one word.

                         bernice

               hey..
     flor turns..bernie moves to embrace her.
