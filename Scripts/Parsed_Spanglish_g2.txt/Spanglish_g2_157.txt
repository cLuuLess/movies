158   ext. clasky driveway - night...                             158

      john is at the car but flor heads for the gate.

                           john

                     (as decisive as we've seen
                      him)
                 i'm taking you.

                           flor

                     (with anger)
                 why?!?

                           john

                 because if i don't -- i'll worry
                 about you and i can't handle that
                 right now, okay?
      flor emits a crooning sound.

                           flor

                 ahhhhh.
                     (stunned and worried)
                 i never made that sound over a man
                 before..




                                                              105.







      flor shudders at her own sappiness as john opens the
      passenger door for her...very much into his own torture he
      nonetheless grabs her arm and guides her up and in..she
      catches and appreciates his automatic gracious manners while
      he is clearly fucked up...she is impatient with his
      solicitousness almost slapping his hands away as he makes
      sure her skirt doesn't get crushed in the door..the
      frustration roiling in her.

                           flor (cont'd)

                 please!?! mandil√≥n.

      other angle..

      deborah watching them...

      her pov.

      her cuckolded husband closing the door behind her gorgeous,
      soon-to-be ex-housekeeper.

      close on deborah..

      she trembles under the force of imminent justice.
