35   int. / ext. clasky house - backyard - night                  35


     john's pov - deborah and two female caterers.

     deborah is wearing a party dress. they are rolling out the
     last huge cylinder of sod, completing the now beautifully
     manicured backyard. it is hard manual labor involving
     physical strength. the female caterers are complaining that
     it's too heavy but deborah is undeterred.

                         deborah

                   (to catering women)
               we can do it. come on.
     she falls over the roll..getting filthy..but it gives and
     they gain momentum...one of the catering women falling down,
     one losing pace.. deborah,however, gains the upper hand. yet,
     even while succeeding, she remonstrates herself.

                         deborah (cont'd)

                   (great exertion)
               why... do... i... care.. so..
               much.. about.... crap?
     and now she wins.. the cylinder of grass rolls all the way
     out and she jumps on the seam in victory. she is dirty,
     spent and triumphant..the components for a solid sexual
     experience..and, in truth, as the exhausted caterers half-
     heartedly applaud the bizarre victory, she has gotten off.
     she looks with mother's pride at the lawn. then sees john.

                          deborah (cont'd)

               can you believe they left without
               finishing?
     as she looks at her handiwork - john looks at her..a
     grin..half laugh.. he loves the dame.




                                                       20.








                    deborah (breathless) (cont'd)

          looks great, huh?.... you're not
          looking.

                    john

          i was getting a kick looking at you
          look at it.
not the answer she wanted..

                    deborah

          i better get dressed again in case
          anybody's just a half hour late.
she hits a switch at the door and the backyard area is now
fully illuminated -- set up for a dinner party for 20 or
so....all details thought about and done to a "t". this is
the outdoor lighting nobody nails..the twinkling of a half
acre..the path to the pool like a runway to heaven. as she
looks at it all she has a wistful moment.

                     deborah (cont'd)

              (a replenishing sigh)
          okay..we're okay here.
              (then)
          why can't everything be like sod?
          there's no wait, no dung, nothing
          you have to do right and yet it's
          perfect. it covers up all your
          dirt and makes things immediately
          pretty..then, the miracle, if you
          just give it time, it roots and you
          can't tell it from the real thing.
              (a look to her husband)
          no reaction. nothing to say.

                    john

          huh? oh sure..i, uh..well, no, i
          don't have anything particular to
          say.

                    deborah

          oh, john why don't you just take
          out a knife and kill me all
          together.
somewhat crushed, she prepares to exit.

                    john

          how'd you get there..hey, wait a
          minute..deb..stop..come on.
              (she turns)
          i'd like to figure this one out.
          what would have been the great
          thing for me to say after you said
          the sod sentence?..really.




                                                             21.








                         deborah

               that's actually a good question.

                         john

               there you go. i surprise sometimes.

                         deborah

               i would have liked, if after i
               compared the sod to life, if you
               had said, "exactly!"
     she turns to leave.

                         john

               yeah. but to say that and mean it
               i'd have to think the same way you
               do.

                          deborah

                    (some sense of mischief)
               it's worth a try...i had something
               else to tell you...it'll come to
               me..
