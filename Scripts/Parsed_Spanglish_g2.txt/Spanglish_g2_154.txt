      deborah can barely look at him...

                ...then, when i was driving back
                tonight after i ended the whole
                yuck thing..i was feeling human.
                i'm done with what's his name..a
                relief... ..and now it can be like
                it never happened and then i
                thought that the only hope was that
                i own that it did happen and that i
                take my medicine here..because if
                i'm walking around with what i did
                and you don't know what i
                did..there is a real limit to how
                close we can be..you're with me and
                i'm this person who has this bad
                secret and we aren't really on the
                same page ever again..so the reason
                i took this chance in telling -- is
                because i want us to be good..i
                want us to be close. i want to
                feel like you're not nuts to be in
                love with me..so what i think is we
                should talk till we pass out ..
                talk till we're so sick of each
                other that there's nothing left to
                do but take the first step out of
                hell..so please let's not leave
                this room until you've heard and
                said everything..please say, okay..
      she awaits his answer..he has heard barely a few words..

                          john

                what?




                                                             103.

                  john..

                            john

                  i've got to get out of
                  here..because you keep talking.
                      (as she starts to follow
                       him)
                  stay put!
      she does. just before he exits.

                            deborah

                  you've got to say something.

                            john

                  you are a terrible wife.
      he exits.
