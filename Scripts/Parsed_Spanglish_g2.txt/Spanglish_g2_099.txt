100   int. living room - day                                   100

      john enters..

                          john

                hey, flor..
      she turns..

                          john (cont'd)

                i'm sorry..very sorry..
      he indicates his watch -- then holds his fingers together.

                          john (cont'd)

                they should be back soon..
      flor starts to cry. she sits in a chair..he sits not far from
      her.

                          john (cont'd)

                hey, flor..
      embarrassed, she says, in spanish, to please leave her
      alone..she turns from him..he walks to the wet bar and gets a
      bottle of water...pours some..her crying soft in the




                                                        66.




background...he walks to her, sits near her and offers her
the glass of water which she takes.

                      john (cont'd)

            deborah made a mistake. i
            understand how you feel...do you
            understand me at all, generally? is
            simpático the word?
he pats her on the back..she looks at him..

close on flor..

is he coming on?..

her pov..

his kind eyes.

full shot..

this is real eye contact..two vaguely humiliated people
finding real company for an instant. without thought, she
duplicates his gesture and pats his back.

                      flor

            simpático, yes.
and when he seeks to add another pat, he misses, because she
is out of her chair..(this is as intimate as john has been
with another woman since he was married..) he calls out to
stop her.

                      john

            un momento, huh?
she stops and turns to him.

                      john (cont'd)

            i'm really sorry this is happening.
            i just want you to know that. i am
            real sorry.
he taps his heart as an indication of sincerity -- then a
flash of worry that he has inadvertently come on to her.

                      john (cont'd)

            i didn't mean..
he makes a gesture of ardent love..

                        john (cont'd)

            i meant..
makes a person to person innocent gesture..she finds herself
smiling.




                                                              67.








                          john (cont'd)

                well, the good thing about being an
                idiot is that every once in a while
                you cheer people up..got to get to
                work.

      camera stays with flor

      as he exits...thinks about john's demeanor, smiles again,
      shakes it off as her mind fills with concern for cristina.
