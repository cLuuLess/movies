19   ext. north valley street - early evening                     19

     as they disembark...the mother studying a slip of
     paper...fearing she has made the mistake of a lifetime. the
     child fascinated by all.

                          narrator

                at the time, i was oblivious to my
                mother's anguish. she loved and
                lived to talk. now, as if by a
                witch's spell, words were no longer
                her bridge but her barrier. in a
                very real sense she feared she had
                left herself behind.

     on the two females.

     the mother sees something. joy returns.

     her pov.

     a street full of stores with signs in spanish..she begins
     walking the street asking passers-by for directions in
     spanish and is answered..her step lightens..she beams with
     relief. so far so very, very good.
