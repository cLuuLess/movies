      he sits..she stands, gorgeous..the wind gusts periodically
      blowing her dress against her body. he tries not to notice.

                          flor

                you know about cristina and your
                great school?

                          john

                oh, it's happened. is it driving
                you nuts?

                          flor

                yes, nuts. i have no idea what to
                do. such an important thing.

                           john

                yeah.

                          flor

                it's a good school?

                          john

                tops. it's tops.

                          flor

                so you like it?




                                                        88.








                    john

          no. i hate the damn school. but
          that's because they keep sending my
          daughter home anxiety-ridden,
          mostly over geometry..i mean you
          "get" bernice..in a decent world
          her school should let her know how
          great she is, right?

                    flor

          very right.

                    john

          so, don't ask me..i'm worried about
          my own kid there.

                    flor

          you don't have to worry about
          bernice. nothing is going to change
          that heart.
he looks at her..out of nowhere overwhelmed by someone
echoing and affirming his deepest most private thoughts about
his daughter..it is odd..being this deeply touched before he
knows what hit him..he makes little adjustments until the
moment passes..

                     john

          um.....yeah..thanks...
              (then)
          it's great to hear someone else say
          that out loud..hard to explain.

                    flor

          i "get" it.

                    john

              (a beat..then deeply, with
               core feelings, a lament)
          ah, man..

                    flor

              (caring)
          it will be okay.

                    john

          no, i was thinking about you..

                    flor

              (instantly alarmed)
          your, "ah, man" was for me? you
          think i am in trouble with
          cristina?

                    john

          it's just tough to be sane.







                    (more)





                                                        89.

                    john (cont'd)
          to know you're not just making
          something out of nothing. that when
          you think you're at some
          crossroads - you are.

                    flor

              (she takes this in/nods)
          ....i never know a man who can put
          himself in my place like you do.
          how do you become that man?

                    john

          i don't know...you introduce two
          jews in the desert and wait five
          thousand years. then, bingo,
          somebody else who can see trouble
          coming but can't do anything about
          it.

                    flor

          i don't understand.

                    john

          that's okay.

                       flor

          i want to.

                    john

          nothing. i don't know what i'm
          talking about..
a sustained gust of wind which celebrates her shape in a way
which cannot be ignored.

                     john (cont'd)

          will you sit down.. get out of the
          damn wind.
she sits. it helps.

                    john (cont'd)

          so you going to send her?

                    flor

          i don't know. but it does not feel
          good. i think if she goes there it
          will be one of two things..either
          she will be odd...or she will make
          herself the same as them.

                    john

              (in wonderment)
          that is exactly the way i felt
          about bernice going there..exactly.













                       (more)





                                                               90.

                          john (cont'd)
                i wasn't able to think it that
                clearly...but that's how i felt. so
                between odd and the same...you
                gotta root for odd, don't you?

                          flor

                yes, you gotta.
      camera begins to pull back...early in the move john's words
      stop the movement.

                          john

                this was a crummy summer.
      flor nods ruefully..then suddenly off a glance at him.

                          flor

                not all crummy.
      suddenly there is a bit of danger..she rises quickly,
      changing mode.

                          flor (cont'd)

                thank you, good night. i go sleep.

                          john

                good night..hey?
      she turns..

                          john (cont'd)

                you speaking english...it's, uh..

                          flor

                what?

                          john

                nothing. just.... nice meeting you.
      she gulps and exits...as the camera pulls back..ending the
      summer at the rented house...as we transition to....
