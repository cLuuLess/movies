125   int. beach house - late night                              125

      as john enters the house, clearly drunk.   there is the sound
      of skittering paws as chum approaches.

                          john

                    (cheering)
                hey, boy, i can use some up
                company.
      but chum feverishly digs his snout against a nearby piece of
      furniture and retrieves a tennis ball and rockets away. john
      follows, weaving a bit.
