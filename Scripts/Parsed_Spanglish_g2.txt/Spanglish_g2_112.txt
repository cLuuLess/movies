113   ext. clasky's rented beach house - late afternoon.          113

      john exits his door and steps to his car..as he is about to
      get in..

                             cristina's voice

                excuse me.
      he looks up and steps around to where she is...there is a
      battered wood table along the side of the house.

                          john

                hi..what's doing?
      she overturns a large bucket and a small mountain of sea
      glass spills on the table.

                             john (cont'd)

                i'm broke.




                                                     72.








                    cristina

              (feeling horrible)
          no..you don't have to pay..i'm
          sorry. don't worry, please.

                    john

          no. i'm kidding..instead of a
          platter -- i'll just build a sea
          glass building and serve fish
          inside... great, cristina..why
          don't you count it and..

                    cristina

          i have... many times..i didn't
          sleep. i counted.

                    john

          so what's the damage...total?
her eyes locked on his.

                    cristina

              (dead serious)
          it depends on whether you consider
          these four a color other than
          green, brown or clear..
she takes them from her pocket.

                    john

          well, this one is borderline.

                     cristina

          i agree.

                    john

          oh my god, you found a blue..nobody
          finds a blue..you know how a blue
          happens? i mean, before the ocean
          blasts it for 30-40 years. somebody
          had to throw away an old milk of
          magnesia bottle. you know what milk
          of magnesia is?

                    cristina

          unfortunately.
he smiles broadly. the kid's a trip. he likes her.

                    john

          so how much for the whole deal?

                    cristina

              (unable to look at him)
          eleven hundred and one dollar.
he reacts..then..




                                                                73.








                          john

                okay. we'll finish dealing with it
                when i get home from work.
      she gasps..
