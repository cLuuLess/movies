172   int. restaurant - very late night...                        172

      they are lying post coitally in each other's arms on a sofa
      just inside the dining room..they are covered by a table
      cloth. they hold hands above the cover...each private but
      still somehow in contact.

                          flor

                oh, johnny, why is everything so
                damn confusing?

                          john

                culpa.
      flor's pleasure zone is rocked. she smiles at his first
      spanish word. she is wrestling with large feelings of
      pleasure and large ominous thoughts.

                          flor

                    (a beat)
                is your mind racing?

                          john

                i would say my mind has
                evaporated...but that there are
                remnants still standing waiting to
                fall. it feels pretty good.

                          flor

                like happy?

                          john

                like happy.

                          flor

                you think that will last?

                          john

                it's already gone.

                          flor

                i understand what you mean.

                          john

                i don't understand what i mean.




                                                       115.








                    flor

          that it's getting late. that
          responsibilities have entered your
          brain. don't hide that from me.
          and really, one large reason we are
          here is because you respect me as a
          mother and i respect you as a
          father..
he is looking at her...she is disconcerted.

                    john

          you're a great and wild mother.

                    flor

          you are a beautiful father.
she looks at him..they kiss...tenderness..heat...intimacy.

                    flor (cont'd)

          when cristina was young, i would
          say i want to take any man who
          wants me to the park and i will
          tell whether i want him from the
          way he is with cristina. i wish
          you had been in the park then.
              (a beat)
          any reaction?
john considering and then the answer comes to him.

                       john

          exactly!..

                    flor

          you know, i always think about when
          you...oh, there's no point. i talk
          too much...
              (a bit of emotion)
          ...because i don't know if we ever
          talk again.

                    john

          hey, hey..how do you get there?
          wait.

                    flor

          yes you do. be honest.

                    john

          i'm being honest.
              (indicates their bodies)
          look at us - i think i call it
          honesty.




                                                             116.








                          flor

                what are we going to do -- go home,
                let our hearts go back in our
                bodies, see each other a few more
                times. make a tragedy out of us..
      she kisses him again...starts to cry....looks at him..emits a
      small cooing sound.

                          flor (cont'd)

                ahhhhhhh.
                    (sudden energy)
                there are some mistakes you cannot
                risk when you have kids...please,
                are you ready to go?

                            john

                     (urgently)
                no. i'm not. no.
                     (then)
                stay put for a second. stay here.
                once our feet touch that floor, i'm
                going to get too many brain cells
                back. so don't be in such a hurry.
                that floor, flor, is going to eat
                us alive.
                     (she settles back/he is
                      energized)
                so you think it was a mistake up to
                now.
                     (she nods "yes")
                that's rough.
      she nods again..trying to gut things out...but as her foot
      touches the floor, she must say one last thing to him.

                          flor

                the mistake....i love it.
