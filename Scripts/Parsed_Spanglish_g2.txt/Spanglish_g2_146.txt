                             narrator

                   though it is possible to judge
                   harshly my conduct toward my mother
                   in my first year at school; almost
                   all professional literature excuses
                   my behavior as developmental, since
                   i was entering an age where
                   rebellion and narcissism were to be
                   expected. and i was being mentored.
      monica and her newly arrived mother are there along with the
      bride from an earlier scene and some of the girls who saw
      cristina off to malibu..women cooking in the kitchen..she
      tells the girls, in spanish, that cristina may not make it.
      they are disappointed...flor thinks - then says something to
      monica who nods in agreement. flor exits.
