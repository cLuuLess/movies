173   int. clasky home - master bedroom - late night.          173

      deborah's face is bleached from crying...the tear ducts of
      her now brown eyes are parched dry..evelyn sits eyeing her as
      she looks through the window at the pre-dawn emptiness of
      stone canyon. in her current shape she would give pause to a
      staff worker at promises..a shock victim walking through the
      rubble after the bomb has dropped. deborah's voice is
      scratchy when she speaks.

                          deborah

                tell me again why i can't call him
                on the cell.

                          evelyn

                besides that he turned it off?

                          deborah

                yes.




                                                       117.








                    evelyn

          forty messages start to look needy.

                    deborah

          mother, you're enjoying this.

                    evelyn

          no..definitely not in the way you
          think.

                    deborah

              (staggered)
          you are enjoying it?!?

                    evelyn

              (rising/honest)
          i am enjoying actually being of use
          to my daughter. i am enjoying the
          fact that i really know how to
          advise you and the miracle that you
          are so deeply disoriented that you
          are gobbling up everything i say.
deborah nods in agreement -- then looks at her mother in a
somewhat new way..as if evelyn were an actual person instead
of an upsetting extension of herself.

                    deborah

              (vulnerable)
          there's one thing i'd like to say
          to you about you and me.

                    evelyn

          you don't have to.

                       deborah

          i want to.

                       evelyn

          okay.

                    deborah

              (quite vulnerable and
               appealing)
          you were an alcoholic and wildly
          promiscuous woman during my
          formative years so that i am in
          this fix because of you. it is your
          fault. i just needed..
              (gestures heart to heart)
          ..that moment for us.

                    evelyn

          you have a solid point, dear. but
          right now the lessons of my life
          are coming in handy for you.




                                                        118.








                    deborah

          there's a car coming....
evelyn moves to her.

                    deborah (cont'd)

          it's him...he's got to tell me
          everything..
evelyn shakes her head "no."

                       deborah (cont'd)

                 (wild-eyed)
          yes!

                    evelyn

          do you know that right now you are
          your own worst enemy..that you
          can't trust one thought in your
          brain?

                       deborah

          duh.

                    evelyn

          then trust me and only allow
          yourself to say one thing to
          him..one thing..."i'm so glad
          you're back."

                       deborah

          huh?

                       evelyn

          yes.

                    deborah

              (babbling)
          but i've got to know whether he
          touched her - where he touched her -
          how he touched her - if they broke
          a sweat --- what they said - who
          made the first move - how they left
          it -- if anyone loves anyone or has
          an intention of making contact in
          the future - what she wore - how he
          felt afterwards - whether anyone
          mentioned me..
              (a wail)
          ..whether they held hands when they
          left..
the distinct sound of a door opening and closing from
downstairs.




                                                             119.








                          evelyn

                just those words i said. if you
                want a prayer of coming out of
                this.

                          deborah

                i know you're right..but..

                            evelyn

                but what?

                          deborah

                    (a small voice)
                i forgot the sentence you said i
                should say.

                          evelyn

                "i'm so glad you're back."

                          deborah

                okay..do i have to wait here?

                          evelyn

                no..he may not come up here..go to
                him.

                          deborah

                why wouldn't he come up here?

                            evelyn

                just go.

                          deborah

                do i need a little makeup?

                          evelyn

                you need a hose but you don't have
                the time. it's fine that you look
                like that. it's genuine..you can
                use genuine.

                          deborah

                thank you, mom.
      she takes a breath exits...
