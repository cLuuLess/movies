     georgie, in a swim suit, talking to chum in the manner of
     people trying to excite dogs.

                         georgie

               who wants to go swimming?..yes, who
               wants to go swimming?
     the dog goes crazy with excitement -- then, droll for a nine
     year old, georgie turns to his grandmother (who is sunning
     herself and reading) and addresses her in precisely the same
     way. evelyn has a drink in hand..

                         georgie (cont'd)

                   (to grandmother)

               the summer after next.
     john enters the scene..
