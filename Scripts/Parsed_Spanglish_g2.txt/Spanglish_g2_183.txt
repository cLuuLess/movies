184   ext. street - day.                                         184

      as she moves alongside him and the gate closes behind her.

                          john

                i was hanging out here waiting.
                can't give you guys a lift?
      flor shakes her head "no." she looks away for a beat so the
      next thing she does is a considered action. she leans forward
      and kisses him on the lips. john looks at her.

                          john (cont'd)

                this is killer.
                    (on her confusion)
                incredibly hard.

                          flor

                yes, cari..
      the gate opens and a sniffling cristina is holding an armful
      of loot.

                          john

                    (reading flor)
                let her have it..party favors.




                                                              127.







      she nods..bites back some emotion and turns from him.

                             flor

                cristina..

                          cristina

                goodbye, mr. clasky..i am very
                sorry we will not see each other as
                frequently.
      she offers her hand, which john shakes while patting her on
      the back.

                             flor

                yes.
      they turn and begin walking down the street.

      shot - stone canyon

      the women walking toward camera, john briefly in the
      background...as they begin their walk flor begins talking in
      spanish.

                          narrator

                the first minute we were alone, my
                mother told me that i would no
                longer go to the private school.

                          cristina

                no. no..you can't. i won't be able
                to forgive you..it will be the end.
                i won't let you.
      and then cristina moves her hysterics to spanish as she stops
      walking and her mother takes her hand and pulls her along
      with enormous dedication. camera begins a pull back.
      cristina dropping presents..picking them up..one of them left
      by the wayside..people noticing..cristina's conduct violating
      tacit zoning laws.

      closer shot..

      so we can see their faces in the struggle.
