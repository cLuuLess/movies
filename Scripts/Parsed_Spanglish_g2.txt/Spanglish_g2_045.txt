     john enters - not seeing flor - goes to the sparkletts water
     container and fills a cup...he is shaken..

                         john

                   (to himself)
               great god in heaven save me.
     boy meets girl.

                         flor

               hi.
     he turns with a start to see flor smiling at him. gorgeous
     squared. his first word is inadvertent.

                         john

               whoa...whoa...i didn't know deborah
               had found someone... you work here?
               you're going to help with the house
               and kids?

                         flor

               solo espa√±ol.

                         john

               you work here and you don't speak
               any english at all?
     the sound of feet on the stairs..deborah and georgie enter.

                          deborah

               all she has to do is dial 9-1-1 and
               press two for spanish.
                   (even before she enters)
               flor...john.
                   (to john enunciating the
                    name)
               this is flor.




                                                             30.








                         john

                   (pronouncing it perfectly)
               hi, flor.
     deborah reacts, grabs some coffee and pushes georgie along.

                         john (cont'd)

                   (to deborah)
               look, i'll take georgie to school.

                         deborah

               no. i'm doing it..show flor the
               ropes.
     flor is trying to figure out what's expected of her then
     deborah gestures impatiently for her to fall into step and
     come with her.
