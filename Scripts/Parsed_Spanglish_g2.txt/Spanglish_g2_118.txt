119   int. clasky house - living room                            119

      he carries the brilliant snack to the living room and is just
      about to take his first bite when he hears emotional spanish
      voices approaching. he looks up.

      angle on flor and cristina

      as they enter. cristina translating her mother's words.

                          cristina

                my mother wishes me to represent
                exactly what she says, nothing
                else.




                                                         74.







and so, for the remainder of the scene, flor will speak in
spanish and cristina will not only translate but render her
mother's emotion, sometimes including body language. it is
not only a translation but a reenactment.

                    cristina as flor

          may i talk to you?

                    john

          you mean your mother....
cristina nods...not comfortable breaking the rule of only
speaking for her mother...she faces him, her back to flor.

                    john (cont'd)

              (looking at flor)
          sure you can talk to me..
cristina begins translating as her mother speaks in spanish..

                    cristina as flor

          i don't have to sleep first?

                    john

          what's wrong?
flor waves the money..cristina waves an empty hand as she
speaks for her mother.

                    cristina as flor

          did you give this money to my
          daughter?

                    john

          i made this little deal..with all
          the kids to...

                    cristina as flor

              (interrupting)
          please..
flor advances on him past her daughter so cristina now
translates from the background.

                    cristina as flor (cont'd)

          you don't tell or ask the mother
          when you give a child a fortune for
          looking on the beach for
          stones..what is the word for this..

                       john

          sea glass?
on hearing the translation of "sea glass" an exasperated flor
turns so that her back is to john as cristina admonishes him.




                                                           75.








                      cristina as flor

            no..not a name for the stones..a
            name for the act..what you did..

on flor..

as she spits out the word to her daughter.

                        flor

            engreÌdo.

on john..

as his eyes shift to cristina fearing the word he will hear.

                      john

            oh, no..engreÌdo's going to be
            rough.

on cristina..

reluctantly taking the emotional stance of her mother to
deliver the word.

                      cristina

                (briefly being herself)
            it's hard to translate.
she takes half a beat..finds the word and now spits it out.

                        cristina as flor

            smug.
john gets up and takes a conciliatory step toward flor so
that now cristina is in the middle looking up at them as she
translates for john

                      john

            i had no idea it would amount to
            that kind of money..i thought ---
            sort of tops fifty dollars.

                      cristina as flor

            fifty dollars is a lot of money..

                      john

            okay. right.
he has no idea where to take it from here -- the two females
look as he searches for the right thing to say..

                       john (cont'd)

                (sighing to himself)
            ah, shit..
that fast cristina translates.. before flor can react. john
talks directly to flor..quiet,compassionate, a bit beaten.




                                                           76.








                    john (cont'd)

          i'm sorry....i get why you are
          upset. it might not look it but i
          am good at getting things. doing
          something about it is something
          else..i was going to talk to you
          before i actually gave her the
          money..but maybe i should have
          checked before i started the whole
          thing.
              (he smiles/they don't)
          i know what it's like when you feel
          your kid is being messed with..i
          get the message. it won't happen
          again. it's late..i'm sure we'd all
          like...
flor lets it out...her daughter hard pressed to keep up.

                    cristina as flor

          to what..sleep? if this was small
          enough to be helped by some little
          apology, i would be a fool to bring
          it up..i need to say more no matter
          what the result. i need to be
          impolite. you leave someone else's
          child alone. it's simple, no? it
          is too easy for children to feel
          contradictions..it encourages
          questioning their parents..and that
          makes them less safe. your wife
          takes her for rides and changes her
          hair..you give her money. here..
              (this next sentence
               cristina translates with
               alarm and adds her own
               question mark.)
          take back the money????????????
flor hands john the envelope under her daughter's wrenching
gaze. they begin to exit..but flor turns inadvertently
bumping into her daughter. her voice softens.

                    cristina as flor (cont'd)

          i did not mean to be angry to you -
          only emotional..
they turn to leave. john speaks with sudden volume and
muscle.

                    john

          what about hypocritical?
cristina turns back..confused..her mother asks her for a
translation and she complies.. flor then wearing the same
confused expression.




                                                        77.








                    john (cont'd)

          yeah, you heard me. it's not like
          you didn't do the same thing...

                      flor

                (hard on the translation)
          no!

                    john

          oh, yes. so go lecture
          yourself..you won't need a
          translator for that one...i mean
          what am i lately... a recycling
          bin?..just anyone dump in your
          garbage and hope i make something
          useful out of it...
flor is confused and getting pissed but he is moving now and
pointing a finger at her.

                    john (cont'd)

          yes, you did the same thing...you
          think i didn't know about altering
          those outfits for bernie..she tells
          me her stuff....so, am i missing
          something? is there a real
          difference between that and what
          you are complaining about?
cristina waits for a comeback from her mother to
translate..but doesn't get one..instead her mother is a bit
mortified and considerably humbled..the pie smack into the
face.

                    flor

          sin diferencia. yo interferÌ.

                    cristina as flor

          no difference. i interfered.

                    john

          okay......i'm still not sure i did
          the right thing keeping it to
          myself. it felt disloyal to
          deborah..but my daughter really
          needed someone to be kind to her
          right then..so..so.

                    cristina as flor

          i am very embarrassed. you are very
          right. hypocrisy..yes.




                                                        78.








                    john

              (something strikes him, he
               softens, disoriented)
          i'll tell you, it's pretty wild to
          say something and have the other
          person just concede the point. i'm
          dazed here.

                    cristina as flor

          i will leave whenever it is good
          for you and...

                    john

          no..no..come on, man..

                    cristina as flor

          but how can i work for you after we
          talk like this?

                    john

          you can't quit even if you want to
          and you know why.

                    flor

          no..

                    john

          yes, you do..
flor is worried as john looks right at her..is he coming on?

                    john (cont'd)

          because then cristina will blame
          herself for costing you the
          job...and that guilt...i don't know
          if you know about guilt..
cristina doesn't have to check with her mother on this one.

                     cristina

          culpa, guilt, sÌ. we know. we are
          catholics.

                    flor

              (after her daughter's
               translation)
          culpa, si..por dios, si.

                    cristina

              (on her own)
          we know.

                    flor

              (big nod)
          we know.
john gestures that there is nothing to be done. flor nods.




                                                              79.








                          john

                so, welcome back.
      she smiles..gets up..extends her hand..they shake.

                          flor

                good night, mr. clasky..

                          cristina

                good night as they exit..their
                backs to john, daughter following
                mother...flor speaks to her
                daughter.

                          flor

                    (an aside)
                no te puedo tener haciendo esto por
                mi. ahora tengo que aprender
                inglÈs.

                          cristina as flor

                    (over her shoulder to john
                     as they move)
                i can't have you doing this for me.
                i must learn english now.

                          flor

                no, dije eso por ti - no por john.
      that translates to "no, i meant that for you, not john." but
      cristina does not translate the line. nor..

                          john

                you have a wonderful mother.

                          flor

                que?

                          cristina

                nada.
