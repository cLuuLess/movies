      flor enters in something of a fury and holds the letter out
      to deborah, who hates being cornered in this manner. she
      actually places her hands behind her so as to avoid the note.

                            deborah

                  what's this?
      flor shakes the letter at her.

      other angle..





                                                                69.







      showing cristina hidden but looking on... like a stage
      prompter in the wings.

                           flor

                for you.

                           deborah

                from?
      flor with enormous emphasis stabs her finger at her own
      chest.

                          deborah (cont'd)

                you are not yourself...this was
                written in anger. you sleep on it
                and then if you still want me to
                have it -- fine..i don't think you
                will once calm and rational thought
                returns. just sleep on it.
      deborah exits to a bathroom and closes the door...leaving
      flor in the hall with the letter..cristina reveals herself
      and explains the situation to her mother. the last word we
      hear before scene's end is "ma√±ana."
