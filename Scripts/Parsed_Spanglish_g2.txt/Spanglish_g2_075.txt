     as he enters....the phone is going off the hook..as he passes
     the maitre d's desk. their conversation is strangely hushed
     and very, very quick.

               keep some walk-in business..i want
               this to stay neighborhood.

                         victor

               impossible. there would be
               riots..you should hear the
               desperation in their voices..best
               day of my life.

                         john

               we'll serve a full menu at the bar
               then.

               then where do i put the people
               waiting for a table? it won't work.

                         john

               do this for me.

                         victor

               there's no way.

                         john

               do this for me or i'll set my hair
               on fire and start punching myself
               in the face.

                         victor

               huh?

                         john

               yeah..you're right...that was an
               unusual way for me to make myself
               understood..but you'll do the bar
               thing?

                         victor
