131   int. beach living room - day                             131

      this is the last day of the summer rental - many packed
      cartons on the floor. deborah, flor and cristina engaged in a
      momentous conversation..(note: throughout the following, and
      quite beside the point, we see flor periodically make the
      motion of throwing the ball. but we do not cut to chum,
      rather we just hear his claws skittering after the ball as we
      maintain focus on the momentous conversation.)

                          deborah

                nuh-uh, flor you are not pinning
                this one on me. i've got to finish
                packing up.

                          flor

                    (no longer sure of herself
                     or anything)
                i just don't....out of space this
                school wants her to go for free?

                          deborah

                we ran into the school head. they
                want diversity...cristina knocked
                her out...i had nothing to do with
                it. by the way, the scholarship is
                worth twenty thousand dollars. and
                early registration is tomorrow.

                          flor

                it is too far from our home.

                          deborah

                you could move in with us in town.

                          flor

                never, thank you...

                          deborah

                okay, then don't..by the way..the
                phrase is "no, thank you."
