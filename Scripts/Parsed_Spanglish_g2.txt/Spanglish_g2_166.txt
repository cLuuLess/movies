167   int. restaurant kitchen - night...                          167

      he is cooking..he is talking to himself.

                           john

                nothing to be nervous about. you
                are not on a date...
                    (calls out)
                hey, flor?

                             flor's voice (o.s.)

                yes, john.

                          john

                what are you doing?
      she enters the room...dancing a bit..




                                                       110.








                    flor

          just lighting candles and picking
          music.
              (notices his cooking)
          oooh.
she gets up on one of the counters and sits there, her feet
dangling...sings along a bit in spanish. he is uncomfortable
anew. the nervousness mounting.

                    john

          you want a drink?
she considers the question totally..he is busy cooking..not
realizing how weighty she considers his question...finally
aware she has not answered and looks at her..

                     john (cont'd)

          huh?
she regards him levelly..then makes her decision.

                     flor

          no.
he gets out a bottle of vodka.

                    flor (cont'd)

          i, uh...don't think you should
          either.

                    john

          then excuse me, because if i had
          the equipment i'd inject the vodka.
he starts to pour.

                    flor

          wait!
              (he stops)
          i think it is so important that we
          are each clear-headed.
he looks at her..a beat...he puts the vodka away. flor
beams..we have not seen her smile like this for quite some
time.

                    flor (cont'd)

          it is very good that you did not
          ask, "why?"

                    john

              (quietly)
          keep things real, right?

                    flor

              (impressed)
          i wouldn't have put it so well.




                                                                111.
