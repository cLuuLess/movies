     as flor enters from outside.

                         bernice

               morning, good to see you.




                                                        24.








                       flor

             morning. good too.
she notices the french toast.

                          bernice

             try some.
she demurs. bernice holds out one slice on a spatula,
indicating flor should just tear a piece off which she
does...one taste and she marvels -- her mouth dropping open
at this kid's ability to make something mundane
special..bernice laughs.

                          bernice (cont'd)

             thanks.
her mother enters on her way upstairs. she is thoughtful,
tense and sweaty - her run having failed to exorcise her
current demon. she greets flor and then shakes her head,
making a vain attempt to communicate her troubled mood to
flor in some sort of sisterhood based on life being a fucker.

                          deborah

             tough day.
bernice prepares a plate for her mom while, in the b.g., a
golden retriever named chum approaches flor from behind with
a ball in its mouth. flor is checking out the kitchen...
what's in each drawer, etc .....deborah is impressed by the
self-starter display and indicates same to bernice.

                       bernice

             i had an idea for a breakthrough in
             french toast so i made breakfast. i
             don't want to be teased about it..
             no sarcasm. no tough love. just try
             it and if by any chance you have a
             positive reaction...

                       deborah

             right..mean ol' me. i can't play
             right now. i have to do something
             about your brother.

                       bernice

             i had an idea for a recipe. when
             has that happened? i got up early
             to do this. at least taste it, for
             god's sakes!
she does..

                       deborah

             oh, it's good...oh god, it's rich --
             oh god, it's good.




                                                              25.








                         deborah

                   (sudden alarm)
               by the way, you could do without
               this.
     the approval rug pulled out from under her, bernice looks at
     her mother. but deborah is unaware of having hurt her
     daughter because her attention has been diverted so that
     deborah and the camera lose focus on bernice as the teenager,
     distraught, moves from the room.

                         deborah (to flor) (cont'd)

               no..no! flor!....never do fetch.
     chum is nudging flor with the ball and flor was about to
     accommodate him by taking it before deborah's warning shout
     stopped her in mid-sentence.

                         deborah (cont'd)

               i mean it, never!
     on flor's stunned reaction to the outburst.

                         deborah (cont'd)

               i'm not mad. i'm thinking of you.
               this is me being nice..
     then using her hands to demonstrate.

                         deborah (cont'd)

               just no taking ball from dog.
                   (broadly)
               trust me on that one.
     close up on chum going nuts with deborah's hand passing in
     front of his face ignoring how urgently he offers the ball.

                          deborah (cont'd)

               you and me. we are fine. just a
               tip.
                    (she gives her waist a
                     little squeeze)
               girlfriends.
                    (flor is totally confused)
               could you make some coffee? cafe?

                         flor

               yes.
     deborah directs her to the most complicated cappuccino
     machine italian overpriced artists ever devised.
