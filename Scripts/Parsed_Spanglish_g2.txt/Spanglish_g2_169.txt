      as she returns...

                             flor (cont'd)

                   this song...you see what a good
                   thing to tell you how you talk like
                   a mexican song.

she begins to translate the lyrics.

                     flor (cont'd)

          when i kiss you, entire oceans rush
          through my veins..
              (he is wildly
                uncomfortable)
          gardens of flowers blossom in my
          body.
he starts to make a comic gesture of awkwardness to get past
the event..she shakes her head at him..driving the words --
pointing emphatically..she will not have her poetry laughed
at..

                    flor (cont'd)

          and you wander along my fertile
          soil, picking its ripe fruit..a
          nightingale undresses on my
          tongue..and under its wings..
he laughs. she stops cold. looks down..though just seconds
long, this still constitutes the first depression of her
life.

                    john

          i'm sorry. i don't know what i just
          took out of you but tell me how to
          get it back in there..i'm sorry.
          flor..i'm sorry.

close on her..

the downcast eyes rise to see him..

                    flor

          then respect this.
he looks at her...they kiss..it is a kiss without an author.
god at the controls. they break. there is a beat then..

                    john

          here's something i never asked
          anyone..did nightingales undress on
          your tongue?
flor looks at him with enormous warmth. her arms looped
around his neck..aware of the music.

                    flor

          did they on yours?

                    john

              (a long beat of
               reflection/then sincere
               and surprised)
          yeah...
