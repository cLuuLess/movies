     rubrick sticks his head in the door of the cramped officers mess.

                                   rubrick
                   people.  they've spotted people!

     both church and sloan look up in astonishment from the card game
     they're playing on a tiny fold-out table.

                                   church
                   "people"!  "people"?  what do you
                   mean "people"?

                                   rubrick
                   two civilians.  unarmed.  they've
                   killed both of them.  they've
                   spotted smoke from some kind of camp
                   and they're going to check it out.

                                   sloan
                   a camp!  jesus christ!

                                   church
                   damn!
                         (worried)
                   did they ask for assistance?

                                   rubrick
                   not yet.

     church frowns, considers, then frets...

                                   church
                   like my daddy used to say,
                   "nothing's ever as simple as it's
                   supposed to be...except shit."

                                   sloan
                         (rolling her eyes)
                   thank you, "daddy."

                                   rubrick
                   who do you think they are?

                                   sloan
                   the civilians?
                         (a shrug)
                   squatters...refugees. i don't think
                   we want to know, do we?

                                   church
                   good point.

                                                       cut to:
