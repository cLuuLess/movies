     int.  furnace room

     the burners, silhouetted by flames, feed goines' body to the
     furnace.

     close on the flames as goines' body is consumed by raging
     flames.

     angle on the burners trudging to the bin.  they reach in blindly
     for whatever's next.  tugging with effort, they struggle the
     clumsy object over the rim, and let it fall to the floor.  it's a 
     mattress!

     communicating with a look, the first burner drags the mattress
     toward the fire while the second burner reaches again into the
     bin.

     the second burner frowns through the visor, struggles with
     something, frowns, wrestles with it.

     finally, with great effort, he pulls out a big carton that 
     immediately spills old magazines on him.

     disgusted, he pulls the partially full carton across the refuse-
     littered floor toward the furnaces.

     angle on his feet, as the second burner struggles toward the
     fire, stepping over a trail of blood which is hardly noticeable
     in the flickering firelight.

     he passes another big corrugated bin with a sign an it.  the sign
     says nonflammable waste disposal...and the trail of blood leads
     to that bin!
