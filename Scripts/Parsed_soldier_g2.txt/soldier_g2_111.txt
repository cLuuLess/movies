     todd and mace are running, todd in the lead, buffeted by wind, 
     struggling through a clutter of old machinery, diesel engines, 
     turbines, scattered haphazardly on the flat desert floor.

     mace is running too, not as well, and todd has to reach back and
     grab him, pull him along...

                                   mace
                         (gasp)
                   ...maybe...they're...
                         (gasp)
                   ...friendly...
