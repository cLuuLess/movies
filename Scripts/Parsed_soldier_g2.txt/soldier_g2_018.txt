     ext.  extraterrestrial city - day

     bombed out!  buildings turned to rubble, smoking ruins, rain.  an
     extra-terrestrial city ravaged by war to such a degree that it
     bears an uncanny resemblance to dresden/earth in 1945 after the
     fire-bombing!  the architecture, even in ruins, recalls old
     europe, and the streets are narrow, as in before (or after)
     automobiles.

     bursts of automatic fire, occasional mortar blasts.  a spooky
     battle between unseen soldiers is taking place in seemingly
     deserted streets and alleyways.  and supered over the gloomy
     scene...

                        the third dresden moon
                (1.16 earth atmos, acceptable oxygen)

     crack!  crack!  crack!  shots!

     suddenly a terrified mother dashes along the street, a screaming
     baby in her arms, looking for shelter.

     a civilian man pops out of a doorway, pulls her to safety.

     reveal todd, watching from the shell of a once proud building.

     todd's pov of four enemy soldiers running at a crouch among the
     rubble.

     angle on todd watching them scurry into a cellar door.  todd
     turns and gives a hand signal.

     angle on riley twenty yards away, hidden behind exposed
     machinery, acknowledging the signal and, along with a third
     soldier, advancing toward the cellar.
