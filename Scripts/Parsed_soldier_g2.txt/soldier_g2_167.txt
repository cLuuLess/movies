     the wind sighs and a faint breeze stirs.  then a tin can skitters
     by in a puff of wind as the new soldiers take turns moving
     closer to todd, flanking him from safe vantage points.

     new soldier four stands to wave the next man forward when...

     whooooooooooooosh!  the wind erupts, roars, bellows...

     new soldier four is lifted into the air and carried away.

     new soldier five is trying to stay on his feet, as the wind slams
     him into one piece of junk after another.
