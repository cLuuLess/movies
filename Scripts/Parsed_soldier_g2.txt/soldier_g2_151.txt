     ext.  junk terrain

     seven of the new soldiers -- the three hanging on crawler one and
     the four from crawler two -- drop off into the stillness.  one
     checks the left front soldier's body while the others, barely
     visible in the weak light, fan out, keeping low, taking cover in
     the random junk strewn all around them.

     angle on new soldier one, a corporal, crouched behind a huge
     piece of discarded agriculture machinery.  he yanks a flare from
     his waist band and fires it.

     the flare bursts overhead, exposing the ghostly terrain to a
     bright green light.

     angle on the junk and the skeleton ship: a ghostly graveyard.  no 
     wind.  nothing moves.  no sign of todd.
