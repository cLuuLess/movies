     int.  bunks/"daddy" - night - moments later

     emma, judith, slade and jimmy pig are settling most of the
     children in the cramped crew quarters, pulling off hats and
     coats, when a commotion causes them to look toward the open door
     to the corridor in time to see...

     a glimpse of rubrick being shoved roughly along the corridor by
     moore, his loud protests clearly audible.

                                   rubrick
                    are you crazy?  you can't do this,
                    soldier!  you're going to be in
                    trouble.

     then, as rubrick is pushed out of view, church appears, indignant
     and panicky, as chesley hustles him past.

                                   church
                    i'm your superior officer, don't you
                    understand that?

     angle on the pioneers, exchanging glances.
