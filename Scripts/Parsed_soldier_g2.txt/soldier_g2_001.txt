     int.  hospital nursery - night

     babies in bassinets, isolettes, incubators.  babies sleeping,
     babies blinking, babies cooing, babies chirping, babies
     squalling.

     it's the squalling babies, the ones with pinched faces and tiny
     bunched fists, that seem to interest the two anonymous men in
     military uniforms.  (their anonymity is assured by the angles
     from which they are seen; they are hands, they are feet, they are
     the backs of heads.)

     a lone nurse watches them grimly as they make their "selections,"
     marking the cribs of the most active, noisy babies with x's.
