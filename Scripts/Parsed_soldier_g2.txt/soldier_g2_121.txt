     ext. garden trench - day - a little later

     hawkins, jimmy pig, red, and other pioneers are peering over the
     lip of the trench just beneath the trellis.

     a half mile off they can see the crawler creeping in their
     general direction.

     the garden is full of excited pioneers with their children,
     everybody trying not to trample the plants, but trampling them
     anyway, as hawkins addresses them...

                                   hawkins
                   i'm going to go out and talk to
                   them.  more than likely they're
                   friendly.  if not...
                         (indicating jimmy pig,
                          others)
                   ...those of you with weapons will be
                   ready to defend us.  the rest of you
                   go back.

     hawkins turns abruptly and looks over the rim.

     the crawler is closer now, only a quarter mile away, angling to
     the left along the wire.

     hawkins starts to climb out of the trench, boosted by jimmy pig
     and chester.  she's waving her arms, shouting.

                                   hawkins
                   here!  over here!

     sandra looks worried.
