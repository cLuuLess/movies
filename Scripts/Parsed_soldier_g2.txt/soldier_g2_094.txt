     int./ext.  cockpit - day - later

     through the cockpit window in the bluish glare of a work-light,
     veterans, dressed in space suits, can be seem erecting a prefab
     hut on the harsh moonscape.

     sloan is watching them through the window while behind her
     rubrick lounges with his feet on the console and reads a current
     magazine on a vdt.  church is partially visible in the
     background, poring over charts in the navigator's cubicle.  it's
     very quiet until sloan speaks, almost to herself.

                                   sloan
                   every time it's time to send them
                   out, riley asks about weapons.  and
                   every time i tell him they don't
                   need weapons anymore, they're not
                   soldiers anymore.

                                   rubrick
                         (eyes on vdt)
                   jesus!  it says here macy's is going
                   out of business.  can you imagine
                   that?  new york without macy's?

     silence.  sloan watches the veterans outside through the window.
     they're working like a team of ants in space suits, erecting the
     hut.

     church gets up noisily from the navigation cubicle and joins
     them, shaking his head.

                                   church
                   next one's going to be a real pain
                   in the ass.

                                   rubrick
                         (reading, not interested)
                   yeah?  what flavor pain in the ass?
                   gravity pain in the ass?  atmosphere
                   pain in the ass?

                                   church
                   how about a "gaseous currents" and
                   "urgent convections" pain in the ass.

                                   sloan
                   i think you're trying to say a "wind
                   pain in the ass."

                                   rubrick
                   wind!
