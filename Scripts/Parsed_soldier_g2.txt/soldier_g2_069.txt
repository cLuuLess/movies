     ext.  inside a trench

     as mace continues talking to todd, he loads the pockets of his
     heavy parka with miscellaneous hunks of metal.

                                   mace
                         (continuing)
                    that's why we're weighing down.  and
                    that's why we're always on the wire
                    even when the wind's down, like now.
                    you don't get much warning.  here,
                    load up, you'll want the weight, i
                    promise.

     mace hands heavy hunks of metal to todd who's wearing a parka
     like mace's.  he pockets the metal obediently.

     behind them a small crowd of pioneers are doing the same:  jimmy
     pig, slade, chester, red, a woman named sally and several others.
     in addition to the parkas, they wear eskimo-style eye-protectors
     and carry canteens, tools, and coils of rope attached to various
     parts of their outfits.

     angle on mace noticing todd eyeing the rifle jimmy pig is
     carrying.

                                   mace
                    oh, we're not going to shoot
                    anything.  that's not what we mean
                    by "hunting."
                         (then, laughing, to
                          jimmy pig)
                    jimmy pig, you're not going to shoot
                    anything, are you?

                                   jimmy pig
                         (laughing)
                    what could i hit?

                                   mace
                         (to todd)
                    it's how we call for help.  two
                    shots.  there'll be someone on duty,
                    listening in case we get off the
                    wire and get lost or something.  we
                    have flares too.  come on.

     other are already climbing the ladder out of the trench to the
     surface above as mace urges todd to follow.
