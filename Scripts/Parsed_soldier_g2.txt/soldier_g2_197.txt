     ext.  inside the trench garden

     in the shadows six feet below the overturned and smoldering
     crawler two, the body stirs on the floor of the garden, barely
     visible in the flickering half light from the flames above.

     it's caine 607.  he groans and stirs again.  he's not dead!  in
     fact, he's rolling over, struggling to his knees.
