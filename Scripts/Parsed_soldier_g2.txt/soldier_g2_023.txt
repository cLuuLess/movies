     int.  command quarters

     entering, the man shakes rain off his poncho.  his name is
     rubrick, he's thirty-five, a lieutenant.  he faces the two bored
     officers lounging in the cluttered office where outdated
     equipment is strung together by mazes of wire and the desktops
     are heaped with printout sheets and styrofoam coffee cups.

     the captain, church, has his feet on the desk.  he's fifty years
     old, gray and fat and soft.  the other officer, sloan, also a
     lieutenant, is a thirty-five year old woman, dark, moderately
     attractive, but not particularly happy.

                    colonel mekum has his "boys"
                    unpacked.  i think he wants to show
                    them off.
