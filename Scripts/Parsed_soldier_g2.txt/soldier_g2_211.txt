     bursting into the corridor, sandra sees ellen racing toward her, 
     weaving through broken beams, screaming as caine 607 lumbers
     after her out of the shadows.  caine 607 doesn't bother to avoid 
     obstacles, shoving beams aside like twigs, dragging his bad leg.

                   sergeant todd!

     ellen dives into sandra's arms and sandra turns, only three steps
     ahead of caine 607, and rushes into the meeting room.
