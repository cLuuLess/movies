     mace screams, he's hurled wildly mid-stride, tossed ten yards.

     todd looks back, sees him lying on the sand, screaming in pain.

     todd turns back, sprinting, low, weaving, tossed by the wind.

     whooom!  another shot.  if the wind hadn't hit him, todd would
     have been hit.

     mace is screaming.  his right leg is gone.

     todd gets him, drags him, stumbles.

     whoom!  another shot, another miss.

     todd struggles for cover, staggering in the wind with mace on his 
     back.
