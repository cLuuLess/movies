     int.  barracks - day

     a spartan room, bare bunk-beds.  rain pounds on a window that
     looks out into a stormy sky over the godforsaken ruins of the
     third dresden moon.

     todd is sitting on a bunk, shirtless.  his new rank has been
     tattooed on his right cheek; there's a scar under one eye and
     another scar that distorts his lip slightly.  the names of
     various battles have been neatly stenciled down his left arm, an
     official record, not a decoration.  todd is silent, staring into
     space.  the room is full of soldiers in t-shirts, fatigues,
     sleepwear.  words appear supered over the scene...

     the words fade away, the silence continues, the rain beats on the
     barracks, no one says a word, they just stare into space or watch
     the rain beat on the windowpane.  they look like robots...used
     robots, made individual only by their different scars.
