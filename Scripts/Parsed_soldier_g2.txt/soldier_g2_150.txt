     int.  crawler one

     vision blocked, the driver is fighting for control of the vehicle
     as the gunner to his right screams into the radio mike...

                                   gunner
                   crawler one, we are red!  red!  we
                   are red!

     by veering sharply, the driver is able to shake off the body that
     was blocking his vision, clearing his shattered windshield.
