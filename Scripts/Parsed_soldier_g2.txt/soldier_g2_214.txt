     int.  dining commons

     blackened with soot, jimmy pig still has the axe in his hand as
     slade manages, with a supreme effort, to hold the door of the
     root cellar up enough to allow emma and judith to push the four
     children out of the cellar and then to scramble after them.

     exhausted, slade lets the door fall back, picks up his rifle and
     turns toward the exit.  and freezes.  dumbfounded.

     standing in the doorway is todd, laden with children, on his
     shoulders, in his arms, surrounding him, clutching at his
     garments.

                                   slade
                    you!

                                   jimmy pig
                    thank god!
