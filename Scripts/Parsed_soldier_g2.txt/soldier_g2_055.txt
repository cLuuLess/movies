     int.  "living room"

     a second tiny room next to the bedroom is the rest of the
     mace/sandra/nathan living quarters.  mace and sandra are deep in 
     conversation.

                                   mace
                    what do you mean he's survived
                    worse?  did he say something?

                                   sandra
                    no, but he's covered with old
                    wounds, all sorts of scars.  knife
                    scars, bullet scars, burns.

                                   mace
                         (worried)
                    a soldier!

                                   sandra
                    there are words on his shoulder.
                    tannhauser gate, the argentine
                    sector, montana, bolivia, shanghai
                    2012...

                                   mace
                    the tannhauser gate was a battle...

     mace and sandra look into each other's eyes, very worried.
     then...

                                   sandra
                    we'll have to sleep on the floor.

                                   mace
                         (suddenly alarmed)
                    where's nathan?

     mace is looking around.  he spots the open door to the bedroom, 
     hurries to it, and disappears.

     sandra starts after him, looking worried...but before she gets to
     the door, mace reappears with nathan safely in his arms.

                                   mace
                    if there's any danger to nathan --

                                   sandra
                         (interrupting grimly)
                    i won't permit danger to nathan.

     mace and sandra lock eyes in firm understanding as we...
