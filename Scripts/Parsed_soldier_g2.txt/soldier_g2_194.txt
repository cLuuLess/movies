     int.  dining commons/settlement - night

     the gap between the floor and the trap door has increased to ten
     inches, enough for emma and ruth to squeeze an infant through to
     sandra's reaching arms.

     soaked with sweat, gasping and coughing in the thickening smoke, 
     jimmy pig, slade and red continue to strain at the beam...and it
     moves.  another inch!

     the fire is raging.  the infant squalls in sandra's arms.  slade
     snaps at her as he pushes on the beam.

                                   slade
                   get them kids (grunt) hid somewhere!
                   there's soldiers coming.

     ellen and the children look alarmed as sandra gathers them and
     ushers them toward the exit, glancing back toward the trap door
     as she's leaving.

     emma and ruth meet her look with frightened eyes.

     noticing sandra's hesitation, jimmy pig reassures her...

                                   jimmy pig
                   don't worry.  couple more inches and
                   they're out.

     sandra and the children exit.

     and suddenly!!!  the beam slips back five inches, almost closing
     the opening.  emma and judith scream!

     jimmy pig, red and slade look alarmed, defeated.
