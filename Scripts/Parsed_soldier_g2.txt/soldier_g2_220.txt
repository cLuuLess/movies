     int.  cockpit/"daddy" - night

     the countdown clock is ticking away, showing ten minutes, as
     church, rubrick, and sloan complete their pre-launch prep.
                                   church
                    right horizontal?

                                   rubrick
                    roger.  right horizontal checks
                    green.

     church relaxes, looks up at the clock, satisfied.

                                   church
                    all right we're "go."  i'm allowing
                    us three minutes to clear the
                    atmosphere and get out of range.
                    that means we can wait seven more
                    minutes.

                                   sloan
                    fuck 'em!  let's just go!

                                   rubrick
                    she's right!  four more casualties
                    aren't gonna mean anything to
                    anybody, especially when they're
                    already obsolete.

     church considers for a moment, then shrugs.

                                   church
                    i guess they wouldn't want to get
                    old anyway.
                         (to sloan)
                    go ahead, lock the hatch.
                         (to rubrick)
                    rube, punch up the port power
                    cluster and --

                                   sloan
                         (interrupting urgently)
                    what was that?

                                   church
                    huh?  what was what?

                                   sloan
                    sssshhhh!  listen!

     sloan is listening intensely.

     all they hear is the hum of the air system and miscellaneous
     white noise.

     church and rubrick exchange a glance and are about to speak when
     they all hear it...

     a sound like a child crying somewhere in the ship!

     all three of them stare at each other in utter amazement.
                                   rubrick
                    it sounds...

                                   sloan
                    like a kid!

     just then they hear it again, closer.

     church frowns.  what the fuck?

                                                       cut to:
