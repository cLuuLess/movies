     int.  captain's cabin/"daddy" - night

     silence.  church is dozing fully clothed on his bunk in a tiny
     stateroom.

     bzzzzt.  bzzzzt!  a buzzer sounds and a light flashes.

     church opens his eyes, sees the light flashing.

     siting up in the bunk, he grabs the receiver of a phone and puts
     it to his ear.  as he listens, his eyes widen with
     incredulity...then they get wider as he hears more.

                                   church
                   whaaaaat?
