     still firing, crawler one grinds up to the lip of the trench.

     angle on new soldiers charging toward the trench behind the
     crawler.

     close on crawler one's hood where a small trap opens and a nozzle
     pops out like a little penis and...squirts a stream of liquid!
     the liquid stream arcs fifty yards along the trench and
     diminishes backward like a man pissing...
