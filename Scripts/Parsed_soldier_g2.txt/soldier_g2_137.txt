     int.  other room

     crossing the next room, todd moves quickly to the door, flattens,
     and peers into the corridor.

     he sees the second soldier heading toward him.

     blam!  blam!  todd fires twice around the door and sees...

     the second soldier staggering back, hit, a pistol from his
     hip...

     dirt explodes around the door frame as todd ducks back.  quick as
     a wink, he yanks a grenade from his utility belt, triggers it,
     and flips it around the corner as crack!  a shot rips at his arm.

     bawhoom, the grenade goes off and, bleeding from his arm, todd
     swings into the corridor and follows the grenade with three quick 
     rocket shots.
