     ext.  "roof" - night - minutes later

     a low wind moans and mingles with strains of "oh, holy night" as
     todd bellies up to the "skylight" and peers down at the scene
     below in the meeting room.

     todd's pov through the skylight.  the merriment has evolved into
     a more spiritual mood as the pioneers join in the solemn hymn.

     but todd spots nathan trying to pull his pull toy along so the
     wings flap.  nathan is pretty wobbly and he goes down hard and
     starts to cry.

     immediately sandra disengages from the adults and rushes to the 
     sobbing nathan and clutches him to her breast, soothing him...and
     mace joins her, hovering over his son.

     angle on todd, watching.  after a moment, todd scrambles off the
     roof and drops into the adjoining trench while "oh, holy night"
     continues to blend with the soughing wind.
