     int.  meeting room - day

     ellen is supervising block building (babysitting) with several of
     the younger children (omar, bucky, angie and janice) while will
     and tommy play their own separate games close by.  then will
     looks up and sees something disturbing.

                                   will
                    you're not supposed to do that
                    anymore.

     he's speaking to johnny who is doing martial exercises.

                                   johnny
                    so what?  i'm a soldier.

                                   will
                    they're gonna kick him out.

     ellen looks up from the blocks.

                                   ellen
                    they can't kick him out...

                                   will
                    they're gonna.  my father --

                                   ellen
                         (interrupting strongly)
                   my mother says when someone's sick
                   or hurt, you have to help them.  you
                   don't have a choice.

                                   johnny
                         (getting interested)
                   yeah, but what if the hurt person
                   is...evil?

                                   ellen
                   you still have to help them...
                   because if you don't, you're evil!

                                   will
                         (importantly)
                   my father says...uh...he says,
                   "soldiers deserve soldiers."

                                   tom
                   yeah.  that's what my father said
                   too.

                                   ellen
                   my father's making sergeant todd a
                   scarf because he saved his life one
                   time.  he's knitting it.
                                   will
                   that's dumb.  your father's dumb.

     will is smirking with satisfaction at having settled that when
     out of nowhere ellen's little fist hits him hard on the nose.
     will looks stunned.  blood oozes from his nose.  he starts to
     cry.

     ellen looks horrified at what she's done as we...

                                                       cut to:
