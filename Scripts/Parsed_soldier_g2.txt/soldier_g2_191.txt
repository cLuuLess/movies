     ext.  above the trench garden

     the radio in crawler two is still squawking urgently with
     rubrick's voice as the crippled vehicle lies sprawled at a
     violent angle over the trench garden.

                                   radio (v.o.)
                   this is daddy!  come in, crawler
                   two, come in...

     nearby, a voice is crying out in pain in the night.

     limping, todd keeps his weapon ready as he searches out the
     sound.

     angle on the injured soldier, the one todd crushed under the
     treads of the crawler.  he's screaming in pain.  looks up.

     todd looms over the injured soldier, weapon pointed.  their eyes
     meet.

     in agony, the soldier looks into todd's eyes, nods ever
     so slightly.

     blam!  blam!  todd fires point blank.

     now the only sound is the roaring of the wind and the pathetic
     sound of rubrick continuing his desperate radio babble.
