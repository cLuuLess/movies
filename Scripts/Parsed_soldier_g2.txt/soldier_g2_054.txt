     int.  bedroom - night

     todd is on his back in a bed in a tiny earth-walled bedroom.  he
     stares stupidly at the woman bending over him.  she is sandra, a
     woman of twenty-five who is attractive, but not in a glamorous
     way.  it's a very natural beauty worn with intelligence and 
     dignity.  she's wiping away blood and grease from todd's face.

     todd's eyes flick around the room even as he lies motionless.

     he sees a window high on one wall.

     he sees old-fashioned magazine pictures and bits of patterned
     material hung here and there for decoration.

     clothing hangs from pegs on the walls.

     he doesn't see the look in sandra's eyes as she discovers the 
     savage scar on his forehead or the sergeant's tattoo on his
     cheek.  eyeing these telltale marks, sandra pours liquid into a
     spoon and holds it to his lips.

                                   sandra
                    want to try some more of this?

     todd swallows weakly.

     sandra smiles, stands up, moves toward the door.

                                   sandra
                    you rest now.  i'll give you more
                    later.

     todd watches her exit.

     he hears her voice in the next room...a low murmur.

     he's looking around again when a noise makes him look back toward
     the door.

     a two-year-old is crawling into the room on hands and knees.  the
     baby boy, nathan, stops just inside, seeing todd in the bed.

     nathan looks into todd's eyes with childlike interest and wonder.
     todd meets the look with those blank soldier's eyes.
