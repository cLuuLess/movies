     int.  bedroom

     as sandra dashes into the bedroom in blind retreat she runs smack
     into the chest of another soldier!

     helpless and horrified, she looks right into a cruel stone face
     and goggled eyes, and she gasps...

                                   sandra
                   sergeant todd!

     todd never takes his eyes off the door as he brushes her roughly
     aside with one hand, while his other arm aims the heavy rocket
     gun right at the door and...

     the first soldier comes into the doorway with his flame thrower
     raised to torch women and children and what he sees is todd
     looking right at him, aiming the rocket gun, and bawhoom, the
     first soldier is blown clear back across the other room with a 
     shot right in the chest.

     angle on sandra, still on the floor where he knocked her,
     watching todd exit the room, weapon raised, his utility belt
     dangling bandolier style across his chest.

     he looks like...one of them!  a soldier!
