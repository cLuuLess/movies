     ext.  the bomb/terrain

     the countdown timer on the bomb is faintly visible in the dying
     light.  it reads twenty seconds.

                                   church (v.o.)
                    twenty seconds.  hurry.

     church and sloan are hunched desperately over the bomb in near
     darkness, the wind tearing at them.  sloan tries to punch a code
     into the keys...

                                   sloan
                    oh, my god, i can't remember if it's
                    six-seven or seven-six...

                                   church
                    try one! try it!

     sloan punches the keyboard blindly.

                                   sloan
                    there!  i did it!  did it stop?  did
                    it -- ?

     bahwhoooooooooooooooom!  everything is dazzling, blinding light!
