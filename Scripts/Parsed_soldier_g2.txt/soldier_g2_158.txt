     new soldiers one and two are approaching the trench when suddenly
     a flare bursts above them.

     the new soldiers react with amazement as the flare exposes them
     in a brightly illuminated landscape.  before they can take
     cover...

     budda budda budda.  flashes of fire from the lip of the trench.

     new soldier one drops dead, new soldier two is down and writhing
     on the ground, screaming.

     angle on crawler one veering sharply toward the trench, 
     accelerating, firing rockets, canons, machine guns....

     angle on the other new soldiers, prone, firing toward the trench.
