     int.  cockpit - day

     close on space charts.  church's finger is indicating a tiny dot
     on the chart surrounded by a vast sea of space.

                                   church
                   it's a dump.  literally.

     sloan and rubrick are looking over church's shoulder while a new 
     soldier sits stonefaced at the control console flying the ship.

                                   sloan
                   no shit!  we're gonna set up a
                   monitor on a garbage dump!  so we
                   can monitor garbage rusting?

                                   rubrick
                   will the wind affect the patrol?

                                   church
                   the crawlers are low enough and
                   heavy enough, they won't blow.  the
                   men should wear armored vests and
                   carry double weapons and ammo for
                   the weight.  they may have to use
                   lines too, like mountain climbers.

     rubrick shakes his head, snorts disgustedly.

                                                       cut to:
