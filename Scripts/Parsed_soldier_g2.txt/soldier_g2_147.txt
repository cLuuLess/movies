     ext.  junk/terrain - night

     two crawlers cut through the night fifty yards apart.  four of
     the new soldiers cling to the outside of one crawler, five on the 
     other, two on each crawler operating spotlights that pan the
     darkness to the sides while the headlights illuminate the
     skeleton of the crashed ship and shadowy chunks of machinery
     littered across the terrain ahead of them.

     it is very still.  no wind.
