     int.  corridors - night

     explosions!  screams!  bawhoom!  another shell hits, beams
     splinter, dirt walls collapse.

     eight-year old johnny, alone and terrified, comes in to view
     around a corner.  he's been separated from the others.

                                   johnny
                   dad!  daaaaaad!

     no answer.

     johnny doesn't know which way to go.  the world's falling apart!

     whump!  the little warren of earthen corridors is shaken by
     another blast.

     desperate, johnny makes a left, away from the last blast and
     hurries down a collapsing corridor past doorways that reveal
     rooms with no ceilings where the wind howls.  it's obvious the 
     shelling has been going on for a while.

                                   johnny
                   daaaaaaad!

     just then, jimmy pig pops out of a doorway in front of him and
     and rushes toward him.

                                   jimmy pig
                   gotcha!

     ba-whoom!  another shell collapses the corridor behind johnny as
     jimmy pig grabs him and hauls him toward the door he emerged
     from, the dining commons.
