     ext.  pipe/landscape - day - minutes later

     the pipe lies fifty yards off the cable to the right.  as mace
     pulls even with it, he can see right inside.

     todd is standing just inside the mouth of the pipe, looking
     straight out at mace...but the light is behind him and mace can't
     see todd's face as he shouts at him.

                                   mace
                   todd!  todd!
                         (pauses, then)
                   todd!  we want you to come back!  we
                   made a mistake!

     mace starts toward him, letting go of the wire, struggling in the 
     wind.

     todd watches him come.

     mace stumbles on, dances a few feet, recovers, struggles toward
     todd, shouting....

                                   mace
                   todd!  we're sorry!  we were wrong!

     just then, a sharp gust staggers mace, driving him several yards 
     toward a "catcher trench."

     he's teetering on the lip of the flooded trench, about to fall
     in, when todd's strong arms grab him.

     they look like a strange four-footed beast as todd drags him
     through the wind in an awkward "embrace" toward the cable.

     once mace has the cable in his hands, he laughs and gasps...

                                   mace
                   damn!  thank you, todd.  god damn!
                   i almost took a... a...swim there!

     mace breaks off.  todd isn't listening; he's looking off toward
     the horizon.

     mace follows his look.

     five miles away he can see an ugly insect-shaped spacecraft
     descending from about ten thousand feet.

                                   mace
                   my...god!  someone's landing.

     todd doesn't answer.  he's staring at the descending ship with
     soldier eyes and a stone face as we...

                                                       cut to:
