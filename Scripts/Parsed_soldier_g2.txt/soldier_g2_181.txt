     ext.  settlement - night

     muzzle flash!  fffwhooomp!  crawler two fires another round.

     the vehicle is squatting not thirty yards from the trench garden,
     pouring round after round into the colony, lighting the night
     with bright-colored flowery blasts.

     crouched in the wind not far from the vehicle, the two new
     soldiers from the back seat have set up a mortar, and they too
     are firing away.
