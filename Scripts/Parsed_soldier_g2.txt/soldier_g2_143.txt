     int.  crew quarters - night

     the new soldiers are putting on their heavy gear in ominous
     silence, covering their muscular torsos with armored vests and
     utility belts while sloan watches from the hatchway.

                                   sloan
                   double belts, double ammo, double
                   everything!  you've got to be heavy
                   there or you'll blow away,
                   fellas...and we wouldn't want that,
                   would we?

     they continue dressing obediently, their eyes the sullen eyes of 
     robots.  but caine 607 speaks up, at once respectful and
     dignified...

                                   caine 607
                   it's dark now, sir.

                                   sloan
                   you're afraid of the dark, sergeant
                   caine?

                                   caine 607
                   no, sir.  but the manual says --

                                   sloan
                   that's what nightscopes are for,
                   soldier.  for the dark.

                                   caine 607
                   yes, sir.  but the sixth rule is
                   "never give the enemy an advantage
                   unnecessarily."  if they're
                   expecting us --

                                   sloan
                         (erupting)
                   listen, sergeant, this may come as
                   news to you, but you're not a real
                   hot thinker!  your pitiful efforts
                   at tactics have cost us three men
                   already.  so turn it off, that
                   little pea brain of yours!
                         (turning to the others)
                   that goes for all the rest of you
                   mental giants too.  all you have to
                   do is go boom-boom.  understand?
                   boom-boom!  kill kill!  say it...
                   kill...kill...kill...

     draped in battle gear the seventeen new soldiers obediently
     repeat the words after her, their eyes blank and sullen...  "kill
     kill kill..."  they look like somber death machines as we...

                                                       cut to:
