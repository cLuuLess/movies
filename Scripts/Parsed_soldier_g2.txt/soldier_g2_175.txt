     int.  crawler one

     peering through the scope as he sweeps the terrain, the gunner
     suddenly stiffens and back-pans to find something...

                                   gunner
                   tentative at one.

     the driver angles right, aiming for one o'clock.

                                   gunner
                   that's negative, no target.

     the driver swings the wheel back and they continue slowly through
     the darkness.

     in the back seat, two new soldiers peer into the night with blank 
     faces.  one of them is watching a huge plastic sign cartwheel
     past in the wind when --

     -- he reacts!

     -- as todd's face appears is only inches from his, right against
     the plexi!

     bam!  before the new soldier can do more than look startled, todd 
     shoots out the window with a pistol and shoves a live grenade
     through the hole.

                                   new soldier
                   red!  red!  re --

     bawhooom!  the grenade explodes and...

     the driver fights for control of the wheel.

     the gunner screams and screams and screams like a machine running
     at high speed while the two new soldiers lie open-eyed with death
     in the back seat.
