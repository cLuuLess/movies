     int.  corridor/"daddy" - night

     nathan wobbles along an empty corridor, stumbles, catches himself
     on a wall, keeps going.

     he passes a doorway, peers in, sees two soldiers working at a
     console like robots.  they don't look up.

     nathan keeps going, toddling toward a hatchway.
