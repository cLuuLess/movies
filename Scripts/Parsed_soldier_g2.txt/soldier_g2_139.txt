     caine 607 is sitting at the wheel of the motionless vehicle
     parked near the trench garden, radio mike in hand, when he hears
     the low animal snarl come across his speaker.

     caine 607's robot face reveals nothing as he listens to another
     growl.  wind howls outside.

     then he flicks a switch on the dash and puts the mike to his
     mouth, his face expressionless.

                   crawler to daddy, crawler to daddy.
                   come in, daddy!

     porthole view/ext./int.  officers' mess/"daddy"

     seen through the thick plexi-porthole, heavily-clothed veterans
     are struggling with a wall, trying to erect the pre-fab unit
     while the wind, inaudible inside the ship, rages around them, 
     staggering them this way and that.  what we hear in the quiet
     interior of the mess is church voicing his disbelief.

                                   church (o.s.)
                   a "growl"!  he heard a growl?

     rubrick, looking uneasy, is facing church who's looking up at him
     from a game of solitaire at the little table.  sloan is biting
     her fingernails in the b.g.

                                   rubrick
                   well, he didn't say the word
                   "growl."  he said a "throat-noise,"
                   but i asked him to imitate it and it
                   sounded like a growl to me.

                                   church
                   my god!  who are we fighting here!

                                   rubrick
                         (nervous)
                   i think...i think we have to assume
                   the missing men are...down.

                                   church
                         (getting up, pacing)
                   i knew mekum's hotshots were green.
                   no reinforcements, then they walk
                   right into an enemy stronghold.

                                   rubrick
                   we could send reinforcements now...

                                   church
                         (sharply)
                   absolutely not.  those bastards are
                   just waiting in there for us.  no
                   more of this fancy super-soldier
                   shit.  we do it with the hammer...

     rubrick and sloan exchange a nervous glance as church paces
     agitatedly.

                                   rubrick
                   uh, what does that mean, "the
                   hammer"?

                                   church
                         (suddenly smug)
                   my daddy always said, "when you want
                   to insert a nail in a piece of wood,
                   you don't do nothing fancy or
                   glamorous, you don't finesse or play
                   the hero, you just pick up your damn
                   hammer and hit that sumbitch till
                   it's in."

                                   sloan
                         (under her breath) 
                   christ!  now daddy's a carpenter!

                                   rubrick
                         (to church)
                   i...don't...quite...follow...sir.

                                   church
                         (decisive, sharp)
                   take the whole unit, both crawlers,
                   and tell 'em to pound that place
                   with rockets, cannons, mortars,
                   everything we got...from a safe
                   distance.

                                   rubrick
                         (brightening)
                   raw firepower!

                                   church
                   it may not be heroic, and we may
                   waste some ammo, but by god we'll
                   get the job done.
