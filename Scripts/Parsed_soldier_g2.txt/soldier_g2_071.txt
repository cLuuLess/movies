     int.  office (other world) - night

     a christmas tree!  the corny little tree with plastic needles,
     blinking lights, and topped with a super cute angel is only a
     foot high.  it's sitting on church's cluttered desk next to
     framed photographs of church's wife and children.  we can hear
     mekum's voice badly transmitted...

                                   mekum (v.o.)
                    sorry to disturb the tranquillity of
                    outer space on christmas eve, but
                    i'm off to the caribbean in a few
                    hours, and i wanted to make sure
                    you'd got the transmission on the
                    security sweep.

     glowering at the monitor where mekum's badly transmitted video
     image is quivering and distorting, church waves the print-out map
     he's holding in his hand, a map showing hundreds of little dots 
     against a vast field, stars and moons in the vast sea of space. 
     rubrick and sloan watch as church addresses mekum's image 
     indignantly.

                                   church
                    we got it all right.  this is an
                    outpost here, not the third army!
                    you've got us securing thirty-four
                    locations and erecting monitor units
                    in one month and --

                                   mekum
                         (interrupting)
                    piece of cake, guys!  these are
                    totally remote, totally uninhabited
                    territories.  all you do is set
                    down, send out a patrol purely as a
                    formality, then have those veterans
                    of yours put up an a-type unmanned
                    monitoring unit.  you should be on
                    about number twenty-five by the time
                    i get back from my vacation...

                                   church
                    what if we do run into people...
                    say squatters or refugees?

                                   mekum
                         (a frown)
                    well, you sure as hell don't want to
                    get involved in evacuating people
                    and that sort of thing.
                         (then, meaningfully)
                    my advice would be to..."avoid
                    paperwork."

                                   church
                    eliminate them, you mean.
                                   mekum
                    well, no one's out there, but
                    officially these are "hostile
                    zones."  therefore you'd be within
                    your rights to classify anyone as
                    "hostile," i think.
                    but i repeat, you should be worried
                    about boredom, not action.  any
                    other questions before i go?

     church hesitates.  sloan and rubrick look at him.  then church
     blurts a question, his voice breaking...

                                   church
                    down there...is it snowing?

                                   mekum
                         (a smirk)
                    not in the caribbean.  have a good
                    christmas, guys.  see you when i get
                    back.

     mekum's image disappears and the video screen goes blank, leaving
     a glum silence broken only by the drumming of the rain on the
     roof.

     church moodily strolls toward his desk, and his eyes go to the 
     photographs.

     his wife and children smile back at him from the pictures.

     just then sloan taps him, and be turns to see her handing him a
     cup full of amber liquid.

                                   sloan
                    merry christmas, captain.

     rubrick is pouring another glass from a bottle of scotch as the
     little tree winks on and off, and we...

                                                       cut to:
