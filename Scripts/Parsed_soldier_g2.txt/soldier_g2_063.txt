     int.  dining commons - evening

     jabbering voices, the click of utensils.  heaping plates of food
     are being passed the length of long tables set up in communal
     style.  johnny is kicking ellen under the table, will flips a
     piece of food at tommy when his mother, ilona, isn't looking, and
     the outspoken slade is lecturing a pioneer named chester.

                                   slade
                    you can't talk to a soldier no more
                    than you can talk to a...a...bomb!
                    or a bullet!  they're trained,
                    they're killing machines.  they got
                    an objective and they go after that
                    objective and nothing stops them but
                    killing them.

                                   chester
                         (a glance over his
                          shoulder)
                    just one?  to kill us all?

     the conversation gets the attention of johnny and will who stop
     food-fighting to listen to the adults talk.

                                   slade
                    first off, if there's one, there's
                    more.  that's how it is, soldiers
                    travel in bunches.  second, they
                    don't waste soldiers on folks
                    like us, that's for police!  training
                    soldiers to kill weaklings like us
                    is not what they call "cost
                    effective."

                                   chester
                    then who do they fight?

                                   slade
                    other soldiers!  there's a saying,
                    "soldiers deserve soldiers."

     angle on ilona noticing will and tommy listening.

                                   ilona
                    slade, hush up.

     angle on tommy and will glancing toward the next table.

     angle on the next table where todd, wedged between sandra and
     mace, is eating like a machine, looking neither right nor left as 
     people jabber all around him.

     angle on judith whispering to emma at a nearby table as she
     watches todd eat.

                                   judith
                    you see how much he's eating?

     angle on slade who turns now and boldly addresses todd across the
     gap between the tables...

                                   slade
                    i don't see how you can not remember
                    how you got here, sergeant.

     there's a sudden hush in the noisy room, broken only by a few
     urgent whispers and a cough.

     todd looks up from his food and meets slade's look.

     sandra scowls at slade as slade persists...

                                   slade
                    you're not a deserter, are you...
                    sergeant?

     the silence is even more charged than before.

     sandra looks alarmed.  someone coughs.  the tension is
     unbearable.

                                   todd
                    no, sir.

     a sigh of relief from everybody!  but slade presses on.

                                   slade
                    then how come you're not with your
                    unit?

                                   jimmy pig
                    oh, come on, slade, let the man eat.

                                   slade
                    it's not an unreasonable question.
                         (to todd)
                    how about it, sergeant?

     on todd, actually struggling with the question...
     remembering.  suddenly he blurts...

                                   todd
                    i was...replaced.

                                   mace
                    replaced?

     todd hesitates for half a second before answering.

                                   todd
                    by a better soldier, sir.

     there are looks exchanged among the pioneers as we...

                                                       cut to:
