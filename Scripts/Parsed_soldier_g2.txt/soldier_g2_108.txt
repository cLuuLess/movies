     ext.  cable - day

     todd is on the cable with mace, his eyes on the squat beetle-like 
     object crawling slowly toward then through the junk half a mile
     away.

                                   mace
                   look at that.  it's some kind of
                   vehicle.  a landing party.  hey!

     mace raises his arm to wave.

     without taking his eyes off the approaching crawler, todd grabs
     mace's arm and pulls it down.

     mace looks at todd, sees the grim expression on todd's stone
     face, and suddenly mace is worried too.
