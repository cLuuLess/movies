     int.  the meeting room

     huddled in a makeshift shelter of overturned furniture, with
     nathan asleep on her lap, sandra is reciting to ellen, will,
     tommy, johnny, angie, eight year old ramon.

                                   sandra
                   "-- sailed an a river of crystal
                   light into a sea of dew.  where are
                   you going and what do you wish the
                   old moon asked the three.  'we've
                   come to fish for herring fish...'"

                                   tommy
                   what's a "moon?"

                                   johnny
                   i know what a moon is!  it's...

                                   sandra
                         (suddenly, urgently)
                   shhhhhhh!

     sandra is reacting to vague movement in the shadows beyond the 
     door...and sounds.

     she puts her hand over the mouth of a whimpering child, hushes
     another.

     a timber falls outside the door and sandra sees a shadowy shape
     enter the meeting room, looming in the darkness.

     frightened children hold their breath, peer out fearfully.

     crack!  smash!  the huge shape hurls aside the debris in his way, 
     switches on a flashlight, probes the darkness.

     the light wipes the damaged room.

     suddenly, sandra gasps.

                                   sandra
                   oh, my god!  it's... it's you!

     todd maneuvers the flashlight beam, sees the frightened children.

                                   sandra
                   are you...all right?

                                   todd
                   we should go, sir.

                                   sandra
                   go?
