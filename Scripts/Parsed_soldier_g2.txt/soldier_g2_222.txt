     as chesley shoves him along, church continues to protest...

                                   church
                    don't you realize you're violating
                    the chain of command?  i'm giving
                    you a direct order to...to...to...

     church breaks off, suddenly speechless at the sight ahead of him.

     here comes todd, laden with more children, the tattoo on his
     cheek clearly visible.  his eyes meet church's.
