     int.  bedroom - day

     a viper writhes across the floor through the patterns of light 
     streaming through the window, a sinister presence, full of menace
     and evil designs.

     the viper winds its way toward an object that will prove in a
     moment to be a corner of the bad.

     smack!  the viper doesn't make it!  smack!  another blow from
     mace's heavy boot being swung by hand.

     the viper coils and hisses angrily, wounded and dangerous.

     smack!  the boot again!

     nathan wields it awkwardly, hitting bravely at the hissing viper!

     smack!  nathan hits again and...

     mace rolls over in the bed.

     smack!  mace comes awake, looks around.

     mace lunges from the bed.

     smack!  just as nathan gives the damaged viper another blow, mace 
     snatches the boy in his arms and yanks him away.

     sandra sits up in bad, looking around, alarmed.

     mace is holding nathan, staring down at the viper.

     the viper has up the ghost, lying on the floor.

     mace hugs nathan to him and looks toward sandra.  they both look
     at the boot.  and at the dead viper.

     their eyes meet and, for a long moment, they just look at each
     other.
