     ext.  shooting range - day

     suddenly, out of nowhere, a scary mechanized pop-up target, a
     military figure, erupts from the long grass, weapon pointing.
     before the weapon can flash a laser bean, automatic fire ravages
     the target and it disappears back into the grass.  the boys,
     eighteen-year-olds now, are wearing combat gear and carrying
     automatic weapons as they advance through a sloping field of tall
     grass.

     different sophisticated targets pop up urgently, sometimes close, 
     sometimes far, some moving rapidly on tracks.

     the eighteen-year-olds expertly mow down menacing military
     figures while holding their fire when animal targets or unarmed
     civilians and children appear.

     the eighteen-year-old on point is riley, a muscular redhead.
     todd is right behind him as a date is supered over the scene...

                                 2010

     suddenly multiple targets appear, charging.

     budda budda budda!  first target down!

     riley, panning for the next target, holds fire, passes over two 
     mothers holding children, pans for a nearby soldier target.  but
     the soldier target zips behind the mothers holding children,
     taking cover, weapon pointed at riley.

     for half a second riley hesitates!

     budda budda budda!  todd blazes away, mercilessly blowing away
     the mothers holding children target and the soldier target.

                          the main title appears

     as the roar of guns gives way to music...
