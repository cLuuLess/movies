     emma and judith peer out from under the heavy metal trap door as
     jimmy pig and slade desperately try to move the beam using a
     piece of metal as a lever.

                                   slade
                   this (grunt, cough) ain't gonna
                   work.  where's them axes?  he musta
                   run into soldiers and got killed.

                                   jimmy pig
                   how do you know there's soldiers coming?

                                   slade
                   'cause soldiers (gasp) finish what
                   they start -- unless you stop 'em.
                   and we're what (gasp) they started,
                   and we didn't stop 'em!
                         (shouts to emma)
                   we're gonna get you outta there
                   somehow!  i swear it!

     just then red bursts into the room with a single axe, shouting...
                                   red
                   soldiers!  soldiers!
                                   slade
                         (grabbing the axe)
                   only one axe?

                                   red
                   they took the other one!

                                   slade
                         (chopping furiously)
                   toldja.

                                   jimmy pig
                         (to red)
                   how many?

                                   red
                   i... i couldn't... i couldn't...
                   count 'em.  four, i think.  maybe
                   five.

                                   slade
                         (chopping)
                   more!  trust me!

                                   jimmy pig
                         (grabbing the axe)
                   turns.

     jimmy pig starts chopping furiously.

     slade picks up a rifle, hands it to red.

                                   slade
                   do what you can.

     as red looks at the rifle, alarmed, slade "comforts" him.

                                   slade
                   they're gonna kill us anyhow.  no
                   point in surrendering.
                         (grabbing the axe)
                   turn!

     jimmy pig gasps for air as slade takes over chopping again.

     red exits, worried.
