     ext.  inside a "catcm trench"

     splash!  soldier three has tumbled into a flooded trench.

     he struggles to his feet, can't figure out where he is.  he pulls
     a flashlight from his waist and shines it down the trench in both 
     directions.

     the flashlight beam reveals a steep-walled trench knee-deep in
     water and littered with rusting junk.

     new soldier three splashes along the trench, looking for a way
     out.

     his light reveals a piece of a derrick mast leaning against the 
     trench, a perfect ladder.

     he's slogging toward it when he whirls suddenly and splays his
     beam down the trench behind him.

     new soldier three's pov of the flooded trench.  junk and water.

     angle on new soldier three, turning back and approaching the
     ladder.  just as he reaches the ladder he whirls again.

     again his light illuminates the spooky trench.  again, nothing
     but water and junk.

     relieved, he's just about to switch off his light when...

     todd rises out of the water only five feet away like a demon.

     before new soldier three can cry out, todo lunges at him.
