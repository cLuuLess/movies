     int.  other room - day

     nathan is screaming in terror on the floor, ignored as sandra and
     children haul the bed from the bedroom to add to the heap of
     obstacles they've placed in front of the door already.  the
     stove, everything is wedged against the door to the corridor.

     as they heave the bed against the mountain of furniture and other 
     belongings, the door quivers, the heap of furniture shifts.
