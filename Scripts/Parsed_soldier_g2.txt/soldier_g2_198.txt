     int.  dining commons

     the frightened eyes of emma, ruth and children peer from the four
     inch crack.

     whipped by wind from the hole in the ceiling, the fire is
     spreading, the smoke is thick.  jimmy pig, slade and red are
     gasping with effort and coughing.  slade gasps to red.

                                   slade
                   you know where thomas keeps those
                   two axes?  go get the axes.

     red takes off at a run.

                                   jimmy pig
                         (so emma and ruth can't
                          hear)
                   we can't (cough) chop 'em out.  we
                   don't have time.

                                   slade
                   just as good (gasp) to die chopping
                   as fighting.
