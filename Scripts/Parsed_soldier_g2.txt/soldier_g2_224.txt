     ext.  spaceship/"daddy" - night

     rubrick desperately clutches at the hatch entrance as the savage
     wind tears at him...but he can't hold on.

     as sloan and church are shoved out the hatch, they see rubrick
     blown off into the night, screaming.

                                   church
                    down!  lie down!  flat!

     and church dives for the ground as the wind tumbles him.

     sloan does the same thing as the hatch door slams behind them, 
     shutting them out of the ship..

                                   sloan
                    no!  no!  no!  please!  no!
