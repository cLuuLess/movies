     int./ext.  crawler

     as the wind howls and shakes the crawler, the driver and the
     gunner stare with amazement as new soldier five slams into their 
     windshield, neck broken, and stares at them with lifeless eyes.
     they see new soldiers six and seven tumble and somersault past.

     as new soldier six disappears, blown off into the night, new
     soldier seven manages to grab hold of the walking wire.

     gripping the wire for his life, he turns just in time to be 
     decapitated by a piece of aluminum housing flying through the
     air.
