     int.  other room - day

     cleaning vegetables, sandra is separating the roots, shaking the
     dirt off, cutting away the excess.

     todd is carefully following her example, cutting the stalks away
     with the knife.

     nathan is tottering across the floor an a beginner's wobbly legs.

                                   sandra
                    it seemed like he was never going to
                    walk.  then all of a sudden...he's
                    an expert.

     whump!  nathan falls on his ass.

                                   sandra
                         (a laugh)
                    well, not quite an expert.

     todd watches sandra go to nathan and hug him affectionately.

     turning back to the vegetables, stone faced, todd cuts his
     finger.  blood flows.  he ignores it, continues working...

     but sandra, returning to the vegetables, notices todd's cut
     finger and immediately grabs a rag and takes his hand.

     todd looks startled is she takes his finger.  then, staunching
     the blood with the rag, she looks him in the eye, curious.

                                   sandra
                    sergeant todd...what's it
                    like...what's it like being a
                    soldier?

     what's it like...?  todd stares at her, trying to process the
     question.  seeing his difficulty sandra tries to help...

                                   sandra
                    what do you think about?

     no answer, a stare.

                                   sandra
                    do you think about food?  or women?
                    you must think about something.

     todd gulps.  his blank stare could pass for stupidity.

                                   sandra
                    what about feelings then?  you must
                    have feelings.  you must feel
                    something.

     todd wets his lips.  he seems about to answer...and yet it's
     difficult for him.  he could kill a person easier.

     on the floor nathan goos happily, oblivious.

                                   todd
                         (at last)
                    fear.

                                   sandra
                         (startled)
                    fear!  you mean...you feel afraid?
                         (as he nods)
                    that's when you're in battle...
                    what about other times?  now, for
                    example?

                                   todd
                    fear.

                                   sandra
                         (amazed)
                    now?

                                   todd
                    always.

     a stunned silence.  finally sandra speaks...

                                   sandra
                    you don't...look afraid.  you look
                    fearless.

     todd looks at her.  this is incredibly difficult for him, like 
     physical labor.  he wets his lips and take a breath.

                                   todd
                    fear and...discipline.

                                   sandra
                         (growing horror)
                    oh, my god.  but there's nothing to
                    be afraid of here.  i can't hurt
                    you.  i wouldn't.

                                   todd
                    always.  it makes us...alert.

     sandra is overwhelmed.  she reaches for him, hugs him to her
     breast like a little baby, holding him.

     but todd is as tense in her arms as steel.  he can't relax.  he's
     even trembling.

     nathan, on the floor, looks up, smiles innocently.

     sandra lets go of todd and steps back, looking at him, her face
     troubled, as we...

                                                       cut to:
