     a low slung armored vehicle on caterpillar treads rumbles over a
     steep rocky terrain faintly backlit by a cold sun that looms 
     enormously on the horizon while giving off only a faint glow.

     hanging on to the outside of the insect-like scouting vehicle
     (called a "crawler") are two nasty-looking new soldiers in space
     suits designed for battle, their heavy rocket rifles cradled and
     ready, their visors blank and ominous.
