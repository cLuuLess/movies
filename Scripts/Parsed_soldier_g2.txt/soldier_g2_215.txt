     int.  corridor/"daddy" - night

     crude letters scrawled on the metal skin of the bomb say "love
     from daddy."

     the heavy bomb is lugged along a long narrow corridor.

                                   sloan (o.s.)
                    well, riley, you wanted a weapon,
                    right?  now you got one!  a real
                    biggee!

     we see that riley and three other veterans -- green, chesley, and 
     moore -- are struggling to maneuver the heavy bomb along the
     narrow corridor and down a ladder hatch as sloan follows on
     their heels and church and rubrick, fretting, follow her.

                                   rubrick
                    what good'll it do just setting it
                    outside?  we don't know where the
                    enemy is.

                                   church
                    doesn't matter.  for once mekum's on
                    the ball.
                    this is a very dirty bomb!  that
                    wind will churn the radioactivity
                    around like soap in a washing
                    machine.  this is gonna be one clean
                    place in a very short time...
