     ext.  inside trench

     stepping into the trench, todd hears the wind scream overhead.
     he approaches crude steps dug in the side of the trench and
     begins to pull himself up into the wind.

     as he climbs, the screaming wind changes pitch radically, and by
     the time he bellies over the lip of the trench, the wind is only
     a breeze.

     getting to his feet and finds even the breeze is dying, replaced
     by a terrible stillness.

     as todd looks off into the darkness, a voice calls to him from
     the trench behind biz.

                                   sandra (o.s.)
                   sergeant!  sergeant todd!

     todd turns back, looking down into the trench, and sees sandra
     looking up at him.

                                   sandra
                   sergeant...these soldiers...the ones
                   you're going to fight...  are these
                   the "better ones"...the ones who
                   replaced you?

     todd looks at her for a long moment, his face a mask, before he
     nods almost imperceptibly.  her eyes are full of tears.

                                   sandra
                   sergeant todd...i think they...i
                   think...someone made a serious...
                   mistake.

     todd looks into her eyes.  it is impossible to tell if he knows
     that she cares about him and that she is blessing him.

     after a moment he turns away and lumbers off into the darkness,
     the clanking of his equipment the only sound in the spooky
     stillness.
