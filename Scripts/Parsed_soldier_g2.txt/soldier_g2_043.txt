     int.  hold/garbage ship - "day"

     as the massive doors on the underside of the ship open, light
     spills in and there is a huge roar as tons of debris, including 
     massive pieces of machinery, huge statues, old vehicles, and 
     numerous containers, spill out through the open bays and tumble 
     downward.  the one that says "nonflammable waste" on the side
     careens against the bulkhead with a thunderous sound, then
     hurtles downward.
