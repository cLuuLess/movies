     int.  corridor

     peering into the smoke, red reacts.

     red's pov of caine 607, obscured by smoke, crossing the corridor 
     ahead, not seeing red.

     angle on red, summoning all his courage, raising his rifle,
     aiming.

     bang!

     angle on caine 607 reacting, looking toward red.

     angle on red scared to death, firing again!  and again!

     angle on caine 607 wrenching a heavy door from its hinges and
     holding it in front of him, shielding himself from red's
     continuous shooting, advancing.

     angle on red, firing again and again...and backing up.

     angle on caine 607 holding the door/shield as he advances on red.

     backing, red trips, goes down flat on his back.

     caine 607, only six feet away, hurls the door at him.

     red shoves the door aside, aims his gun up at caine 607, as the
     huge soldier looms over him.

     before red can pull the trigger, caine 607 snatches the rifle
     barrel and yanks the weapon out of red's hands.

     red rolls, scrambles to his feet.

     and caine 607 clubs him to the ground with the butt of the rifle, 
     crushes his skull with three brutal blows.
