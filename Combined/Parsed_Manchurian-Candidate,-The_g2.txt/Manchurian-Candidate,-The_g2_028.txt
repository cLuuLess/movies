60    int. walter reed hospital - army shrink's office - day         60

      marco with lt. col. howard, a kindly but pedantic army staff
      psychiatrist, referring to notes:

                           marco (o.s.)

                 yes sir.
                     (beat)
                 no sir.
      beat.   howard looks up at marco.

                           marco

                 the meds make me ... spongy.   i float.
                 i'm not sharp --

                           lt. col. howard

                 the meds help you sleep.

                           marco

                 when i sleep, i dream.   i don't want to
                 dream, sir.

                           lt. col. howard

                 you're off your meds, sleep-deprived, you
                 have an unexpected encounter with a
                 member of your gulf war recon team, al
                 melvin, who mentions some dreams he's
                 been having --

                           marco

                 dreams like mine.

                           lt. col. howard

                     (ignores)
                 -- and suddenly your own bad dreams come
                 charging back. made worse by your
                 chronic fear of them. add in all the
                 recent campaign news about congressman
                 shaw, which is obviously rekindling your
                 feelings of guilt and jealousy --

                           marco

                 -- i'm not jealous of raymond shaw, sir.

                           lt. col. howard

                 okay. how did you feel when you heard
                 the news from the convention?
      marco shrugs.




                                                 8/18/03   29.








                    lt. col. howard

          a shrug isn't a feeling.

                    marco

          i felt ... fine.     no big deal.

                      lt. col. howard

          fine.

                    marco

          yes.
              (almost angry)
          glad for him. he deserves it. raymond
          shaw is probably the kindest, bravest,
          warmest --

          marco                              lt. col. howard

-- most selfless human being       -- most selfless human being
i've ever ...                      you've ever known.
half a beat --

                    lt. col. howard

          you're fucking with me, major.

                       marco

          no sir.     i wouldn't do that, sir.

                    lt. col. howard

          what other conclusion can i draw?
marco says nothing.    holding back what he's thinking.

                    lt. col. howard

          look, we've been over this a million
          times. until you forgive yourself for
          what happened that night in kuwait, the
          loss of your men -- for what you did, for
          what you didn't do ...
no reaction from marco.    the lt. colonel sighs.

                    lt. col. howard

          how's public affairs?

                    marco

          it sucks, sir. i want to get back to
          intelligence.

                    lt. col. howard

          then for god's sake, ben, go back on your
          meds. and stay on them, this time. get
          some sleep. i'll see you in two weeks.

                      marco

          yes sir.    same time, same station.




                                                  8/18/03   30.







     marco starts to get up --

                         lt. col. howard

               and stay the hell away from television.
