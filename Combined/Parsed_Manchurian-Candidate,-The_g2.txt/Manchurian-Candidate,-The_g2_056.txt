      marco comes up the escalator, into a sea of commuters.
      momentarily lost. rosie is behind him, a moment later with
      her bag, and --

                          rosie

                you somewhere?

                          rosie

                your friend gonna meet you here?

                           marco

                no.

                    (off marco's frown)
                my cell phone, in case you -- you know.
                i like to say it the old way -- can you
                remember the number, or should i write it
                on your chest with a sharpie?

                          marco

                    (small smile)
                i'll remember.
      beat.

                          rosie

                you're sweating.

                           marco

                what?
      marco feels his shirt -- soaked. long beat. she reaches
      out and feels his forehead. no fever. sizing him up.

                          rosie

                listen. you got a place to go and get
                freshened up?
