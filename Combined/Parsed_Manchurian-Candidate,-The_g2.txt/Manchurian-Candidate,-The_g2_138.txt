       rosie and the feds sprint toward marco's projection booth --

237    on stage - raymond and ellie                                   237

       as ellie surrenders to the moment, and enters raymond's arms
       -- what else can she do? -- this is her son, her dream is
       halfway there ... and the president can die another day.
       they swirl off to the music --

238    through marco's scope - arthur                                 238

       perfectly centered in marco's sights, but then --
       -- raymond and ellie glide in front of marco's target --
       lingering in marco's eyeline, raymond stares up into the
       scope -- eyes trusting, urging, as if he's saying: now --
       -- then arthur is alone again, in the center of the
       crosshairs, waving and grinning at the roaring crowd like a
       man who's just been elected president, but --
       -- marco's crosshairs swing over, finding raymond and ellie
       again --

       looking into raymond's eyes ... follows his gaze up into the
       dazzling glare of the stage lights -- first shadow of doubt
       crawling across her --

240    through the scope - ellie and raymond                          240

       they're right in marco's cross-hairs.

       committed.   almost serene.

       eyes wide -- realizing too late --

       pulls the trigger.   bam bam bam.
       raymond and his mother are kicked back into the horrified
       celebrants on the stage --
       -- the same bullets ripping through both of them --
       -- toppling together, dead before they hit the ground --
