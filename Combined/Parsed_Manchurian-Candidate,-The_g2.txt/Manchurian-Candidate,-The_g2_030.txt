     has found raymond with jocie -- outside -- but hangs back --
     overhearing raymond's earnest and intense conversation with
     jocie, who is slightly uncomfortable with this but trying to
     make light of it --

                         jocelyn

               ... but raymond, my god, it's been so
               many years -- i've been married and
               divorced --

                         raymond

               i've changed too.

                         jocelyn

               that's not what i -- but, yes, it's
               great, really -- i see that you have --
               congratulations --

                         raymond

               -- but my feelings haven't.   changed, i
               mean ...
     jocie starts to say something, is at a loss for words --

                         raymond

               ... i guess i've never stopped -- feeling
               -- wondering -- how it might have turned
               out, you know, between us, if --

                   (overlapping)
               raymond -- people can't rewrite their
               lives --

                         raymond

               jocie, i haven't even been with another
               girl since we ... stopped seeing each
               other -- doesn't that say something to
               you?

                         jocelyn

               that you must be just about the loneliest
               person on earth, and it breaks my heart.
     raymond is staggered -- doesn't know what to say --

                         jocelyn

               i've got to go -- good luck with the
               campaign.
     she hurries to a waiting limo -- her father's already inside
     -- raymond still wants to say something, he wants to stop
     her, but --

raymond turns --

                     raymond

           what?
marco slides in front of him with a disarming grin.

                     marco

           i want to talk to you too.

                     raymond

           -- not now.

                     marco

           -- i know you're busy -- i just have to
           ask you --
he starts to move away, but marco grabs his arm --

                     marco

           i saw al melvin the other day -- remember
           corporal melvin?
raymond yanks his arm away --

                     raymond

           don't touch me.

                     marco

           okay -- sorry -- but -- melvin, he's
           extremely disturbed about what happened
           to us, on the recon patrol, back in
           kuwait --

                     raymond

           don't ever touch me.
