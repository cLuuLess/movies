112   int. delp's research lab - sky booth - day                     112

      a narrow, glassed-in space with a cluster of monitoring
      equipment against the wall of darkened windows. fluorescent
      lights flicker on, revealing a cavernous space below, in
      which an intricate maze of cages contains unhappy, screaming
      research monkeys with orwellian stainless-steel hardware and
      antennae bolted to their bisected skulls. strange sounds
      and various lighting effects emerge from the different
      sections.

                ... i personally know of a coupla rangers
                who swear that they see only in tertiary
                colors now --

                           marco

                -- delp.

                close to a con-ed transformer.

                     marco

          -- delp.   it's not gws.
delp has known marco too long, and too well, not to take him
seriously.

                    delp

          a dozen years ago, the army did this tiny
          implantable i.d. thing -- you could imbed
          it under the skin, then scan it like a
          bar code for medical emergency
          information, blood-type, dna. pentagon
          ordered up half a million, and stuck
          about five thousand experimentally into
          high-risk soldiers and infantry. but the
          scanners proved skittish and field
          hospitals hated 'em, so the whole deal
          got eighty-sixed and forgotten.

                    marco

          the army never put one in me.

                    delp

          that you know of, man.     that you know of.
              (then)
          how'd you find me?

                    marco (v.o.)

          i looked under mad scientists in the
          yellow pages -- there was a full page ad.

                     delp

          ha ha.
marco stares down into a big pit. among the racks of
equipment are two primate-sized stainless-steel beds with
restraints and i.v. trees waiting.

                    delp

          you seriously believe somebody's messed
          with your mother board.

                    marco

          what are you studying here, delp?

                     delp

          fear.

                    marco

          for the agency?

                    delp

          nah, cia cut me loose in '97 during the
          macedonian debacle. now i got this
          little grant from wal-mart.




                                                 8/18/03    60.







      wal-mart? fear? marco looks at the monkeys. doesn't want
      to know any more. he shifts his gaze back to delp. studies
      him. then:

                          marco

                look, delp. my experiences during the
                war, in kuwait ... feel dreamlike to me.
                and my dreams? about what happened?
                feel as real as you and me, here, right
                now.
      delp just waits.

                          marco

                it's like ... i feel like somewhere along
                the line, i've been ... brainwashed. or
                something. you know? all scrambled up.

                          delp

                we've all been brainwashed, marco.
                religion, advertising, television.
                politics. we accept what's normal
                because we're told it's normal and we
                crave normalcy. hell, look at the
                germans under hitler. disco, in the
                seventies.
                    (beat)
                and if you're really worried about
                somebody imbedding electric probes and
                computer chips in your brain to make you
                do things -- it's horseshit, man. turns
                out pavlov had it right from the getgo.
                dogs and all. a little ect and sleep
                deprivation will do the trick for a
                fraction of the price. ask the uzbeks.
                and you would remember it.

                          marco

                what about my dreams?

                          delp

                    (shrugs)
                what if all this is the fucking dream and
                you're still back in kuwait?

                          marco

                you're not helping me.

                          delp

                i am. you're not helping yourself.
                reality is consensual, man. you just
                gotta prove it up. or play it out.
