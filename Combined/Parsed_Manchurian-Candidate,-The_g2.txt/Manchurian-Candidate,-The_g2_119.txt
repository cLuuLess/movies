        where raymond sits, stripped to the waist, watching the
        mirror as his mother looms over him, in a beautiful chinese
        silk dress, combing his damp hair.

                  ... because, of course, the assassin --
                  the deranged, obsessed, tragically

                    ellie (cont'd)

          paranoid, lone gunman -- is trying to
          kill you.

          the major is an excellent marksman.
she touches his bare shoulder, leaves her hand there.

                    raymond

          but what will happen to him?

                    ellie

              (gentle)
          the assassin always dies, baby. it's
          necessary for the national healing.
she takes his shirt off a hanger, he stands up, and she
starts to dress him --

                    ellie

          i'm sure you will never entirely
          comprehend this, darling, and i know, the
          way you are right now, this is like
          trying to have a whimpered conversation
          with someone on a distant star ... but it
          must be said, raymond -- i did this for
          you -- so that you could have what i
          could not, what your father didn't want --
          what your grandfather dared to dream
          possible --
she runs her hands through his hair.   tears fill her eyes.

                    ellie

          -- when you ran away to join the army,
          after that girl, after jocie -- when you
          swore you'd never speak to me again, i
          felt your father's shadow pass across us,
          and i couldn't let him run you the way
          he ruined himself.
              (beat)
          that's when mark whiting came to me with
          talk of extraordinary scientific
          breakthroughs ... attitude adjustment ...
          reconciliation ... greatness. so i let
          them take you, and change you. not too
          much. not so much that you'd notice.
          just enough to bring you back to me.

                    raymond

          yes, mother.

                    ellie

          and look what you have, now! look how
          far we've come! it's working, darling --
          they think they own you, but they are
          very, very wrong. you're not something
          they can buy and sell, raymond, not for

                    (more)





                                                 8/18/03    109.








                          ellie (cont'd)

                any price -- we're one, and there'll be
                no stopping us now, will there? we're
                going to save this country in the hour of
                its greatest need.
      raymond is dazzled by eddie's radiance.

                          raymond

                yes, mother.
      she straightens his tie.   her hands caress her son's
      shoulders.

                          ellie

                how much you look like my father, now --
                you have his hands, and you hold your
                head in the same proud way. and when you
                smile it's like i'm a little girl again,
                and --
                    (impulsively kisses him)
                when you smile -- when you smile --
      raymond moves to her -- their embrace is all consuming --
