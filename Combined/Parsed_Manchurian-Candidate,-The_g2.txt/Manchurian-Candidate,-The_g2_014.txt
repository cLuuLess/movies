37   int. h.s. auditorium entrance - later                          37

     the luncheon is breaking up. a couple of scouts chase each
     other through the clusters of men. marco's leaving. men
     stop him to shake his hand and thank him for coming.

                         melvin

               major marco.
     marco turns, stares blankly into the eyes of the bedraggled-
     looking man, who half-salutes.

                         melvin

               it's al melvin, sir. corporal melvin.
               from your unit. desert storm.
     marco stares hard. melvin looks like a homeless guy, his
     clothes rumpled, his fingernails stained and broken, his
     eyes wild with fatigue and paranoia.

                          marco

               melvin.   jesus -- how are you --

                         melvin

                   (intense)
               i have these dreams, major.

                          marco

               dreams.




                                               8/18/03   11.








                     melvin

           yeah. kuwait. you and me. mavole, and
           baker. raymond shaw.
               (beat)
           see, i remember it happened the way you
           just said. and then i don't.

                     marco

           well, we had a pretty rough time over
           there, al, it was hairy, and -- it was a
           long time ago, now. memories shift.

                     melvin

           do you have dreams, sir?

                     marco

           everybody has dreams, corporal --

                     melvin

           not these.
beat.   marco stares at him.

                     marco

           no i don't.
melvin's face falls, disappointed. fumbling in his clothes,
he finds a spiral notebook, dog-eared, and fat with
newspaper clippings -- tries to press it into marco's hands.

                     melvin

           it's bad, sir. it's making me crazy. i
           write it down, every night, after i wake
           up, i try to get it all -- it doesn't
           always go together -- all of what i can
           remember, and --

                     marco

               (gentle)
           -- al, you know, maybe you should be
           going to the va and talking to a doctor,
           i mean if these dreams are really --

                     melvin

           -- i've been to doctors!
the notebook drops between them, and pages scatter on the
floor. both men go down to collect them --

                     melvin

           i'm so stuck, sir. i mean -- i remember
           shaw saving us, but it does not make
           sense -- it should have been you. and
           shaw, he --




                                                 8/18/03   12.








                         marco

               well, that's -- it's over and done.
               we've got to move on --
     -- marco rocks back on his heels as he stares down at a
     sketchy portrait of an arabic woman whose face is covered
     with intricate designs -- marco stares curiously, as if he
     recognizes her --

                         melvin

               i can't get my hand around it. i thought
               maybe, if you had the dreams ...

                         marco

                   (shaken)
               you need money --?

                          melvin

               no.   no sir.
     self-conscious (people are staring) melvin shoves the
     notebook back inside his jacket.

                         marco

               -- here --
     marco already digging for a crumpled twenty.    melvin waves
     it off, backing away, suddenly pissed.

                         melvin

               i don't need your money.

                          marco

               okay.   okay. well, look, al, i gotta --

                          melvin

               go.

                         marco

               -- run, yeah. but.
                   (awkward)
               it was great seeing you.   and good luck
               to you.
     melvin just scowls sadly at marco. flash of glass, a door
     opens and closes, and marco is gone.
