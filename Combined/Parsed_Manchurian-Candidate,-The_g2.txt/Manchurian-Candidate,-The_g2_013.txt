36   int. high school auditorium - continuous                       36

     a boy scout luncheon banquet.

                         washington d.c., now

     a full chicken buffet table, banners, flags, and over one
     hundred scouts, leaders and dads, all looking somewhat
     attentively up at the guest speaker, u.s. army major ben
     marco.

                         marco

               like edmonds in korea, holderman in viet
               nam, raymond shaw was awarded the
               congressional medal of honor. i signed
               the recommendation myself.
     a hand shoots up.    marco nods toward it.




                                                   8/18/03   9.








                           another scout

                 were you wounded?

                            marco

                 i was --

fb36   flash: marco on the kuwaiti two-lane                        fb36

       turning away from the overturned humvee, and right into a
       head-high rifle-butt swung by the hands and arms of a gas
       mask-wearing figure.

       resume - auditorium - marco

       he blinks.

                           marco

                 -- injured. i fell, had a, uh,
                 concussion -- lost focus -- sgt. shaw
                 took command --
       a disheveled man comes into the back of the room noisily,
       as:

                           scout dad

                 did your unit sustain any casualties?

                            marco

                 yes.   two. two of my people were killed.
       silence. no more questions. the disheveled man (melvin)
       coughs. marco pointedly ignores him.

                           marco

                 the medal of honor is the highest award
                 to which any soldier can aspire. from
                 the jungles of iwo jima to the desert of
                 kuwait, what these brave men i've talked
                 about today did will never be forgotten.
                 since 1917, only 827 medals have been
                 given to a total of more than 30 million
                 americans in arms. only three have been
                 awarded in the last 40 years. who knows?
                 maybe someday one of you fine boys will
                 earn one yourself in defense of this
                 great nation.
       a scoutmaster, thin, bearded, stands up:

                           scoutmaster

                 major marco, on behalf of troops 484 and
                 488 -- just like to thank you, for coming
                 to talk to us, about the medal of honor,
                 and your interesting experiences in the
                 armed services.




                                                   8/18/03   10.

               thanks for listening. my family has
               claimed the army as a trade ever since a
               young gunnery officer who grew up with
               hernando de soto left spain for a look at
               the upper mississippi.
                   (beat)
               my life is in service to my country.

                         melvin

               you ever wish it'd been you?

                         marco

               excuse me?

                         melvin

               won the medal. been the hero.
     something causes marco to hesitate.   then, as if he'd
     rehearsed it:

                         marco

               no, i'm just proud to have been there.
     he sits down.   spattering of polite applause.
