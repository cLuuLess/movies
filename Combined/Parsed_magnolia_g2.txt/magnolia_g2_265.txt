     int. billingsley's - that moment

     camera tracks with claudia as she walks back to the table...she
     comes up from behind jim kurring and leans in quick...kisses
     him on the cheek and then quickly sits down across from him;

                                claudia 
                      i wanted to do that. 

     jim kurring smiles, shaken a bit. 

                                jim kurring
                      well. 

                                claudia 
                      that felt good to do...to do what
                      i wanted to do. 

                                jim kurring
                      yeah. 

                                claudia 
                      can i tell you something? 

                                jim kurring
                      yeah, of course. 

                                claudia 
                      i'm really nervous that you're 
                      gonna hate me soon.  that you're
                      gonna find stuff out about me
                      and you're gonna hate me -- 

                                jim kurring 
                      -- no, like what, what do you mean? 

                                claudia 
                      you're a police officer.  you have
                      so much, so many good things and 
                      you seem so together...so all straight
                      and put together without problems.

                                jim kurring
                      i lost my gun. 

                                claudia
                      what?

                                jim kurring 
                      i lost my gun after i left you today
                      and i'm the laughing stock of a lot 
                      of people.  i wanted to tell you that. 
                      i wanted you to know...and it's on my mind
                      and it makes me look like a fool and 
                      i feel like a fool and you asked that
                      we should say things, that we should
                      say what we're thinknig and not lie 
                      about things and i'll tell you that, this:
                      that i lost my gun and i'm not a good 
                      cop...and i'm looked down at...and i know
                      that....and i'm scared that once you
                      find that out you might not like me. 

                                claudia 
                      oh my god, jim. jim, that was so --
