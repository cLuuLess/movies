     ext. apartment building/la river - that moment

     camera {steadicam) follows jim kurring as he walks around the side of
     an apartment building, looking for the black male....he snoops a bit,
     holding his flashlight as it's just about dark....the side of the 
     building runs along the l.a river.....he starts in towards something... 

     a very loud gunshot is heard and hits on the side wall of the
     apartment, right next to jim kurring's face --

     ...he ducks for cover, looses balance and falls down, in the mud,
     sliding down the embankment next to the l.a. river --- another
     gun shot is heard....

     kurring reaches for his revolver which is not in it's holster --

                                                                cut to:
