     int. holiday inn/banquet room - that moment

     camera pulls back from frank, who heads offstage.  the audience is 
     applauding him.  the sidekick, doc takes the mic and makes an
     announcement about the one hour break/snacks served in lobby/etc.

     frank hops offstage, greets captain muffy and gwenovier;

                                captain muffy 
                      chief, this is gwenovier from the show,
                      "profiles," for the interview -- 

                                frank 
                      hello, hello, i'm a bit out of breath
                      from all this work -- 

                                gwenovier 
                      that's fine.  it's nice to meet you. 

                                frank 
                      are we gonna tape some stuff now? 

                                gwenovier 
                      if you're up to it, i've got us
                      set up in a suite upstairs --

                      you got us a room so quick? 

     frank and captain muffy laugh at the joke.

                                frank 
                      i'm kidding of course. 

                                                                cut to:
