     int. earl's house - that moment

     camera (hand held) with phil, phone to his ear, on hold (we can 
     hear frank's commercial playing on the receiver, ref. notes.)

     earl is moaning in pain, the dogs are barking at the noise. 

     earl continues to hallucinate and remains in major pain, but at 
     the same time he's very, very weak.  there are moments of strength
     that pop and push into him and he's very angry with phil, continues
     to scream for someone named, "lily," and generally treats phil like
     an enemy.

                                earl 
                      lily.  fuck. lil, please. lily. 

     phil moves into the kitchen and gets the bottle of morphine pills. 
     he drops them, the crash on the floor, picks them all up, except one... 

     ...which one of the mutt dogs walks over to and eats.  earl screams.

                                                                cut to:
