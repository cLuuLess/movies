                      this is not an easy job.  i get a call
                      from shirley on the radio: bad news.
                      it's never good news.  she tries to
                      be cheerful, tries to say something 
                      nice, but uh-huh, it's just bad news.
                      and it stinks.  but this is my job. 
                      and i love it.  because i want to do well.
                      in this life and in this world i want 
                      to do well.  and i want to help people.
                      and i may get twenty bad calls a day. 
                      but one time i help someone, i make a save?
                      i correct a wrong or right a situation; 
                      then i'm a happy cop.  and we move through
                      this life we should try and do good.
