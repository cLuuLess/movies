     jimmy and rose.  hold. then:

                                rose 
                      ...say it, jimmy... 

                                jimmy 
                      do you know the answer to this? 

                                rose 
                      i'm asking you.  i'm asking you 
                      if you know why clauida will not 
                      speak to you....please, jimmy....tell me. 

                                jimmy 
                      i think that she thinks i may
                      have molested her. 

     rose doesn't flinch. 

                                jimmy 
                      she thinks terrible things that 
                      somehow got in her head...that i might
                      have done something.  she said that
                      to me last time...when it was...ten
                      years ago she walked out the door, 
                      "you touched me wrong..." "i know that." 
                      some crazy thought in her, in her head... 

                                rose 
                      did you ever touch her? 

                                jimmy
                      ...no.... 

     hold. beat. rose asks again;

                                rose
                      jimmy, did you touch her? 

                                jimmy 
                      i don't know.

     rose starts to cry a bit.  so does jimmy.

                                rose
                      ...jimmy... 

                                jimmy 
                      i really don't know. 

                                rose 
                      but you can't say....

                                jimmy
                      i don't know what i've done. 

                                rose 
                      yes you do....you do and you won't say. 

                                jimmy
                      ...i don't know...

     she stands up and walks to a small table and gets her car keys
     and her jacket....

                                jimmy
                      what...? ...no...no, please...

     she stands above him. 

                                rose 
                      you deserve to die alone for what you've done.

                                jimmy 
                      i don't know what i've done. 

                                rose

                                rose
                      no. 

                                jimmy 
                      i don't know what i've done. 

                                rose 
                      you should know better.

     she leaves.
