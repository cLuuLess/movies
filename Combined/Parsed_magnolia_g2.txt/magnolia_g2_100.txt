     int. earl's house - den - that moment

     camera holds on phil.  slow zoom in as he stands in front of
     the television, flipping stations.

     angle, the television. 
     it's plays all sorts of various things.  phil stops a few beats
     on each thing that looks vaguely like an infomercial. 

     he puts the remote down, exits the room.  camera stays a moment,
     catches a glimpse of a promo for, "what do kids know?"

     it's various images of stanley and the other kids answering 
     questions, with a calendar showing they've been at it for over
     seven weeks and total winnings moving towards $450,000.00

                      luis and todd -- they're moving towards
