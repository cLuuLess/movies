     camera follows dixon as he walks towards an old beat up parked car.
     he stops, hesitates, looks across the way --

     linda's mercedes is parked.

     he hestitates a moment, looks left and right and all around
     and then he starts to walk over to the car...

     at linda's car.  dixon sees that she's passed out, knocks on
     the window...

                                dixon 
                      lady...hey lady...lady....you ok?
                      you alive...huh...hey?

     he looks around again, then gets in the passenger's side of the
     car, shakes her same more.

                                dixon
                      lady.  lady. hey wake up.  lady?

     dixon reaches down and takes her purse, takes the money out of the
     wallet and then reaches for her cel phone and dials 911.

                                dixon 
                      hello?  hello?  i have an emergency

                      information regarding location. etc.)

     concealed parked car he came from --
