     int. earl's house - that moment

     linda is bedside with earl.  she cries her eyes out.  she
     speaks to him in mumbles about "...sorry..." "...my love..."
     "...you've lived a long, good life..."  she prepares the 
     bottle of liquid morphine and sets it next to the him...hold.

     earl comes out of it a bit, pets her head, mumbles a few words that 
     don't make sense.  phil in the b.g.  linda can't administer the drops,
     she turns quickly to phil; 

                                linda 
                      listen...listen to me now, phil: 
                      i'm sorry, sorry i slapped your face. 
                      ...because i don't know what i'm doing...
                      ...i don't know how to do this, y'know? 
                      you understand?  y'know?  i...i'm...i do things 
                      and i fuck up and i fucked up....forgive me, ok?
                      can you just...

                                phil 
                      ....it's alright....

                                linda 
                      tell him i'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, 
                      now, i'm sorry, tell him, for all the things
                      i've done...i fucked up and i'm sorry....
                      and i'm gonna turn away and walk now and not
                      look at him not see my man, my earl, i'll 
                      leave now...and tell him it's ok and i'm ok. 
                      the whole thing was ok with me -- and i know. 

     she turns quick and walks out of the house.

     hold on phil.  he paces around a moment or two, looks at the side table.

     cu - the bottle of liquid morphine.
     it's ready to go.

     cu - phil. he looks at it. 

                                                                cut to:
