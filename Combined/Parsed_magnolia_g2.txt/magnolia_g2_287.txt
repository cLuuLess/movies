     ext. claudia's apartment/street - that moment

     the frogs are falling sort of heavy now....rose's jaguar comes
     through it....skids and smashes into a parked car....

     camera dollies over to her....she looks up at them....they fall
     straight into camera and onto the hood, windshield and roof....

     ..rose puts the jaguar in reverse and tries to back away from the 
     smashed parked car.....the bumper's are stuck....

                                                                cut to:
