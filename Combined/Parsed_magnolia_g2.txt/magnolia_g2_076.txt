     int. doctor's office - moments later

     quick shots get them in the room:  dr. landon (40s) sits
     across from linda, who's in semi-hysterics, pacing; 

                                linda 
                      -- he's fucking dying, he's dying
                      as we're sitting here and there
                      isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, 
                      how can you tell me to calm down? 

                                dr. landon 
                      i can help you through this the 
                      best i know how but there are certain
                      things you are gonna have to be 
                      strong about and take care of, now
                      we can go over them, but i need to 
                      know that you're listening to me, ok? 

                                linda 
                      i just, i just -- i just -- i'm just
                      in a fucking state, i know he's 
                      going and it's like i don't know how
                      -- just tell me practical things -- 
                      what the fuck do i do with his body? 
                      what happens when he dies? that next moment:
                      what? what do i do?  then what? 

                                dr. landon 
                      well that's what hospice will take care of
                      for you.  they will send a nurse, someone 
                      who can take care of all of that for you -- 

                                linda 
                      he has phil right now.

                                dr. landon 
                      phil's one of the nurses from the service? 

                                linda 
                      yeah.

                                dr. landon 
                      if you're happy with phil taking care
                      of him and helping you, that's fine, 
                      but contact hospice to arrange for the body -- 

                                linda 
                      -- you don't understand: it's more pain 
                      than before and the fucking morphine pills
                      aren't working, he's -- past two days it's 
                      like he can't really swallow them and i don't 
                      know if they're going down -- i can't see inside
                      his mouth anymore -- i'm up all night staring
                      at him and i don't think the pills are going
                      down and he moans and he hurts -- 

                                dr. landon 
                      we can fix that, because i can give
                      you -- are you listening? 

                                linda 
                      i'm listening.  i'm getting better. 

                                dr. landon 
                      do you wanna sit down? 

                                linda 
                      i need to sit down.

                                dr. landon 
                      ok. linda:  earl is not gonna make it.
                      he's dying. he is.  he is dying very,
                      very rapidly -- 

     she breaks a bit more.

                                dr. landon 
                      now the thing here is making that experience 
                      as painless and easy as possible for him, 
                      you understand?  now you need to get in touch 
                      with hospice care because they can take care of
                      all those practical things that you're asking 
                      me about -- they are who you call when he dies. 

     he writes a number on his bussiness card, hands it over as they speak;

                                dr. landon 
                      this is the number for hospice.
                      ok. now. as far as the morphine pills go,
                      there is something else to consider that
                      can take the pain away that he is in,
                      there is a very strong and very potent solution
                      of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle,
                      with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in
                      his mouth and drop on his tounge and 
                      it will certainly diminish the pain that
                      he is in but you have to realize that
                      once you give it to him; there really 
                      is no coming back, i mean, it will certainly
                      cure his pain, but he will float in and 
                      out of consciousness, even worse than he
                      is now, linda.  i mean, any sign of the 
                      recognizable earl will pretty much go away -- 

                                linda 
                      -- how the fuck can i say anything 
                      to that -- i don't know what to say to that -- 

                                dr. landon 
                      the job here is to make him as comfortable 
                      as possible -- right now -- our job is to just
                      try and make it as painless as possible.
                      right?  you understand?

     the perscription for the liquid morphine....hands it to linda....
