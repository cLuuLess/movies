     int. game show stage - that moment

     camera (steadicam) follows mary as she runs over to jimmy.

                                jimmy 
                      take me outta here, mary...i gotta 
                      go, i gotta go home to rose, please, please. 

     she leads him away.  camera moves over to burt who's dealing with
     the situation -- rick comes running over, looking for stanley. 
     "where is he? where the fuck did he go?"  burt tries to calm him down. 

     canera moves over to cynthia who's dealing with richard and julia
     and mim and luis and todd. 

                                cynthia 
                      let's go, c'mon, get up -- 

                                richard
                      did we win or lose, i mean --?

                                cynthia 
                      i don't know, richard, they need 
                      to talk it over --

                                luis 
                      you lost, kid.  they go to the score
                      at the time it was called -- 

                                julia 
                      that's not an official rule. 

                                luis 
                      that's the way it goes. 

                                richard 
                      bullshit. who says that, what rule book, 
                      in what sport?  this is different, it's a quiz show,
                      they don't go by sports rules -- 

                                mim 
                      let's all just settle down -- 

                                cynthia 
                      richard, shut it and keep it down.

                                richard 
                      if he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda
                      won.  we fucking had this game. 

                                luis 
                      you didn't have shit, kid. 

     camera with jimmy and mary as they head off, down the hallway
     and towards some elevators -- he's really out of it --

                                                                cut to:
