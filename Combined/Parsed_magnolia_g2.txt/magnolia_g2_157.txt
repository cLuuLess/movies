     int. holiday inn suite - that moment

     frank and gwenovier doing the telvision interview. camera dollies
     in slow on each:

                                frank 
                      -- that's right, that's right, and what i'm 
                      saying, that none of my competitors can say is
                      this:  that there is no need for insight or
                      understanding.  things of the past! gone, over, done.
                      do you realize how fucking miraculous this is?
                      how fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and
                      ahead of it's time this concept is?  i'm 
                      talking about eliminating insight and understanding
                      as human values.  god damn i'm good.  there is
                      no need for insight.  there is no need for
                      understanding.  i have found a way to take 
                      any subjective human experience -- in other
                      words -- all the terrible shit or all the 
                      great shit that you've had happen to you in 
                      your life -- and quickly and easily transform
                      it in the unconscious mind through the subtle 
                      and cunning use of language.  the "listener-patient"
                      (in other words: the chick) settles into a very
                      light, very delicate, conversationally induced
                      state: not a trance, mind you, but a state. 
                      a state that is brand new.  the system's state.
                      what did i do?  i realized that concept and put 
                      it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use.
                      i'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the 
                      seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 
                      'till dawn.  i'm gonna teach methods of language that
                      will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail -- 

                                gwenovier
                      let's talk about -- 

                                frank 
                      i just realized this is for television,
                      isn't it?  i can't swear up and down
                      like i just did. 

                                gwenovier 
                      it's fine.  i can bleep it out. 

                                frank 
                      i warned you -- i get on a roll... 

                                gwenovier 
                      -- let's talk more about your background -- 

                                frank
                      muffy -- coffee? 

     muffy moves to pour a cup, gwen looks down at her clipboard, then:

                                gwenovier 
                      i'm confused about your past is the thing. 

                                frank 
                      is that still lingering? 

                                gwenovier 
                      -- just to clarify -- 

                                frank
                      so boring, so useless -- 

                                gwenovier 
                      i would just want to clear some things up: 

                                frank 
                           (muffy delivers coffee) 
                      thank you, muffy.  funny thing is:
                      this is an important element of,
                      "seduce and destory:"
                      "facing the past is an important way 
                      in not making progress," that's something
                      i tell my men over and over -- 

                                gwenovier 
                      this isn't meant -- 

                                frank 
                      -- and i try and teach the students to
                      ask: what is it in aid of? 

                                gwenovier 
                      are you asking me that?

                                frank
                      yes. 

                                gwenovier 
                      well, just trying to figure out who you are,
                      and how you might have become -- 

                                frank
                      in aid of what?

                                gwenovier 
                      i'm saying, frank, in trying to
                      figure out who you are -- 

                                frank 
                      -- there's a lot more important things
                      i'd like to put myself into -- 

                                gwenovier 
                      it's all important -- 

                                frank
                      not really. 

                                gwenovier 
                      it's not like i'm trying to attack you -- 

                                frank 
                      this is how you wanna spend the time,
                      then go, go, go -- you're gonna 
                      be surprised at what a waste it is --
                      "the most useless thing in the world 
                      is that which is behind me," chapter three -- 

                                gwenovier 
                      we talked earlier about your mother. 
                      and we talked about your father and his death.
                      and i don't want to be challenging or
                      defeatist here, but i have to ask and 
                      i would want to clarify something --
                      something that i understand -- 

                                frank 
                      i'm not sure i hear a question in there? 

                                gwenovier
                      do you remember a miss simms? 

                                frank 
                      i know alotta women and i'm sure she remembers me.

                                gwenovier 
                      she does.  from when you were a boy. 

                                frank
                      mm. hm. 

                                gwenovier 
                      she lived in tarzana. 

                                frank 
                      an old stomping ground --is this 
                      the "attack" portion of the interview,
                      i figured this was coming sooner 
                      or later -- is "the girl" coming in for the kill? 

                                gwenovier 
                      no, this is about getting something 
                      right and claryfying one of your answers
                      to an earlier question -- 

                                frank 
                      go ahead and waste your time.

                                gwenovier 
                      i was told that your mother died.
                      that your mother died when you were young -- 

                                frank 
                      and that's what you've heard? 

                                gwenovier 
                      i talked to miss simms.  miss simms
                      was your caretaker and neighbor
                      after your mother died in 1980.

     beat. frank goes silent.

                                gwenovier 
                      in my research i have you listed as 
                      the only son of earl and lily partridge.
                                (beat)
                      and what i learned from mrs. simms is that
                      your mother passed away in 1980. 
                                (beat) 
                      see:  it's my understanding that the information
                      supplied by you and your company and answers 
                      to question's i've asked are incorrect, frank.
                      and if i'd like to get to the bottom of who you
                      are and why you are then i think your family 
                      history -- you're accurate family history...well:
                      this seems important...frank...? 

     video camera pov - that moment
     frank lights his cigarette.  camera zooms into cu.

                                frank 
                      are you asking me a question?

                                gwen
                      well i guess the question is this:
                      do you remember miss simms? 

     beat. hold, then:

                                                                cut to:
