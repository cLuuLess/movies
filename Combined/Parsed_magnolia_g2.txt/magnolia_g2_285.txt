     ext. magnolia blvd. - that moment

     camera holds a wide angle as jim kurring's car slams and skids to
     a stop in the middle of the empty street.

     closer angle, push in on the driver's side window.
     jim is scared and sweating.....he looks up, out the driver's side
     window....

     jim's pov - looking straight up. 
     it's dark and empty sky.....

     ....hold on him....he looks at the frog that has landed on
     the windshield....it's dead and splattered.....

     suddenly: 

     the sound of another frog falling from the sky and slamming
     on the roof of the car. 

     jim jumps.....looks up again....

     ....from straight out of the sky comes another frog falling
     directly into the camera....it splats....

     ...then another and another and another.....

     wide angle.  the street.

     it starts to rain frogs in the middle of magnolia blvd.

                                                                cut to:
