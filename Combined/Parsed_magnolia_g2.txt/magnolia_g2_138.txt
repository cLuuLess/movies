     int. claudia's apartment - that moment               sequence e

     jim kurring and clauida continued.  he walks into the kitchen area
     and sees a pot of coffee.

                                jim kurring 
                      got some coffee brewing, huh? 

                                claudia 
                      yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit -- 

                                jim kurring 
                      i like iced coffee, generally, but a day
                      like this, rain and what not, i enjoy a warm cup --

                                claudia 
                      -- do you wanna cup? 

                                jim kurring 
                      that's great, thank you. 

     she starts heating/preparing him some coffee.

                                claudia 
                      i don't know how fresh it's gonna be -- 

                                jim kurring 
                      oh, it'll be fine, i'm sure, claudia. 

                                claudia 
                      you take cream or sugar? 

                                jim kurring 
                      that'd be fine.  so, claudia, lemme just say,
                      so i can get my role of lapd officer
                      out of the way before we enjoy our 
                      coffee (i never like to talk shop over coffee)
                      i'm not gonna write you up or anything,
                      i'm not gonna give you a citation here -- 
                      but the real problem we have is that there
                      are people around here, people that 
                      work from their homes, people tryin' to get
                      some work done, and if you're listenin' to 
                      your music that loud:  they're incovenienced
                      by that.  if you had a job you'd probably
                      understand, but i see you like listenin' 
                      to your music and that's fine, you're just 
                      gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume,
                      maybe memorize what number you see on the
                      dial and just always put it to that -- 
                      if it's the middle of the day -- that's 
                      what i do -- just put it on two and a half 
                      and that's a good listening level, alright? 
                      i see you like listenin' to your music loud,
                      but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you
                      end up damaging your own ears ok? 

                                claudia
                      yeah. 

                                jim kurring 
                      arlight, then.  cheers. 

     they clink coffee cups.  he makes a sour face at the taste;

                                jim kurring
                      is this boyfriend bothering you? 

                                claudia 
                      i don't have a boyfriend.

                                jim kurring
                      the gentleman who came to the door --

                                claudia 
                      -- is not my boyfriend. 

                                jim kurring 
                      many times, in damestic abuse situations
                      the young lady is afraid to speak,
                      but i have to tell you that, being
                      a police officer, i've seen it happen: 
                      young woman afraid to speak, next thing 
                      you know, i'm gettin' a call on the radio, 
                      i got a 422 --

                                claudia
                      it's not -- what's a 422?

                                jim kurring 
                      it's where situations like these 
                      lead, claudia, unless you do something
                      about it early, if and when the police
                      call and come for help.  now there 
                      are certain measures you can take -- 

                                claudia 
                      it's not my boyfriend -- and it's
                      not anything -- it's over.  really.
                      it's not.  he won't came back. 

                                jim kurring 
                      i don't wanna have to come back here 
                      in an hour and find that there's
                      been another disturbance.

                                claudia 
                      you won't.  you won't have to. 

                                jim kurring 
                      but i wouldn't mind comin' back in 
                      an hour just to see your pretty face!

     they laugh. 

                                claudia 
                      i'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick. 

                                jim kurring
                      okey-doke. 

     she exits.  hold a beat with him.

                                                                cut to:
