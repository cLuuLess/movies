     int. psychologist's office - moments later

     a small, comfortable office space.  linda is crying, talking,
     pacing.  the psychologist is a middle aged woman, dr. diane.
     as they talk, dr. diane writes a perscription;

                                linda 
                      i hate doing this, coming here
                      and not being able to talk -- 

                                dr. diane 
                      i understand, it's fine -- 
                      i wish the circumstance was better. 

                                linda 
                      i don't know what's gonna happen,
                      i really don't -- i'm so fucking, 
                      i feel so over the top with everything. 

                                dr. diane 
                      mmm..hmm.  running out of your 
                      medication at all, let alone at 
                      a time like this could be drastic,
                      i'm glad you came in to see me,
                      as short as this has been -- 

     she hands over the perscriptions (x2) and is about to say another
     word -- but linda snatches the two small pieces of paper from
     her hand and heads for the door -- 

                                linda 
                      thank you doctor diane -- 

                                shrink
                      good luck with everything.

     ecu - door slammed.

                                                                cut to:
