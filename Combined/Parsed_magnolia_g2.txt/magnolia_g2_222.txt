     int. earl's house - that moment                      sequence h

     camera on earl.  he opens his eyes a bit....looks over to phil. 

                                earl 
                      phil...phil...

     phil comes over and takes a seat next to him.

                                earl 
                      i'm onna try and talk...i'm atryan
                      say some thing some thing... 

     earl begins to talk. (director's note: following is the story
     earl tells, it is to be more broken and elliptical, factoring 
     in earl's state of mind and health, etc, but here's the concept
     in its entirety;) 

                                earl 
                      do you know lily?  phil..do you know her? 

                                phil
                      no. 

                                earl
                      ...lily...? 

                                phil
                      no. 

                                earl 
                      she's my love...my life...love of it...
                      in school when you're 12 years old. 
                      in school, in six grade....and i saw her 
                      and i didn't go to that school...but we met.
                      and my friend knew her...i would say, 
                      "what's that girl?"  "how's that lily?"
                      "oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with 
                      guys..."  my friend would say this....but 
                      then sometime...i went to another school, you see?
                      but then...when high school at the end, what's
                      that?  what is that?  when you get to the end? 

                                phil
                      graduation? 

                                earl 
                      no, no, the grade...the grade that you're in? 

                                phil
                      twelve. 

                                earl 
                      yeah...so i go to her school for that
                      for grade twelve...and we meet...she
                      was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain
                      doll...and the hips...child bearing
                      hips...y'know that?  so beautiful.
                      but i didn't have sex with anyone,
                      you know?  i was not...i couldn't 
                      do anything...always scared, y'know... 
                      she was...she had some boyfriends...they 
                      liked her y'know...but i didn't like that.
                      i couldn't get over that i wasn't a man, 
                      but she was a woman. y'see?  y'see i didn't
                      make her feel ok about that....i would
                      say, "how many men you been with?" 
                      she told me, i couldn't take it...take that
                      i wasn't a man....because if i hadn't had
                      sex with women...like as many women as
                      she had men...then i was weak...a boy....
                      but i loved her...you understand? 
                      ....well, of course, i wanted to have
                      sex with her...and i did and we were 
                      together....we met...age twelve, but then 
                      again...age seventeen...something, somethin...
                      i didn't let her forget that i thought she
                      was a bad...a slut.....a slut i would call
                      her and hit her....i hit her for what she
                      did...but we married...lily and me and we
                      married...but i cheated on her...over and
                      over and over again...because i wanted
                      to be a man and i couldn't let her be 
                      a woman...a smart, free person who was
                      something...my mind then, so fuckin'

                      that i would go out and fuck and come

                      gimme a cigarettee?

     through the following phil tries to give earl a cigarette,
     which earl can't get to his mouth, but then mimes that he's
     smoking as he starts to get more and more delusional, etc. 

                                earl 
                      she had cancer...from her...in her 
                      stomach and i didn't go anywhere 
                      with her...and i didn't do a god thing...
                      for her and to help her....shit...this
                      bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch
                      with perfect skin and child bearing 
                      hips and so soft...her namewaslilysee?
                                (beat, fading) 
                      he liked her though he did, his mom, 
                      frank/jack...he took care of her and she died.
                      she didn't stick with him and he thinks 
                      and he hates me, ok...see...i'm...that's
                      then what you get? 
                      ....are you still walkin' in that car...?

                                phil 
                      what?  say it again...walking in the car?

                                earl 
                      ....getthat on the tv....there... 

     earl starts to break down in tears, streaming out of his eyes,
     his body isn't moving at all; 

                                earl 
                      ...mistakes like this are not ok... 
                      sometimes you make some, and ok...not
                      sometimes to make other one....know
                      that you should do better....i loved lily.
                      i cheated on her.  for thirty five years.
                      and i have this son.  and she has cancer. 
                      and i'm not there.  and he's forced to take 
                      care of her.  he's fourteen years old to take
                      care of his mother and watch her die on him. 
                      little kid.  and i'm not there.  and she dies.
                      and i live my life.  and i'm not fair. 
                      thirty eight years and she has cancer and
                      i'm gone...i leave...i walk out, i can't
                      deal with that...who am i?  who the fuck
                      do i think i am to go and do a thing?
                      shit on that and that lovely person. 
                      i'll go away...i'll go away...i can't 
                      hold this..you gotta take this fuckin'

                      .....atke this.....

     phil mimes as if he's taking a pen from earl's hand. 

                                phil
                      i got it. 

     camera stays with phil.  hold on him as earl continues a moment.
     slow dolly in. 

                                earl 
                      oh fuck...this fuckin story has fallen apart
                      and i don't even think i can...i got no
                      punchline -- we had good times later, 
                      the best times, the love of my life,
                      i thirty eight years -- but never the respect
                      and the...she knew what i did...she knew...
                      all the stupid things i've done but the 
                      love was stronger than anything you can think up. 

     camera lands cu on phil.  earl's voice continues over the following:

                                                                cut to:
