     camera booms down and pushes in on donnie smith's honda accord,
     with damaged front end, as it pulls into a parking space.
     it's pouring rain. (dir.note) 

     camera lands in close.  donnie sits a moment.  he plays his tape,
     "dreams," sings along a bit, pep talks himself, does some deep 
     breathing, says; 

                                donnie 
                      make it happen, make it happen and go,go,go. 

     he gets out of the car real quick -- 

                                                                cut to:
