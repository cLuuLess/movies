     int. game show stage - that moment

     camera pushes in on the floor director again who counts down;

                                floor director 
                      and...three...two...one --- 

     he points to jimmy, who pops into shape, looks into the tv camera.

                                jimmy gator 
                      what a day and what a round, going
                      back and in for me and the final 
                      speed round to determine who's who 
                      today -- scores on the board's kids: 
                      9225. adults: 11,000.  and this game is 
                      not out of reach for the kids...can they 
                      hang in there and break the record? (etc,etc)
                      elders! who's the lucky so and so? 

     mim from the "adults" speaks into her mic. 

                                mim
                      it's gonna be me, jimmy.

                                jimmy 
                      c'mon down here, mim.

     she stands up and crosses over to jimmy.  this is for a one on one
     final section speed round.  one kid vs. one adult. 

     angle, stanley.
     camera pushes in on him and lands in cu.

     he takes his shirt out of his pants and tries to pull it down enough to
     cover the large wet stain in his pants.

     angle, jimmy and mim
     they chat about the game so far, etc. "they're quite a challenge, etc."

     angle, stanley and richard and julia.
     stanley can't pull his shirt down enough to cover.  he turns to
     richard and julia; 

                                stanley 
                      i don't wanna go, i can't do it this time. 

                                richard 
                      -- the fuck are you talking about? 

                                julia 
                      you have to go, stanley.  you're the
                      smartest. 

                                stanley 
                      i don't wanna do it.  why can't one
                      of you do it -- 

                                richard 
                      stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up 
                      and go over there i'm gonna beat your ass -- 

                                stanley 
                      i'm sick of being the one, the one who
                      always has to do everything, i don't
                      want to be the one always -- 

                                jimmy (oc)
                      kids!

     jimmy looks over to the "kids" panel. 

                                jimmy 
                      do i even have to ask?  stanley, get
                      your butt over here -- 

     stanley looks like a deer in headlights.  the audience applauds. 

                                                                cut to:
