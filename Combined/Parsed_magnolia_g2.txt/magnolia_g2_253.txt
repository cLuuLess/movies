     int. lamplighter - that moment

     camera with stanley, sitting alone in a booth with a coke and a cookie.
     he's reading a book.  beat, hold, then:

     camera pans/dollies away and booms up -- moving across the
     restaraunt -- across the way, sitting in a booth by the opposite 
     window, out of view from stanley;

     dixon, the little kid from earlier, sitting in a booth with a
     young black male, worm (20s) this is clearly the back figure
     we've been seeing glimpses of --

     angle, at the booth.
     dixon eats same pudding.  worm mumbles to him, various jabs.
     "...sit up straight..." "...world is hard..." "..little brat..."

     hold.  worm glances across the coffee shop -- he sees stanley.

     worm holds his look, thinks a moment.  he looks up at the
     woman behind the counter...she's doing a crossword puzzle.

     worm looks back to dixon, subtle mumbles and gestures and
     few moments later, dixon stands from the booth and exits the
     coffee shop.

     hold w/worm.  he sticks a finger down his throat, makes himself
     well with tears.  he stands up out of frame.

     angle, counter near stanley.
     worm sits into frame, near to stanley.  stanley glances up, they
     make a quick moment of eye contact, then look away.  beat. hold.

                                                                cut to:
