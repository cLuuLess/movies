     int. holiday inn/banouet room - that moment.

     camera with gwenovier as she walks quietly over to the side
     of the crowd to a video crew that's been set up and is recording
     frank's seminar.  she speaks sotto to a cameraman; 

                                gwenovier
                      sorry i'm late -- 

                                cameraman 
                      -- we're all set upstairs. 

                                gwenovier
                      thanks. 

     she moves towards a row and takes a seat next to captain muffy
     and doc, speaks sotto again; 

                                doc 
                      you have everything you need? 

                                gwenovier 
                      i'm set, thanks.

     camera moves away, frank is kneeling down to a guy in the
     audience, interacting, speaking compassionately;

                                frank
                      denise?

                                guy
                      that's right --

                                frank
                      -- and she hurt you didn't she?
                      i know, i know.  i know how that
                      can be brother, but let me tell you loud
                      and clear what we will be teaching
                      denise when we put our calendars to work and
                      set goals:

     frank hops back up on the stage;

                                frank
                      little denise, i say this:  i mark it
                      up and i write it down and you've been warned:
                      "by the end of may, you will know i'm not gay."
                      "on the fourth of june, denise, you're
                      gonna be lickin' my spoon."
                      "and come august, you suck my big fat
                      sausage."  i've set goals for myself.
                      and what?  i've said "enough is enough."
                      because why?  she's not gonna be your pal.
                      she's not gonna be your friend.  you think
                      she's gonna be there for you the second
                      you need something?  think again - this fuckin'
                      bitch denise!
                                (audience cheers) 
                      but: listen up:  that is not to say that we don't
                      all need women as friends, 'cause we're gonna 
                      learn later on in chapter 23 that having a couple
                      of chick-friends laying around can come in
                      real handy in setting jealousy traps. 
                      but we'll get to that.  number one (this is page 18
                      in your booklets, blue cover - go to it and
                      follow along with me.)

     the guys flip open their little blue booklets and follow along.

                                frank 
                      create a crisis -- simple and clean,
                      and if done properly can be quite
                      effective in getting some bush. 
                      here we go:  set a date with your so-called
                      "friend."  let's say you make it 7:30.
                      you call her on the phone -- 

                                                              flash on:
