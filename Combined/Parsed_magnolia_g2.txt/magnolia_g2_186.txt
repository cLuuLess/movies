     camera (steadicam) follows/leads doc as he walks from the seminar area 
     to the elevators...this is one continuous shot...as he gets into the
     elevator's and rides up, talking on the cel phone.

                      i wanna ask you one question, phil:
                      have you talked to anyone else about
                      this?  about frank and earl?

                      it that way -- all the security and 
                      what not, you understand?  this could
                      be a delicate situation for frank and
                      the family --

     the elevator doors ding and open and doc steps out -- heads down the
     hallway towards the suite -- 

                                janet (oc)
