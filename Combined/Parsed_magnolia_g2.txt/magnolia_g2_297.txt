     ext. street nearby - that moment

     jim kurring is in the middle of the frog rain...he puts his
     car into gear and drives down the street....

     ....about twenty yards later and he's out of it....

     ...he pulls into the parking lot behind solomon and
     solomon.....it's not raining frogs here.....

     kurring's headlights catch a glimpse of donnie starting to climb...

     ...donnie gets scared and freezes....

     ...kurring is oblivious to donnie for the moment.  he looks in
     his rearview mirror and sees the frogs falling....

     ...donnie looks past kurring and now sees the frogs falling
     in a 50 x 50 area in the street....

     ...donnie looks up... 

     ....frogs are falling staight at him/camera and they knock him down 
     and to the cement.....he falls flat on his face... 

     ...jim kurring turns his head and sees donnie, fallen flat face
     and bloody on the pavement....he gets out of his car and runs over
     to donnie, through the frogs that rain down, and picks him/drags
     him out of harm and under shelter in the loading dock area.
