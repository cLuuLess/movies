     int. claudia's apartment - that moment

     camera holds on claudia.  she's sitting up in bed, covers around 
     her, staring into space....a song plays....for a very, very long
     time she doesn't move until she looks up and sees someone 
     enter her bedroom....a figure from the back enters frame and walks
     in and sits on the edge of the bed....from the back it is clear 
     that it's jim kurring. she tears a bit and looks at him...hold....

     she turns her eyes from him and looks into the camera and smiles.

                                                          cut to black.


                                end.
