                                frank 
                      you requested my time and i gave it
                      you, you called me a liar and made accusations.
                      and you say, "if i'd known i wouldn't have
                      asked," then it's not an attack?  well, 
                      i don't wanna be the sort of fella who doesn't
                      keep his word.  i gave you my time, bitch.
                      so fuck you now.
