     int. sherman oaks pharmacy - that moment.

     camera pushes in on linda as she enters, heads to the back for 
     the perscription counter and a young pharmacy kid behind the counter;

                                young pharmacy kid
                      hello. 

                                linda
                      hi. 

     she hands over her three perscriptions.  the young pharmacy kid takes a
     long look at them, gives her a suspicious glance. 

                                young pharmacy kid
                      wow.  lot-o-stuff here, huh? 

     linda nods.  he goes to the back to the old-guy pharmacist and says
     a few words, points to linda.  another suspicious look or
     two from the both of them...the pharmacist guy gets on the phone.

     angle, linda. slow zoom in. blend from 24fps to 40fps.
     she just holds her breath and temper, looks down. 

                                                                cut to:
