     int. claudia's apartment - that moment

     claudia jumps -- turns her head to the door.  she sniffs a bit,
     yells over the blasting music;

                                claudia
                      ...hello...? 

                                jim kurring (oc)
                      lapd. open the door.

     she looks through her peep-hole, sees jim kurring.  she turns looks
     at her coffee table:  it's full of coke, pills and pot, etc. 

                                claudia 
                      uh...uh...what is it? 

                                jim kurring 
                      it's the lapd, can you open the door, please? 

     claudia rushes over to the table of drugs and starts to scoop
     things up in her arms -- 

                                claudia 
                      just a minute just a...i have 
                      to get dressed -- (fuck,fuck,fuck)
