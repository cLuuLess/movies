            bill and maurice walk around interviewing folks about bones. 
            bill with the dat recorder, maurice with the vidcam.

            we see this through maurice's shaky video camera:

            grainy video shots:

            an old woman.

                                old woman
                      ...and every tuesday, he'd roll by in his
                      car and drive me with all my laundry to
                      the laundromat so i wouldn't have to
                      carry the clothes.

            -- a dude in a wheel chair.  drinking outta paperbagged
            bottle with a wino hanging on the corner.

                      jimmy bones?  yeah, i knew that
                      motherfucker.  people make out like he
                      was some kinda damn robin hood. 
                      bullshit.  i saw him cut some muhfucker's
                      tongue once with that razor of
                      his...dropped it right into that jar of
                      dill pickles they used to have on the
                      counter in the bar.

                                wino
                      when i was a kid he used to slip twenties
                      into my pocket so i could buy toys and
                      shit.
                          (now to maurice/at camera)
                      bones was awrright.  he was solid.  and
                      then one day, he just wasn't around no
                      more.  don't pay to ask too many
                      questions 'round here.
