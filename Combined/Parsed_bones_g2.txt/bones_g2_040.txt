            maurice and bill carrying speakers and racks and lights and
            turntables while shotgun, in his lawn chair across the
            street, glares at them.

            after the last equipment is loaded, they lock the car. 
            shotgun still watching.  bill pulls out a six pack of beer. 
            he offers one to shotgun who, after a beat, accepts it.

            maurice surreptitiously turns on his small hi-7 camera. 
            holding it under his arm, but it's on.

                                maurice
                      you ever hear of jimmy bones, sir?

                                shotgun
                      what business is it of yours?

                                maurice
                      just wondered.  we heard he used to live
                      in our building.

            shotgun says nothing.

                                bill
                      is it true?

                                shotgun
                      yeah.  he lived there.  and died there,
                      too.

                                bill
                      died there?  how?

                                shotgun
                      how the hell should i know?

                                maurice
                      what was he like?

                                shotgun
                      bones?  he was something.  he could be
                      cold as ice or warm as blood.  but he
                      never turned his back for a brother.

            his eyes drift up to the building.

                                shotgun (cont'd)
                      always there.

            maurice goes in.  bill lingers behind.

                                shotgun (cont'd)
                      hey, kid.

                                bill
                      yeah?

                                shotgun
                      take my advice.  get the hell out of
                      there.  it's a bad place.  always has
                      been.
