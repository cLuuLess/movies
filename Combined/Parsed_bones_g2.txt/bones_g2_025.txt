            ext. blackstone - across the street - continuous

            shotgun watches from the window as the group exits the
            building with the dog.  seeing the cur he instinctively
            reaches for his gun.  but the dog's surrounded by kids.

                                shotgun
                      hey, watcha doing with that dog?

                                bill
                      he yours, sir?

                                shotgun
                      hell no!

                                bill
                      then what do you care?

                                shotgun
                      take my advice.  and shoot that dog.  or
                      let me.

                                bill
                      alright.  yes sir.  anything you say.

            tia, bill and bones the dog pile into the van as pearl and
            her daughter cinnabar, 21, walk by.

            the daughter's as fine now as her mother was then.  pearl
            sees the dog in the van and her head snaps to the gang.

                                pearl
                      don't feed that dog.

                                bill
                      you people really don't like dogs.

                                pearl
                      some holes can't be filled.  some hungers
                      can't be satisfied.

                                maurice
                          (way under his breath)
                      and some people need their medication
                      tweaked.

                                pearl
                      i'm not joking boy.  don't feed it. 
                      it'll only make it hungrier.

            pearl walks a little faster, trying to draw cinnabar away
            from the kids and the dog. 
            but cinnabar lingers a few paces behind her mother and
            catches patrick's eye.  he's stunned, and before he can
            speak, maurice speaks for him.

                                maurice
                      need any help with those bags, ma'am?

                                pearl
                      no thanks.

                                patrick
                      no really, let us help.  we're new in the
                      neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.

                                cinnabar
                      you moved into this block?

                                maurice
                      not really to live, just to play.

                                pearl
                      that building?

                      resurrection brothers play there.  heard

                      best.

                      and you bought the building?

            pearl studies their faces, especially patrick's.

                                pearl (cont'd)
                      you look mighty familiar to me.  you sure
                      you're not from around here?

                                patrick
                      i was born near here.  but after my
                      mother died, my dad moved.  i grew up out
                      in rossmore park.

                                pearl
                      you're pretty black to be growing up in
                      rossmore park.
