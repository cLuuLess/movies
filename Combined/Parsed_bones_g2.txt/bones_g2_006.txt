            ext. around the corner - continuous

            two frat boys, jason and palmer, driving a too nice car in a
            too bad part of town.  palmer at the wheel while jason makes
            a call on the cellular.

                                palmer
                      great.  gun shots.

                                jason
                      just a backfire.

                                palmer
                      like you'd know.  face it.  we're lost.

                                jason
                      take a left, no, i mean a right.  okay,
                      stop for a second.

            they stop in the middle of a block.  jason on the phone.

                                jason (cont'd)
                      we're here.  where the hell are you?

                                stank
                          (on phone)
                      back here.  at the end of the block.

            he turns around and sees behind them, two guys standing on
            the far corner.  one's on the phone.

                                stank (cont'd)
                          (on phone)
                      you got the cash?

                                jason
                      you got the shit?

                                stank
                          (on the phone)
                      yeah, but you got to come the rest of the
                      way on foot.  leave your car and walk
                      over here.
