			int. bathroom - continuous

            the bathroom is entirely wood lined, like some '70's hot tub
            paradise.  the room dominated by a large two person tub.

            tia lights four small scented candles on the counter.  the
            wind through the open window blows the curtains.  she shuts
            the window and then steps gingerly into the steaming bathtub.

            she lies down in the bath, with her back to the door.  the
            four candles throwing varying shadows of her.

            then one of the shadows becomes...the shadow of bones.  all
            it's attention is focused on one lit candle.  the one closest
            to the curtain.

            slowly the bones' shadow's fingers start to caress the
            curtain to make it move, ever so slowly, closer and closer to
            the candle.  the drapery reaches out, straining, straining
            towards the candle flame.

            tia soaks with her eyes closed, enjoying the moist heat.

            bones' shadow fingers more and more urgently drawing the
            flame towards the curtain, the curtain towards the flame. 
            and soon the corner of the drape just reaches the little
            flickering flame.  and in an instant the drape is on fire.
