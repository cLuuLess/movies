            int. kitchen - continuous

            the kids are all sitting around the kitchen, watching tia fix
            some meaty concoction to feed the dog.  the dog stares at her
            expectantly.  jaws dripping in anticipation.

            an older, distinguished looking black man walks in.

                                patrick
                      hey, dad.

            and we see their father is... jeremiah.  though now a
            prosperous banker, twenty years ago he was the man who set
            bones up.  he enters with nancy, his white second wife, tia's
            mother.

                                jeremiah
                      not only do i have to feed the three
                      mouths i got, and that bottomless pit
                      they call maurice, i gotta feed this
                      stray, too?

            at the sound of jeremiah's voice, the dog looks up right at
            him and unleashes a low, rumbling growl.

                                tia
                      shhh, bones.  it's not nice to bite the
                      hand that feeds you.

                                jeremiah
                      what did you call that dog?

                                nancy
                          (moving on)
                      just what are you feeding him?  i didn't
                      know we had dog food.

                                tia
                      we don't.  i used that meat you had in
                      the bowl.

                                nancy
                      tia, that was the prime rib i was
                      marinating for dinner.

            they look at the dog eating enough beef to feed six people.
