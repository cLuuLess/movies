            ext. allway - night

            bones walks the night with a slicing stride.  his legs
            stretching too far and somehow covering long distance in an
            instant.  and in slo-motion, like a nightmare, marionette, a
            walking shadow, or some great black grasshopper.

                                mack's severed head (o.s.)
                          (as if swinging back and forth)
                      bones!  bones, you muthafuckah!  what the
                      hell you done to me?

            bones stops for a moment and looks down at his waist and we
            see mack's severed head tied to bones' belt.  severed, yet
            seemingly alive.

                                bones
                      not half what i'm planning on...

                                mack's severed head
                      this some sick fucked up shit.  what you
                      want with my head?

                                bones
                      just using it to carry your soul.

                                mack's severed head
                      my soul?  fuck you.  look, i killed you. 
                      you killed me.  fine.  now...

            bones got no time to argue.  he bends and picks up a handful
            of fetid city garbage.

                                mack's severed head (cont'd)
                      ...we're even.  no need to get all meta
                      fucking-phys-i-gack...

            and shoves it into the still talking mouth of mack.
