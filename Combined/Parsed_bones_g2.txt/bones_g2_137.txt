            ext. rossmore gate - continuous

            the rent-a-cop hangs up the phone and shakes his head.

                                guard
                      sorry miss.

                                cinnabar
                      can't i call?  and talk to them.

                                guard
                      sure.  but not from here.  nearest public
                      phone would be back a few miles.  outside
                      the mall.

            cinnabar sees it's useless to argue and walks away.  shocked
            and hurt.  back to where her mother stands in the shadows
            outside the gates.

                                pearl
                      told you so.  alright.  we tried.  let's
                      go home.

                                cinnabar
                      mother!  no.

            hear a voice from the other side of the gate.

                                patrick
                      cinnabar?  walk around the north side. 
                      there's an opening there.
