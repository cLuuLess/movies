            just round the corner from the entrance to the gated suburb. 
            cinnabar and pearl.  on foot.

                                pearl
                      we'll have to sneak in.

                                cinnabar
                      no we won't, momma.  i'll just have them
                      call and tell patrick it's us.

                                pearl
                      girl, they build gates like that to keep
                      people like us out.

            cinnabar walks up to the guard at the gate.  he picks up the
            phone to check.
