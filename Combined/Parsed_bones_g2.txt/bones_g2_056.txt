            int. cinnabar's room - continuous

            she enters the room where cinnabar is drawing a still-life
            assignment by a window overlooking the fire-escape.

                                pearl
                      aren't you going to join us?

                                cinnabar
                      i have to finish this for class.

                                pearl
                      you got a vision, girl.  just like i got. 
                      just like my momma had.  and the good
                      lord didn't give you that vision just for
                      painting pretty pictures.  that's just
                      wasted time.

                                cinnabar
                      you mean as opposed to your life?

            she regrets it halfway out her mouth.  and a thousand-fold
            more when she sees the look on her mother's face.

                                cinnabar (cont'd)
                      i'm sorry, momma.  maybe next time.

                                pearl
                      i don't want you meeting around that
                      house.  you stay away from those kids. 
                      and away from that dog.

                                cinnabar
                      they seemed alright.  bring a little life
                      to that old building.

                                pearl
                      nothing but a wide world o' pain locked
                      in there.

                                cinnabar
                      have you ever been inside?

                                pearl
                      maybe once upon a time.  but that was
                      long ago.  back before... before it
                      became what it is.

                                cinnabar
                      and what's that?

                                pearl
                      just a bad place.  and the doorway to
                      worse.

            cinnabar, as far too often, not understanding much of what
            her mother says to her.
