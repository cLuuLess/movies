            ext. street - continuous

            shotgun, pearl and a few others have run out into the street
            to watch the fire.  in the distance, sirens already wail. 
            pearl holds her breath until she sees cinnabar safe.

            looking for an instant, they all see bones as the room is
            engulfed in flames.  see him raise his fists in a rage.  or
            is it in triumph?  before his figure is obscured by falling
            debris.

            sirens wail as fire trucks pull up and the men start
            unrolling a hose.  but freeze at the cocking of the shotgun.

                                shotgun
                      unh-unh.  let it burn.

            the rising flames illuminate the faces of spectators. 
            especially shotgun and pearl, who for the first time in 20
            years, look each other straight in the eyes.

                                shotgun (cont'd)
                      we shoulda done this a long time ago.

                                pearl
                      i don't know.

            her flame-reflecting eyes telling us her fear: this may be a
            huge mistake.
