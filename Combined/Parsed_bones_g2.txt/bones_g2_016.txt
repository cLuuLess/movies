            int. krushed klub - night

            two raging black screaming skulls engulfed in eye-scorching
            fluorescent green fire:

            the decals on the front panel of a gemini executioner, a hi
            tech mixer.  four hands at the controls.  throbbing, shifting
            twisted beats.  we're in a northside dance club:

            pull out to reveal bill, 20, and maurice, aka space cowboy
            and intergalactic gangster of love, 20.  the two boys dj-ing. 
            they're accompanied by the crooning voice and dancing body of
            bill's step-sister tia, 29.  bill's black.  tia's white.  and
            maurice is not of this earth.

            bill's turntablizing: his hands dance between two competition
            style direct drive turntables tilted side by side, playing
            them like an instrument.

            while maurice plays in and around and out of bill's rhythm,
            with his 6 top-loaded computerized cd players, the boys hand
            the beat back and forth and up and down, building
            outrageously, till maurice tips it over the top.

                                maurice
                      goodness gracious grande bolas del fuego!

            the floor is jammed with underground dance scenesters,
            college students and spaced-out shoegazers tripping on
            ketamine, dancing with their invisible friends.

            the bar's surrounded by a sea of hands waving money,
            demanding drinks.  our boys are popular.  and the club is
            making a lot of green tonight.

            see someone checking out all the money, counting heads:
            patrick, 23, bill's older brother.  the money man.
