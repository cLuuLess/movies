            int. master bedroom - continuous

            the dog silently noses the door open and stealthily enters
            and pads softly over to jeremiah's side of the bed.

            where it stares intently at the sleeping jeremiah, who begins
            to toss and turn.  he settles again on his back.  his head
            tilted back, his soft, vulnerable throat exposed.

            the dog steps closer to the bed.  we can almost feel the
            dog's hot fetid breath inches away from his throat.

            the dog stares at jeremiah.  and for just a second the long
            doggy face wavers and changes: in shifting shades of black, a
            ragged red demonic face ripples beneath the black fur -- and
            looks for an instant as if it were about to lunge and rip out
            jeremiah's throat!

            but at the last second it freezes.  head cocks and ear lifts
            as if hearing something in the wind.  its master's voice,
            perhaps.  and then the dog reverts to normal and pads out of
            the room as silently as it entered.
