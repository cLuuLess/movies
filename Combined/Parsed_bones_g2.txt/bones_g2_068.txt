	ext. bones' building - continuous

            cinnabar stops outside the building.  she's about to knock
            when she instinctively freezes.  we can almost see the hairs
            standing up on her neck one by one.

            she looks around -- what is it?  a sound, like a moan.  is it
            her name?  or just the wind.

            suddenly, with a creak, the door swings open.

            she takes a hesitant step into the building.  suddenly she
            jumps, as a door to her left flies open.

            it's just patrick.  she laughs in relief.

                                cinnabar
                      just thought i'd see if you needed any
                      help.

            patrick too surprised and tongue-tied to respond, so tia
            helps him out.

                                tia
                      good.  we do need help.  first you can
                      help us eat lunch.

            cinnabar follows patrick into the room, with a last tense
            look over her shoulder -- still the feeling something's
            there.
