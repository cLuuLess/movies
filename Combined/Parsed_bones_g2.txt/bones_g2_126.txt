            ext. black cat pool club - night

            stank and weaze with eddie mack, who's getting a manicure
            from a coke whore.

                                mack
                      you boys been hitting the pipe?

                                weaze
                      no, eddie.  it's just that, i dunno.  he
                      was tall, and thin, and like a shadow,
                      his face was just a blur.  all i remember
                      is the voice.  it was smooth and low and
                      it didn't seem to be comin' out of his
                      mouth.

                                mack
                      then how'd you hear it, fool?

                                weaze
                      it was just like in my head.

                                mack
                      maybe i oughta open a couple holes in
                      that head and let all them voices out. 
                      you'll feel better, i promise.

                                stank
                      no, eddie, man.  wait.

            but he's not about to shoot him.  he leans over and snorts a
            line of white powder off the mirrored tray.

                                mack
                      i told you not to lie to me.  now what
                      the hell happened?

                                coke whore
                          (needs a hit)
                      what about me, baby?

                                mack
                      shutup, bitch.  now what, he just said to
                      tell you what?  he was back?  who was
                      back?

                                stank
                      bones.

            at the very sound of the name, mack freezes.  then with
            sudden coke-fueled ferocity, he whips around and starts
            smacking the shit out of stank, breaking his nose.  the coke
            whore cheering eddie on.  wanting to see more action.

                                mack
                      bones?  what the fuck is that supposed to
                      mean?  get the fuck out of here.  both of
                      you, 'fore you hear my voice up in yo'
                      head.
