            int. the storm cellar grave - continuous

            the lock broken, the door stands ajar.  and as the dog gorges
            upstairs, something very strange is happening down here.

            flesh is growing on the bones.  bit by bit, red, wet strips
            of muscle and flesh appear and spread over the corpse.

            the shadow looks down at his semi-reconstituted corpse.  it
            almost looks like him, minus the skin.  but it still has a
            long ways to go.  still, mere strips of muscle and flesh on
            the skeleton.
