            they search for the cellar door.  the night air is shattered
            by a scream, at once very close and infinitely far.  finally:

                                bill
                      here!

            he's found a chipped gray storm door.  patrick easily kicks
            in the rotten wood revealing a dark tunnel of stairs leading
            down beneath the ruins of the building into the sub-basement.

                                patrick
                      it's not safe down there.  the fire
                      started down there.  the whole thing
                      could collapse.

                                pearl
                      then your father's a dead man and jimmy
                      bones is gonna be around a long time.

            patrick steps down into the darkness of the cellar, his
            flashlight on.
