			int. pearl's storefront - night

            pearl reaches into an old bureau drawer and pulls out an old
            photo: jimmy bones with his arm around her.  she sits down at
            her table with a drink and just looks at the picture of
            herself and her lover when the world was innocent and young. 
            she downs her glass and wipes her tears away.

            outside - down the block

            in the upper window of the bones building we see his
            silhouette, staring down the block towards pearl.
