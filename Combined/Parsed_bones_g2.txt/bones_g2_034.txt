            int. black cat pool club - continuous

            lupovich makes his entrance and bellies across the club
            towards mack.

                                lupovich
                      not your style.  is it eddie?  killing
                      off your customers?

                                mack
                      i ain't killed nobody.
                          (gives a menacing glance to
                           stank and weaze)
                      shall i rack 'em?  play a game, lupe?

                                lupovich
                      no time for eightball.  i got your tip.

            he tosses a bag of crack rocks on the pool table.

                                lupovich (cont'd)
                      confiscated their whole stash.

            mack hands him a wad of cash.

                                lupovich (cont'd)
                      fair enough for the shit.  but i think a
                      little bonus is due for knocking out the
                      competition.

                                mack
                      you was just doing your job.

                                lupovich
                      last thing you need's for me to start
                      doing my fucking job.

            mack hands him another wad of bills.

                                lupovich (cont'd)
                      that's more like it.  cost of doing
                      business.  maybe you can deduct it on
                      your taxes.
