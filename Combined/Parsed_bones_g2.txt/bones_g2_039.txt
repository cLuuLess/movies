            ext. bones' building - morning

            patrick's on a ladder replacing glass in the upper windows. 
            from down the block, we see cinnabar heading out of her
            mother's house, holding her portfolio.  the corners of papers
            sticking out, splashes of color visible.

            patrick sees cinnabar about to walk beneath his ladder.

                                patrick
                      careful.  that's bad luck.

                                cinnabar
                      that place is already bad luck.

                                patrick
                      why?

                                cinnabar
                      no.  it goes way back.  or so my momma
                      says.

                                patrick
                      what else does she say?

                                cinnabar
                      nothing.  you'd think she was crazy.  and
                      she is a lot of things, not all of them
                      nice, but crazy momma's not.

                                patrick
                      way i figure, everything our parents tell
                      us is part true and part total b.s.  and
                      our whole job is figuring out for
                      ourselves which is which.

                                cinnabar
                      my momma says every house is two houses. 
                      every street, two streets.  there's a
                      whole city, a whole world, kinda beside,
                      on top, just below this one.  the city of
                      the dead.

                                patrick
                      like right now, there's actually like
                      hordes of dead people shambling around
                      us?  fingers rotting off?

                                cinnabar
                      maybe.  but there's an invisible wall, a
                      fabric that kinda keeps things separate.

                                patrick
                      lucky thing.

                                cinnabar
                      yeah.  but when something bad happens,
                      something really bad -- the wall breaks. 
                      the fabric tears.

                                patrick
                      the dead get out?

                                cinnabar
                      or the living fall in.  who knows.

                                patrick
                      and you believe her?

                                cinnabar
                      if i did, i wouldn't come within fifty
                      yards of your door.

            she sees her bus pulling up at the corner and runs for it,
            leaving only her smile with patrick.

            she passes maurice and bill, pulling up.  bill has to pull
            maurice's dog like attention away from the way cinnabar's
            bottom moves as she walks down the street to focus at the
            matter at hand: unloading their shitload of equipment.
