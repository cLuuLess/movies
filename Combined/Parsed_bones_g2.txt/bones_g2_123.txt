            int. jeremiah's study - continuous

            as patrick slams the door behind him, jeremiah hides a stack
            of papers and photos beneath a pile on his desk.

                                patrick
                      did you do it?

                                jeremiah
                      sure, son.  i went down there and torched
                      the place myself.

                                patrick
                      you could have had it done.  you didn't
                      want us there.

                                jeremiah
                      i wouldn't have risked killing you to get
                      you out.  i was trying to protect you.

                                patrick
                      from what?

            jeremiah can't answer.  but patrick's not leaving it alone.

                                patrick (cont'd)
                      why?  why did you give a shit about the
                      building?  why did you care that we were
                      there of all places?

                                jeremiah
                      it's...it's a bad neighborhood.  as you
                      can see now.

                                patrick
                      bullshit, dad.  don't front me.  for
                      once.  just tell me the truth.  i came
                      from there, too.

                                jeremiah
                      you were just a kid.

                                patrick
                      i saw your face.  you knew that place. 
                      you knew those people.

                                jeremiah
                      that's the past.  it's dead.

                                patrick
                      dead?  i don't think your past is dead.  
                          (points to the bandages)
                      it's alive.  and it bites.
