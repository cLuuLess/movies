            ext. bones' building - day

            they've made it out of the inferno.  like dante said "thus we
            emerged again to see the stars."  no stars here, just the
            glorious dawn.

            patrick stops, feels the new sun on his face.  breathes clean
            air again for the first time.

                                patrick
                      we made it...

            then from behind or above or somewhere we can hear what might
            be a low, low chuckle.  jimmy bones' chuckle.

                                bones (o.s.)
                      dog eat dog, boy.  dog eat dog...

            patrick turns and spins in mounting horror.  there, behind
            him, right where cinnabar was standing...

            the black dog.  it leaps right at the camera, filling the
            frame with huge teeth and bloody red tongue.  we freeze.
