            int. bones' building - continuous

            the sound is deafening.  it's the sound of every door in the
            empty house swinging maniacally on its hinges.  beating the
            air like wings.  opening and slamming shut again and again.

            every door except one door.  the padlocked door to the sub
            basement.
