            int. necropolis wall - continuous

            jeremiah's head inside now.  eyes still closed, head bobbing
            in the jelly-like base that holds what he sees when he dares
            to open his eyes.

            hideous malformed faces, genetic anomalies, the kinds of
            faces that wound up in side-shows in less enlightened times. 
            all laughing and leering and glaring at jeremiah.

            full c.u. - lupovich's face and head

            the skin peeling away like congealed jelly.  lupovich tries
            to talk to jeremiah or to scream but nothing comes out. 
            except for a hideous wobbling bubble.

            for a subliminal moment, jeremiah sees a figure trapped
            inside the bubble.  his own figure, silently screaming to get
            out.

            new angle

            suddenly, jeremiah is screaming for real as bones has just
            yanked his head back out of the wall.

                                bones
                      it's a trip, ain't it?

            bones sounding almost sympathetic to jeremiah.  almost.
