            int. jeremiah's house - day

            bill in a kind of shock can only lie in his bedroom, staring
            at the ceiling.

            tia's out in the living room, sitting on the couch weeping in
            her mother's arms.

            patrick's in the bathroom tending the bloody scratches on his
            back and arms.  he's frightened.  and angry.  he storms out
            of the bathroom, down the hall to his father's office.
