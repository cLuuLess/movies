            tia's feeding the insatiable dog.  handing quarter-pounders
            to it, the thing scarfing 'em as fast as she can unwrap them. 
            then, for a second, it stops.  and looks up.  and just stares
            at something it knows is there -- but we humans can't see.

                                tia
                      watcha looking at, poochie?

            cinnabar follows the dog's glance.  she sees nothing...or is
            there something for a second there in the corner?

            is staring back at her, and at the dog.  cinnabar pulls her
            sweater around her shoulders.

                      i hate it when dogs do that.  like
                      they're looking right out of the world.

            the dog continues scarfing down burgers, having him his way. 
            cinnabar looks warily at the beast.  who stares right back at
            her while wolfing down the burgers.

            steps through the rusted metal into the old elevator shaft
            and we follow it as it floats down.
