            int. bones' bedroom - continuous

            bones there in the flesh, with jeremiah on his knees.  bones
            untying the heads from his belt.

                                bones
                      you two bitches were just meat, never had
                      any idea smarter than getting yourself a
                      little more.  but my brother jaybird,
                      here.  he was smart.  he didn't just want
                      more.  he wanted more with compound
                      interest.

            bones shoves the screaming severed heads through the undead
            wall of the necropolis.

            severed heads pov

            for only a flashcut moment, we see the heads see coming at
            them - reaching for them.  laughing at them.  the undead.

                                bones (cont'd)
                      time for him to collect his interest. 
                      jeremiah's gonna have the unique
                      experience of seeing his reward, tasting
                      it while he's still alive.

            bones wraps his long arm around jeremiah's neck in a
            brotherly choke hold.  jeremiah terrified.
