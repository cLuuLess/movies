            int. bones' room - continuous

            cinnabar gets into bed and turns off the light.  pitch dark
            in there, can't see a thing.

            as she's drifting off to dreamland, she hears what sounds
            like the door quietly opening and someone slipping into the
            darkness of the room, we just stay on her face. 

            it's cold in the place.  and spooky.  so she doesn't mind
            when she feels what she assumes is patrick slip in bed beside
            her.  though we see only a shape sliding under the covers.

                                cinnabar
                          (half-asleep)
                      it's okay, just don't get funny on me. 
                      it's warmer this way.
