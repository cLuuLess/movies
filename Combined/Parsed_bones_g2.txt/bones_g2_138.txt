            as they sneak around the other side, a dark figure steps
            right up to the main gates.

            the rent-a-cop wakes up fast when he sees bones standing in
            front of him. 
            after all, how often does he come face to face with
            everything he is there to keep out?  he hitches his belt in
            best john wayne style.

            ...but then he notices the two-severed heads swinging from
            bones' belt.  all three of them smile.
