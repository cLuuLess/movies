            bones is back in the car.  shotgun rolling on down the street
            and round the corner.

            bones sees a young black man leaning into the window of a
            police car.  it's jeremiah peet, bones' right-hand man,
            trying to do business.  and make sure his three year old son
            keeps from running into the street.  the cop in the car
            eating a sloppy sauce-drippin' pork chop sandwich, watches.

                                bones
                      hold up s-g.  give him a toot.

            jeremiah speaking low and rapid to the cop who says nothing,
            just wipes his greasy lips on a handkerchief.

            then shotgun hits the car horn, which plays a james brown
            style trumpet riff.  jeremiah steps over to jimmy's car. 
            jeremiah's son cautiously following.

                                jeremiah
                      'sup jimmy b. shotgun.
                          (to his son)
                      get back on the curb!  now!

                                bones
                      go easy on jay bird.  i can remember when
                      we was his age...

            the boy makes eye contact with bones, who motions he's got a
            dollar for him.  the boy nervously takes it from bones and
            then runs back to the curb under his father's harsh eye.

                                jeremiah
                      it's all arranged for tonight.  eddie
                      mack's gonna be there.  and offisa
                      korruptsky, too.

                                bones
                      they get about twelve and a half minutes. 
                      tops.

                                jeremiah
                      trust me, jimmy, there's big money behind
                      this.  not just big.  big.  like big
                      business big.  big corporation big.  big
                      government big.  our little acre alone'll
                      net hundreds a thousands.  nothing but
                      net.

                                bones
                      nothing but net?  could be a swish.  or a
                      muthafucking air ball.

                                jeremiah
                      one simple word, three little letters. 
                      yes.  that's all it's gonna take and we
                      could move out of this dump, get the real
                      deal.  big houses, legit business...

                                bones
                      that's your dream, homes.  not mine.  i
                      don't want to leave this street.  ever. 
                      the status quo is totally cool with me.

                                pearl
                      maybe i oughtta get there a little early. 
                      for good luck.

                                bones
                      don't need luck tonight.  i'm just
                      letting 'em have their say before i say
                      no.

                                pearl
                          (worried)
                      let me see your hand.

                                bones
                      all that shinin' and "reader and adviser"
                      mess.  that was your mama's bag.  i don't
                      know about the readin' but you both can
                      sure 'nuff advise.

                                pearl
                          (swats his hand)
                      my mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a
                      long line of mamas before her.

                                bones
                      sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.

            she takes his hand in hers.

                                pearl
                      such fine hands.  you shoulda been a
                      musician.  you got the fingers.

            she strokes his hands.

                                pearl (cont'd)
                      left hand's the past.  your right's the
                      present.  and the future.  but it's not
                      written in stone.  it's written in flesh
                      and blood.  and flesh and blood will
                      change.  see?  there's something here, a
                      new line, right across your life line.

                                bones
                      must be my clothes line.  no?  how bout
                      my phone line?

                                pearl
                      no baby.  i'm serious.  cancel that
                      meeting.  i got more fruit that needs
                      checking.  come home with me now.

                                bones
                      don't you worry about a thing.  this
                      hand's gonna be stroking the back of your
                      neck tonight.

            the car pulls away, the little boy waves good-bye...

                                jeremiah
                          (under his breath)
                      'cause you got all the status.  and i got
                      nothing but quo...
