            int. bones' bedroom - continuous

            jeremiah still with bones, looking for a way out.

                                jeremiah
                      what will it take?  what do you want? 
                      just tell me, jimmy!

                                bones
                      aw that's easy.  i want my life back. 
                      can you swing that, my brother?

                                jeremiah
                      you know i can't.

                                bones
                      then fuck it!!!

            in a righteous fury, bones headlocks jeremiah again and rams
            his head through the necropolis wall.

            over jeremiah's shoulder - his pov

            as he's back inside face to face with living dead mutations,
            with lupovich's head coming at him, it's mouth suddenly
            opening to ten times its normal size, swallowing jeremiah
            whole.

            back with bones

            watching with some pity as the rest of jeremiah, his legs and
            feet are pulled into the wall and gone.  accompanied by the
            disappearing screams of the last of jeremiah.

                                bones (cont'd)
                          (sadly)
                      dog eat dog, brother.  dog eat dog.
