            int. jeremiah's kitchen - continuous

            bones the dog slinks into the kitchen.  sniffing the air. 
            still hungry.  always hungry.

            his big black paw actually opens the refrigerator.  with his
            long nose he digs into the meat drawer.  inside he finds
            plastic wrapped raw hamburger meat.

            he pulls it out and drops it on the floor.  tears it open and
            gorges himself on the raw meat.
