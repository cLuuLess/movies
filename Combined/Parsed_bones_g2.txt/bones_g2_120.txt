            ext. back on the street - pre-dawn

            the building is finished, just a blackened shell.  remnants
            of the staircase lead up to fragments of the upper floors. 
            smoke still billowing from the empty center of the ruin.

            silhouetted in the smoke and the low light of the rising sun:
            a tall, dark figure, not of then, nor quite of now.

            it is bones.  taller, thinner, darker and more menacing then
            ever.  but unmistakably bones.  he steps out of the rubble. 
            and looks across the street, up at shotgun's lit window.
