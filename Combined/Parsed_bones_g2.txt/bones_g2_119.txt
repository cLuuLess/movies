            int. pearl's storefront - continuous

            cinnabar, listening to her mother, is told what happened.

                                pearl
                      you got his hands.  beautiful hands.  i
                      didn't even know.  that night.  when they
                      - we - killed him, that you were already
                      alive inside me.  life's like that. 
                      grows right out of death.

                                cinnabar
                      but if it's him.  if he's really come
                      back, won't he know us?  love us?

                                pearl
                      sure, if it was really him.  but it isn't
                      that simple.  jimmy's body died a long
                      time ago.  and his soul is long gone, and
                      all that's left is that ravening, hungry
                      spirit in the blood that soaked into the
                      house itself, i suppose.

                                cinnabar
                      but how do you know?  maybe he just
                      wanted to see us?  and now he's gone
                      again.  and you've all killed my father
                      for the second time.

            cinnabar runs crying out of the room.
