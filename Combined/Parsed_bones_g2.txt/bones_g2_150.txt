			int. bones' bedroom - continuous

            bones has jeremiah on his feet now, leading him towards the
            wall of the undead.

            suddenly, hands shoot out of the wall, only inches away from
            jeremiah's face!  he twists and turns to stay away from them,
            but the long nails on one of the hands claw at his cheek. 
            while hungry mouths open from the palms of hands.

                                bones
                          (keeping jeremiah out from
                           hands' reach)
                      i don't understand it.  you were my man. 
                      since we was grasshoppas.  i always
                      looked after you.  you had a piece of
                      everything i had.

                                jeremiah
                      i didn't want a piece of yours, i wanted
                      my own.

                                bones
                      and the hell everybody else, right?

            bones pushing jeremiah's face towards the grasping hands.

                                jeremiah
                      wait, jimmy.  think about it.  you woulda
                      done the same thing if you was me.

                                bones
                      no brother.  i wouldn'ta.  i never done a
                      man - any man.  let alone a brother like
                      that.  course, as you can see, no good
                      deed goes unfucked.  now the question is,
                      if the good get fucked, what we got saved
                      up for the bad?  you about to find out.

            bones rams jeremiah's head (his eyes closed in fear) through
            the necropolis wall.
