	int. same scene - later that day

	the store is jam-packed.  joe with his father nelson, his
	grandfather schuyler, and kevin, the store manager.

			     joe
		no pickets, no demonstrations.

			     kevin
		the neighborhood loves us.

			     nelson
		they're wondering where we've been all
		these years.  they're wondering how they
		ever did without it.

			     schuyler
		it's a hit.

	they admire their own store, walk through the downstairs and
	start up the staircase to the second floor.

			     nelson
		how's the children's book department?

			     joe
		it's early yet.  school isn't out.  and
		there's that children's bookstore nearby
		--

			     schuyler
		cecilia's store --

			     joe
		her daughter's --

			     nelson
		we'll crush it --

			     schuyler
		she was enchanting.

	and as they walk on upstairs, several mothers with children
	come up the stairs behind them.
