		soon we'll just be a memory.  in fact,
		someone, some foolish person will
		probably think it's a tribute to this
		city, the way it keeps changing on you,
		the way you can never count on it, or
		something.  i know, because that's the

		part of me has died,  and my mother has
		died all over again, and no one can ever
		make it right.
