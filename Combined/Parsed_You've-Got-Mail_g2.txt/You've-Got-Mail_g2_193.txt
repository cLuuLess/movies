	ext. columbus avenue - day

	as they walk uptown, eating their hot dogs and drinking
	papaya drinks.

			     joe
		he could be the zipper man.

			     kathleen
		who's that?

			     joe
		this guy on amsterdam who repairs
		zippers.  you'll never have to buy new
		luggage.

			     kathleen
		stop teasing.

			     joe
		timing is everything.  he waited until
		you were primed.  until you knew there
		was no other man you could ever love.

			     kathleen
			(almost believe it)
		yes.

			     joe
		sometimes i wonder...

			     kathleen
		what?

	they stop walking, they look at each other.

			     joe
		if i hadn't been foxbooks and you hadn't
		been the shop around the corner and we'd
		just met --

			     kathleen
		don't.

			     joe
		i would have asked for your phone number
		and i wouldn't have been able to wait 24
		hours before calling and asking, "how
		about coffee, drinks, dinner, a movie,
		for as long as we both shall live?"

			     kathleen
			(almost a swoon)
		joe...

			     joe
		and then we would never have been at war.

			     kathleen
		no.

			     joe
		the only fight we'd ever have is what
		video to rent on saturday night.

			     kathleen
		who fights about that?

			     joe
		some people.  not us.

			     kathleen
		we would never.

	a long beat.

			     joe
		if only...

			     kathleen
		please.  i have to go.

	she doesn't move.

			     joe
		let me ask you something?  how come
		you'll forgive him for standing you
		up and you won't forgive me for a 
		little tiny thing like putting you
		out of business?

	kathleen looks at him.  shakes her head.

	they look at each other.

			     joe
		oh how i wish you would.

	it's all kathleen can do not to forgive him.

	it's all joe can do not to kiss her.

			     kathleen
		i really do have to go.

			     joe
		you don't want to be late.

	she's in agony.

	he turns and walks away.

	after a moment, she does too.
