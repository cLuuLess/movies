	int. kathleen's store - later

	matt is sitting on the floor reading a book.  kathleen is 
	showing annabel a copy of a book called betsy-tacy.

				kathleen
		this is her best friend tacy, whose real
		name is anastasia, and then in the next
		book betsy and tacy become friends with
		tib, whose real name, i am sorry to tell
		you, is thelma.

	in another section of the store:

	george is showing joe a first edition of swiss family
	robinson from the glass case.

				george
		the illustrations are hand-tipped,
		which is why --

				joe
		it costs so much.

				george
		it's why it's worth so much.

	joe smiles and turns to see kathleen and annabel at a whole
	shelf of betsy-tacy books.

				annabel
		i want all of them.

				kathleen
		that might be an awful lot for your dad
		to buy at one time.

				annabel
		my dad gets me all the books i want.

				kathleen
			(looking over at joe)
		well, that's very nice of him.

				annabel
		that's not my dad.  that's my nephew --

				kathleen
		oh, i don't really think that's your
		nephew --

	as joe approaches.

				joe
		it's true.  annabel is my aunt.  aren't
		you, aunt annabel?

	annabel nods solemnly.

				annabel
		and matt is --

				kathleen
		let me guess.
			(to matt)
		are you his uncle?

				matt
		no.

				kathleen
		his grandfather?

	annabel and matt start giggling.

				kathleen (cont'd)
		his great-grandfather?

				matt
			(shouting with glee)
		i'm his brother.

				joe
		annabel is my grandfather's daughter.
		and matt is my father's son.  we are an
		american family.

	he smiles at kathleen, who finds herself smiling back.

	annabel suddenly sneezes.

	kathleen takes a handkerchief from her sleeve.  it's an old
	fashioned hankie that's embroidered.  she offers it to
	annabel, who instead wipes her nose with her hand and then
	looks at the handkerchief, a little puzzled.

				annabel
		what is that?

				kathleen
		a handkerchief.  oh my, do children not
		even know what handkerchiefs are?  a
		handkerchief is a kleenex you don't throw
		away.  my mother embroidered it for me --
		you see?  my initials and a daisy, 
		because daisies are my favorite flower.

				annabel
		orchids are my favorite flower.

				kathleen
			(to joe)
		you know what else children don't know?
		they don't know what a telephone booth
		is?

	joe is looking at kathleen.

				joe
		who are you?

				kathleen
		kathleen kelly.  i own this store.
		are you are?

				joe
		joe.  just call me joe.
			(quickly)
		we'll take these books.

	he gets the one matt is reading.  and the two other kathleen
	has gotten for annabel.

				kathleen
		these are wonderful books.  as annabel
		gets older the characters in the books do,
		too.
			(to annabel)
		you can grow up with betsy.

				george
		you're going to come back again, aren't
		you?

				joe
		of course.

				george
		this is why we're never going to go
		under.  our customers are loyal.

				kathleen
			(by way of explanation)
		they're opening a foxbooks around the
		corner.

				annabel
		foxbooks!  my daddy --

				joe
			(gently putting his hand over
			 her mouth)
		-- likes to buy at discount.  don't tell
		anyone that, annabel, it's nothing to be
		proud of --

				matt
			(spelling)
		f-o-x.

				kathleen
		that's amazing.  you can spell fox.  can
		you spell dog?

				matt
		f-o-x.

			     joe
		matt, look at this dinosaur book.
		wouldn't you like a dinosaur book?
		annabel, maybe you could read this to
		matt while i wrap things up here.
			(moves them to a corner, to
			 them quickly)
		sit down, read, and don't listen to
		anything i say.

	returns to counter and gives kathleen some cash.

			     joe
		and the dinosaur book too.

			     kathleen
		the world is not driven by discounts,
		believe me.  i've been in business
		forever.  i started helping my mother
		here after school when i was six years
		old.  i used to watch her, and it wasn't
		that she was selling books, it was that
		she was helping people become whoever
		they were going to turn out to be.  when
		you read a book as a child it becomes
		part of your identity in a way that no
		other reading in your life does.
			(stops herself)
		i guess i've gotten carried away.

			     joe
		you have, and you've made me feel...

	he can't finish the sentence.  he looks at her and sees,
	behind her on the shelf, a picture of a woman who is
	unmistakably kathleen's mother, with a young kathleen.

			     joe (cont'd)
		enchanting, your mother was enchanting.

			     kathleen
		she was.  how did you know that?

			     joe
		lucky guess.

			     kathleen
		anyway.  she left the store to me, and
		i'm going to leave it to my daughter.

			     joe
		how old is your daughter now?

			     kathleen
		oh, i'm not married.  but eventually.

	she smiles at joe...

			     kathleen
		so foxbooks can...

			     kathleen and george together
		go to hell.

			     kathleen
			(handing him his books)
		here you go.

			     joe
		we ready?

	annabel and matt join him at the counter.  kathleen gives them
	each a lollipop.

			     annabel
		bye, kathleen.

			     kathleen
		goodbye, annabel.  bye, matt.  what
		about cat?  can you spell cat?

			     matt
		f-o-x.
