	ext. rockefeller center skating rink - day

	we see a little boy, young joe, 8, skate past holding someone's
	hand --

			     joe (v.o., cont'd)
		-- although my mother did not skate.  the
		nanny skated --

	and we now see joe's nanny, a young sonja henie, who suddenly
	peels off into a series of triple lutzes, as joe's mother
	absently reads a copy of vogue in the spectators' section.
