	int. kathleen's apartment - dusk

	kathleen in the kitchen, unloading groceries.  frank is
	standing there, plugging in an olympia report deluxe electric
	typewriter.

				frank
		when you are finished with foxbooks, the
		shop around the corner is going to be
		responsible for reversing the entire
		course of the industrial revolution.

				kathleen
		that is so sweet, frank.  thank you.
		that is so sweet.

				frank
		hey --

	he holds his arms out.  they hug.

				kathleen
		although...

				frank
		what?

				kathleen
			(over his shoulder, she notices
			 the typewriter, breaks from
			 the hug)
		what is that doing there?

				frank
		listen to it.  just listen--

	he strikes a key.  practically swoons.

				frank
		the olympia report deluxe electric
		report.  as in gunshot.

				kathleen
		that sound is familiar.

				frank
		now listen to this.

	he puts his ear to the typewriter.

	kathleen listens too.

				kathleen
		that whirring?

				frank
		the gentle and soothing lullaby of a
		piece of machinery so perfect --

				kathleen
		i know where i've heard it before.  i
		know.

	she whips a cover off the other typewriter on the table.
	it's the same machine exactly.

				frank
		i needed a backup.

				kathleen
		don't you have another one at your
		apartment?

				frank
		i might, i might.  so what?

				kathleen
		you're turning my apartment into a
		typewriter museum.

				frank
		i'll stop.  i'll try.  i probably can't.
		i see one and my knees go weak.  anyway,
		what were you starting to say?

				kathleen
		when?

				frank
		before.

				kathleen
		nothing.

				frank
		come on.

				kathleen
		i don't know.  i was just wondering about
		my work and all.  i mean, what is it i do
		exactly?  all i really do is run a 
		bookstore --

				frank
		all you really do is this incredibly
		noble thing --

	kathleen nods.

				kathleen
		but i don't know if i --

				frank
			(stopping her)
		kathleen --

				kathleen
		but i just --

				frank
		you are a lone reed.

	kathleen looks puzzled.

	he sticks a piece of paper in the typewriter, starts typing.

				frank
		you are a lone reed waving in the 
		breeze standing strong and tall in 
		the corrupt sands of commerce.

	he whips the piece of paper out of the typewriter and hands
	it to her.

				kathleen
			(reading from it)
		i am a lone reed.
			(tries it on again)
		i am a lone reed.

	clutching her piece of paper, she wanders into the bathroom.
