	int. computer screen - day

	we see a list of letters:

	big cash op: you can make $$$ in your spare time.  oil mkt: you
	can turn $20 into $20,000 this really works u can do it: 
	maximize your selling ability nowwwww!!!  ny152 brinkley

	kathleen hits the "delete" key and the first three letters --
	all of them junk-mail -- are deleted and drop offscreen.

	then she selects the "read mail" key for "ny 152 brinkley".

	and the letter comes up:
		   to: shopgirl
		from: ny152
		   re: brinkley

	kathleen starts to read the letter aloud:

				kathleen
		brinkley is my dog.  he loves the streets
		of new york as much as i do --

	and now we hear kathleen's voice replaced by the voice of
	ny 152, a man named joe fox --

				joe (v.o.)
		-- although he likes to eat bits of pizza
		and bagel off the sidewalk, and i prefer
		to buy them.  brinkley is a great catcher
		and was offered a tryout on the mets farm
		team --
