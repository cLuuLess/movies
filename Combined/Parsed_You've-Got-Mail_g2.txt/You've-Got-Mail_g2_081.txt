	int. shop around the corner - dusk

	we see kathleen and george at the end of the day, counting
	the receipts.  birdie is using a calculator to total them.
	christina is shelving books.  there are thanksgiving
	decorations -- cardboard turkeys and pilgrims, books on
	colonists like myles standish.

			     kathleen (v.o., cont'd)
		... and thrilling about this island in
		cyberspace i have with you.  so please
		don't ask me again.

			     birdie
		about $1200 less than the same week last
		year.

			     kathleen
		that could be a fluke, right?

	they look at each other.

			     birdie
		or not.

			     kathleen
		their store is new.  it's a novelty.  but
		it will all shake out.  do you think i
		should put up more twinkle lights?

			     birdie
		that's a lovely idea.

			     christina
		what if we have to fold?  i'll never find
		another part time job and i won't be able
		to pay the rent and i'll have to move to
		brooklyn.

			     george
		the joy of rent control.  six room for
		$450 a month.

			     christina
		we know.  you've told us a million times.
		i can't believe you're bringing it up at
		a time like this.  it's like bragging
		because you're tall.  birdie never brags
		about her rent and she pays even less
		than you.

			     birdie
		ten rooms.  i just rattle around from one
		to the other.

			     kathleen
		hey, guys.  we are not going to fold.

	the door opens, and meredith carter, the woman george had
	swooned over in front of his building, walks in.

	george stares, frozen in place, as she walks up to him.

			     meredith
		george pappas?

			     george
			(i have died and gone to
			 heaven)
		yes.

			     meredith
			(flashing her badge)
		detective carter, 23rd precinct.  i'd
		like to ask you a few questions.

	kathleen suddenly sees george, following meredith out of the
	store.  he's in a complete daze.

			     kathleen
		george?  where are you going?

	he goes out the door.

	laura margulies, a well-known children's book author, enters
	as george leaves.

			     laura
		kathleen, are you surviving?

			     kathleen
		laura!  we're so excited about your new
		book.  when should we schedule your
		signing?

			     laura
		oh, it's being published in january.
		are you going to be in business in
		january?  i'm so worried.

			     kathleen
		we're doing great, aren't we?

			     christina
		great.

			     birdie
		no difference whatsoever.

			     laura
		thank god.  well, you know you can count
		on me.  for anything, support, rallies.
		picket lines.  we can get the times to
		write something.  or that nut in the
		independent --

			     kathleen
		what nut in the independent?

			     laura
		frank navasky.  this is just the sort of
		thing that would outrage him.

	she smiles brightly.
