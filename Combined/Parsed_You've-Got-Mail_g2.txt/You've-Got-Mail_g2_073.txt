	int. kathleen's bedroom - day

	as kathleen reads the end of joe's letter.

	kathleen hits the reply key and starts to type:

			     kathleen (v.o.)
		i know what you mean and i'm completely
		jealous.  what happens to me when i'm
		provoked is that i get tongue-tied.  my
		mind goes blank.  then i spend all night
		tossing and turning trying to think of
		what i should have said.
