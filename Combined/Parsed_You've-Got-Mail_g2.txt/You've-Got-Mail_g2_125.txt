		wait a minute.  there's a book with a
		flower, so it must be her.

			     joe
		what does he look like?

			     kevin
		there's a waiter blocking, i can't see
		her face.  he's serving her a cup of tea
		and she's putting in three spoonfuls of
		sugar --

			     joe
		well, why shouldn't she?

			     kevin
		no reason.  unless she has hypoglycemia.
		oh, he's moving.

			     joe
		can you see her?

			     kevin
		yes.

			     joe

			     kevin
			(clearly frustrated)
		she's very pretty.

			     joe
		she is.  i knew she would be.  she had
		to be.

			     kevin
		she looks... i would say she has a little
		of the coloring of that kathleen kelly
		person.

			     joe
		kathleen kelly of the bookstore.

			     kevin
		why not?  you said you thought she was
		attractive.

			     joe
		so what?  who cares about kathleen kelly?

			     kevin
		well, if you don't like kathleen kelly,
		i can tell you right now you ain't gonna
		like this girl.

			     joe
		why not?

			     kevin
		because it is kathleen kelly.

	joe elbows kevin aside and looks.

			     joe
		oh, god.

	a long beat.

			     kevin
		what are you going to do?

			     joe
		nothing.

			     kevin
		you're going to let her just wait there?

			     joe
		yes.  yes i am.  that's exactly what i'm
		going to do.  why not?

			     kevin
		but she wrote the letters.

			     joe
		good night, kevin.  i'll see you
		tomorrow.

	kevin stares after him.  then he walks away in the other
	direction.
