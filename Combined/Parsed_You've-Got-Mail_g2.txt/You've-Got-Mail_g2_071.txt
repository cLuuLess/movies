	int. joe's den - night

	joe writes on his computer.  brinkley on the floor next to him.

	and cut between joe and his computer screen.

			     joe (v.o.)
		do you ever feel you become the worst
		version of yourself?  that a pandora's
		box of all the secret hateful parts --
		your arrogance, your spite, your
		condescension -- has sprung open.
		someone provokes you, and instead of 
		just smiling and moving on, you zing 
		them.  hello, it's mr. nasty.  i'm sure 
		you have no idea what i'm talking about.
