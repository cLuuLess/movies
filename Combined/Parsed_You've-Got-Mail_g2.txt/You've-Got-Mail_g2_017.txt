		up garbage?  you think i go up and down
		the street picking up garbage, i'm not
		going to pick up yours?  what's the

	kathleen is standing there, tongue-tied.
	
				garbageman #1
		you don't even bundle it right, you're
		supposed to bundle it and leave it near
		the curb, you leave it near the store
		and you use cheap garbage bags, they

		to pick it up with my shovel --
