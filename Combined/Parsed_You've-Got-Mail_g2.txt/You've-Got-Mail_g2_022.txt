	int. construction site - day

	workers, electricians, masons, carpenters, etc. in the 
	process of building what looks like a large store.  wires
	hanging everywhere.

		the electrical contractor called.  his
		truck hit a deer last night, he won't be
		in 'til tomorrow.  the shelves are late
		because the shipment of pine had beetles.
		and there's some question about whether
		we're installing the stairs in the right
		spot --

				joe
		that sounds great.

				kevin
		testing one two three four.

				joe
		is the electrician here?

				kevin
		i just told you -- he hit a deer.

				joe
		i hear nothing.  not a sound on the city
		streets, just the beat of my own heart.
		i think that's the way it goes.
		something like that.

				kevin
			(beginning to glean something)
		did you and patricia get engaged?

				joe
		engaged?  are you crazy?

				kevin
		i thought you liked patricia --

				joe
		i love patricia.  patricia's amazing.
		patricia makes coffee nervous.
			(suddenly all business)
		are we still on schedule?

				kevin
		we open two weeks before thanksgiving.

				joe
		i guess we should announce ourselves
		soon.  tell people we're coming.

				kevin
		this is the upper west side of manhattan.
		the minute they hear they'll be lining up
		--

				joe
		-- to picket --

				kevin
		-- the big bad --

				joe
		--chain store --

				kevin
		-- that destroys --

				joe
		-- everything we hold dear.  but we'll
		seduce them with our square footage and
		our deep armchairs and our amazingly
		swift checkout lines and our discounts
		and our...

				joe & kevin
			(the trump card)
		-- cappuccino.

				joe
		they hate us in the beginning, but we 
		get them in the end.  meanwhile we 
		should just put up a sign -- coming soon, 
		a foxbooks superstore and the end of
		western civilization as we know it.
