	int. joe's apartment - later

	the e-mail from kathleen continues as joe reads.

			     kathleen (v.o.)
		i was cruel, and i'm never cruel.  and
		even though i can hardly believe what i
		said mattered to this man -- to him, i'm
		just a bug to be crushed -- but what if
		it did?  no matter what he's done to me,
		there's no excuse for my behavior.
		anyway, you are my dear friend, and i so
		wanted to talk to you.  i hope you have a
		good reason for not being there last
		night, but if you don't, and if we never
		really connect again, i just want to tell
		you how much it has meant to me to know
		you were there.

	joe sits there a second.  a moment of intense ambivalence.
	then he hits the menu key and signs off.

			     computer
		goodbye.

	joe stands and leaves the room.

	the computer sits there.

	hold on the computer.  we hear him open the refrigerator 
	door. we hear him close the refrigerator door.  he passes
	the den without even looking into it.  a moment later he
	comes back into the room, stares at the computer.  he starts
	for the bedroom, changes his mind.  circles the computer.
	he's going to go cold turkey if it kills him.

	fuck it.  he sits down.  sign on.  starts to type.

			     joe (v.o.)
		i am in vancouver.

	he stops... hits the delete button and erases the message.
	he starts typing again:

			     joe (v.o.)
		i was stuck in a meeting, which i
		couldn't get out of it, and there was
		no phone.

	he backspaces to erase "there was no phone."

	screen now reads: i was stuck in a meeting, which i couldn't
	get out of it.  joe sits there thinking for a moment.  then he
	starts typing.

			     joe (v.o., cont'd)
		the electricity went out in the building
		and we were trapped on the 18th floor and
		the telephone system blew too.

	he stops and looks at it.  then he types:

			     joe (v.o., cont'd)
		amazingly enough.

	he sits looking at it.

	then he deletes the whole thing.

	sits looking at the blank screen.

			     joe
		fuck you.

	he clicks the yes box.

	then he starts to type again.

			     joe (v.o.)
		dear friend: i cannot tell you what
		happened to me last night, but i beg you
		from the bottom of my heart to forgive me
		for not being there.

	he deletes "for not being there."

	then types again, after "to forgive me".

			     joe (v.o.)
		-- for what happened.  i feel terrible
		that you found yourself in a situation
		that caused you additional pain.  but i'm
		absolutely sure that whatever you said
		last night was provoked, even deserved.
		and everyone says things they regret when
		they're worried or stressed.  you were
		expecting to see someone you trusted and
		met the enemy instead.  the fault is
		mine.
