	int. kathleen's apartment - continuous

			     kathleen
			(into intercom)
		-- and vitamin c, so i would really
		appreciate it if you would come some
		other time --

	there's a knock on the door right next to her.  kathleen
	practically jumps out of her skin.  she looks through the
	peephole.  there he is.

			     joe
		kathleen?

			     kathleen
		just a second.

	she puts on a robe, runs frantically about picking up various
	scattered wadded-up kleenexs, opens the front door.  joe is
	holding a bunch of flowers wrapped in paper.

			     joe
		hello.

			     kathleen
		what are you doing here?

			     joe
		i heard you were sick and i was worried
		and i wanted to --
			(he hears voices)
		is someone here?

			     kathleen
		just the home shopping network.

			     joe
		bought any porcelain dolls?

			     kathleen
		i was thinking about it.
			(beat)
		you put me out of business --

			     joe
		i know that --

			     kathleen
		and now you turn up with flowers?  did
		you come to gloat?

			     joe
		no.

			     kathleen
		to offer me a job --

			     joe
		no, i wouldn't think of --

			     kathleen
		because i have plans, i have lots of
		offers.  i've been offered a job by --
		well, actually by --

			     joe
		my former?

			     kathleen
		former?

			     joe
		we broke up.

			     kathleen
		that's too bad.  you seemed so perfect
		for each other.
			(she claps her hand over her
			 mouth)
		i don't mean to say things like that.  no
		matter what you have done to me, there is
		no excuse for my saying anything like
		that.  but every time i see you --

			     joe
		things like that just seem to fly out of
		your mouth.

			     kathleen
		yes.  i'm sorry.  i'm starting over.
			(sharply)
		thank you for coming.  goodbye.
			(she says it again, a little
			 more nicely)
		thank you for coming. goodbye.

	she starts to the door.

			     joe
		i bought you flowers.

			     kathleen
		oh.
			(trying as hard as she can)
		thank you.

	she takes them.

	he takes them back.

			     joe
		why don't i put them in water?

	he heads for the kitchen.  a beat, while she stares after him.
	then follows.
