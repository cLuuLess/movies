		what if she has a really high, squeaky
		voice?  i hate that.  it reminds me of
		those mice in cinderella.

			     kevin
		what mice in cinderella?

			     joe
		gus-gus and oh shit, i can't remember the
		other one.  why am i compelled to meet
		her?  i'm just ruining a good thing.

			     kevin
		you're taking it to the next level.  i
		always do that.  i always take a
		relationship to the next level, and if it
		works okay i take it to the next level
		after that, until i can finally get to
		the level where it becomes absolutely
		necessary for me to leave.

			     joe
		i'm not going to stay long anyway.  i
		already said that, didn't i.  christ.
		i'm a total wreck.
