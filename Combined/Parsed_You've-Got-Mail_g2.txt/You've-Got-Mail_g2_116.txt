	int. shop around the corner - dusk

	george is talking to kathleen and birdie, who is toting up
	the week's receipts.

			     george
		and i can't decide whether to put
		sausages into the meat sauce or just
		chopped meat.  last time i made it,
		detective carter and i never even sat
		down to dinner because --
			(he makes some sort of hand
			 gesture indicating that sex
			 prevented them from dining)
		and last night, i made margaritas in the
		blender, and i took the ice cube and --

			     birdie
		spare us.

	george goes out the door.

	birdie looks at kathleen.

			     kathleen
		don't tell me.  not the slightest
		difference?

	birdie can't bring herself to answer.

			     kathleen (cont'd)
		how could that be?  all this publicity
		and not one bit of difference?
		oh birdie, what am i going to do?  what
		would mom have done?

			     birdie
		let's ask her.

	she opens the locket hanging around her neck.  there's a
	picture of kathleen's mother inside it.  birdie holds the
	locket up to her face.

			     birdie
		cecilia, what should we do?

	birdie holds the locket to her ear and listens.  a pause.

			     kathleen
		birdie?

			     birdie
		shhhh.
			(after a beat, shrugs)
		she has no idea, but she thinks the
		window display is lovely.  good night
		dearie.

	birdie smiles and picks up her shopping bag, goes out the
	door.
