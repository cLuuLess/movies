	int. birdie's apartment - day

	a large rent-controlled west side apartment.  birdie is 
	pouring tea.  there's a plate of cookies.

	christina is looking at the picture of birdie as a young
	woman, dressed in a sort of carmen miranda getup.

			     christina
		where was this taken, birdie?

			     birdie
		seville.

			     kathleen
		when you had the thunderbolt?

			     birdie
		yes.  what did you decide, dearie?

			     kathleen
		close.  we're going to close.

			     christina
		close.

			     kathleen
		although it feels like such a failure.
		it feels like i'm quitting.  it feels
		like... mom...

	she closes her eyes.

	birdie sits down on the loveseat next to kathleen, puts her
	arms around her.  hold on them.

			     birdie
		keeping the store open doesn't keep your
		mother alive, although sometimes i think
		we all think it does.

	christina looks over at the picture of birdie.

			     christina
		who was it, birdie?  that you had the
		thunderbolt over?

	birdie shakes her head.  she's not going to tell them.

			     christina (cont'd)
		it's so romantic.

			     birdie
		but it wasn't meant to be.

			     christina
		why not?

			     birdie
		he ran spain.

			     christina
		spain?

			     birdie
		the country.  he ran it.  that was his
		job.  and then he died.  just as well.
