	int. cafe lalo - continuous

	kathleen, sitting alone, at a table for two, is drinking her
	tea.  she's starting to feel a little foolish.  she checks
	her watch.

	a loud, boisterous group comes in and sits at the table next
	to hers.  they're laughing.  a man from the group grabs the
	empty chair at kathleen's table.

			     man
		do you mind?

	kathleen jumps up.

			     kathleen
		oh, yes.  i'm expecting someone.
		please.

	she takes the chair back.  sits down again.  she watches the
	group as they playfully fight over the menus.

	she checks her watch again.  then she opens her copy of pride
	and prejudice and looks at it.  she can't focus.

	a man comes into the restaurant and she looks up hopefully at
	him.  but he's going to meet another group of people.

	as he passes her table, he knocks the book and the flower
	onto the floor.

			     kathleen
		oh!

	she jumps up and rescues the book and flower as if they were
	precious china.

	in the window, now, behind her, joe appears.  he watches, as
	she rearranges the book and the flower.

	he disappears from sight.

	a beat...

	he walks in the door.

			     joe
		kathleen kelly.  hello.  what a
		coincidence.  mind if i sit down?

			     kathleen
		yes i do.  i'm expecting someone.

	joe picks up her book, looks at it.

			     joe
		pride and prejudice.

	kathleen grabs it back.

			     kathleen
		do you mind?

	she places it back on the table, puts the rose into it.

			     joe
		i didn't know you were a jane austen
		fan.  not that it's a surprise.  i bet
		you read it every year.  i bet you just
		love mr. darcy, and that your sentimental
		heart beats wildly at the thought that he
		and whatever her name is are really,
		honestly and truly going to end up
		together.

			     kathleen
		would you please leave?

	joe sits down.

			     kathleen
		please?

			     joe
		i'll get up as soon as your friend comes.
		is he late?

			     kathleen
		the heroine of pride and prejudice is
		elizabeth bennet and she's one of the
		greatest, most complex characters ever
		written, not that you would know.

			     joe
		as a matter of fact i've read it.

			     kathleen
		well, good for you.

			     joe
		i think you'd discover a lot of things if
		you really knew me.

			     kathleen
		if i really knew you, i know what i would
		find -- instead of a brain, a cash
		register, instead of a heart, a bottom
		line.

	kathleen is shocked at herself.

			     joe
		what is it?

			     kathleen
		i just had a breakthrough, and i have to
		thank you for it.  for the first time in
		my life, when confronted with a horrible,
		insensitive person i actually knew what i
		wanted to say and i said it.

			     joe
		i think you have a gift for it.  it was a
		splendid mixture of poetry and meanness.


			     kathleen
		meanness?  let me tell you --

			     joe
		don't misunderstand me, i'm just paying
		you a compliment.

	he lifts the book off the table.  kathleen grabs for it.

			     kathleen
		why are you doing this?

	she manages to get the book, leaving joe with the rose.

			     joe
		what have we have?  a red, no, crimson
		rose, tucked into the pages.  something
		you read about in a book, no doubt.  one
		of those books with a lady in a nightgown
		on the cover about to throw herself off a
		cliff.

	she holds her hand out for it.

			     kathleen (cont'd)
		give it to me.

	joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache.

			     joe
		it's a joke to you, isn't it?
		everything's a joke to you.

	she grabs the rose.  puts it back in the book.

			     kathleen (cont'd)
		please leave.  i beg you.

	he stands up, walks from the table, sits down at the very
	next table, with his back to her.

	the door to the restaurant opens.  kathleen looks at it
	hopefully.  a pleasant looking man, who's immediately joined
	by a pleasant looking woman.

	for a moment, kathleen looks just a little droopy, as if the
	wind has just gone out of her sails.  she takes out her
	compact, looks into her mirror.  she slides it over to look
	behind her, at him, just as he's looking sideways at her.  he
	turns away suddenly.

	then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief.

			     joe
		you know what the handkerchief reminds
		me of?  the first day i met you --

			     kathleen
		the first day you lied to me --

			     joe
		i didn't lie to you --

			     kathleen
		you did too --

			     joe
		i did not --

			     kathleen
		i thought all that fox stuff was so
		charming.  f-o-x.

			     joe
		i never lied about it --

			     kathleen
		"joe.  just call me joe."  as if you were
		one of those stupid 22-year-old girls
		with no last name.  "hi, i'm kimberley."
		"hi, i'm janice."  what's wrong with
		them?  don't they know you're supposed to
		have last names?  it's like they're a
		whole generation of cocktail waitresses.

	she stops herself -- it's a tangent she never meant to go off
	on.  but joe has stood up and seated himself back at her
	table.

			     joe
		i am not a stupid 22-year-old girl --

			     kathleen
		that's not what i meant --

			     joe
		and when i said the thing about the price
		club and cans of olive oil, that wasn't
		what i meant either --

			     kathleen
		oh, you poor sad multimillionaire.  i
		feel so sorry for you.

	the door opens and a large and very attractive transvestite
	in a boa comes in the door.

			     joe
		i am going to take a wild guess that this
		isn't him, either.  who is he, i wonder.
		not, i gather, the world's greatest
		living expert on julius and ethel
		rosenberg, but someone else entirely.
		will you be you be mean to him too?  will
		you start out sweet as sugar candy and
		then suddenly, miraculously, like a bolt
		from the blue, find that sharp little 
		tongue of yours?

			     kathleen
		no, i won't.  because the man who's
		coming here tonight is completely unlike
		you.  the man who is coming here is kind
		and funny -- he has the most wonderful
		sense of humor --

			     joe
		but he's not here.

			     kathleen
		if he's not here, he has a reason,
		because there is not a cruel or careless
		bone in his body.  i can't expect you to
		know anything about a person like that.
		you've nothing but a suit.

	a beat.  joe gets up.

			     joe
		that is my cue.  good night.

	joe leaves.
