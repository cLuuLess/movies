	int. kathleen kelly's apartment - day

	kathleen kelly is asleep.  kathleen, 30, is as pretty and
	fresh as a spring day.  her bedroom cozy, has a queen-sized
	bed and a desk with a computer on it.  bookshelves line every
	inch of wall space and overflow with books.  framed on the
	children's classic.  madeleine.

	as kathleen wakes up, her boyfriend frank navasky walks into
	the room.  he wears blue jeans and a workshirt.  he's carrying
	the new york times.

				kathleen
		good morning.

				frank
			(as he reads)
		listen to this -- the entire work force
		of the state of virginia had to have
		solitaire removed from their computers --

	kathleen gets out of bed and goes to brush her teeth in the
	bathroom, and we stay with frank.

				frank
			(continuing)
		-- because they hadn't done any work in
		six weeks.

	kathleen comes out of the bathroom in her robe.

				kathleen
		aren't you late?

				frank
			(continuing)
		you know what this is, you know what
		we're seeing here?  we're seeing the end
		of western civilization as we know it.

				kathleen
		this is so sad.

	she tosses him his jacket.

				frank
			(points at her computer)
		you think that machine is your friend,
		but it's not.
			(checks his watch)
		i'm late.
