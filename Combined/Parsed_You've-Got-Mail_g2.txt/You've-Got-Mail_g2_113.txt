	int. tv set - night

	as we see sidney-ann strongin, a young and attractive pbs
	talk show hostess for a show called inside media.

			     sidney-ann
		the new york literary world was shocked
		this week when william spungeon, the most
		famously reclusive author since j.d.
		salinger, announced that he was coming
		out of hiding because of his loyalty to a
		small children's bookstore on the west
		side of manhattan.  discussing this
		tonight is a man i happen to think of as
		one of this city's most underappreciated
		assets, frank navasky.

			     frank
		thank you.

			     sidney-ann
		this all happened because of you, didn't
		it --

			     frank
		well, i knew william spungeon loved
		children's books so i wrote a provocative
		column --

			     sidney-ann
		your specialty.

	frank laughs.  sidney-ann laughs.

			     frank
		and it kind of smoked him out.
