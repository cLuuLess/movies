	they turn left onto west 101st and stop in front of an
	apartment building on the block.  there are more police cars

		the body of a woman was found this
		morning on the roof of a new york
		building...

	as george comes out of his building into a horde of reporters
	with microphones, cameras, etc. and listens to the reporter,
	who, seeing george, sticks the microphone into his face.

				tv reporter
		here is a resident of the building.  your
		name, please?

				george
		george pappas.

				reporter
		did you see or hear anything unusual last
		night?

				george
		no.  i didn't go out.

	at that moment, george sees a young woman.  this is meredith
	carter.  he is struck dumb.

				reporter
		the victim was red-haired, about thirty-
		five, wearing a jogging suit.  did you
		encounter anyone by that description
		in the building?  sir?

	george hasn't heard a word.

				reporter
		have there been any wild parties 
		lately?

	george doesn't answer.

				reporter
		could it perhaps be one of your
		neighbors?

	george continues to stare at the beautiful woman.  as he
	does, she notices him.  she stares back.  the reporter,
	ignored, finally turns away.

				reporter
			(to camera)
		as you can see, no one here knows
		anything.

	he continues to stand there, dumbstruck for a moment.
	meredith carter starts to walk away.
