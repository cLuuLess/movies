	ext. riverside drive park - late afternoon

	as kathleen comes down a path in the park, near 88th street.

	she comes to a stop.

	looks around.

	a young woman in running clothes passes by.

	a young father pushing a baby in one of those strollers
	runners use to push babies in.

	kathleen looks at her watch.

	suddenly she hears a noise.  a dog barking.

	and brinkley comes around the corner.

			     voice
		brinkley!  brinkley!

	and hold on kathleen as she sees.

	joe

	and she starts to cry.

	and he comes to her.  and puts his arms around her.

			     joe
		don't cry, shopgirl, don't cry.

			     kathleen
		i wanted it to be you.  i wanted it to
		be you so badly.

	and as they kiss, we hold on them.

	and crane up and away as we see them, a couple kissing in the
	park on a beautiful spring day.

	a dog is leaping around them.

	and as we get further and further away from them, the screen
	turns into

	cyberspace

	and the dog turns cartwheels and flipflops.

	and we tilt up to see the clouds and the sky

	and hear the sound of computer keys, clicking, clicking,
	clicking

					fade out
