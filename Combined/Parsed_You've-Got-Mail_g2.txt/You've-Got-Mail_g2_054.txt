	int. taxi - a minute later

	as the cab turns onto eighth avenue, starts uptown.

	patricia is dialing her cell phone.  she's elaborately
	ignoring the man who stole her cab.

			     patricia
		veronica, it's patricia, you should have
		been there, it was unbelievable, we're
		going to sell truckloads of your book.
		call me.

	she hangs up, folds up the phone, puts it back in her purse
	as the cab moves on.

			     man in overcoat
		are you an editor?

			     patricia
		yes.

			     man in overcoat
		i am a rabbi.

			     patricia
		oh, my god, i said fuck to a rabbi.  i'm
		sorry.

			     man in overcoat
		i hope you don't mind my asking, but are
		you jewish?

			     patricia
		yes.

			     man in overcoat
		you should come to our temple.

			     patricia
		i'm not really religious.

			     man in overcoat
		oh, i am surprised, you seem like a very
		religious person.

			     patricia
		you're kidding, right?

			     man in overcoat
		we are at west end avenue and 83rd
		street.  every friday night, we have a
		joyous time, everyone dancing, everyone
		singing.  also some wisdom.  perhaps you
		have heard of us, we are known as the
		singles temple.

	he smiles at her.

			     man in overcoat
		it's a very good place to calm down.

	the cab stops.

			     man in overcoat
		oh, look, i am already here.  very nice
		to meet you.
			(gives the cabbie money)
		take this woman to her destination.

	he gets out.  closes the door.  a beat too late:

			     patricia
		goodbye.
