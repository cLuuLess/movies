	ext. shop around the corner - dusk

	the bookshelves are empty.

			     kathleen (v.o., cont'd)
		six months ago, when you and i first met,
		i knew everything about myself -- what i
		would be doing for the rest of my life
		and even the person i would be doing it
		with.  now i know nothing.

	on the door is a small sign.  "after 42 years, we are closing
	our doors.  we have loved being part of your lives."

	kathleen turns out the light in the store and opens the door.

	the little bell over the door jingles.

	kathleen reaches up on her tiptoes for the bell and detaches
	it.

	then she comes out of the store, carrying the bell.

	kathleen locks the door and reaches down to operate the grate
	for the last time.

	the grate starts to lower.

	kathleen looks at her store, one last time.  then she walks
	off, carrying the bell.  we hear it jingle in the night.

	and hold on the shop around the corner, and it slowly turns
	into a computer-enhanced version of itself.

	and then, suddenly, it vanishes with a poof, leaving an empty
	screen.
