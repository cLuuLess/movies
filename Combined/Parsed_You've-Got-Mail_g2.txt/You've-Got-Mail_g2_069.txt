	int. kathleen's bedroom - night

	as kathleen and frank get into bed.

			     frank
		i really like patricia eden.  she's a
		very nice person.

	kathleen doesn't respond.  frank turns out the light.

			     frank
		she needs educating, that's all.

	a beat.

			     frank
		she's hopelessly driven by money and
		power, but there's a hope for anyone 
		who's that familiar with my work --

	on kathleen, as she turns away from frank and lies there,
	eyes open.
