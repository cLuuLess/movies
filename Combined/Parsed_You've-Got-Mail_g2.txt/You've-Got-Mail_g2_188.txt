	int. sidewalk cafe - another day

	kathleen and joe having nachos.

			     joe
		so he didn't exactly answer.

			     kathleen
		he did too.  he nailed me.  he knew
		exactly what i was up to.  which is just
		like him.

			     joe
		but he didn't exactly answer, did he?
		did he?

			     kathleen
		no.

			     joe
		maybe he's fat.

			     kathleen
		i don't care about that.

			     joe
		you don't care that he might be one of
		those guys who's so fat he has to be
		removed from his house with a crane?

			     kathleen
		that's very unlikely.

			     joe
		why else do you think he's putting off
		meeting you?  although... maybe that's
		not it.  maybe...

			     kathleen
		what?

			     joe
		never mind.

			     kathleen
		what????

			     joe
		he could be waiting til he's paroled.

			     kathleen
		oh, you won't believe this, there was a
		moment when george thought he might be
		the rooftop killer, which was completely
		ridiculous --

	her voice trails off, as she considers whether it could be
	true.

			     joe
		what's his handle?

	she shakes her head.

			     joe
		come on, i'm not going to write him.  is
		that what you think?

			     kathleen
		ny 152.

			     joe
		one five two.  one hundred fifty two.
		very interesting.  he's 152 years old.
		he has 152 hairs remaining on his head.
		he's had 152 moles removed and now he
		has 152 pockmarks.
