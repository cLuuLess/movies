	int. joe's office - day

	on joe at his computer, staring at the screen.

			     joe
		asshole.

	he backspaces, deleting.  starts typing again.

			     joe (v.o.)
		i'm sorry.  i don't know what to say.
		truly i don't.  and anything i do say
		will sound trite.  i hope you feel
		better.

	he sits there, appalled at his own triteness.
