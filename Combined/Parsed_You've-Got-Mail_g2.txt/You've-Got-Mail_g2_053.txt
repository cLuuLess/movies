	ext. 57th street - continuous

	patricia in the pouring rain, trying to hail a cab.  she
	spots one across the street.

			     patricia
		taxi!  taxi!  taxi!

	she whistles -- a longshoreman's whistle.

	the cab makes a u-turn, but instead of stopping for patricia
	it stops about twenty feet ahead for a man in an overcoat who
	gets into it.

			     patricia
		excuse me -- what are you doing?  this is
		my taxicab.
			(to the driver)
		don't take him.  i am telling you right
		now, and i am memorizing your number,
		don't take him.
			(to the man)
		who the fuck do you think you are?

			     man in overcoat
		are you going uptown?

			     patricia
		yes.

			     man in overcoat
		get in.  i'll drop you.
