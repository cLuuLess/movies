			     kathleen (v.o. cont'd)
		-- ice skating at rockefeller center,
		where i was knocked into a 6-year-old
		maniac --

	a six-year-old boy knocks into her.

			     young kathleen
		hey, watch out --

			     six-year-old boy
		me watch out, why don't you watch out?
		i'm not sliding around like a baby.  you
		think i come here to skate with babies?

	young kathleen's jaw drops and she stands there tongue-tied.

			     kathleen (v.o.)
		my first experience as a speechless
		person.

	her mother skates up and takes her hand.  the boy skates off.

			     kathleen (v.o.)
		i always miss my mother at christmas, but
		somehow it's worse this year since i need
		some advice from her.

	and we hear the sound of another computer.
