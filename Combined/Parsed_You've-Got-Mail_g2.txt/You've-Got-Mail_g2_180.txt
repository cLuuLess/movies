	christina is running.  she sees a good-looking male runner
	coming toward her.  she has no hope that he will notice her,
	and starts to look away as they get close to one another.

			     male runner
		hi.

			     christina
		hi.

	he passes her.  christina can't believe it.

	she does a little dance of joy.

	camera pulls back as we see her by the reservoir on a 
	beautiful morning doing her little celebratory spin.

	then she resumes her morning exercise, running on.
