	int. drip - day

	drip is a cafe on amsterdam avenue with fifties-style couches
	and chairs in cozy seating arrangements.  kathleen is
	standing at the front counter with christina, getting drinks.

				christina
		i went to the foxbooks website and you
		can buy anything.  they ship it to you
		in a day.  maybe we should get a website.

				kathleen
		my mother would never have wanted us to
		have a website.  "every book you sell is
		a gift from your heart."  she always said
		that.

	as they walk toward the back of the cafe, kathleen notices a 
	stack of loose-leaf binders on the table.

				christina
		what if they put us out of business?

				kathleen
		it's out of the question.  we're a
		fixture in the neighborhood.  we're
		practically a landmark.
			(indicating the binders)
		men for women, women for men, women for
		women -- what is this?

				christina
		you fill out one of these forms and they
		file it in the book and if someone wants
		to meet you, they arrange it.

				kathleen
		what a stupid way to meet someone.

				christina
		compared to the internet?

				kathleen
		my little thing on the internet is just
		a lark.

				christina
		so it's still going on?

				kathleen
		and i do not plan to meet him.
			(indicating the book)
		why do i get the feeling that you are in
		here somewhere?

	christina flips the book open to her application.

				christina
		i came in here one night and drank too
		much coffee and filled one out.
			(off kathleen's look)
		well how am i supposed to meet someone?

				kathleen
		you are a runner.  some day you will make
		eye contact with another runner and --

				christina
		no one ever even looks at me.  they
		don't.  on top of which, who are they?
		they could like the symphony.  i could
		never fall in love with someone who 
		likes to go to the symphony --

				kathleen
		i know.  what are you supposed to do
		there?

				christina
		i don't know.

				kathleen
		sit.  you're supposed to sit.

				christina
		i could never fall in love with anyone
		who smokes cigars either.

				kathleen
		i'll tell you what i hate.  big fat legs
		like stumps.

				christina
		yeah.  i hate that too.

				kathleen
		the worst, the worst -- i could never,
		under any circumstances, love anybody
		who had a sailboat.

				christina
		neither could i.

				kathleen
		if i had to get up on saturday morning
		knowing that i was about to go down to
		the pier and unravel all those ropes and
		put on all that sunblock --

				christina
		all that talk about the wind.

				kathleen
		and then you have to go out on the boat,
		and you sail and sail and sail until you
		are bored witless, and then, only then,
		do they say, let's turn around and you
		realize the trip is only half over, only
		it's not, because the wind has changed --

				christina
		it hasn't changed.  it's died.

				kathleen
		so then there's more talk about the wind.
		while you just float up and down trying
		not to get nauseous.  and when you
		finally get back, you have to clean up
		the boat.

				christina
		why don't people have boat maids?

				kathleen
		i know.  there're all these people who
		wouldn't be caught dead polishing a
		doorknob in their house but put them on 
		a boat and they want to rub down 
		everything in sight.
