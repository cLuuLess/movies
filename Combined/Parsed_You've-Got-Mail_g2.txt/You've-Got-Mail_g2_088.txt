	int. joe's father's apartment - thanksgiving day

	an elegant east side apartment.  schuyler, his youngish
	french wife, yvette, nelson, gillian and their child matt,
	and joe are sitting and listening as annabel sings tomorrow.

			     annabel
		the sun'll come up tomorrow, bet your
		bottom dollar that tomorrow, there'll be
		sun --

	joe is on a loveseat with matt.  gillian lifts matt up, sits
	down in his place next to joe and plunks matt into her lap.
	nelson is already seated in a chair in front of the loveseat
	and can't see her without turning around.

	as she continues singing, gillian moves her hand next to
	joe's leg.  joe edges away.  he looks around the room, sees
	nanny maureen standing behind the couch.  he stands, offers
	her his seat.  she sits.
