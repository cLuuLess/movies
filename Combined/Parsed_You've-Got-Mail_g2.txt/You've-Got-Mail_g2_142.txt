	as kathleen looks at frank, waiting for him to begin.

			     frank
		you're a wonderful person, kathleen.

			     kathleen
		so are you.

			     frank
		and i'm honored that you want to be with
		me because you would never be with anyone
		who wasn't truly worthy --

			     kathleen
		i feel exactly the same way about you.

			     frank
		oh, god, don't say that, please, that
		just makes it worse.

			     kathleen
		what?
			(he shakes his head)
		you don't love me?

	frank shakes his head no.

			     kathleen
		me either.

			     frank
		you don't love me?

	kathleen shakes her head no.

			     frank
		but we're so right for each other.

			     kathleen
		i know.

	a long beat.

			     kathleen
		that woman on television, right?
		sidney-ann.

	frank nods.

			     frank
		i mean, nothing's happened or anything.

			     kathleen
		i think she's a republican.

			     frank
		i can't help myself.

	kathleen pats him.

			     frank (cont'd)
		what about you?  is there someone else?

			     kathleen
		oh, somewhere out there, i'm sure.
		somewhere --
			(she throws up her hands)
		in cyberspace.
