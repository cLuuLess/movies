	ext. broadway - morning

	as kathleen comes onto broadway at the corner of 83rd street
	and starts downtown.

	through a long lens we can see joe, walking into blocks behind
	her.

	as kathleen and joe make their way down broadway we see the
	west side of manhattan in the morning.  mothers and fathers
	taking their kids to school, people on their way to work,
	dogs being walked.  school buses picking up kids, bakery
	trucks dropping off brown bags of bread in the doorframes of
	unopened restaurants.

	kathleen stops at a newsstand, says good morning to the 
	newsstand dealer, and picks up a new york times.

	metal grates are pulled up to open flower shops, nail salons,
	the pharmacy, fish store, the cuban chinese restaurant,
	zabar's.

	joe stops at the same newsstand.  he buys all the papers --
	the times, wall street journal, post and daily news.
