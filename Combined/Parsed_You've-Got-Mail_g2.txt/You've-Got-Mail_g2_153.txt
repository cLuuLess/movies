			     joe
		hello, charlie, veronica.

			     patricia
		last time, we rode in an elevator, we
		made the deal of the century.  what is
		going to happen this time?

			     charlie
		miss grant's going to get me a part in
		one of her movies, that's what's going
		to happen.

			     veronica
		in your dream, charlie.

			     patricia
			(back to the conversation with
			 joe)
		i love how you've totally forgotten you
		had any role in her current situation.
		it's so obtuse.  it reminds me of someone
		... who?  who does it remind me of?
			(thinks for a moment)
		me!

	the elevator suddenly stops.

			     patricia
		shit.

			     veronica
		shit.

			     joe
		it is stuck?

			     charlie
		could be.

	he pushes the open button.  nothing.  turns the key, hits the
	open button, flicks the emergency switch.  the he starts
	hitting the buttons in every possible combination.

			     joe
		charlie, what are you doing?

			     charlie
		bang the door.

			     patricia
		really.

	joe bangs the door.  nothing.

			     charlie
		i hope this thing doesn't plummet to the
		basement.

			     veronica
		can it do that?

			     joe
		no.

	he picks up the phone.

			     joe
		this is joe fox.  who is this?  hi, juan.
		we're stuck on the sixth floor.  there
		are four of us --

			     patricia
			(grabs the phone)
		-- and if you don't get your ass up here
		in two shakes and get us out --

	he hangs up.

			     joe
			(to veronica)
		are you all right?

			     veronica
		it's hot.

	joe hands her his handkerchief.

			     charlie
		everyone should jump in the air.

			     patricia
		what?

			     charlie
		we jump.  the elevator thinks that no one
		is here and it opens.

	everyone stares at each other.

			     joe
		one -- two -- three --

	they all jump into the air.

	they all land.

	nothing happens.
