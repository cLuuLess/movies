	int. shop around the corner - late that day

	the store is crowded.  people are buying stacks of books.
	we hear brief snatches of conversation: birdie telling a
	customer she's planning to travel, christina saying she's
	finally going to have to finish her dissertation, george
	saying he's been offered a job at foxbooks but even though
	it's okay with kathleen, he wouldn't work there if it were
	the last place on the earth.

	there is a frantic, rummage sale atmosphere.

	kathleen, busy at the cash register, looks up for a minute at
	her beautiful store being ravaged by vultures.  we hear the
	sound of the computer and hear her voice-over:

			     kathleen (v.o.)
		my store is closing this week.
		i own a store.  did i ever tell you that?
		probably not.  it's a lovely store --

	as a woman dumps a huge stack of books on the checkout table.

			     woman shopper
		this is a tragedy.
			(yelling across the shop to her
			 husband)
		honey, grab a copy of the trumpet of the
		swan.

			     kathleen (v.o.,cont'd)
		-- and in a week, it will be something
		really depressing, like a baby gap.  i
		am being amazingly brave --

			     woman shopper
		what are you going to do with yourself?

			     kathleen
		i don't know.  i'm going to take some
		time.  i have a little money saved.  i'm
		almost looking forward to it --

			     kathleen (v.o.,cont'd)
		i am so cheerful i would make pollyanna
		throw up.

			     second shopper
		i came here every saturday when i was a
		little girl.  i remember when your mother
		gave me anne of green gables.  "read it
		with a box of kleenex," that's what she
		told me.

			     third shopper
		she's looking down on you right now.

			     kathleen
		i'm sure she is.

			     kathleen (v.o.,cont'd)
		i have promised myself i'm not going
		to cry.

	a forth shopper approaches the counter with a stack of books
	up to his chin, and manages to slide the stack on the 
	counter.

			     fourth shopper
		we should bomb foxbooks.

			     kathleen
		it's not their fault.  the truth is, the
		world is just... different.

	she starts ringing up the sale.
