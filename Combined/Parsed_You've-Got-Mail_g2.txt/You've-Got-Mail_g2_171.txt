	int. yacht - night

	in the main cabin joe and nelson are having drinks.  nelson
	lifts his glass in a toast.

			     nelson
		to us.

			     joe
		father and son, together at last.  that
		happened with gillian?

	nelson ignores the question.

			     nelson
		i've stayed here after, let's see, your
		mother, laurette that ballet dancer --

			     joe
		-- the nanny --

			     nelson
		was she the nanny?  i forgot that.  how
		ironic.  then there was the ice skater --

			     joe
		-- also the nanny --

			     nelson
		really.  how amazingly ironic.  sybil the
		astrologer.

			     joe
		whose moon turned out to be in somebody
		else's house, as i recall.

			     nelson
		just like gillian.

			     joe
		gillian ran off with someone?

			     nelson
		the nanny.

			     joe
		nanny maureen?  gillian ran off with
		nanny maureen?  that's incredibly
		ironic.

			     nelson
		true true.

			     joe
		there's no other word for it.

			     nelson
		who did you break up with?

			     joe
		patricia.  you met her.

			     nelson
		would i like her?
			(cracks himself up)
		just kidding.  isn't this great?  have
		some peanuts.  of course i have to live
		out of a suitcase for a least three
		weeks, and then there's the inevitable
		legal hassle, more of your inheritance
		down the drain.

			     joe
		don't worry about it.

			     nelson
		i won't.  but then i get to meet someone
		new.  that's the easy part.

			     joe
		oh, right, a snap to find the one single
		person in the world who fills your heart
		with joy.

			     nelson
		don't be ridiculous.  have i ever been
		with anyone who fits that description?
		have you?

			     joe
		on to the next.

			     nelson
		isn't it a beautiful night?

	hold on joe.
