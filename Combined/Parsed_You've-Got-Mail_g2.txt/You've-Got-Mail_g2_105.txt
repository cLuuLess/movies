	int. shop around the corner - continuous

	kathleen comes out of the storage room.

	william spungeon is standing there.

			     william spungeon
		i'm william spungeon.

			     kathleen
		i'm very pleased to meet you.  i'm
		kathleen kelly.

	frank is practically levitating.

			     spungeon
		i knew your mother.  although she knew me
		only as w.  that enormous bookstore is
		obscene.

			     frank
		i'm frank navasky.  i carry your picture
		in my wallet.

	he pulls it out.  spungeon looks at him like he's crazy.

			     kathleen
		we've organized pickets.  channel 13 is
		doing a special.

			     spungeon
		i'd be glad to talk to the press if it's
		all right with you.  they've been trying
		to interview me for years.

			     frank
		the press?  i'm the press.

			     kathleen
		you'd allow that?  for me?  for the
		store?  that's incredible.  although you
		wouldn't have to be photographed.  i
		respect that.  if it's television, they
		could just put one of those blurry dots
		in front of your face.

			     spungeon
		no television.

			     christina
			(referring to the tv crew)
		they're waiting for you --

			     frank
		i know all your books.  phaelox the
		gnome, the little man who comes from
		nowhere... and is going nowhere...
			(quoting)
		"where did you come from?"  "nowhere."
		"where are you going?"  "nowhere."

			     spungeon
		cool it.  i'm starting to break out in
		hives.
			(to kathleen)
		here's my phone number.

			     kathleen
		i had no idea william spugeon had a
		phone.

			     spungeon
		adios.

	he gives a little wave and leaves.

			     frank
		this is historic.
			(beat)
		do you realize what i've done?  by
		writing that piece, do you realize?
		i've brought william spungeon in from
		the cold. holy shit.  i am completely
		amazing.

	at that moment a tv reporter sticks her head into the store.

			     tv reporter
		kathleen kelly?

	kathleen takes a deep breath, walks out the door.
