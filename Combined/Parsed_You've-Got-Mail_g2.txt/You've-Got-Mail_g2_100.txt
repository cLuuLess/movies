	int. joe's bedroom - day

	joe is in bed with his laptop.  and cut back and forth
	between them and their computer screens as they type instant
	messages to one another.  possible split screens.

			     joe (v.o., cont'd)
		i can give you advice.  i'm great at
		advice.

			     kathleen (v.o.)
		i don't think you can help.

			     joe (v.o.)
		is it about love?

			     kathleen (v.o.)
		my business is in trouble.  my mother
		would have something wise to say.

			     joe (v.o.)
		i'm a brilliant businessman.  it's what
		i do best.  what's your business?

			     kathleen (v.o.)
		no specifics, remember?

			     joe (v.o.)
		minus specifics, it's hard to help.
		except to say, go to the mattresses.

			     kathleen (v.o.)
		what?

			     joe (v.o.)
		it's from the godfather.  it means you
		have to go to war.

	close on kathleen - looking at the computer

			     kathleen
			(to herself)
		the godfather?

	she starts to type.

			     kathleen (v.o.)
		what is it with men and the godfather?

			     joe (v.o.)
		the godfather is the i ching.  the
		godfather is the sum of all wisdom.  the
		godfather is the answer to any question.
		what should i pack for my summer
		vacation?  "leave the gun, take the
		cannoli."  what day of the week is it?
		"maunday, tuesday, thursday, wednesday."
		and the answer to your question is "go to
		the mattresses."

	camera on kathleen - considering what he says

			     joe (cont'd)
		you're at war.  "it's not personal, it's
		business.  it's not personal it's
		business."  recite that to yourself every
		time you feel you're losing your nerve.
		i know you worry about being brave, this
		is your chance.  fight.  fight to the
		death.
