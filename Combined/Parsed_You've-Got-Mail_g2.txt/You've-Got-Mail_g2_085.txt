	int. zabar's cheese department - night

	the place is mobbed -- the usual crush the night before
	thanksgiving.

	kathleen, pushing a shopping cart, is trying to wedge her way
	through the crowd in the cheese department.  as she reaches
	across three people to grab some brie, she sees joe walk into
	the store.  quickly, she turns her back so he can't see her.
	she stands there frozen.  a beat...

	peeks around, doesn't see him anywhere.  cranes her neck this
	way and that.  no joe.
