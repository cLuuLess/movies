	as frank and kathleen go up the escalator, on their way to a 
	movie.

			     frank
		she fell in love with generalissimo
		franco?

			     kathleen
		don't say that.  we don't know that for
		sure.

			     frank
		who else could it have been?  it was
		probably around 1960 --

			     kathleen
		i mean, it's not like he was something
		normal, like a socialist or an anarchist
		or something --

			     frank
		it happened in spain.  people do really
		stupid things in foreign countries.

			     kathleen
		absolutely.  they buy leather jackets,
		they go see flamenco, they ride in
		gondolas, they eat in restaurants where
		guitarists sing malaguena sola rosa, but
		they don't fall in love with fascist
		dictators.
