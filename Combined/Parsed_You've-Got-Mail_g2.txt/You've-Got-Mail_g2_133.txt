	int. kathleen's apartment - night

	as she types.  and we cut from her face to the screen as we
	hear a voice-over:

			     kathleen (v.o.)
		and as i waited, someone else showed up,
		a man who has made my professional life a
		misery, and an amazing thing happened --
		i was able, for the first time in my
		life, to say the exact thing i wanted to say
		it.  and of course, afterwards, i felt
		terrible.  just as you said i would.
