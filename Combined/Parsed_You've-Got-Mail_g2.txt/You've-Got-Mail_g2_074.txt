	int. joe's computer screen and joe's den - night

	as he replies:

			     joe (v.o.)
		wouldn't it be wonderful if i could pass
		all my zingers to you and then i would
		never behave badly and you could behave
		badly all the time and we'd both be
		happy?  on the other hand, i must warn
		you that when you finally have the
		pleasure of saying the thing you mean to
		say at the moment you mean to say it,
		remorse inevitably follows.  do you think
		we should meet?
