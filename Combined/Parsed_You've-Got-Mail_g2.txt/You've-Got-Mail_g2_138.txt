		birdie is a very kind person, she's
		practically my surrogate mother.

			     frank
		well she's out of her mind.

			     kathleen
		she is not.

			     frank
		i could never ever be with anyone who
		doesn't take politics as seriously as i
		do.

	the person in front of them turns around.

			     person in front of them
		do you mind?

			     frank
		a hot dog is singing.  you need quiet
		while a hot dog is singing?

	the two of them sit there.

			     kathleen
		i have something to tell you.  i didn't
		vote.

			     frank
		what?

			     kathleen
		in the last mayoral election, when rudy
		giuliani was running against ruth
		messinger, i went to get a manicure and
		forgot to vote.

			     frank
		since when do you get manicures?

			     kathleen
		oh, i suppose you could never be with a
		woman who gets manicures.

			     frank
		forget it.  it's okay.  i forgive you.

			     person in front of them
		shhhhhh.

			     kathleen
		you forgive me.

	hold on them a beat.

	kathleen stands and walks out of the theatre.
