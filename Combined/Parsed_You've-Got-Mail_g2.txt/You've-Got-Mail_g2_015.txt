	ext. columbus & 73rd street - day - continuous

	as kathleen comes around the corner onto 73rd and stops in
	front of her store, a children's bookstore called "the shop
	around the corner."  it is an irresistibly inviting store.
	there are twinkle lights in the windows, framing large
	stuffed animals reading children's books: madeleine, good
	night moon, where the wild things are.  a teddy bear in a 
	pinafore is reading the stupids step out.  waiting for
	kathleen in front is one of her employees, christina.

				kathleen
		hello, christina.  it's a beautiful day.
		isn't it the most beautiful day?

	christina looks up at the sky as if seeing it for the first
	time.

				christina
		i guess.  yeah, sure.

	kathleen unlocks the shop and cranks the grate, which
	rises, making a horrible noise.  two cabs almost collide in
	front of the store, with a screech, and one cabdriver starts
	yelling obscenities at the other.  kathleen unlocks the door
	to the store.

				kathleen
		don't you love new york in the fall?

	christina looks at her puzzled.
