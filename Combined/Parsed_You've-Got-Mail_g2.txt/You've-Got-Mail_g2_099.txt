	int. kathleen's bedroom - day

	kathleen in bed with her laptop reading joe's letter.

	she starts to type a response.

	suddenly there's harp arpeggio and an instant message
	flashes on screen.

	from ny 152

	close on kathleen - total shock

	on screen as we see the message

			     joe (v.o.)
		i had a gut feeling you would be on line
		now.
