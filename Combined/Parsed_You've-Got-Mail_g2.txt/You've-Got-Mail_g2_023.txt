	int. foxbooks - world headquarters - day

	joe is in the office with his father, nelson fox, and his
	grandfather, schuyler fox.  the office has been recently
	redecorated; everything is new and a little overdone.

	on the wall we see the foxbooks logo.

				joe
		kevin and i are both a little concerned
		about the neighborhood response --
			(suddenly notices the garish
			 couch)
		what is this fabric?  does it have a
		name?

				nelson
		money.  its name is money.

				joe
		gillian selected it.

				nelson
		of course.

				schuyler
		your father is getting married again.

				joe
		oh, great, congratulations, dad.  why?

				nelson
		who knows?  why does anyone get married?

				joe
		love.

				nelson
		yes, that is one reason.

				schuyler
		i think you're a damn fool.

				nelson
		dad, matthew is four.  it would be nice
		for him if his parents were married.

				schuyler
		annabel is eight and i'm not married to
		her mother.  i can't even remember her
		mother's name.
			(he laughs merrily)

				joe
		i have a very sad announcement to make.
		city books on 23rd street is going under
		...

	nelson, shuyler, and joe high-five each other.

				nelson
		another independent bookstore bites the
		dust --

				schuyler
		on to the next.

				joe
		and i'm buying their entire stock --
		architecture, new york history -- for the
		new store.

				nelson
		how much are your paying?

				joe
		whatever it costs, it won't be as much as
		this exquisite mohair episode.
			(indicates the couch)
		we're also going to have a section on
		west side writers --

				schuyler
		-- as a sop to the neighborhood.

				nelson
		perfect.  it'll keep those west side
		liberal nut pseudo-intellectual bleeding
		hearts --

				joe
		readers.  they're called readers.

				nelson
		don't romanticize them.  it'll keep them
		from jumping down your throat --

				schuyler
		what's the competition?

				joe
		one mystery store.  sleuth, on 86th and
		amsterdam.  and a children's bookstore.
		the shop around the corner.  been there
		forever.

				schuyler
		cecilia's store.

				joe
		who's that?

				schuyler
		cecilia kelly, lovely woman.  i think we
		might have had a date once.  or maybe we
		just exchange letters.

				joe
		you wrote her letters?

				schuyler
		mail.  it was called mail.

				nelson
			(fondly nostalgic and kidding
			 it slightly)
		stamps.  envelopes.

				joe
		wait.  i've heard of it.  it was a means
		of communication before i was born.

				nelson
		exactly.

				schuyler
		cecilia had beautiful penmanship.
		she was too young for me, but she was...
		enchanting.  her daughter owns it now.

				nelson
		too bad for her.

	as a decorator walks into the office carrying a pile of
	upholstered pillows, and joe turns to look at them.

				computer voice (over)
		welcome.  you've got mail.

				joe (v.o.)
		my father is getting married again.  for
		five years he's been living with a woman
		who studied decorating at caesar's
		palace.

				computer voice (over)
		you've got mail.
