	int. joe's apartment - night

	as joe turns on his closet light and hangs up his jacket.
	the computer is on the desk, and the light on it illuminates
	the room.

	patricia is in the next room, eating matzos.

			     patricia (o.c.)
		so i said to her, "if you think i will
		even talk to you about paying that kind
		of advance for an author whose last book
		is being used as trivets all over the
		world, you are completely crazy."

	on joe's face, barely bearing.
