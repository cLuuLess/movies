	kathleen at the computer, typing.

			     kathleen (v.o.)
		i have been thinking about this and
		i think we should meet.

	she clicks the send button and then exits from american on
	line.

	on her computer screen we now see the standard screen with
	several icons: american on-line, word, recycle bin, etc.

	she clicks word.

	she goes to file: new.

	there are several choices of format.

	she stares at the choices.  then she clicks book format.

	a blank page appears in the computer.

	she starts to type:  "once upon a time there was a little
	girl named..."

	she pauses for a moment and looks around the room.  she sees
	the flowers that joe brought her.

	and then she types: "daisy."

	as she goes on typing...
