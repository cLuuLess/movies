	int. japanese noodle restaurant - day

	annabel is sitting in her chair, staring glumly at a bowl of
	japanese soup and noodles.

			     joe
		i'll read you a story.

			     annabel
		where did she go?

			     joe
		she had to close her store.

			     annabel
		why?

			     joe
		she didn't have enough business.

			     annabel
		why?

			     joe
		well.  her store was very close to our
		store, and you know our store sells books
		at a slightly lower cost --

			     annabel
		why?

			     joe
		why do we sell at a lower cost?  so more
		people can buy books.

			     annabel
		why couldn't she sell that way too?

			     joe
		because she's small and we're big.  how
		about we go get some candy?

			     annabel
		so now she's gone and it's all your
		fault.

			     joe
		it's business, annabel.  it's not
		personal.  how about we go get so much
		candy you'll be bouncing off the walls
		for days?

			     matt
		what's personal?

			     annabel
		personal means that she's gone forever,
		and now we'll never get another book from
		her as long as we ever live.

	she burst into tears.  matt bursts into tears too.

			     joe
		remember the man who worked with her?

			     annabel
			(a wail)
		no.

			     joe
		well i hired him.

			     annabel
		you killed the storybook lady.

	matt throws himself on the ground, crying.

	annabel sobs hysterically.
