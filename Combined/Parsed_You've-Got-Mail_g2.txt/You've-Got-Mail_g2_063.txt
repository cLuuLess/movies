		what i was thinking as i was trailing him
		was that eventually i would have the
		courage to say hello to him, you know,
		not in a horrible, intrusive or slavering
		fan-slash-acolyte kind of way, but more
		like, "hi."  "how ya doing?"  "have you
		ever thought about trading up in the sock
		area?"  "who knows, maybe he's read my
		work -- and then we'd become friends, and
		eventually i'd introduce him to you --
		you know how much he loves children's
		books, there's a whole long section in
		relativity's smile about the wizard of oz
		-- and then maybe he'd come out of hiding
		so he could help save the store.
