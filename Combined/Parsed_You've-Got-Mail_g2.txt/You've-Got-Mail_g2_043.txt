	she goes over to the bookshelf and pulls out a copy of
	madeleine by ludwig bemelmans and opens it to the
	illustration of the twelve little girls in two straight lines
	marching through the streets of paris.  she looks at it, then
	looks up, lost in thought.  we hear the sound of the computer
	keys.

				kathleen (v.o.)
		sometimes i wonder about my life.  i lead
		a small life.  well, not small, but
		circumscribed.  and sometimes i wonder,
		do i do it because i like it, or because
		i haven't been brave?  so much of what i
		see reminds me of something i read in a
		book, when shouldn't it be the other way
		around?

	and hold on her as she thinks about this.

	in the other room, we hear frank typing.

	kathleen goes to the computer, turns it on.
