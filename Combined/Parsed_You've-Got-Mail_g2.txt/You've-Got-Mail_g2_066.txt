	int. vince mancini's apartment - night

	a publication party for an author named vince mancini.  a mix
	of book people, journalists and various other media folk.

			     frank
		hey, vince.  congratulations.  you know
		kathleen kelly.

			     vince
		how are you?

			     frank
		guess who i saw today on the subway?
		william spungeon.

			     vince
		i thought he was in mexico.

	they start chatting.

	across the room, joe is with patricia, who is telling two
	other people the story of meeting the rabbi in the taxicab.
	joe looks over and sees kathleen.  he suddenly looks
	stricken.

	shifts his position so kathleen can't see his face, but
	sneaks a look.

			     patricia
		would you get me another drink, sweetie?
		i'm all out.
			(continues chattering)
		so then the rabbi says, "it's a very good
		place to calm down."  isn't that
		hysterical?

	they all laugh.  joe moves over to the bar.

			     joe
		absolut on the rocks.

	as he is waiting, kathleen comes up next to him.

			     kathleen
		a white wine, please.
			(very friendly)
		oh, hello.

			     joe
		hi.

			     kathleen
		remember me, from the bookstore?

			     joe
		of course i remember you.

			     kathleen
		how's your aunt?

			     joe
		good.  she's good.
			(gets his drink)
		i have to deliver this.  i have a very
		thirsty date.  she's part camel.

	kathleen laughs.

			     kathleen
		joe.  it's joe, isn't it?

			     joe
		and you're kathleen.

	joe vanishes into the party.
