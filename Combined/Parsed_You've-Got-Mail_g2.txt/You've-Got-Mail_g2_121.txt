	int. nut shop of broadway - day

	george, kathleen and christina in the shop.  kathleen is
	buying more lollipops.

			     kathleen
		we're meeting in a public place.

			     christina
		well don't go anywhere with him.  don't
		even go out to the street with him
		afterwards.  get a dial cab to just sit
		there and wait for you.

			     george
		did you tell frank?

			     kathleen
		there's nothing to tell.

			     christina
		but did you tell him?

			     kathleen
		he's away.  at the 32nd anniversary of
		the chicago seven trial.

			     george
		and he's gone to a place where there are
		no phones.  do you even know this guy's
		name?

	kathleen shakes her head no.

			     christina
		and you're going to meet him in a bar?

			     kathleen
		not a bar.  that place on 83rd with the
		cheesecake.

			     george
		and he will wear a flower in his lapel,
		and you will be carrying a copy of anna
		karenina with a rose in it.

	no answer.

			     christina
		oh god, no.

			     kathleen
		not anna karenina.  pride and prejudice.
