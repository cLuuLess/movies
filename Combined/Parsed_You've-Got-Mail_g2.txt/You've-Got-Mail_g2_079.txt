	ext. broadway - morning

	a little group of children dressed as pilgrims walk down the
	street as kathleen comes around the corner to buy her morning
	paper.  joe is at the newsstand.  she turns and pretends to
	be staring at a wall until he finishes buying his paper and
	walks on.

		i don't think it's a good idea for us
		to meet...
