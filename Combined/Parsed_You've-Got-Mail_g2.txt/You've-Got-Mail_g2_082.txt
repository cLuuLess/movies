	int. coffee shop - day

	george and meredith are sitting in a booth.

			     meredith
		mr. pappas, i'm investigating the murder
		of the woman found on the roof of your
		building.  do you live alone there?

			     george
		do i live alone?  yes i do.  do you live
		alone?

			     meredith
		yes.

	george takes her hand in his and looks at it as if it were
	the eighth wonder of the world.  he starts stroking it,
	caressing it...

	meredith pulls it away.  a beat.  then she gives it right
	back to him.  he continues stroking.  they stare at each
	other.  he puts her fingers into his mouth.

		meredith
			(overwhelmed)
		what are you doing?

			     george
		i don't know.  i have no idea.

			     meredith
		you have to stop.

			     george
		i can't.

	she utters a little moan.
