	int. shop around the corner

	kathleen and several customers in the store.

	george walks in and goes to the back to hang up his coat.
	christina is unpacking boxes.  birdie is at the desk.  george
	looks at christina meaningfully.

				christina
			(totally mystified)
		what?

				george
		the coup de foudre. i had one. i
		never believed in them, but i just had
		one.

				birdie
		is that the thing where you get cold
		suddenly, bang?

				christina
		no, that's the coup de vieux.

				birdie
		i had that.

				george
		the coup de foudre is where you get
		love suddenly, bang.  a thunderbolt.

				birdie
		i had that too.  only i had it in
		seville, where it was called ,el
		estruendo de amor.

				george
		i don't know her name, or anything about
		her.  i may never see her again.

				christina
		and if you ever do meet her, you'll find
		out all the horrible details, and that
		will be that.  she'll turn out to have
		pictures of the virgin mary all over the
		walls.

				george
		i won't care.

	kathleen sticks her head into the back.

				kathleen
		can someone help me out here?

				christina
		george had a coup de foudre.

				george
		and christina's making fun of me.

				kathleen
		don't let her.  i believe in this, i
		completely believe in this.  it happened
		to madame bovary, at least six times.

				christina
		and she was wrong every time.

				kathleen
		yes!
			(beat)
		who was she?

				george
		i don't know.  she was standing outside
		my building with the police and the
		reporters.

				kathleen
		what police and reporters?

				george
		someone died.

				kathleen
		who?

				george
		i have no idea about that either.
		they found her on the roof.

				kathleen
		a dead body.  that's so sad.  but
		you fell in love.  that's so great.

				george
		oh.  one other thing.
