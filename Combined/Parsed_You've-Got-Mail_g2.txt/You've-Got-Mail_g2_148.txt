	int. foxbooks superstore - children's department

	as kathleen walks into it.

	it's huge, of course.  with its reading area, and stage, and
	room for displays, and child-size furniture, and so many
	books and so many customers.

	kathleen sits down on a little child-size chair, completely
	wilted.

	kathleen from another p.o.v.

	and now we see joe watching her, from a distance.  she doesn't
	see him.

	a woman browsing, stops a sales person.

			     woman shopper

			     salesperson
		the "shoe" books?  who's the author?

			     woman shopper
		i don't know.  my friend told me my
		daughter has to read the "shoe" books, 
		so here i am.

		noel streatfeild.  noel streatfeild wrote
		ballet shoes and skating shoes and
		theater shoes and movie shoes...
			(she starts crying as she tells
			 her)
		i'd start with skating shoes, it's my
		favorite, although ballet shoes is
		completely wonderful.

			     salesperson
		streatfeild.  how do you spell that?

			     kathleen

	as she walks away.

			     kathleen
			(to herself)
		they know nothing, they know absolutely
		nothing.

	on joe

	as he watches her.  we hear the sound of the computer.

	she starts out of the store.  and hold on him.
