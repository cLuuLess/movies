		if i ever get out of here, i'm going to
		start speaking to my mother.  she slept
		with oscar, and maybe it was oscar's
		fault, i don't know, and then she sold
		the story to inside edition.
		that could have been oscar's idea, too.
		who knows?  but i divorced him.  i wonder
		what she's doing right this minute.  i
		think of her... whenever i hear about a
		new pill.  ecstasy, zoloft, fenphen, i
		just think, i hope mama knows about that.

	she takes out a tissue and dabs at her eyes.

		would be so great for the book.
