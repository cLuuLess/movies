	int. television screen - continuous

	joe onscreen, with a super: joe fox, vice-president foxbooks.

			     joe
		i sell cheap books.  sue me.  i sell
		cheap books, and as a result -- listen 
		to this, because it's really bad --
		more people can buy books.

	the show immediately cuts back to the newscaster.

	on joe and kevin.

			     kevin
		that's what you said?

			     joe
			(outraged)
		that's not all i said.  i said -- i can't
		believe those bastards -- i said we were
		great, i said people can come and sit and
		read for hours and no one bothers them, i
		said we stock 150,000 titles, i showed
		them the new york city section.  i said
		we were a goddamn piazza where people
		could mingle and mix and be.

			     kevin
		a piazza?

			     joe
		i was eloquent.  shit.  it's just
		inevitable, isn't it?  people are going
		to want to turn her into joan of arc --

			     kevin
		-- and you into attila the hun.

			     joe
		well it's not me personally, it's more
		like it's the company --

			     kathleen
			(on the television)
		and i have to say, i have met joe fox,
		who owns foxbooks, and i have heard him
		compared his store to a price club and the
		books in it to cans of olive oil.

	on joe, reacting.
