	int. shop around the corner - continuous

	kathleen turns the closed sign on the door over to read
	"open" and she activates the computer system.  she looks
	around, and we see a small but charming children's bookstore,
	with wooden shelves, a tiny area where kids can sit and read,
	some charming posters and a glass case full of first editions
	of the oz books and alice in wonderland, etc.  there's a 
	playful display of witches, lit with twinkle lights covered
	with orange pumpkin globes and a sign reading "the ten best
	witch list"  and a collection of witch books -- "the lion, the 
	witch and the wardrobe," "the witches," "the wizard of oz."
	on the counter is a glass jar full of sugar-free lollipops.

	kathleen hangs up her coat in the back of the store and
	suddenly stops to daydream.  a smile creeps onto her face.
	christina looks at her.

				christina
		what's going on with you?

				kathleen
		nothing.

				christina
		you're in love.

				kathleen
		in love?  no.  yes.  of course i am.
		i'm in love with frank.  i'm practically
		living with frank.  do you think you
		could get our christmas mailers out this
		week?

				christina
		by monday i promise.  i have a paper due
		friday.  now what's going on?
			(she looks at kathleen)
		i'm just going to stand here till you tell
		me.

	a beat.

				kathleen
		is it infidelity if you're involved with
		someone on e-mail?

				christina
		have you had sex?

				kathleen
		of course not.  i don't even know him.

				christina
		i mean cybersex.

				kathleen
		no!

				christina
		well, don't do it.  the minute you do,
		they lose all respect for you.

				kathleen
		it's not like that.  we just e-mail.
		it's really nothing, on top of which i'm
		definitely thinking of stopping because
		it's getting --

				christina
		out of hand?

				kathleen
		confusing.  but not really.  because it's
		nothing.

				christina
		where did you meet him?

				kathleen
		i can't even remember.
			(off christina's look)
		the day i turned thirty i wandered into
		the over thirty room for a joke, sort of
		and he was there, and we started 
		chatting.

				christina
		about what?

				kathleen
		books.  music.  how much we both love new
		york.  harmless.  harmless.  meaningless.
			(starts smiling)
		bouquets of sharpened pencils.

				christina
		excuse me?

				kathleen
		forget it.  we don't talk about anything
		personal.  we made a rule about that.
		i don't know his name, what he does or
		exactly where he lives, so it will be
		really easy to stop seeing him, because
		i'm not.

				christina
		god, he could be the next person to talk
		into the store.  he could be...
			(as george walks in)
		george.

	george pappas, in his twenties, one of kathleen's 
	salespeople, is a cute guy who has no idea that he's supposed
	to look in the mirror when he gets dressed.

				george
		morning.

				christina
		are you on line?

				george
		as far as i'm concerned, the internet is
		just another way to be rejected by a 
		woman.

	birdie walks in.  she is in her seventies, has white hair,
	and is tiny, like a little sparrow.  she is the store's
	oldest employee, having worked there for over forty years,
	and serves as a accountant as well as salesperson.

				kathleen
		good morning, birdie.

				birdie
		what are you all talking about?

				christina
		cybersex.

				birdie
		i tried to have cybersex once but i kept
		getting a busy signal.

				christina
		i know, i know.  one saturday night i was
		really depressed about not having a date,
		so i thought, no problemo, i'll go on
		line and i won't be lonely, but i 
		couldn't get on, there were hundreds of
		thousands of people who didn't have dates
		trying to get on.
			(more)
		you have to wonder which is harder,
		getting a date or getting on line when
		you don't have a date.

				george
		getting a date is harder.

	we hear the bell jingle as two west side mothers come in with 
	two kids in strollers.

				kathleen
			(to the kids)
		jessica and maia, how are you today?

	we hear the sound of the garbage truck.  kathleen goes out
	the front door to:
