	int. kathleen's apartment - a minute later

	kathleen comes in, drops the book on the table, takes off her
	coat and goes immediately to the computer.  she clicks on
	american online.  waits impatiently to connect.  looks with
	anticipation at the mail box.

	the computer screen - no mail

	hold on kathleen as a tear starts down her face.

	she takes her handkerchief out of her sleeve and wipes her
	face and blows her nose.  then looks at her handkerchief and
	tosses it over her shoulder.

	she goes over to the bed and turns it down and slips out of
	her shoes.

	then she lies down on the bed, fully clothed.  she reaches
	up to turn out the light.
