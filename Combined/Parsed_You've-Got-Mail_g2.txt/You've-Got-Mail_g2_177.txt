	when kathleen gets to the kitchen, joe is checking the kettle
	for water.  turns on the stove.

			     joe
		you're sick.  sit down, please.

	he pulls out a kitchen chair.  kathleen sits.  she's a little
	woozy.

			     joe

			     kathleen
		upper left.

	he gets out a vase.  fills it with water.

			     joe
		george says hello.  he told me you
		weren't feeling well.

			     kathleen
		how is george?

			     joe
		great.  he's revolutionizing the place.
		no one is allowed to work in his
		department who doesn't have a ph.d. in
		children's literature.

	he unwraps the paper around the flowers.  daisies.  puts them
	in a vase.

			     kathleen
		i love daisies.

			     joe
		you told me.

	he puts the vase on the kitchen table.  kathleen plays with
	the petals.

			     kathleen
		they're so friendly.  don't you think
		they are the friendliest flower?

			     joe
		i do.

			     kathleen
		when did you break up?

			     joe
		oh, a couple of weeks ago.

			     kathleen
		everyone is breaking up.  you.  me.  this
		other person i know broke up with someone
		in an elevator.  i think it was in an
		elevator.  or just outside it.  or after
		it.  it got stuck.  i think.  and suddenly
		everything became clear.  when i saw you,
		at the coffee place, i was waiting for him
		and i was --

		-- charming.

			     kathleen
		i was not charming.

			     joe
		well, you looked charming.

	the teakettle whistles.  joe turns off the burner.

			     joe
		tea?

			     kathleen

			     kathleen
		i was upset.  and i was horrible.

			     joe
		honey?

	kathleen nods.  he puts in two spoonfuls, gives it to her.

			     joe
		i was horrible.

			     kathleen
