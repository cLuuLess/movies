	ext. shop around the corner - night

	it's starting to rain.  kathleen lowers the grate over the
	store.  as she turns to walk away, william spungeon steps in
	her path out of the shadows.

			     kathleen
		oh my goodness, hello.  what are you
		doing here.

			     spungeon
		loitering.  lurking.  skulking.
		stalking.

	he laughs.  so does she.  dramatically, he whips out an
	umbrella and opens it over the two of them.

			     spungeon (cont'd)
		you look very beautiful.

			     kathleen
		thank you.  but i'm a wreck.

	he touches her cheek suddenly.  kathleen starts.  then he
	blows on his hand.

			     spungeon
		an eyelash.  it's gone.

	kathleen relaxes.  they start walking.

			     kathleen
		are you writing another book?

			     spungeon
		i'm in the home stretch.  i'll be done in
		approximately six more years.

			     kathleen
		should i discount?

			     spungeon
		it's about a man on a quest for knowledge
		who meets a woman he cannot resist.

			     kathleen
		if i discount i have to fire someone
		because i can't discount with this
		overhead but whom could i fire?  i
		couldn't fire anyone.

	spungeon suddenly puts his hand through kathleen's hair.  she
	stops, frozen in place.

			     spungeon
		you have your mother's hair.  thick,
		wild, the color of nebraska wheat.

	he grabs her and tries to kiss her.

			     kathleen
		what are you doing?  let me go.

	he backs her into a wall.

			     kathleen
		stop it.  are you crazy?

	she kicks him in the shins, wiggles free and runs away.
