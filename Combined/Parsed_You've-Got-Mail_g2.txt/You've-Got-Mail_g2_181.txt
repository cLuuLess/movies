	int. the singles temple - friday evening

	patricia comes in.

	the place is packed.  there are hundreds of young jewish new
	yorkers singing folk songs and dancing the hora.  the rabbi
	is dancing among them.

	patricia sees the rabbi, leading the dance.

	the rabbi whirls madly toward her, like a human dreidel.

			     rabbit
		shabbat shalom!

	he grabs patricia's hand, and to her surprise, they go
	whirling off together.
