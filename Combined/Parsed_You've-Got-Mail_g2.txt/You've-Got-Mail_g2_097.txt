	int. joe's apartment - 1972 - night

	young joe, at the dinner table with his father.  a wide shot
	of a big room with a huge table and servants.  joe looks very
	small at the table as he eats his soup.

			     joe (v.o., cont'd)
		my mother died when i was ten.  i was
		staying with my father, who is not famous
		for intimacy, and whose way of breaking
		the news of her death was to tell me she
		would not be coming to pick me up as
		usual.  it was a car accident, and i
		don't know where she was going or who she
		was with, and i assume what i owe her is
		my tendency to cover almost any emotion
		with a joke.  a useful gift, unless you
		want to know what you're feeling.  she
		was very beautiful.  people toss that
		word around a lot, but my mother was.

	the camera moves closer to the dining table.  we see that
	tears are rolling down little joe's cheeks.
