		"kathleen kelly and her mother cecilia
		kelly have raised your children.  if this
		precious resource is killed by the cold
		cash cow of foxbooks, it will not only be
		the end of western civilization as we
		know it, but the end of something even
		dearer: our neighborhood as we know it.
		save the shop around the corner and you
		will save your own soul."  frank, that's
		charming.

			     frank
		you think it's a little over the top?

			     birdie
		just say thank you.

			     frank
		thank you.
