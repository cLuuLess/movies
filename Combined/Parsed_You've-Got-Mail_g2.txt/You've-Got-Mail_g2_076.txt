	ext. 75th street & columbus - day

	as the iron gates on all the stores start to open, just the
	way we saw them open in the opening sequence of the movie.
	the pharmacy.  the optician.  the cosmetics supply store.
	the video store.

	and now, finally, we see the new grate on the new foxbooks
	superstore start to open upwards.  this is the finest grate
	on broadway, no question of it.  it's electric and almost
	soundless.  we see a sign saying, opening day.  35% off on
	all best-sellers.

	people on the street notice the store.  one walks in...

	camera follows him...
