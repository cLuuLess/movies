	ext. shop around the corner - december dusk

	kathleen is in the window decorating a little tree with
	lovely decorations from a box.  two people are carrying a
	tree home, there's the sound of church bells.

	kathleen looks up as a couple of people walk past the store,
	carrying foxbooks shopping bags.

	then she unwraps a pair of ruby slipper ornaments, and as she
	starts to hang them on the tree we hear the sound of the
	computer.

		this is such an odd christmas.  i find
		myself missing my mother, who's been dead
		for ten years.  new york at christmas is
		so loaded with all the things we used to
		do --
