	ext. kathleen's bedroom - continuous

	kathleen puts the daisies next to the bed and gets into it.
	she fluffs up the pillows, pulls up the blankets, surrounds
	herself with kleenex and evian and sneezes a gigantic sneeze.

			     kathleen
		why did you stop by?  i forget.

			     joe
		i wanted to be your friend.

			     kathleen
		oh.

			     joe
		i knew it wasn't possible.  what can i
		say?  sometimes a person just wants the
		impossible.  could i ask you something?

			     kathleen
		what?

			     joe
		what happened with that guy at the cafe?

			     kathleen
		nothing.

			     joe
		but you're crazy about him --

			     kathleen
		yes.  i am.

			     joe
		then why don't you run off with him?
		what are you waiting for?

	a long beat.

			     kathleen
		i don't actually know him.

			     joe
		really.

			     kathleen
		we only know each other -- oh god, you're
		not going to believe this --

			     joe
		let me guess.  from the internet.

			     kathleen
		yes.

			     joe
		you've got mail.

			     kathleen
		yes.

			     joe
		very powerful words.

			     kathleen
		yes.

	joe sits on the edge of the bed.

			     joe
		i'm happy for him.  although -- could i
		make a little suggestion?  i think you
		should meet him.  no.  i take it back.
		why meet him?

			     kathleen
			(starting to get sharp again)
		i hardly think i need advice from someone
		who --

	he reaches out and gently claps his hand over her mouth.  and
	holds it there.  it's unexpectedly tender and sexy.

			     joe
		i concede i bring out the worst in you,
		but let me help you not to say something
		you'll just torture yourself about for
		years to come.

	she starts to smile and he removes his hand.

	they look at each other.

			     joe
		i hope you're better soon.  it would be 
		a shame to miss new york in the spring.

	joe stands.

			     kathleen
		thank you for the daisies.

	he starts for the door.

			     joe
		take care.

			     kathleen
		i will.

			     joe
		goodbye.

			     kathleen
		goodbye.

	we hear the door close.

	hold on kathleen.
