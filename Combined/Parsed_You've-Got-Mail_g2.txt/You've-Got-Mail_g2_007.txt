	int. joe's apartment - day

	a dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor. this
	is brinkley.  the pillow has "brinkley" embroidered on it.
	brinkley's master, joe fox, a great-looking guy, full of
	charm and irony, comes into the kitchen and pours himself
	some orange juice.  he's half-dressed.

				joe (cont'd)
		-- but he chose to stay with me so that
		he could spend 18 hours a day sleeping on
		a large green pillow the size of an inner
		tube.  don't you love new york in the
		fall?  it makes me want to buy school
		supplies.  i would send you a bouquet of
		newly-sharpened pencils if i knew your
		name and address.  on the other hand,
		this not knowing has its charms.

				voice
		darling --

				joe
		mmmmmhmmm --

	joe's girlfriend patricia eden, in armani head to toe, comes
	into the kitchen and turns on the $2000 espresso machine,
	which starts grinding beans.  she's carrying the morning
	papers.

				patricia
		i'm late.
			(indicating the newspaper)
		random house fired dick atkins.  good
		riddance.  murray chilton died.  which
		makes one less person i'm not speaking 
		to --
			(she drains a cup of espresso
			 as a second starts to come out
			 of the machine)
		vince got a great review.  he'll be
		insufferable.  tonight,  pen dinner --

				joe
		am i going?

				patricia
		you promised.

				joe
		can't i just give them money?  that's the
		cause?  free albanian writers?  i'm for
		that.

	patricia drains another cup of espresso, looks at him.

			     joe
		all right, i'll go.  you're late.

			     patricia
		i know i know i know.

	she tears out of the kitchen and the door slams behind her.

	hold on joe, listening as he hears the elevator door open and
	close on the landing outside.

	it. joe's den - day

	as he comes in and sits down at his laptop computer and logs 
	on.

			     joe & the computer (together)
		welcome... you've got mail.

	and as he starts to read his letter, we hear:

			     kathleen (v.o.)
		i like to start my notes to you as if
		we're already in the middle of a
		conversation.  i pretend that we're 
		the oldest and dearest friends --
		as opposed to what we actually are,
		people who don't know each other's names
		and met in a chat room where we both
		claimed we'd never been before.
