	int. gym - night

	five tv sets are on, over adjoining treadmills, joe and
	kevin are on two of the treadmills, walking and watching.

			     joe
		she's not as nice as she seems on
		television.

			     kevin
		you've met her?

			     joe
		she's kind of a pill.

			     kevin
		she's probably not as attractive as she
		seems on television either.

			     joe
		no, she's beautiful.  but a pill.

			     kevin
		so you don't feel bad about basically
		destroying her livelihood not to mention
		her legacy not to mention her raison
		d'etre.

			     joe
		it's not personal --

			     kevin
		it's business.

			     joe
		right.  exactly.

	they look up at the television.
