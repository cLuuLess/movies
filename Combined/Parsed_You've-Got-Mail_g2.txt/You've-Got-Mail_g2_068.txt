	int. vince mancini's apartment - a couple of minutes later

	joe is standing at a table of food, his back to the room.

			     kathleen
		fox?  your last name is fox?

	joe spins around, looks at her.

			     joe
		f-o-x.

			     kathleen
		god, i didn't realize.  i didn't know who
		you --
			(she trails off)

			     joe
		-- were with.
			(quoting)
		"i didn't know who you were with."

			     kathleen
		excuse me?

			     joe
		it's from the godfather.  when the movie
		producer realizes that tom hagen is the
		emissary of vito corleone --
			(continued)

	kathleen is staring at him.

			     joe (cont'd)
		-- just before the horse's head ends up
		in his bed never mind --

			     kathleen
		you were spying on me, weren't you?  you
		probably rented those children.

			     joe
		why would i spy on you?

			     kathleen
		i am your competition.  which you know
		perfectly well or you would not have put
		up that sign saying "just around the
		corner."

			     joe
		the entrance to our store is around the
		corner.  there is no other way to say it.
		it's not the name of our store, it's
		where it is.  you don't own "around the
		corner."

			     kathleen
		next thing you'll be using twinkle
		lights.

			     joe
		twinkle lights?

			     kathleen
		little white christmas lights that
		twinkle.  i use them in my window and on
		all my displays, as if you didn't notice.

			     joe
		look, the reason i came into your store
		is that i was spending the day with
		annabel and matt.  i like to buy them a
		present when i see them because i'm one
		of those guys who likes to buy his way
		into the hearts of children who are his
		relatives.  there was only one place to
		buy children's books in the neighborhood
		-- although that will not always be the
		case, and it was yours, and it is a
		charming little bookstore.  you probably
		sell $250,000 worth of book a year --

			     kathleen
		how do you know that?

			     joe
		i'm in the book business.

			     kathleen
		i'm in the book business --

			     joe
		oh, i see, and we're the price club.
		only instead of a ten-gallon can of olive
		oil for $3.99 that won't even fit into
		your kitchen cabinet, we're selling cheap
		books.  me a spy.
			(beat)
		absolutely.  and i managed to get my hands
		on a secret printout of the sales figures
		of a bookstore so inconsequential and yet
		full of its own virtue that i was instantly
		compelled to rush over and check it out
		for fear it would drive me out of business 
		--

	kathleen stares at him.  she's speechless.

			     joe (cont'd)
		what?
			(off her look)
		what?

	kathleen shakes her head.

	frank turns up.

			     frank
		hi.  i'm frank navasky --

			     joe
		-- joe fox.

			     frank
		joe fox?  inventor of the superstore,
		enemy of the mid-list novel, destroyer of
		city books -- tell me something:
		how do you sleep at night?

	patricia joins them.

			     patricia
		i use a wonderful over-the-counter drug,
		ultrasom.  don't take the whole thing,
		just half, and you will wake up without
		even that tiniest hangover.  you're frank
		navasky, aren't you?

			     frank
		yes.

			     patricia
		your last piece in the independent, the
		one about anthony powell, was brilliant.
		i'm patricia eden, eden books.  joe, this
		man is the greatest living expert on
		julius and ethel rosenberg --

			     joe
		and this is kathleen kelly --

	kathleen glares at him.

			     frank
		you liked my piece.  god, i'm flattered.
		you know you write these things and you
		think someone's going to mention them and
		then the whole week goes by and the phone
		doesn't ring, and you think oh, god, i'm
		a fraud, a failure --

			     patricia
		you know what's always fascinated me
		about julius and ethel rosenberg is how
		old they looked when they were really
		just our age.

	everyone is stopped dead by this observation and looks at
	patricia, who smiles at them all.

			     patricia
			(to frank)
		i'm so happy to have finally met you.  we
		will talk.  have you ever thought about
		doing a book?

			     frank
		oh sure, it's passed through my head.
		something really relevant for today like
		the luddite movement in 19th century
		england.

	at the same time:

			     joe
		patricia --

			     kathleen
		frank --
