	int. foxbooks superstore - day

	we can hear the pickets marching and singing outside --
	although the store is full of customers anyway.  the fox men
	-- joe, nelson and schuyler -- are sitting in the cafe.
	nelson is holding a copy of a weekly newspaper, which has the
	old high-school yearbook picture of william spungeon on the
	front page and a headline: william spungeon emerges from
	hiding to support bookstore.

			     schuyler
		who is this spungeon anyway?

			     joe
		he's a writer.

			     nelson
		well, i've never heard of him.  and
		neither has anyone else in this place.
