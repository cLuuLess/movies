	int. kathleen's living room - day

	joe follows her.  they both sit.

			     joe
		whereas i am a horrible person and have
		no choice but to be horrible, is that
		what you're saying?

			     kathleen
		no i am not saying that because i am done
		saying horrible things, even to you.

			     joe
		you did it again.

	she claps her hand over her mouth.

			     joe
		i put you out of business.  you're
		entitled to hate me.

			     kathleen
		i don't hate you --

			     joe
		but you'll never forgive me.  like
		elizabeth.

			     kathleen
		who?

			     joe
		elizabeth bennet in pride and prejudice.
		she was too proud --

			     kathleen
		i thought you hated pride and prejudice.

			     joe
		-- or was she too prejudiced and mr.
		darcy too proud?  i can never remember.
			(beat)
		it wasn't personal --

			     kathleen
		-- it was business.  what is that
		supposed to mean?  i am so sick of that.
		all it means is it's not personal to you,
		but it's personal to me, it's personal to
		a lot of people.
			(she shrugs helplessly)
		what's wrong with personal anyway?

			     joe
		nothing.

			     kathleen
		i mean, whatever else anything is, it
		ought to begin by being personal.

	kathleen stands up, picks up the daisies.

			     kathleen
		my head's starting to get funny.  i have
		to go back to bed.

	they walk to...
