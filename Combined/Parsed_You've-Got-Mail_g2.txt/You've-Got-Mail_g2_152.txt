		so you're going to offer her a job?

			     patricia
		why not?  what else has she got to do?

			     patricia
		thanks to you.

			     joe
		well, i can't imagine her working for
		you.

			     patricia
		why not?

			     joe
		she has a horrible personality, she's...
		nice to everyone all the time.  it's
		exhausting.  and her staff turnover is
		... non-existent.  they've been there
		forever.  until... recently, when they
		all found out they were going to lose
		their jobs.

			     patricia
		thanks to you.
