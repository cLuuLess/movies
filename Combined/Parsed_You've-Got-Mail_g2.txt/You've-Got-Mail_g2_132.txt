	int. shop around the corner

	as kathleen puts her purse into the drawer.

			     kathleen
		i think something happened, something
		terrible and unexpected that made it
		impossible for him --

	george walks in.

			     george
		what happened?

			     kathleen
		he wasn't able to make it.

			     george
		he stood you up.

			     kathleen
		what could have happened?
			(continued)

	george looks suddenly stricken.

			     kathleen (cont'd)
		why didn't he come?  maybe he showed up,
		took one look at me and left.

			     christina
		not possible.

			     kathleen
		maybe there was a subway accident.

			     christina
		absolutely.

			     kathleen
		a train was trapped underground with him
		inside.

			     christina
		and no phone.

	george continues to look stricken.  he's starting to shake
	his head.

			     kathleen
		or an automobile accident.  those cab
		drivers are maniacs.

			     christina
		they hit something and you slam right
		into that plastic partition.

			     kathleen
		his elbows could be in splints -- so he
		can't really dial --

			     christina
		or he could be in the hospital in one of
		those semi-private room with like --
			     
			     christina & kathleen
			(together)
		-- no phone.

	they look at george.  still shaking his head.

			     kathleen
			(to george)
		what?

	george hands them a new york post.  they look at the cover:
	cops nab rooftop killer

			     kathleen
		what are you saying?

			     george
		it could be.

	dead silence.

			     george (cont'd)
		he was arrested two blocks from the
		cheesecake place.

			     christina
		is there a picture?

	there it is.  it's of a man with his jacket pulled over his
	head.

	they all look at it.

			     christina
		so that explains it.

			     george
		he was in jail.

			     christina
		and there was a phone --

			     george
		-- but he got only one call and he had to
		use it to call his lawyer.

			     christina
		you are so lucky.

			     george
		you could be dead.

			     kathleen
		are you crazy?  this man couldn't
		possibly be the rooftop killer.

			     christina
		remember when you thought frank might be
		the unabomber?

			     kathleen
		that was different.

			     christina
		how long did you sit there all alone?

			     kathleen
		not that long.  joe fox came in --

			     christina
		joe fox!

			     kathleen
		i don't want to talk about it.
			(closes her eyes)
		let's get to work.

	they look around.  there's no one in the store and nothing to
	do.

	a pause.

			     kathleen
		there must be something to do.  there's
		always something to do.

	they hear the jingle of the front door.  they look hopefully
	toward it.  it's only birdie.

			     christina
		he stood her up.

	hold on kathleen as the computer sound begins.

			     kathleen (v.o.)
		i have been thinking about you.  last
		night i went to meet you and you weren't
		there.  i wish i knew why.  i felt so
		foolish.
