int.  bastille - various shots - night

the three musketeers duck into the inky shadows; aramis cuts
the bonds that hold athos' hands, and gives him the extra
sword he had beneath his cloak.

                     porthos
          it worked!

                     athos
          it's a prison, you idiot!  they
          don't expect anyone to try getting
          in!  the problem will come when we
          want out!

aramis shushes them, and leads them into another quiet
corridor.  they hear the distant bells of a church, then
suddenly they must scramble, as a platoon of guards carrying
torches troop up stairs into the corridor; the musketeers
dart like rats into dark nooks; as the guards pass, the
musketeers huddle, and the bells end their tolling.

                     aramis
          midnight!  we have ten minutes!

they press on, deeper into the bastille.
