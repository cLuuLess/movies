int.  palace corridor - night

they reach the queen mother's room; d'artagnan reaches to
open the door for her, and she keeps her eyes lowered.  but
before he can let her go, he must whisper...

                     d'artagnan
          anne...!  i know... i know that to
          love you is treason against france.
          but not to love you... is treason
          against my heart.

                     anne
          then we will both die traitors,
          d'artagnan.

with those whispered words hanging in the air, she enters her
room.  and d'artagnan moves alone, back to his.
