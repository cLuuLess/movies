the guards enter to find the man in the iron mask slumped on
the floor.  aramis, looking like the fat priest again, stands

                     guard
          he says he just fell stone dead as
          he was reading him the mass.

                     head guard
          i never thought the bugger would
          last this long.  but how could he
          just keel over and --

aramis rattles off more italian, and suddenly the guard who
understands it stops examining the body and backs off.

                     guard
          he says the prisoner has the fever,

          plague?  they brought plague in
          here?  get him out of here.  now!

aramis rattles off a protest in italian.

                     guard
          no, no last rites!  get away!
