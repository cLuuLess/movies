int.  d'artagnan's room - day

d'artagnan is working at his desk, as the lieutenant enters.

                     lieutenant
          sir... a casualty report came...

d'artagnan looks at the paper the lieutenant hands him.

                     d'artagnan
          no, no, no...

he sags for a moment, then grabs his cloak and sword.
