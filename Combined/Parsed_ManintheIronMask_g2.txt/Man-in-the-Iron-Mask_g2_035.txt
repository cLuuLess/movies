ext.  the monastery - night

aramis leads athos and porthos out of the catacombs.

                     aramis
          this way.

they move into a moonlit courtyard of the monastery.  a
hooded jesuit standing guard steps from the shadows, then
recognizes aramis and admits the trio to the monastery's
forge, where more hooded jesuits are working in secret,
heating iron red hot in the bellows furnace.

                     athos
          what are they doing?

                     aramis
          making the key to the throne.

                     porthos
          they are very large keys.

one of the blacksmiths uses tongs to remove something red
from the fire; he hammers it in a shower of sparks and
plunges it into water.  aramis pulls the result from the
water and shows it to athos and porthos.

it is an iron mask.
