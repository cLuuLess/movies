ext.  road - night

aramis' carriage pulls off the road and into the trees.  the
musketeers and phillippe pile out, to find another much
grander carriage there waiting.  aramis ushers them into it.

                     phillippe
          whose carriage is this?

                     porthos
          it was mine.  but since you are
          about to be the king, it is yours.

the new carriage lurches away.

inside the new carriage

are bundles of elaborate clothes.

                     aramis
          phillippe first.

they begin to dress phillippe in a masquerade costume.

                     aramis
          remember, phillippe... nobility is
          born in the heart.

                     athos
          hold your goblet with two fingers.

                     porthos
          and make love as if you don't care.
          the way kings do.  and fart whenever
          you wish.

aramis tucks a note into phillippe's pocket.

                     aramis
          remember, all you have to do is get
          through tonight.  smile and nod a
          lot, and if you get stuck just wave
          and announce, "continue."  in the
          morning you hand this note to
          d'artagnan, pardoning athos and
          instructing that he, aramis and
          porthos be brought to the palace as
          your advisors.  and all is well.

phillippe nods; everyone's nervous.  aramis grabs more
clothes and hands them out.

                     aramis
          now the rest of us.
