int.  palace - night

d'artagnan strides into the long hallway leading to the royal
apartments.  as he reaches the door to the king's rooms, he
finds a knot of royal advisors -- among them pierre and
claude -- gathered outside the king's door.

                     claude
          we already know about the riots!

                     d'artagnan
          does he know?

                     pierre
          we will tell him, when it is...

                     claude
          convenient.

blocked by the advisors, d'artagnan leaves them, turning down
one hallway, and then another; he reaches the hall of mirrors
and touches the golden frame of one mirror at its corner; the
mirror becomes a door, revealing a secret passage within the
walls.  d'artagnan steps through and the portal closes again,
leaving no trace of its existence.
