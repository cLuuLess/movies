int.  the king's bedchamber - the three musketeers

are tidying everything up; they have louis gagged and trussed
up hand and foot, his eyes flashing hatred.

                     athos
          don't worry, your majesty.  we have
          a prison for you, where you can rest
          peacefully.

porthos drapes louis over his shoulder, and they move into
the passages.  just as they close the portal behind them, the
door opens and michelle wanders in like a zombie.  suddenly,
d'artagnan is at her shoulder.

                     d'artagnan
          michelle --

then he sees the room is empty; he thought louis was here.

                     d'artagnan
          where is he?

                     michelle
          in... the ballroom.  but he isn't
          the same man.
