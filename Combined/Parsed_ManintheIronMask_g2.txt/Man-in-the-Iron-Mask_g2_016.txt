int.  athos' apartment - night

athos sits alone, playing a haunting melody on a violin.  it
is a sad tune, played with feeling; he stops as he hears a
knock at his door, and opens it to --

                     athos
          d'artagnan!

                     d'artagnan
          athos, my friend!

they embrace with deep affection -- friends who have shared
each other's darkest times.

                     d'artagnan
          it's been too long.

                     athos
          life is too long.  except when we
          have our friends.  look at you!
          you're still a boy!  sit, sit!  i'll
          open a bottle of wine.

d'artagnan takes one of the wooden chairs, by the meager
fire.  the whole place is modest at best.

                     d'artagnan
          thanks, but not for me.

                     athos
          you can't drink with a friend you
          haven't seen in months?

                     d'artagnan
          i have ordered a drill of the royal
          guard for midnight, and must be
          clear-headed for it.

                     athos
          midnight!  mon dieu!  driving the
          youngsters hard, eh?

                     d'artagnan
          they must stay sharp.  there was an
          attempt on the king's life today.

                     athos
          another?  how many times have you
          saved his life in this year alone?
          three?  four?

                     d'artagnan
          i heard your playing.

                     athos
          i was feeling sorry for myself.
          raoul is getting married, he
          proposed today!  i love that boy
          beyond all measure, i've spent
          everything i own to give him
          education and opportunity.  now he
          has complete happiness, and i mope.

a cloud passes d'artagnan's face; he has something to tell
athos.

                     d'artagnan
          athos...

but whatever it is that d'artagnan wants to say is
interrupted by the sound of someone climbing the stairs.  as
athos' face brightened with the arrival of d'artagnan, now it
glows as he jumps up to welcome his son.

                     athos
          that must be raoul!  raoul!  look,
          d'artagnan's come to visit...!
          what's wrong?  you look awful!

                     raoul
          michelle, she -- the king has
          invited her to come live in the
          palace.

athos is stunned; d'artagnan witnesses this with agony.

                     athos
          but -- are you sure?

                     raoul
          we were at her door.  i was just
          taking the ring from my pocket, for
          the third time today, when a young
          musketeer brought the invitation for
          her to become a lady-in-waiting for
          the queen mother.

                     athos
          michelle cannot possibly accept!

                     raoul
          she cannot possibly refuse.  her
          family is poor, they have even less
          money than we do.  and along with
          the invitation, the king sent the
          diamond pendant, from the piglet.

                     athos
          piglet -- ?  what are you -- ?

                     raoul
          never mind, papa, it doesn't matter
          now.  she loved me once.  i want to
          die remembering that.

                     athos
          die?  what...?

                     raoul
          i have rejoined the army, and asked
          to resume my commission at the head
          of the troops of general fromberge.

                     athos
          fromberge...?!  at the front?!  no.

                     raoul
          it is already done.  i have just
          stopped at mother's grave, to say
          goodbye, before coming to tell you.

                     athos
          raoul, no... you cannot do this.  no
          matter how your heart is broken --

but raoul stops him, with an embrace.

                     raoul
          goodbye, father.  i am sorry.

                     athos
          raoul --

raoul breaks away, and runs from the room.  athos, so joyful
moments before, holds his head as if his brain might erupt.

                     athos
          this cannot be.  everyone knows the
          queen mother is a recluse, and the
          ladies-in-waiting are but
          mistresses for the king!

                     d'artagnan
          if the young woman truly loves
          raoul --

                     athos
          she's a woman, d'artagnan!  from a
          poor family.  you may still be young
          enough to believe love conquers
          everything, but i am old and hard
          and i've seen too much.  even when
          kings are hunchbacks they have any
          woman they desire, because power
          seduces even more than love!

d'artagnan is silent, and even ashamed.  athos realizes --

                     athos
          you knew this was happening.  you
          knew and that's why you came.

                     d'artagnan
          i fear i know our king.  i came to
          try to bring you hope.

                     athos
          what hope is there?  a wartime
          commission cannot be vacated except
          by the king, and what chance is
          there of that?  fromberge is on the
          battle line, and raoul --

                     d'artagnan
          i have dispatches a message to
          fromberge requesting that raoul be
          kept far from the fighting.

                     athos
          raoul is everything to me.

                     d'artagnan
          i know.

                     athos
          oh my friend.

athos grips d'artagnan in gratitude and desperate hope.

                     d'artagnan
          i will also speak with the king, for
          he is surely unaware of the problems
          his invitation to mademoiselle
          beaufort has caused.

                     athos
          you trust his character more than
          anyone else does.

                     d'artagnan
          raoul is hurrying to the front, so i
          must hurry too.

                     athos
          save my son, d'artagnan.

they embrace once more, and d'artagnan leaves.
