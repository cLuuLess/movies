int.  palace - anne's room - night

anne moves to the window, where she starts to kneel for her
nightly prayer; but she stops.  outside in the garden, far
below her window, is d'artagnan on horseback, waiting.  their
eyes connect.  he has a single rose in his hand.  never
taking his eyes from her, he places the rose on the stone
bench of the garden, and reins his horse away.

then she understands what he was trying to tell her before,
in the hallway; it was goodbye.
