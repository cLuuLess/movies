int.  palace - the hall of mirrors

the hall is alive with glorious light, fiery gold frames
surrounding silvery mirrors blazing with reflections.
musicians line the length of the hall, and when louis and
michelle appear at the far doorway they begin playing for the
couple as they parade past.  michelle is speechless, as louis
smiles at her awed innocence.
