ext.  paris streets - night

squads of young musketeers gallop along the river, and
through the dark streets around it, searching...

along the back wall of notre dame cathedral, three forms
scurry through the darkness:  aramis, porthos and athos,
heaving, wheezing.  they duck into a niche of the wall to
avoid capture from another patrol galloping by.  then aramis
unlocks a door in the cathedral wall and they stagger in.
