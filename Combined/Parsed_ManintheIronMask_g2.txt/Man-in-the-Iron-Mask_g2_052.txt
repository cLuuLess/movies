int.  a dark apartment in paris - night

the lock rattles, and the door swings open.  d'artagnan
enters, lifting a lantern to throw light on the dark room.
it is athos' apartment, the one he visited earlier; now he
finds it empty, devoid of clues.  he stands there alone.

he turns to leave, then glimpses a familiar painting hanging
beside the door.  lifting his light he studies the portrait:
athos, aramis, porthos and himself -- four musketeers, beat
friends, in their prime.  together then, inseparable.

                     d'artagnan
          my friends... where have you gone?

he lowers the lantern, and leaves.

                                                  cut to:

the message from the prison...

has reached the court.  gloved hands pass the message from
one advisor to another, and finally to the king.
