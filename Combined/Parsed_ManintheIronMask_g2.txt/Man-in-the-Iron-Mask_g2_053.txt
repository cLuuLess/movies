int.  palace - king's study - day

the king reads the message, rerolls it, thinks a moment, and
hands the scroll to claude.

                     louis
          take this to my mother.

the message

is again passed, this time into the hands of the queen
mother's eldest nun-attendant, and then into the hands of the
queen mother herself.  the queen is in her private rooms, and
for the first time we see her with her hair down.  she
accepts the scroll, opens it, and reads.

her eyes fill with pain, grief, guilt... emotions she hides,
turning away.

                     nun
          m'lady... are you...?

                     anne
          please, just... go away.
