int.  palace - king's room - day

as louis' tailors outfit him in a dazzling gold peacock
costume, complete with a jeweled mask at the end of a wand,
he amuses himself by looking out the window at the beautiful
young women arriving early for the ball.

                     louis
          it shall be interesting tonight.

d'artagnan enters, looking concerned.

                     d'artagnan
          your majesty.  this ball, with an
          open invitation to the nobility of
          paris -- we have no way of
          checking --

                     louis
          you will protect me as you always
          have, d'artagnan.

through the window louis sees more beautiful young women.

                     louis
          by the way, claude -- inform
          mademoiselle beaufort that she will
          be moving from her rooms --

he looks up to see that michelle has entered through the open
door behind him.

                     louis
          never mind, it seems we have already
          told her.

but michelle's appearance brings him up short.  it is not the
cruel brush-off; she is already harshly different:  her eyes
are red from crying, her lips are tight in anger.

                     michelle
          murderer!  murderer!

she holds a letter, crushed in her hand.

                     michelle
          i wrote fromberge!  under your seal!
          i wrote as you, demanding to know
          why he disregarded my order to keep
          raoul from danger!  he writes back:
          "but your majesty!  your last letter
          ordered me to put him in front of
          the cannon!"

she hurls the crumpled letter into his face.  everyone is
frozen, silent.  she staggers toward louis as if to attack
him, then falls to her knees, weeping.  no one helps her...

except d'artagnan.  he kneels, hugs her shoulders, helps her
to her feet, and guides her toward her room.  but d'artagnan
looks back once, toward louis.

                     louis
          hysterical woman.

                     claude
          sire, misuse of the royal seal -- !

                     louis
          she'll be gone tomorrow.

as d'artagnan and michelle move out, they pass anne, coming
in.  anne and d'artagnan exchange a look; he remembers to
give her a respectful nod, but she moves past, into the
king's dressing room.  louis is surprised.

                     louis
          mother -- ?

                     anne
          may i speak with you?  alone?

                     louis
          i am preparing for a ball!

                     anne
          we haven't visited in three years.
          and we should have privacy.

exasperated, louis waves his attendants away.

                     louis
          what is it, mother?

                     anne
          i wish to discuss your brother.

                     louis
          he is dead!  by god's choice!  there
          is nothing to discuss.

                     anne
          first they told me he had died at
          birth.  then your father admitted he
          was alive, but well cared for, in
          secret.  but the message that told
          of his death said he had been a
          prisoner.

                     louis
          i am king, mother!  and i do not
          wish to discuss this with you.

                     anne
          he was my blood -- and i demand to
          know what happened to him.

                     louis
          why would you ask now?  you never
          asked before!

                     anne
          because i have dreamed of him.  not
          as the baby they took away, but as a
          man.

                     louis
          you have prayed too much.  your mind
          is weak.

avoiding her stare, louis lifts a plaster bust of his father,
its eyes like the sightless pupils of greek gods.

                     anne
          i believe in dreams, louis.  they
          are our souls speaking to us, from
          that world beyond our eyes.  and
          that son i never saw in daylight was
          standing in the moonlight of my
          dreams.  and he wore an iron mask.

we see her from a low angle, from a pov behind louis -- and
we see the plaster bust burst upon the marble floor.

                     louis
          it -- it doesn't matter, mother!  he
          is dead now!  dead!

                     anne
          yes.  dead.  two nights ago.  the
          night of my dream.

and the night of louis' "dream."  anne begins to walk out.

                     louis
          if... if he was wearing an iron mask
          in your dream, then how could you
          know he was your son?

louis smiles; he thinks he has her.

                     anne
          then you did do it, louis.  you did
          put your brother in an iron mask.

all the blood is gone from louis' face.  anne walks from the
room, past louis' waiting tailors.  he snaps at them.

                     louis
          i have a ball to attend!

they rush in.  as they scurry about, dressing him in gold,
louis' composure returns; he stares at himself in the golden
mirror, likes what he sees... and smiles.
