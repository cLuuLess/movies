int.  carriage - rolling - day

the three musketeers, plus phillippe, are hurrying back
toward paris.

                     athos
          aramis, this will never --

                     aramis
          louis is planning a visit to the
          vatican, then who knows where after
          that.  if we miss him now we may not
          get another chance.

                     athos
          but --

                     aramis
          it presses us but it is good for us
          too!  louis' whims make him more
          vulnerable.  we are less ready, but
          so are his guards!

                     porthos
          d'artagnan, unready?

                     athos
          at a ball, everyone watches the
          king!

                     aramis
          but what if something extraordinary
          happened?  something so unusual that
          all the attention went to someone
          else?  someone whose confirmation of
          phillippe the king would never be
          questioned.

                     porthos
          who?

                     aramis
          the queen mother.  anne.

and aramis leans forward to tell them his plan...
