ext.  manor house courtyard - night

aramis emerges quickly, whispering directives to the jesuits;
athos helps the man in the iron mask from the carriage, his
head shrouded by a cloak.

aramis has a blacksmith waiting; almost before he realizes it
the man in the iron mask finds his head placed on an anvil;
but as the hammer rises he begins to scream.

                     man in the iron mask
          no!  please!

                     aramis
          what is wrong?  we only mean to free
          you from the mask!

but the prisoner is shaking, and athos understands why.

                     athos
          prison was horrible but it was his
          home.  he's been torn from it by
          strangers.  he's frightened,
          exhausted -- and the mask is
          familiar.  let him rest in it
          tonight, and remove it tomorrow.

                     aramis
          excellent, athos.  you have a keen
          sense of this man.

                     athos
          his plight is obvious, isn't it?

athos, angry with aramis' arrogance and insensitivity, leads
the man in the iron mask toward the house; then aramis spots
porthos, looking downcast.

                     aramis
          and why are you so glum?

                     porthos
          i expected action.  there was no
          killing, no fighting, i was useless.

in deep depression, porthos climbs out and shuffles off.
aramis sighs, shakes his head, and walks to the house.
