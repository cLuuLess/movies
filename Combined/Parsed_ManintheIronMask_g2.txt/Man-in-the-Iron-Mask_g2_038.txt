lying just off the coast is the forbidden island, where the
imposing fortress prison rises on the promontory off shore.

                     athos
          the prison of belle sur.

                     aramis
          come, we have a boat waiting.

as hooded jesuits appear from the shadows to guide them,
athos and porthos glance at each other; porthos shrugs.
