ext.  garden - outside the king's window - night

an old jesuit priest slips back into the garden chapel where
the nuns have returned to pray.  he kneels at a back pew,
tucking the iron mask deep within his robes.  the young
musketeers who move through the garden glance into the
chapel, see only the normal piety, and move on.  the old
priest crosses himself, bows his head, and smiles.

                                                  cut to:

close - phillippe's eyes, through the slits of the mask

they are frightened.  as we pull back we see the iron mask,
in an overhead pov... phillippe is lying on his back, his
head resting on an anvil.  athos stands close by, lending
support; aramis and porthos look on.  a blacksmith stands
over phillippe.  he positions the point of his chisel against
the lock of the mask.  it takes several ringing hammer blows
-- which we experience from a pov within the mask -- before
the lock breaks.

athos, as gently as he can, pries open the iron mask.

phillippe's face

is a wretched sight, overgrown with a matted tangle of hair
and beard, and with a deathly pallor.

phillippe sits up, lifting his head out of the mask.  he
looks at the musketeers, watching them for their reactions.
at first they are frozen; then there is recognition, awe.

phillippe sees a cooling bucket beside the forge, and looks
down into the surface of the water, at his reflection.

                     porthos
          aramis!  athos!  he looks exactly
          like... exactly like...

                     aramis
          i will answer all your questions.
          but first soap, water, and a razor.
