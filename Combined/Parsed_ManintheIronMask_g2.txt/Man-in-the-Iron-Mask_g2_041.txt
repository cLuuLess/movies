int.  cell of the man in the iron mask

the prisoner has used the torn bible to make all sorts of
amazing origami, invented from his own head.  he looks up as
he hears the door open, and sees aramis, the priest.

                     man in the iron mask
          my confession day!  but where is the
          other one?

aramis says something in latin -- the first words of the
ceremony of absolution -- as the guards lock the door behind
him and move off down the corridor.

                     man in the iron mask
          i know you don't speak my language
          -- but is the other one all right?
          please tell me he is not dead too,
          or i will have lost everyone.

aramis goes on mumbling latin mechanically, for the sake of
the retreating guards.  the man in the iron mask is desperate
for someone to talk to.

                     man in the iron mask
          i... tore my bible.  or someone else
          did.  but it was all right.  "let the
          words of my mouth and the
          meditations of my heart be
          acceptable in thy sight, oh lord our
          god and my redeemer."

aramis has stopped talking, and stares transfixed at this
sight of the prisoner, in the iron mask.

                     man in the iron mask
          i'm sorry.  you're never seen me
          before.  i must frighten you.

aramis puts his finger to his lips.

                     man in the iron mask
          what are you doing?  why do you --

aramis clamps his hand over the mouth hole, and whispers --

                     aramis
          i am a friend, here to help you.

aramis hurriedly removes his robes, revealing the bundle.

                     man in the iron mask
          what -- ?

                     aramis
          it is an escape.  to freedom.

                     man in the iron mask
          freedom...?

he says it as if the concept is beyond him.  aramis undoes
the bundle, revealing the limp body.

                     man in the iron mask
          wh-- ?  he is dead!  who is he?

                     aramis
          he is you.

aramis uncovers the head of the body.  it is covered in a
mask, identical to the prisoner's.
