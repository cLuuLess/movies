int.  palace - bedroom - night

within a bed whose tapestried posts stretch to the sixteen
foot ceiling, the king is making love; the young woman lying
beneath him is doing her best to sound sincere.

                     young woman
          oh yes!  so good!  ooo, wonderful,
          marvelous!  fan-tas --

louis climaxes with a grunt.  she tries to sound pleased.

                     young woman
          oh, louis, that was incredible.  it
          was better than ever before.  it --

                     louis
          i'm hungry.

he hops up, throwing on a silk robe embroidered in gold.

                     young woman
          i will have food brought.

                     louis
          i like to eat alone.

he moves to what appears to be a wardrobe, standing against
the far wall, and opens its door, revealing a secret
staircase hidden within the thick walls of the palace.

                     louis
          by the way, you'll be moving
          tomorrow.

leaving the girl without another word, he moves down the
concealed stairs.
