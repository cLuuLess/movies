int.  country manor house - athos' room - night

athos is pacing in his room, all alone, rehearsing the things
he wants to say to phillippe.

                     athos
          i am not... i am not angry with you.
          you understand?  good.  now, as to
          acting like a king, we wish you to
          be a good king.  but at first... at
          first you must pass as louis, and
          louis is cold and cruel.  so you
          must stop looking at people with
          such softness.  it is... not kingly.
          the eyes of a king say that all he
          cares about is himself, and your
          eyes -- how do i tell him this -- ?
          you eyes... ask so much.  you
          shouldn't care about me, about my --
          about...

athos' voice breaks, his body sags.

                     athos
          oh raoul, my son... my son...

athos weeps.
