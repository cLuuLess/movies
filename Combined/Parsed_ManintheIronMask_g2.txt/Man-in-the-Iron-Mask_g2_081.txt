int.  manor house - day

phillippe sits alone in the parlor; he looks up as athos --
his face washed, no sign of grief -- marches in.

                     athos
          come, we have much to do.

montage - athos training phillippe

-- they practice sword fighting, athos being sure that
   phillippe knows kingly posture...

-- they rehearse holding court, with athos showing phillippe
   how to sit in a chair like a king on his throne, and then
   phillippe trying it, with athos then playing the roll of a
   courtesan paying homage...

-- they rehearse courtly dancing; and as they stumble, both
   of them feeling embarrassed and ridiculous, they laugh.
