int./ ext.  palace garden - garden chapel - night

anne reaches the door, and finds a few nuns and an old priest
praying in the little chapel.  she staggers forward to the
altar.  and falls to her knees there.  the nuns and the old
priest, seeing the queen mother so distraught, stand silently
and file out, leaving her in solitude.

                     anne
          oh god i -- forgive me...

                     d'artagnan
          m'lady...?

she whirls to see him; the sight of her face, bursting with
emotions she has kept buried, draws him nearer.

                     d'artagnan
          what -- ?

                     anne
          no, stay back!  stay back!

he freezes in his tracks; she holds her hands out toward him
as if warding off a blow.  he's desperate to move to her; she
sees it on his face.

                     anne
          d'artagnan!

her emotions break all her resolve to keep him away; she
rushes into his arms.  they clutch each other, in an embrace
they have denied for many years.  they kiss hungrily.

                     d'artagnan
          m'lady... if anyone sees, it is
          death...

                     anne
          if i don't kiss you, i die anyway.

                     d'artagnan
          i can't bear to see you cry.  what
          is wrong?

                     anne
          nothing... nothing.

she draws back; he tries to hold her.  but the thoughts of
answering that question makes her stiffen.

                     anne
          nothing.  this... didn't happen.  i
          must go back now.

and just like that, their moment is gone.
