int.  a priest's apartment - day

the first of the partying women tumbles inside; she stops
short at what she sees.  the second and third stumble in
after her and they too stop dead still, sobered by what they
see.  then with a great roar porthos barrels in.

                     porthos
          aaaaaaaramis!!  porthos is --

he stops dead in his tracks.  from the pov of porthos and the
women, we see aramis.  always the most theological of the
musketeers, and ruthlessly brilliant, he is still lean and
powerful.  and still handsome, or at least he would be; but
now he kneels before a single candle at a private altar,
wearing sackcloth and ashes in penitent prayer.

                     porthos
          sorry, my dears.  you would have
          enjoyed it too.  he's hung like a
          donkey.

                     wench 1
          so are you.

                     porthos
          really?  i haven't been able to see
          it for fifteen years.  go on now,
          leave his holiness alone.  i'll
          bring you back tomorrow when he's in
          a better mood.

he whacks their bottoms, herding them out, then swaggers to
aramis, heaving himself to a seat beside his praying friend.

                     porthos
          please revel with me, aramis, i need
          my spirits lifted.  i'm old, i'm
          weak, my strength is gone --

                     aramis
          be quiet, you fat fool.  can't you
          see i'm praying?

                     porthos
          i just said you're praying!  are you
          deaf too?  i know you're blind,
          because if you had seen the tits
          that just walked out of here, you'd
          have tears in your eyes.

                     aramis
               (trying to ignore him)
          there are more important things than
          tits.

                     porthos
          really?  if you can name me one
          thing, one single thing, that is
          more sublime than the feel of a
          plump pink nipple between my lips,
          i will buy you a new cathedral.

aramis is still trying to pray, but rises to the bait.

                     aramis
          forgiveness.

                     porthos
          forgiveness?

as if in reply, porthos lets rip an enormous rolling fart.

                     porthos
               (beat)
          forgive me.

aramis' fingers clamp down on the rosary beads, as he tries
to keep praying.

                     porthos
          am i forgiven?

aramis abruptly backhands his huge friend.  porthos reels
backwards, landing in a chair.

                     porthos
          i observe your forgiveness isn't
          sweeter than a plump nipple.

                     aramis
          can't you see i'm praying,
          goddammit?!

porthos raises a foot and kicks the bishop in the balls.
aramis staggers back and grabs a chair to throw it; porthos
picks up the whole table -- just as d'artagnan enters.

                     porthos and aramis
          d'artagnan.

porthos tosses the table aside and bear hugs d'artagnan.

                     porthos
          how are you, you skinny little pup!

aramis sets the chair down in embarrassment.

                     aramis
          a simple theological discussion.

                     d'artagnan
          aramis -- the king wishes to see
          you.

                     aramis
          still you serve him loyally --
          though people hurl rotten eggs at
          his royal emblem.

aramis lifts d'artagnan's cloak as evidence:  near its hem,
sure enough, is the remnant of a broken egg.

                     d'artagnan
          i see your mind is sharp as ever.
          the king said, "right away."  cut
          deep and hard, my friends.

                     porthos
          deep and hard, d'artagnan.

d'artagnan clasps porthos' hand, then that of aramis, and
leaves, as porthos shakes his head.

                     porthos
          we were all musketeers once, eh?  oh,
          i forgot.  for the poor, the ones
          you were praying for.

he hands a purse to aramis.  surprised, even touched, aramis
reaches for it.  just as he takes the money, porthos throws a
haymaker; but aramis sees the sucker punch coming and ducks.
suddenly the two old warriors are circling again.

                     porthos
          i wonder how athos is doing.
