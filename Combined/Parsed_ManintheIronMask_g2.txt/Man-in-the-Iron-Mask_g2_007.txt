int.  a small house - day

athos stands at the dressing table in a modest room; dressed
in a dark plain coat, he too is a former musketeer -- gray
haired and handsome, intensely intelligent, with a hard crust
of manners masking seas of emotion.  he opens a small wooden
box and digs through medals of heroism; he finds what he's
looking for just as his son raoul enters.  raoul is in his
mid-twenties; he wears the uniform of a soldier in the french
army.  he is nervous, pacing, looking at every angle in the
mirror.

                     raoul
          do i look all right?

                     athos
          none of the ladies will be able to
          take their eyes off you.

                     raoul
          i care only about michelle.  should
          i ask her when we first arrive?
          or... or when we're leaving?  i
          could ask her in the carriage -- but
          it is more romantic at the palace.
          i get so confused...

                     athos
          perhaps this will help.

he hands raoul the simple gold ring he took from the box.

                     raoul
          mother's ring.  i can't take this.

                     athos
          she died giving you to me.  and i
          want to die knowing it is one the
          finger of the women my son loves.

they embrace.  athos' eyes mist, but he smiles.

                     athos
          now go, and bring back your fiance.

establishing - the royal palace - day

the palace glows golden in the parisian sunshine.  carriages
deposit guests for the lavish party in the royal gardens.
