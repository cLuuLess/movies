int.  cell of the man in the iron mask

the man in the iron mask lifts his head as a key rattles into
his door.  the door opens, admitting his old jailer, and a
new keeper.  the new keeper is just a younger version of the
old one -- greasy, fat, and cruel.

                     new keeper
          ugh!  he looks 'orrible.

the man in the iron mask rises and takes a step forward; the
new keeper recoils and raises his club threateningly.

                     new keeper
          stay back!

                     man in the iron mask
          i frighten you.  it's okay.  keeper
          was scared of me too, at first.

                     new keeper
          scared?

the new keeper steps forward and clubs the man in the iron
mask in the shoulder, then kicks him as he falls.

                     new keeper
          scared of you?  not me.  i'll kill
          him if he gets near me.

the new keeper strides out.  the man in the iron mask pulls
himself to his knees; his eyes, visible through the slits of
the mask, look sadly at the old jailer.

                     man in the iron mask
          i miss keeper.  i miss him so much.

                     jailer
          moron.

the jailer leaves the cell, locking the door behind him.
