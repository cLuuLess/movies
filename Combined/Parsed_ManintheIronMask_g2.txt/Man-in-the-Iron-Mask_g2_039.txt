ext.  among rocks at the beach - night

the guides lead the musketeers down a hilly path to a long
boat, hidden among the large rocks that dot the coast.
sitting next to the boat is a scrawny little man in priest's
garb; at his feet is a long narrow bundle, about the size of
a mummy, with a rope tied at either end.

the guides drag the boat across the sand into the surf.
aramis throws off his cape, and strips down almost naked.
he's still fit and hard.  with the guides helping him, he
lifts the bundle by its ropes and ties it around his waist.

                     athos
          what is that?

                     aramis
          a body.

                     athos
          i see that is a body!  but where did
          you get it?

aramis ignores the question, and the guides dress him in
priest's garb.  with the robes spreading over the big bundle
added artfully to aramis' waist, it appears he is a very fat
priest; the wig and false beard the assistants give him adds
to the illusion of aramis as a wild, reclusive monk.

the sun is beginning to come up over the mountains.

                     porthos
          he gets one day of confession each
          year.  today is the day.

                     athos
          who does?

                     porthos
          best not to ask.  shouldn't even
          talk about it.

aramis steps onto the boat.  the little priest who first
joined them gets in too, along with a couple of rowers.

                     athos
          what do we do now?

                     porthos
          i don't know about you, but i plan
          to wait here.

the rowers pull the boat toward the fortress prison.
