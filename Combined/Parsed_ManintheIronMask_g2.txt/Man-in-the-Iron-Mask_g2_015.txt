int.  d'artagnan's room - evening

d'artagnan returns to his room, just as a young lieutenant of
musketeers (andre) arrives with two of the royal guards.

                     lieutenant
          duty lists of the day, captain!

                     d'artagnan
          thank you, andre.

they hand him the list and salute again, to leave.

                     d'artagnan
          wait.  there is an entry here --
          "messenger sent by king to residence
          of mademoiselle michelle beaufort."
          why was that?

the young musketeers try not to smirk.

                     lieutenant
          well, captain...
