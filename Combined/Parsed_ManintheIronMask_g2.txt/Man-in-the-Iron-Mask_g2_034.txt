ext.  notre dame cathedral - day

the great cathedral rises next to the monastery where aramis
resides.  we pan down and push in on the cobblestones between
the two structures, as if penetrating to --

subterranean passages

aramis leads porthos through tunnels, twisting, descending.

                     porthos
          aramis... is this the way to hell?

                     aramis
          hell may be our destination, dear
          porthos, but not this trip.

they reach an iron door and move through it, into

a gorgeous, secret chapel

candles illuminate masterpiece frescoes.  the place is
breathtaking.

                     porthos
          where are we?

                     aramis
          jesus of nazareth found the holy
          among the profane.  if we are to
          have a place of private prayer,
          where better than here, beside the
          channels where the shit and the
          garbage run to the river?

porthos notices niches in the walls; he looks closely and
sees the face of a corpse, enclosed behind glass.

                     porthos
          mother of god!

                     aramis
          it is also a place of burial.

                     porthos
          a tomb?  we're in a tomb?

                     aramis
          catacombs.  very holy.

porthos looks as if the bodies could resurrect at any moment
-- then jumps out of his skin as the door opens.

                     porthos
          yaaaahhh!

a hooded figure, looking like the grim reaper, enters.

                     aramis
          relax, you big fool, it's
          d'artagnan.

and sure enough the hooded figure, whom we now see has been
led in by a little monk, is d'artagnan.  aramis nods to the
monk, who leaves quickly.  before d'artagnan can ask
anything, porthos jumps again; the back door has opened, and
monks usher in athos, who freezes as he sees d'artagnan.

                     aramis
          it's all right.  d'artagnan was the
          one who warned us that he'd been
          given an order for your arrest.
          here you have sanctuary -- does he
          not, d'artagnan?

the escort monks disappear, closing the chapel door so that
the four musketeers are left to sit at a small table the
monks have set up, athos and d'artagnan opposite each other.

                     aramis
          look at us.  we are old men now.  but
          once we were young.  and when we saw
          injustice, we fought it.

                     d'artagnan
          we have grown wiser with age.  now
          we know that some problems cannot be
          settled with a sword.

                     athos
          and some problems cannot be settled
          without one.

                     aramis
          well here is the problem at hand:
          the king has ordered me to discover
          the identity of the governor general
          of jesuits, and kill him.  as our
          english rivals have left the
          catholic church, louis has struck on
          a plan to dominate the whole of
          europe by uniting church and state
          and making himself head of both.  he
          has already picked the pope.  only
          the jesuits, who put god above
          throne or papacy, stand in his way.

                     porthos
          but -- doesn't god ordain both pope
          and king?

                     aramis
          so they tell us.  but what are we to
          believe when the king is a tyrant,
          and the church, meant to stand for
          all those oppressed, has become the
          tool of oppression?  when no
          conscience is tolerated?  no
          dissent, no objection?

                     porthos
          it is a weighty problem, aramis --
          but perhaps you should leave it to
          this secret general of the jesuits,
          whoever he might be.

                     aramis
          easy to say, but hard to do.  for
          what i am trying to tell you is that
          i am the governor general of jesuits
          in france.

a stunned silence.

                     athos
          what do you propose to do?

                     aramis
          replace the king.

                     d'artagnan
          i cannot hear this!

                     porthos
          it can't be done.

                     aramis
          it can.  i know the way.

                     athos
          i am with you!

                     d'artagnan
          no!  stop --

                     aramis
          i will need you all.  all for one.
          one for all.

                     d'artagnan
               (jumping up)
          you -- you cannot ask me to betray
          my king!  i have sworn to him!

                     athos
          it is honor you serve, and when the
          king is dishonorable you are removed
          from your oath of honor!

                     d'artagnan
          an oath is an oath precisely because
          it cannot be removed!

                     athos
          why do you follow him, d'artagnan?!
          i know you have put service above
          your own life, but why does this
          king deserve such loyalty?  he is a
          monster!  he executes ministers for
          his own blunders, with their
          families hostage so they take the
          blame!  he has no honor!

                     d'artagnan
          no man is all bad... or all good.  i
          believe -- i must believe -- that
          louis can learn.  and perhaps i can
          help him.

athos leaps up from the table, and glares at d'artagnan.

                     athos
          whatever the plan... i am in it!
          the next time we meet, one of us
          will die.

he storms out of the rear door of the chapel.

                     aramis
          porthos, see to athos, won't you?

porthos follows athos; aramis and d'artagnan are left alone.

                     aramis
          i have heard many confessions,
          d'artagnan.  but even if i were not
          a priest, i could tell your heart
          has a secret weight, and it is
          hurting you to carry it alone.

                     d'artagnan
          the secret i carry i cannot share.
          not even with god.

d'artagnan moves to the door.

                     d'artagnan
          i cannot betray louis.  i will
          defend him with my life.

                     aramis
          i know.  god go with you.

d'artagnan leaves aramis alone in the secret chapel.
