int.  manor house bedroom - night

athos helps the man in the iron mask onto the bed; the eyes
behind the slits in the mask are darting, frightened.

                     athos
          are you hungry?

                     man in the iron mask
          just... water.

athos pours a cupful from the water pitcher on the bed table;
but when he tries to help the prisoner drink the liquid
spills as the cup bumps the mouth hole.

                     man in the iron mask
          this way.

the prisoner manipulates the cup in the way he must to get a
drink, then falls back to the pillow.

                     man in the iron mask
          this place... i once lived in a
          country house.  i had guardians --
          an old man and woman.  and tutors.
          but no friends.  then when i was
          twelve, they came and took me to the
          prison.

                     athos
          who came?

                     man in the iron mask
          a man in black.  i never saw his
          face.  he took me to the cell.  a
          blacksmith came and they put me into
          the mask.  for days i shouted, "what
          have i done?  why do you do this to
          me?"  but no one heard, so i just
          stopped shouting.

                     athos
          and you never knew why?

                     prisoner
          i thought... there is something
          about my face that men do not want
          to see.  something that makes them
          cruel.  but then i realized they
          were cruel even when i was wearing
          the mask.  i knew there must be some
          other reason, but i could not think
          what it was.

                     athos
          what is your name?

                     man in the iron mask
          the old man and woman called me...
          phillippe.

                     athos
          phillippe.  rest now.

athos moves to the door.

                     man in the iron mask
          thank you... for your kindness.

athos nods, pauses a moment... and leaves.
