int.  the king's bedchamber - night

the king angrily stalks around his bedroom, too agitated to
sleep.  he grabs food from the table by the window, and
starts to pop a grape into his mouth when he stops.  he sees
something out the window; it stops him dead cold.

it is a man, standing in the gardens, wearing an iron mask.
