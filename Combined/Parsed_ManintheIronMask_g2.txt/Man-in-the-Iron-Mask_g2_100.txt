int.  michelle's apartment - night

the door opens and they move in; it is in fact empty, though
a mess.  they move to the wall, where aramis, after a little
looking, locates the levers to open the wall/door to the
king's secret passageway.  aramis enters first, the others
follow.  we half expect michelle to pop up at any moment, but
the musketeers enter the passage without incident.
