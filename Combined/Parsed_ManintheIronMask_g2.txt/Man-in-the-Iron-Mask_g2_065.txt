int.  palace - d'artagnan's room - night

d'artagnan is sitting on his cot thinking of all that has
just happened when he hears the king's shouts of alarm.

                     louis' voice
          help!

in an instant d'artagnan is reacting, snatching up his sword
and racing out into the corridor, toward the king's room.
