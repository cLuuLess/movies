ext.  palace garden - night

anne rushes through the evening, toward her little chapel in
the palace garden; she is a tragic, romantic sight, her long
hair flying behind her as she runs.

in his room, d'artagnan

anne.  now he sees her, not with her retinue of nuns, but
running to her chapel, clearly distraught...
