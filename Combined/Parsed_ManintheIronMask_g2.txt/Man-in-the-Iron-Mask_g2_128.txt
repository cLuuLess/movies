int.  the bastille - various shots

the three musketeers scramble down a flight of stairs,
through another corridor, down another stairway.  they pass
cells; wretched prisoners look up, but none of them is
phillippe.  then the musketeers surprise a jailer.

                     jailer
          hey...!

but before the man can say anything else, porthos has crushed
him like a bug against the wall.  they rip the huge ring of
keys from the jailer's waist, and take his torch.

phillippe's cell

he lies on the floor; he sees the light of a torch, coming to
him like sunrise... and then he hears a voice --

                     athos
          phillippe...?

                     phillippe
          how did you --

they open the door and release him -- from the cell, but not
from the mask.  he tries to hug athos.

they head back the way they came.
