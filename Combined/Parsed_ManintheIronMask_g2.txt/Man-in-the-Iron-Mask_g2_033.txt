int.  king's bedchamber - day

the king has just climaxed in his lovemaking, and lies spent
upon michelle.  his rest is interrupted by a knock at his
door.  the king scowls.

                     louis
          what?!

                     voice
          your majesty... it is andre.

louis groans, and pulls on a robe.  michelle whispers --

                     michelle
          shall i leave?

                     louis
          no, you may wait behind the screen.

michelle rises and slips behind a painted dressing screen as
louis goes to the door and admits the young lieutenant.

behind the screen, michelle lifts a jeweled hand mirror and
appraises her face; she begins brushing her long hair.  she
can hear the conversation...

                     lieutenant
          i would not have disturbed you,
          majesty, but you ordered me to keep
          you informed --

                     louis
          yes, yes, go on.

                     lieutenant
          athos, the former musketeer, has
          just fought with several of your
          guard, at the musketeers' gate.

behind the screen, michelle pauses at the mention of athos.

                     louis
          did they kill him?

                     lieutenant
          no.  he cut an ear from one of the
          men, no one else was hurt.  captain
          d'artagnan allowed him to leave.
          athos was upset about the death of
          his son, at the front.

crash!  from behind the screen comes the sound of the mirror,
shattering as it drops to the floor.  it startles the
lieutenant, but the king goes on...

                     louis
          who was athos seeking?  tell me!
          did he try to enter the palace?

                     lieutenant
          ... he did -- but captain d'artagnan
          blocked his way.

                     louis
          you may go, lieutenant.

the lieutenant moves back to the door.

                     lieutenant
          do you want athos arrested, your
          majesty?

                     louis
          not by you.  i will order d'artagnan
          to do it.

the lieutenant leaves, and louis moves behind the screen to
see michelle stagger and grip the dressing table; her bare
feet step onto the broken glass of the mirror, yet she is
oblivious to the cuts.  louis sees this and grabs her.

                     louis
          my dear!  the glass -- !

he pulls her to the couch and draws a blanket about her,
cuddling her as she begins to shake.

                     michelle
          did you know... about raoul?

                     louis
          i did not want to upset you.  it was
          tragic.  i did everything i could
          for him.  i ordered him positioned
          in a spot of complete safety, far
          from the fighting.  but he
          disregarded my wishes and charged
          into danger.

he cuddles her as she weeps.

                     louis
          i will order a mass for his soul.
          it will guarantee his place in
          heaven.

                     michelle
          oh louis, louis...

she clings to him in her grief.
