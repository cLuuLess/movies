int.  a cell, in the bowels of the bastille

the guards remove the hood, and phillippe sees the cell.
then he sees the blacksmith there, with a new iron mask, and
his eyes take on a fresh horror.

                     phillippe
          no.  please!  no!

the guards seize him and the blacksmith places the mask over
phillippe's face, as he screams.  they seal the mask with a
small padlock, whose key is distinctive, and jeweled.
