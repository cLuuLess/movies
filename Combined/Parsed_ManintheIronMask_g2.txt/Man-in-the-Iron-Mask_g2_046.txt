int.  the prison - day

the guards are standing in the cell, looking down at the body
now wearing the mask, the man they think was their prisoner.
the guards are quiet, alone.

                     guard 1
          you ever wonder who he was?

                     guard 2
          no... yes.  but i never asked -- and
          you better not either.

they wrap the body, still in its mask, in a weighted sack.
