ext.  chateau - morning

aramis and porthos are already loaded into the carriage, as
athos runs up.

                     athos
          where are you going?!

                     aramis
          paris.  there is still much to do.
          we'll be back soon.  be ready.

                     athos
          but aramis -- !  phillippe can learn
          in time, but --

                     aramis
          he can learn to be phillippe in
          time.  but first he must learn to be
          louis, and for that he has two more
          days.

                     athos
          what you're asking is impossible!

                     aramis
          i offer you the perfect revolution.
          a revolution without bloodshed,
          without any loss of life, even
          without treason, for he too is the
          son of the king.

                     athos
          but --

                     aramis
          you said you'd do anything, athos,
          anything to replace this king.  so
          do it.

aramis motions to the driver, who snaps the reins and drives
the horses away.

athos, wide-eyed and alone, watches the carriage roll away.
he turns back toward the house, and see's phillippe looking
out the window -- without the mask.
