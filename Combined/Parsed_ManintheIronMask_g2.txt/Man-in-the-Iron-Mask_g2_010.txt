int.  fortress prison

the man in the iron mask sits on the floor.  a key rattles in
the lock and his keeper shuffles in, carrying food.

                     keeper
          food, moron.

                     man in the iron mask
          thank you, keeper.

not watching what he's doing, the bulbous keeper trips on
something and stumbles, dropping the food.  the prisoner
jumps to his feet, concerned.

                     keeper
          look what you've done!

he picks up the tray and slings it at the prisoner.

                     man in the iron mask
          i'm sorry, keeper...

the keeper looks for what he tripped on -- a worn bible.  he
snatches it up and grabs a hunk of pages from its middle.

                     man in the iron mask
          no, keeper, it's my only book!

hearing the pleading in the prisoner's voice, the keeper
looks squarely at him -- and rips out the pages.

                     man in the iron mask
          what number did you tear out?

                     keeper
          eh?

                     man in the iron mask
          what number, on the first page?

                     keeper
          ... two-thirty-seven.

                     man in the iron mask
          two-thirty-seven:  "... and the
          descendants of japeth are these:
          obediah, zebulon, hezekiah..."

as the prisoner rattles off the names of biblical genealogy,
the jailer gawks at the pages in his hand.

                     keeper
          you've... memorized...?

                     man in the iron mask
          what was the end page?

as the keeper is speechless, the prisoner looks for himself.

                     man in the iron mask
          six-two-one:  "... though i speak
          with the tongues of men and angels,
          and have not love, i am but a
          clanging cymbal or --"

the keeper staggers in shock; the prisoner bubbles with joy.

                     man in the iron mask
          we're playing, keeper!  a game!
          take another page, any page!  keeper
          and i are playing a game!

and the prisoner takes the keeper's fat hands in his own and
begins to dance and sing.

                     man in the iron mask
          a game, a game, we're playing a --

the keeper's left arm goes rigid, and he clutches his chest
with his right hand; he drops upon the stone floor.

                     man in the iron mask
          keeper...?

the prisoner approaches the jailer; the man is stoned dead.

                     man in the iron mask
          no... no!  keeper, please, you
          cannot die!  you're my only friend!

the prisoner tries to wipe his eyes, but he can't get at
them, inside the mask.  he edges to the open door.

                     man in the iron mask
          help!  someone!  keeper is dead!

he slumps down beside the open door, and weeps.
