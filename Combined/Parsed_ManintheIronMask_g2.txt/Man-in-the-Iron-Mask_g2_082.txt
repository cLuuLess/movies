ext.  paris street - night

aramis' carriage rattles to a stop, the hooves of the horses
sounding hollow on the cobblestones.  they are near the same
area where the riots occurred; now, at night, everything
looks deserted.  aramis steps from the carriage.

                     aramis
          coming?

                     porthos
          what use am i?

                     aramis
          we go someplace dangerous.

                     porthos
          why didn't you say so?

porthos steps out with him, and aramis leads the way down a
dark, spooky alley.
