int.  the bastille - main courtyard - night

the prison courtyard is murky in the darkness, and ringed by
doors leading into mazes of corridors to its dungeons.

                     guard

          captain will see to the documents.

aramis and porthos drag athos into one of the shadowy portals
surrounding the courtyard.
