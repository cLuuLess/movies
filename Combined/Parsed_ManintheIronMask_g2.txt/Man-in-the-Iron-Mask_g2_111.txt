int.  d'artagnan's room

d'artagnan returns to his bare room; he sits down upon the
bed and drops his face into his hands.

then he hears the sound, like a scream, but short and
muffled, almost like the whelp of a kicked dog.  he lifts his
head sharply; where did that sound come from?  he is almost
too tired, too sad, to investigate.

then the king, already shaken by the night's events, hurries
into d'artagnan's room.

          what was that sound?!  did you hear
          it?  it came from michelle's room!
