int.  michelle's bedroom - night

louis leads michelle back to her room; she's a bit unsteady
from the wine; but she grows alert as she notices him closing
the door behind her.  he stares into her eyes.

                     louis
          you are beautiful.  you know you
          are.

                     michelle
          sire, i --

                     louis
          if you don't want to be so
          appealing, why did you touch the
          rose to your skin?  where was it?
          here?

he touches his lips to her throat.  she gasps, but then pulls
away.  she glances at the letter on the writing table.

                     louis
          what is it?  raoul?  if he really
          loved you, he would have proposed
          marriage.  he didn't, did he?

he sees her hesitation and uncertainty.  he's smooth, gentle.

                     louis
          you have never known love until you
          have known the love of a king.

he kisses her; for a moment she seems frozen... and then she
yields.  never having doubted that she would.  louis pulls
the gown from her shoulders.  she doesn't resist.
