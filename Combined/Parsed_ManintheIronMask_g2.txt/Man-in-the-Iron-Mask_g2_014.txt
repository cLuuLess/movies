int.  the corridor

d'artagnan approaches the queen mother, and bows.

                     d'artagnan
          m'lady...?

                     anne
          i understand you saved my son's life
          today.

                     d'artagnan
          god smiled upon us.

                     anne
          and you were not hurt?

                     d'artagnan
          no, m'lady.

                     anne
          that is good.

without a change of expression on her still beautiful but sad
face, she enters her room.
