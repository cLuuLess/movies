int.  fortress prison - day

the pink light of the new day barely penetrates the gloom of
the prison.  the boat carrying aramis and the little priest
reaches the gate of the prison, which reaches to the water
line.  as aramis steps out, guards meet them.

                     head guard
          who is this, then?

the little priest remains in the boat, slumped over.  one
guard speaks to the little priest in italian, and the little
priest seems barely able to left his head; aramis answers for
him, in italian, and the guard translates --

                     guard
          he says he's the replacement.

aramis rattles off more italian.

                     guard
          he says it is only one day a month
          when the prisoner gets confession,
          and the little one is too sick to
          move.  the big one doesn't speak
          french either.

                     head guard
          then let's get it done.

the head guard gestures to let them pass.
