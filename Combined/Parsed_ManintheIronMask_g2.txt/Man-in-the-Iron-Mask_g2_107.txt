int.  ballroom - night

as a minuet ends, claude raises his glass in a toast.

                     claude
          to king louis!  and to anne, the
          queen mother!

the guests applaud and reach for wine glasses; servants
present phillippe and anne with champagne, and they sip --

                     guests
          to king louis, and the queen mother!

everyone drinks; phillippe suddenly remembers to hold his
glass in his fingertips -- and it slips through his nervous
fingers, hitting the floor with a crash.

dead silence; everyone is looking.  then anne drops her glass
too -- and everybody does it, as if to break the glass is
part of the celebration.

as the music begins again, anne leans to phillippe --

                     anne
          i retire now.  wait two waltzes,
          then retire to your room; and spend
          the night in safety.  we have much
          to talk about, and have the rest of
          our lives to do it.

                     phillippe
          good night, mother.

                     anne
          good night... my son.

she kisses him on the cheek; it brings tears to both of them.
she moves to the door, everyone bowing as she leaves.

just outside the ballroom door

anne encounters d'artagnan.  he stops, so taken by the sight
of her that no one seeing them could miss that he loves her.

                     d'artagnan
          anne!  you look --

remembering himself, he bows deeply.

                     d'artagnan
          my queen...

                     anne
          d'artagnan.

she takes his hand, not caring who is watching.

                     d'artagnan
          i have never seen a sight more
          beautiful than you, tonight.

                     anne
          we have much to discuss.  tomorrow.

she moves off, toward her room.  d'artagnan enters the
ballroom.
