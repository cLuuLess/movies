int.  royal dining room - night

louis leads michelle into a towering room surrounding a
magnificent table, decked out with candelabra and sumptuous
delicacies -- set for just two.

the dinner

louis and michelle sit opposite each other, attended by a
dozen servants.  michelle stares at her plate.

                     louis
          the food doesn't please you?

                     michelle
          it's lovely.  it's just...

                     louis
          this is more than you are used to.
          your mother is a seamstress, your
          father is dead.  you have three
          younger sisters, two of whom suffer
          from consumption.  don't look so
          surprised, kings know such things.

                     michelle
          i... we are humble people...

                     louis
          wait, no!  do not be ashamed.  the
          straits of your family need not be
          permanent.  it is a simple matter to
          have them brought to one of my
          country estates, where they may have
          fine meals, and physicians to look
          after them.

                     michelle
          you would do that, your majesty?

                     louis
          my dear, i've already done it.

she rushes to him and throws herself at his knees, weeping in
gratitude.  louis smiles, as if embarrassed.

                     louis
          please, darling, that isn't
          necessary.  we are friends now.
          mademoiselle needs wine!

a servant quickly approaches with wine; the goblet at
michelle's place is quite large, and he pours it full.
