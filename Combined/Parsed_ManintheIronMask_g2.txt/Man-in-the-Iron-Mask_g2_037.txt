int.  the carriage - night

the three musketeers -- aramis, athos, and porthos -- have
been traveling for some time.  porthos is asleep, snoring.

                     athos
          porthos sleeps, and you plot.  don't
          you think it's time you told me what
          it is you are plotting?

                     aramis
          soon enough.  here we are.

kicking porthos' feet to wake him, aramis opens the carriage
door, and they step out...
