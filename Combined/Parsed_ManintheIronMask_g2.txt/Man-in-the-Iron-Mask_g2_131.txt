ext.  lane of elms - beside the palace - day

at the end of a lane of elms, where the markers of king's
graves stand clustered, royal workmen place a mighty marble
monument stone above the final resting place of d'artagnan.

athos, aramis, porthos, and the king -- phillippe, known as
king louis now -- stand gathered there, as aramis in his
priest's garments utters the funeral incantations.  aramis'
voice breaks as he does so.  porthos' eyes pour out rivers of
tears.  athos' grief is beyond weeping.

phillippe holds the arm of his mother.  she holds the rose
d'artagnan left her.

                     aramis
          amen.

athos moves up between aramis and porthos, and links them
with his arms.

                     athos
          he was the best of us all.

aramis and porthos move off together, to walk the lane of
elms; athos remains by the grave, unable to leave.

phillippe pats anne's arm.

                     phillippe
          i will be with you in a moment,
          mother.

she too moves down the lane of trees, touching the tip of the
rose pedals to her lips as the tears run down her face.

phillippe moves up to athos.

                     phillippe
          after all you have done, i must ask
          you one more service to your king.
          i have lost my father.  and you have
          lost your son.  let me love you like
          a son to a father.  and i pray you
          live for this, to love me like your
          son.

athos can't speak; he can only nod yes.  phillippe moves to
join his mother, leaving athos to take one final look down at
the grave.  then as athos moves off to join aramis and
porthos, we pan from the name "d'artagnan" on the stone, to
the pattern chiseled beneath the name.

it is a mask, of iron.
