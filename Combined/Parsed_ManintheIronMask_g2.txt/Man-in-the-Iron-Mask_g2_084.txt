int.  brothel - night

sleazy whores lounge around, women at the very bottom of
life.  they stir and try to look more appealing as the two
well dressed gentlemen enter.

                     porthos
          aramis... these are... these are
          whores!

                     aramis
          so was mary magdalene, and our lord
          loved her.

                     porthos
          did she have tits like that?

a greasy, disgusting pimp shuffles over.

                     pimp
          what do you want?  white?  black?
          both?

                     aramis
          no.  we want you, father belles.

the pimp reacts with fury, drawing a pistol.

                     pimp
          get out!  now!  i will kill you
          where you stand!

aramis slowly falls to his knees, before the pimp.

                     aramis
          bless me, father, for i have sinned.

the pimp -- the former father belles, the same man we saw as
the priest who prayed with the queen at the royal birth in
the opening -- shoves his pistol at aramis' face.

                     pimp
          don't!  get out!

                     aramis
          i have sinned.  and no other
          priest's assurance of forgiveness
          can mean as much as yours.  tell me
          that i can be forgiven, no matter
          what i have done.

aramis' eyes are hypnotic, staring deep into the fallen
priest's soul.  porthos is bug-eyed, certain aramis' head is
about to be blown apart.

                     porthos
          he's going to kill you, aramis.

                     aramis
          then let him kill me, if all my
          faith is wrong.

he stares at the pimp.  the pimp's finger trembles on the
trigger.

                     aramis
          i have come to help you make it
          right.  i have come to take you
          home.

the pimp shakes convulsively; he drops to his knees, bows his
head, and weeps.
