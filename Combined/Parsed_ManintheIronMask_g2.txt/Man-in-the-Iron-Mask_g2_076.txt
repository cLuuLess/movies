int.  phillippe's bedroom - night

athos enters to find phillippe in a corner of the bedroom,
slumped and ashamed in the darkness, holding the mask.

                     phillippe
          i've worn this mask so long, i
          couldn't sleep without it.

                     athos
          i will sit with you.  i can't sleep
          either.

athos settles into a chair, as phillippe lays the mask aside
on the table and closes his eyes.  athos looks toward the
flames of the fireplace, and in their dancing shadows he sees
the face of raoul.  phillippe's voice interrupts --

                     phillippe
          athos...?  thank you for being my
          guide... back into the world.

athos had not thought of it that way.  phillippe closes his
eyes again, and falls asleep.
