int.  manor house dining room - night

aramis is having dinner; he calls toward the kitchen.

                     aramis
          more wine!

athos enters and sags into a chair, his energy spent.

                     aramis
          how is he?

                     athos
          resting, he's had a long day.
          aramis --

                     aramis
               (calling out)
          more wine!!

                     athos
          you must reconsider this plan.
          phillippe is like a child, he --

                     aramis
          you can do it.

                     athos
          in a year, maybe two, i could teach
          him enough to --

                     aramis
          three days.

                     athos
          three days??!!

                     aramis
          the king is having a ball, a
          masquerade ball.  it is the perfect
          opportunity and perhaps our only
          one.  at any time phillippe could be
          discovered, and what then?  remember
          france.  remember the poor.
          remember raoul.  more wine!!  where
          are those serving girls...?
