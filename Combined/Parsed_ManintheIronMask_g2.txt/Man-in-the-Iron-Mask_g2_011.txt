int.  palace - d'artagnan's room - evening

d'artagnan's room is spartan:  a cot, and weapons laid on a
plain table.  it has a single small window, and d'artagnan
stands at it now, looking out into the palace garden below.

the guests have all gone home; the party pavilions have been
cleared away.  and now in the blue dusk, a solitary lady
walks.  she is anne of austria, the queen mother, the lady we
saw in the opening.

now, twenty years later, she is a slim frail figure.  her
clothes are drab and simple, like the dress of mourning; she
walks in silence, watched at a distance by nun attendants.

she glances up, and sees d'artagnan's form in the window.
when he sees her looking, he pulls away from the window.
