int.  queen mother's apartments - dawn

anne has changed; she is tormented, but alive with energy,
pacing.  there is a knock at her door, and the old nun opens
it to d'artagnan.  the old nun leaves them alone; d'artagnan

                     d'artagnan
          there were two.  not one.  but two.

                     anne

          to carry.

                     d'artagnan
          anne... the night we had together...
          i always wanted more.  but that one,
          it was enough.  enough to make me
          love you forever.  i want you to
          remember that... and go on.  as
          strong as you are now.  no matter
          what happens.

          d'artagnan -- ?

he looks back once more; he seems to want to tell her
something; but whatever it is, he can't find the words, and
with a last loving look at her, he walks away.
