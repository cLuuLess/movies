ext.  bastille - night

the stone walls rising into the paris night seem to ooze
evil.  the building looks impossible to get into, much less
get out of; its doors appear to be solid blocks of wood,
encased in stone ramparts.

we hear a sharp, echoing knock; aramis, athos, and porthos
stand outside the main entrance, athos slumped between the
other two like a beaten captive being delivered to jail.

no one answers their knock; the three musketeers exchange
doubtful glance, and porthos knocks again.  a guard inside
slides open a view port of the massive door.

                     porthos
          open up!  we have a prisoner!

the port shuts, bolts rattle, and the great door heaves open.
the musketeers glance at each other again, and play their
roles, aramis and porthos dragging athos inside.
