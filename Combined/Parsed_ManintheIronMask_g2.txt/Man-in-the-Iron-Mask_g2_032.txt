int./ ext.  musketeer's gate of the palace - day

the musketeer's gate is close to the stables where the
musketeers train and keep their horses.  d'artagnan hurries
from the palace and snaps an order.

                     d'artagnan
          saddle my horse!

the grooms jump to work; several young musketeers nearby stop
their training, noticing their captain's agitation.

                     d'artagnan
          hurry --

but then d'artagnan sees athos coming, riding furiously
through the musketeers' gate.  d'artagnan steps out to meet
him as athos reins in his horse and jumps from the saddle.

                     d'artagnan
          athos, my friend --

athos marches to the palace door; d'artagnan cuts him off.

                     d'artagnan
          athos, please...!

                     athos
          get out of my way.

                     d'artagnan
               (grabbing him)
          athos, i beg you --

athos punches d'artagnan with furious strength, knocking him
aside.  the young musketeers reach for their weapons, but
d'artagnan is up quickly, throwing himself in front of athos
again, blocking the doorway into the palace.

                     d'artagnan
          where are you going?

                     athos
          to kill the king.

at this, the swords of the young musketeers sing from their
scabbards.  athos wears a sword, but he has not drawn it.

                     d'artagnan
          athos!  i know life means nothing to
          you at this moment, but i will not
          let you kill yourself.

                     athos
          the king killed my son!

                     d'artagnan
          the cannons killed raoul!  the
          cannons, and love.  but not the king.

a young musketeer steps up.

                     young musketeer
          i'll kill the old man for you,
          captain, if you don't wish to --

athos spins, striking like a rattlesnake, his sword whipping
from its scabbard and slicing off the arrogant young
musketeer's ear.  he flicks another's sword from his grasp,
then brings the the point of his own blade up beneath the
chin of a third, shoving him back.

                     athos
          come on!  all of you!

d'artagnan tackles athos from behind and pins him face down
to the hay.  for a moment athos bellows in rage --

                     athos
          coward!  fight me!  fight me...!

emotion spills up into athos' throat, and he begins to sob.

                     athos
          he killed my son, d'artagnan!  he
          killed my son...!

d'artagnan, dying inside, still grips athos.  athos grows
quiet, and the young musketeers drift closer.

                     d'artagnan
          get back, all of you!

d'artagnan stands, and athos rises, still holding his sword.
he looks at d'artagnan a long beat, then sheathes his sword
and turns to his horse.  the young soldiers move to him.

                     d'artagnan
          let him go!

athos mounts his horse, and with a last glance back at
d'artagnan, he gallops away.
