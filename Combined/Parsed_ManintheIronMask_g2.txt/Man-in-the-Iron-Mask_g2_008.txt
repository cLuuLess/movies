ext.  the royal palace - gardens - day

attractive young adults strut about in the extravagant attire
of louis xiv's france, the men like peacocks, the ladies in
gowns that seem to squeeze their entire bodies up into their
bosoms.  they laugh and smile and strike courtly poses
pretending to talk with each other -- but all eyes are on the
doorway, through which the king is about to come...

just beyond that palace doorway

king louis the fourteenth is having his wardrobe adjusted by
a flock of tailors.  he is twenty-two, and would be quite
handsome, except for the total self-absorption.  he's
checking himself in a full length golden mirror as two of his
advisors, pierre and claude, try to speak with him.

                     pierre
          your majesty, i know it is a... a
          festive time, but before --

                     king louis
          the blue sash.  no, the burgundy!

                     pierre
          ... before the party begins --

                     king louis
          the party has already begun -- so
          why are you delaying me?

                     pierre
          we do not wish to delay you,
          majesty, but... as your advisors, we
          feel it is our -- our --

                     claude
          ... our duty.

                     pierre
          yes!  it is our duty to let you
          know... there are riots in paris.

                     louis
          riots?  my people live in the
          world's most beautiful city, their
          king has the grandest palaces on
          earth.  why should they feel
          anything but pride and contentment?

                     pierre
          well yes, of course, majesty, and
          i'm sure they are content... except
          that... well, they are starving.

                     louis
          sometimes the poor do grow hungry.
          but why would they riot about it?

as he says this, a replica of the matterhorn made of fruits
and meringues is carried past the window by a team of chefs.

                     pierre
          majesty... we have more than enough
          food set aside for your birthday
          celebration next week.  if we
          distributed some of that, we would
          have time to gather more before --

                     louis
          aramis!  i have been expecting you!
               (to the tailors)
          we are satisfied, that will do.

the tailors and advisors withdraw as aramis -- still in his
simple priest's robe -- strides forward and bows to the kind.

                     aramis
          your birthday celebration, your
          majesty?

                     louis
          next week.  this is a mere garden
          party -- and i wish to join it, so i
          will be brief.  i am experiencing
          resistance from the jesuits.

                     aramis
          well... perhaps you should speak
          with them, your majesty.

                     louis
          i have demanded it -- and common
          priests present themselves!  can you
          imagine the arrogance?  common
          jesuit priests try to act as my
          equals, and they refuse to reveal
          the names of anyone else in their
          order!  no one can keep secrets like
          the jesuits can, and the identity of
          their leader is the darkest secret
          they hold.  even the pope himself
          does not know who leads the jesuit
          order in france!  he suspects the
          governor general of jesuits, whoever
          he is, is angling to become pope
          himself.

                     aramis
          how can i serve you in this?

                     louis
          perhaps you can find out who this
          secret leader of the jesuits is.
          you are now a priest, but you were
          once a musketeer, serving the throne
          of france, a throne ordained of god.
          can you accept this mission, and
          keep it private?

                     aramis
          if i find out the identity of this
          jesuit rebel.  i will kill both him
          and the man who told me.

                     louis
          once a musketeer, always a
          musketeer, eh?

aramis bows and louis turns back to his mirror.  there are
mirrors everywhere in his palace, and he loves his
reflection, adorned as he is all in golden cloth, like fabric
from the sun.  aramis leaves and the advisors return.

                     louis
          ah yes, the riots.  we have food
          stocks on the wharves right now, no?

                     pierre
          that food has spoiled.  that is why
          it was not shipped to the army.

                     louis
          exactly why it should be given away.

                     pierre
          what... an excellent idea, your
          majesty!
