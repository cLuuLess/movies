int.  ballroom - night

d'artagnan sees "louis" sitting on the throne.  more baffled
than alarmed, he grabs one of the musketeer guards near him.

                     d'artagnan
          how long has the king been back?

                     guard
          some while, captain.

                     d'artagnan
          he didn't pass my doorway, i was in
          my room.

                     guard
          he must've, captain, there is no
          other way here.

d'artagnan stands and thinks; his mind begins to spin.

phillippe

sees d'artagnan, staring at him... then calling more guards
over and giving them quick instructions; the guards hurry
away.  then d'artagnan moves to phillippe, and bows.  he
looks at him carefully, but seems to see nothing unusual.

                     phillippe
          continue.

                     d'artagnan
          sire, we have an emergency -- of
          security.  i must ask you to
          accompany me.

                     phillippe
          ... the ball... continue.

                     d'artagnan
          i must insist, sire.

phillippe stands, and follows d'artagnan from the ball.
