ext.  manor house - night

aramis and athos rush through the courtyard, surrounded by
moonlight and trees, confused about where porthos is.  then
they hear bellowing scream of pain from the latrine.

swords drawn, they bang into the latrine, to find porthos
just finishing urinating.

                     porthos
          kidney rocks.  it hurts when i pee.
          it hurts when i shit.  i'm just a
          fat old fart with nothing to live
          for any more.  i'm going to hang
          myself, as soon as i'm sober.

they watch him shuffle toward the main house.
