int.  secret passageway - night

louis is angrily climbing through the passageways, back up
into the main floors of the palace, venting his emotions at
d'artagnan, just behind him; the young musketeers with
phillippe, their prisoner, follow along further back.

                     louis
          i want all these passages sealed!
          another stupid idea of my father's!
          seal them all, every one!

                     d'artagnan
          it shall be done, your majesty.

                     louis
          even the bedchamber passages!  let
          none remain!

                     d'artagnan
          yes, your majesty.

they reach a doorway, and the king bangs through it, into his
own bedchamber, still spouting anger.

                     louis
          i was told this impostor was dead!

                     d'artagnan
          ... you knew you had a double?

                     louis
          he is my brother.

d'artagnan is frozen in surprise.  phillippe and his guards
move into the room; seeing him in full light, wearing louis'
own clothes, fans louis' anger; he jumps forward and begins
ripping the royal garments off phillippe.

d'artagnan forces himself between louis and phillippe.

                     d'artagnan
          i -- i thought he was but... an
          impostor who resembled --

                     louis
          my twin.  which has kept him alive.
          until now.

                     anne's voice
          no!!

they whirl to see the queen mother, who has entered through
the main door.  she hurries to the space between her sons,
hugging phillippe, then trying to hug louis.

                     anne
          louis, please -- !

                     louis
          my guards are useless!  take her
          from me!

he motions to the young musketeers to restrain her;
reluctantly they grip the arms of the queen mother.

                     louis
          what had you to do with this,
          mother?

                     anne
          he is your brother!

                     louis
          he is nothing now.

louis draws a sword from the scabbard of one of the young
musketeers -- but d'artagnan steps between him and phillippe.

                     d'artagnan
          your majesty... this man before
          you... he is royal blood, the same
          as you.  to spill it is the one
          thing even you cannot do.  it is
          against the laws of god, and of
          france.

                     louis
          get out of my way.

                     d'artagnan
          not once have i ever asked anything
          for myself.  i ask now.  forgive
          this man, this prisoner... your
          brother.

                     louis
          forgive?!

                     d'artagnan
          aramis, porthos and athos too.  i
          know what they have done was a
          threat against you -- and yet that
          threat has been removed, with no
          harm coming to your majesty.  if
          their passions were in error, their
          spirits have ever been noble.
          forgive them.

                     louis
          they have plotted against me!  me!
          the embodiment of god's will!

d'artagnan sinks to his knees before the king.

                     d'artagnan
          your majesty... every day of your
          life, i have watched over you.  no
          angel could have stood a more
          faithful vigil.  i have bled for
          you, and have prayed, every day, to
          see you become greater than your
          office, better than the law.  show
          me now what my faith and blood have
          purchased.  show mercy.

the words cut into everyone:  anne, phillippe, the young
musketeers.  but louis' eyes are cold, as he responds --

                     louis
          you take the side of traitors?

                     phillippe
          please, may i speak?  m'lord... i
          beg that you kill me.  i release
          you, before almighty god, from any
          claim of sin in taking my life.  in
          fact i will pray that god reward you
          for your mercy to do it.  but do not
          -- i beg you -- return me to the
          prison, where i have lived so long.

phillippe's plea makes louis pause... then smile.

                     louis
          d'artagnan, you will hunt down
          aramis, porthos and athos, and bring
          me their heads, or i will have
          yours.  and as for you, phillippe...
          back to the prison you shall go, and
          into the mask you hate.

                     anne
          no, louis!  no!

                     louis
          wear it until you love it.  and die
          in it!!

anne screams, and louis waves to the guards, who draw her
from the room, as d'artagnan sags, on his knees before the
king he has served so faithfully.

slowly, phillippe lowers his head.
