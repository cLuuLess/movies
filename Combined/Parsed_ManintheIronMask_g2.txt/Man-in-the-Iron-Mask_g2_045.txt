ext.  the coastline - day

athos and porthos stand as the boat reaches the shore, and
tucks in among the rocks.  sheltered from the view from the
prison, aramis steps from the boat and removes his robes.

the prisoner dangles, tied wrist and ankle, from around
aramis' neck.

                     athos
          my god...

athos, porthos, and the others gawk at the sight of the man
in the iron mask, as aramis loosens the ropes.  as they back
away from him, he sees the sky.  endless blue -- and bright.
he shields his eyes.

                     aramis
          it's all right.  take your time.

aramis helps him up, and turn him slowly around, to face...

the fortress/prison, in the distance.

the prisoner's pov from within the mask:  a vast vista -- the
sky, the sea, and the prison on the island in the middle of
it all.  the prisoner falls to his knees, and weeps.

                     aramis
          athos... he needs a gentle hand.

athos moves over hesitantly, and puts his hand on the
shoulder of the man in the iron mask, who holds his hands
against the mask as if to further hide his shame.
