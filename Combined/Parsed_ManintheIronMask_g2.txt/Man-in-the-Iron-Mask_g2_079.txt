int.  manor house - dining room - day

athos and phillippe are having breakfast.

                     athos
          no, wait, do not hold your goblet
          that way.  with a king it is... so.

he shows him, pinching the goblet between thumb and
forefinger, as the other three fingers extend daintily.

                     athos
          it is not to be dainty.  servants
          have touched the king's goblet, so
          he will touch it as little as
          possible.

phillippe tries it and the goblet slips from his fingers,
crashing onto his plate and spilling onto everything.

                     phillippe
          i am so sorry!  forgive me, i --

                     athos
          no!  do not be sorry!  never be
          sorry!  the king cares for nothing
          and for no one!  there are no
          mistakes when you are king!  what
          you do is right for every person!  a
          king has contempt for everyone!

                     phillippe
          is that the king of king you wish me
          to be?  or do you say this because
          of your son?

                     athos
          how did you know -- ?

                     phillippe
          porthos told me.

for a moment athos can say nothing; then he shoves back from
the table and storms from the room.
