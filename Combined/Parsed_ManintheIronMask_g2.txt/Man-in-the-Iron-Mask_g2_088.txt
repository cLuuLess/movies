athos and phillippe sit at a table in the shade of a tree; on
the table is a model of the palace which athos is using to
drill phillippe on the palace's layout.

                     athos
          these rooms are yours.  up these
          stairs -- or through this hidden
          passage -- is the room of your
          mistress... michelle.

                     phillippe
          whose rooms are those?

                     athos
          your mother's.

they are interrupted as the carriage bearing aramis and
porthos clatters in.  aramis is out immediately.

                     aramis
          change the horses!  clear out
          everything!  now!!
