int.  palace - michelle's new room - day

michelle stands before the mirror, staring at herself,
breaktakingly gorgeous in her new dress.  she stares for a
long time, surprised at her own beauty.

she reaches to a vase of roses and pulls one out, blotting it
around her neck, perfuming herself with its fragrance.  she
looks into the mirror, at her eyes... in guilt for what she
is already feeling, she lifts raoul's letter to read it
again.  then she gasps -- the king stands right before her.

                     michelle
          sire!  i -- how did you --

                     louis
          how did i get in?  you're new here,
          and will soon learn many secrets.
          what is that?

                     michelle
          ... nothing.

                     louis
          a letter.  may i see?

he takes the letter; she has no resistance against him.  the
king reads, his eyes hardening suddenly; but then he smiles.

                     louis
          from raoul.  he urges you to guard
          your honor -- as if it could be in
          any danger... from your king.

                     michelle
          raoul... is in love...

                     louis
          enough of this, our dinner waits.

tossing the letter aside, he offers her his arm.  she takes
it and allows him to escort her from the room.
