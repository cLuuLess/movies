int.  the manor house's main dining room - day

aramis and porthos are sitting at the table when athos ushers
in --

phillippe, cleaned up

the change in him is remarkable, and his face so identical to
the king's that porthos actually jumps.  phillippe takes a
seat opposite aramis, and looks around, wary, vulnerable.

                     aramis
          yes.  identical.

aramis' eyes are aflame as he looks across at phillippe.

                     aramis
          the greatest secret of life is who
          we truly are.  now i must give you
          that secret, which has been kept
          from you your whole life.  it began
          on the night when louis was born.

                     porthos
          i remember that night.  d'artagnan
          was drunk, the only time i've seen
          him that way.  the three of us were
          reveling, remember, athos?

                     aramis
          but i was on duty...

in flashback...

we see the shadowy musketeer we saw in the opening, moving up
the dark steps of the palace.  we see now it was aramis.

                     aramis' voice
          i was summoned to the royal
          apartments.  arrange a carriage,
          they told me, and wait by the door
          of the stables.

intercut flashback

we see images of that night, as we saw in the opening.

                     aramis' voice
          they brought a baby from the back of
          the palace, into the black carriage
          i had waiting.  they had given the
          driver instructions about where it
          was, and i was ordered to make the
          whole journey with the blinds of the
          carriage drawn.

in the flashback we see the young musketeer aramis, his face
shielded in shadow, handing a living bundle over to someone
at one of the back doors of a large country house.

                     aramis' voice
          i carried that baby into the
          countryside, to a chateau, like this
          one.  and there i left him.

aramis in the present

                     aramis
          i have never forgotten that night,
          or what i carried.

                     porthos
          i don't understand.  what does this
          have to do with...?  you carried a
          baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --

                     aramis
          not just a baby, porthos.  i carried
          the child of the king.

                     porthos
          the child of the king is... the
          king.  louis!

                     aramis
          no, not louis!

                     porthos
          athos, do you understand this?  he
          confuses me --

                     aramis
          i carried the king's child!  the
          queen had twins that night, and one
          of them was sent away, in secret!

                     porthos
          but why?

                     aramis
          because the old king had a twin as
          well, and through his whole reign
          his brother fought him for the
          throne.  then he had two heirs, not
          just sons but twins.  so he decided
          that one be put away, as if he never
          existed.  you, phillippe.

phillippe is pale... we dissolve to a flashback of
phillippe's early education in the country house.

                     aramis' voice
          the old king ordered you be educated
          and well treated, but your identity
          kept from you and all those around
          you.

the flashback moves to the palace, matching the narration --

                     aramis' voice
          on his death bed, he revealed your
          existence to louis and your mother.
          your mother had been told by her own
          priest that you had died at birth.
          somehow she blamed herself for ever
          believing it, and she wished to
          restore your birthright.  but now
          louis was king.

we see in flashback louis wearing his new crown, plotting.

                     aramis' voice
          a priest, even a pope, he could kill
          without hesitation, but he was
          afraid to kill you, for his whole
          claim to power rests on the sanctity
          of royal blood.  so he had you
          hidden in a way that only a monster
          could devise.  i know, for it was i
          who took you to prison, and the iron
          mask.  someday i will ask your
          forgiveness.  but not until we have
          restored to you what is yours.

we are in present time again.  all eyes are on phillippe.

                     phillippe
          restored...?

                     aramis
          we will replace louis with
          phillippe.  no one but the king
          himself -- and now we -- knows
          phillippe even exists.  all we have
          to do is switch them.

                     athos
          switch?!  that is your plan?  it is
          ludicrous!

                     aramis
          i have it all worked out.

                     athos
          physical resemblance is but one
          small thing!  louis has an
          arrogance, a manner --

                     aramis
          those can be adopted --

                     athos
          and people close to him, who --

                     aramis
          do you think i have not considered
          that?  i have a plan -- and you may
          rest assured that it is brilliant!

                     athos
          it is not just our lives you risk
          with this conceit of yours!  it is
          phillippe's as well!

                     aramis
          yes, and he has a choice!

aramis stops thundering at athos, and turns to phillippe.

                     aramis
          what about it, phillippe?!  all that
          time in prison, all that time you
          suffered, was it for nothing?!  you
          memorized the entire bible, or so
          your priest told me!  an act of
          survival, of defiance, of courage!
          your years within the mask have
          given you reserves of strength that
          others could not imagine.  your home
          was a dungeon and now you may be a
          king, if you have the heart to make
          it so!  do you have the heart?

phillippe stands shakily, and faces them.

                     phillippe
          i will try.

phillippe walks -- nearly wanders -- from the room.

                     aramis
          you see?  a king.

athos, with a glare at aramis, follows phillippe.
