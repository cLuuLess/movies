int.  bastille - later

the two guards and the blacksmith are coming downstairs after
completing their work.  far above them, in the prison tower,
the cries of the prisoner echo; he sounds like a raving
madman now.

the two guards and the blacksmith enter an office at the base
of the tower; the bastille jailer looks up.

                     blacksmith
          pay me quick, i want out of here.

soldiers, swords drawn, appear in the doorway behind them.

                     guards
          what --

                     bastille jailer
          you saw the prisoner's face.

understanding, the blacksmith raises his hammer toward the
soldiers; but he is stabbed in the back by the jailer, and
the soldiers skewer the two guards who helped him.  a soldier
lifts the jeweled key from the hand of a dead guard.

the key

is handed to the king by andre, the young lieutenant.  louis
hangs the key around his own neck, with a thin gold chain.

                     louis
          now.  where is d'artagnan?

                     lieutenant
          out directing the search for the
          traitors.

                     louis
          when he returns, watch him.  when he
          leaves again, you tell me.

the lieutenant bows.  louis smiles, and fingers the key.
