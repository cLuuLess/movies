int.  the palace - the queen mother's room - night

anne paces in her room, her hands trembling, her beautiful
lips quivering with tortured emotion.  with a sudden impulse
she bolts from her room, through the outer room where her
attendants sit, and into the corridor.

                     nun
          m'lady...?

the eldest nun follows her.
