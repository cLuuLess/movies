ext.  establishing the island fortress prison - day

on a gash of rock thrusting upward from the sea along the
southern coast of france stands an island fortress, a prison,
like an alcatraz of the mediterranean.  just off a coastline
renowned for its beauty, the fortress is horrible and
foreboding.  as we superimpose:

                            1662
                   twenty-two years later
