int.  catacombs

the three musketeers struggle through the catacombs, reach
the chapel, and fall gasping to the floor.

                     aramis
          bloody hell...

                     athos
          we can't... stay here.  that traitor
          d'artagnan... knows about this
          place.

                     porthos
          can we eat... before we go?  this
          excitement's given me an appetite.

                     aramis
          bread and wine... in that cupboard.

porthos hauls himself to his feet and turns up the wick of
the lantern.  the rising light reveals a note, stuck to the
cupboard with the blade of a dagger.

                     porthos
          a note.  pinned with a dagger, like
          the old days.

he removes the note, and reads...

                     porthos
          "phillippe has been removed to the
          bastille, to the lower dungeon.  at
          midnight tonight i will order the
          guard changed, and will delay the
          replacements for ten minutes.  that
          should give you ample time.  never
          have i needed more to say:  one for
          all, and all for one.  d'artagnan."

                     athos
          he lures us to capture.

                     aramis
          he seeks redemption.

                     athos
          you're a fool!

                     aramis
          perhaps.  but of d'artagnan i am
          certain.  what he did tonight was
          what he told us all along he would
          do -- be faithful to his king.

                     athos
          so what has changed?

                     aramis
          perhaps he serves a different king.

                     porthos
          what choice is there?  if phillippe
          is in the bastille, then to the
          bastille we will go.

                     athos
          you are right.  but it is a trap.

                     porthos
          so what?  i'd rather die covered in
          blood, than an old man, lying in my
          own piss.

                     aramis
          then to the bastille.

                     athos
          to the bastille.  and death.
