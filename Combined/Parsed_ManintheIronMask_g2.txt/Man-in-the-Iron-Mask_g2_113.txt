int.  king's bedchamber

the king is pacing as d'artagnan reappears.

                     louis
          where is michelle?

                     d'artagnan
          there.

he points to the window.  louis shoves open the drapes and
leaps back in horror.  michelle has hanged herself outside
louis' window, the golden bunting of her bed tied as a noose
around her neck.
