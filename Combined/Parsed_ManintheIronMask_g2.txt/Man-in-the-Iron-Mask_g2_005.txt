int.  priests' residence - a stairway - day

four people are moving up a winding stairway; three are
women, bosoms spilling from their gaudy dresses; the fourth
is porthos, the former musketeer, now a nobleman of great
wealth and even greater girth.  he and the women are drinking
wine as they stagger up the stairs, the women towing porthos
like rowboats tugging a ship to dock.  porthos is not so
drunk that his hands fail to find pleasant places to grip
their bodies as they walk and giggle.

                     porthos
          ah ha!  here we are!  aramis!
          porthos is here!

they reach a doorway.  porthos kicks it open, staggers back,
and begins shoving the women inside.
