int.  the king's bedchamber - night

louis reaches the bottom of the stairs, disguised behind a
similar wardrobe in his own bedroom.  he steps out -- and is
startled as the lifesize portrait of louis xiii on the other
side of the room opens to admit d'artagnan.

                     louis
          aaa!  d'artagnan!  these passages
          were constructed for the king's
          security, not so you could step from
          my father's portrait and startle me
          to death!

                     d'artagnan
          it is for your security that i have
          come, your majesty -- for the
          security of your honor.

                     louis
          i already know about the riots,
          d'artagnan, i heard them out there
          whispering.  some fool gave the
          order to distribute rotten food.  i
          will deal with it tomorrow.

                     d'artagnan
          then there is one more thing, of an
          even more personal nature.

                     louis
          a personal nature?

                     d'artagnan
          mademoiselle michelle beaufort.  she
          is betrothed to raoul, the son of
          athos the musketeer, who has served
          france through many tribulations.

the king begins to eat from the food laid out on the table.

                     louis
          betrothed?  i think not.

                     d'artagnan
          in his mind, anyway, and soon enough
          in hers.  she had written him many
          letters of love.

the king pokes at his food.

                     louis
          miss beaufort has accepted our
          invitation.  by this we can only
          suppose that she wishes to come --
          as we wish her to be here.

                     d'artagnan
          your majesty has had many women --

                     louis
          that is my desire, and my desire is
          what should concern you, not the
          sentiments of some commoner!

                     d'artagnan
          it is not raoul's heart alone that
          concerns me.  it is yours.  i know
          you find women compliant --
          especially the poorer ones like
          michelle.  but do they love you?  do
          you love them?  what about a queen
          to love?  a son of your own?

                     louis
          what quaint notions, d'artagnan!
          but they contradict my father, who
          picked his queen when he was old,
          and only then to bear me.

                     d'artagnan
          there is more to love than he knew,
          or that you know.

                     louis
          you dare criticize my father?!  or
          lecture me?!

                     d'artagnan
          not criticize -- plead.  love.  love
          your people, and you will not bear
          to see them hungry.  love women, and
          they will love you.  love yourself,
          and --

                     louis
          that is enough!  you are a good
          servant, d'artagnan, but you forget
          your place!

                     d'artagnan
          at least help raoul.

                     louis
          silence!  i order you!

                     d'artagnan
          order fromberge to keep him in
          safety!  it is the least you can do,
          to protect your own honor!

                     louis
          i will consider it.  now leave me.

                     d'artagnan
          thank you, your majesty.

d'artagnan bows, steps to the lifesize portrait of louis
xiii, touches a hidden button on its frame and moves into the
secret passage the painting reveals as it swings open.

                                                  cut to:

close on pierre's face...

he is sweating, exceptionally pale, as he tries to project
his voice past a huge lump in his throat...

                     pierre
          ... and i only say that... the
          rotten food was... all my fault...
          and i take... full responsibility...
          and beg the forgiveness of you all.

he steps back, having accomplished something terrifically
difficult, and glances toward

the king

who steps to his advisor and shakes his hand, whispering
quietly...

                     louis
          well done, pierre.  it will be good
          for your soul, that you have taken
          responsibility for your errors.  and
          don't worry, i will look after your
          family.

pierre can only nod... he takes two steps, kneels, crosses
himself, and places his head between two upright rails of

the guillotine

the king, pierre, and other attendants are standing on a
platform before a crowd of parisians.  the blade drops,
pierre's head hits the basket, the crowd cheers.

the king raises his hands to quiet the crowd.

                     louis
          do not rejoice -- but know that your
          king does not tolerate blunders that
          hurt his beloved people.  more food
          is on its way, and my advisors tell
          me the new harvests are sure to be
          bountiful!

he shoots a glance at his advisors, and they are pale from
the display they've just witnessed.

                     louis
          and i have new joys to announce to
          you!  today we decree a fresh glory
          for paris, and for all of france!
          the laying of the foundations to
          expand versailles, and make it truly
          a palace of the sun!

the advisors all applaud furiously, but from the crowd there
is almost no reaction at all; the triple ranks of soldiers
surrounding the square discourage any protest, and as the
king leaves the platform the crowd begins to melt away.

near the platform

aramis, watching the crowd disperse, hears behind him --

                     voice
          aramis.

aramis turns to see the king, who moves up alone.

                     aramis
          your majesty...

                     louis
          how goes that favor i asked of you?

                     aramis
          i grow closer to my target, your
          majesty.

                     louis
          you bring me the heart of the jesuit
          general, and you will have a palace
          of your own.

the king moves away, followed by his fawning advisors.
