int.  king's bedchamber - night

the king is lying on the bed; we see him from the pov of
someone approaching him slowly, silently.  when his eyes open
in panic, it is too late... we see aramis, athos, porthos
from the king's pov as they swarm him.

                     aramis
          it is judgment day.

his fist drops into frame... louis loses consciousness.

louis' pov

as consciousness returns.  he see phillippe in louis'
clothes.  aramis, athos and porthos bow and say...

                     musketeers
          your majesty.

louis, still on his bed, now wears phillippe's clothes.

                     louis
          wh-- wha--

                     aramis
          don't look so shocked, phillippe.
          come, you're going back to prison.

                     louis
          phillippe?!  why do you call me --

now louis understands everything.  he tries to struggle, but
instantly porthos shoves a rag into his mouth.

aramis opens the main door a crack, and sees d'artagnan has
entered his room down the corridor, through whose open door
he can guard the approaches to the king's rooms.  aramis
shuts the door again and turns to the others.

                     aramis
          d'artagnan guards the hallway!  you
          must go back the way we came!

athos puts his hands on phillippe's shoulders.

                     athos
          now, your majesty.  it is time.

aramis and porthos bow again to phillippe -- now dressed and
looking exactly like the king.  phillippe's mouth is dry; he
swallows hard, and follows athos up the hidden stairs.
