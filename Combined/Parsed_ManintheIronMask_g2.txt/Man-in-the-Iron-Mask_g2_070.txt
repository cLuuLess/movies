ext.  manor house gardens - day

the gardens are sun drenched, bursting with the beauty of a
french summer.  athos finds phillippe there, sitting alone.

                     athos
          recent hours have been a shock.

                     phillippe
          perhaps not as much as you might
          imagine.  when tutors answered every
          question except those about who i
          was.  when i was imprisoned in a way
          no other man had ever been, i knew
          there was something different about
          me.  but a king...

                     athos
          phillippe... there is something i
          hope you understand.  terrible
          cruelty has been used against you.
          and... you must understand that you
          did nothing to deserve it.

                     phillippe
          there is... wrath... in me.  i have
          learned to hide it.  those years in
          the cell, i dreamed that freedom
          would someday just happen, the way
          the mask happened.  now i am free.
          and with each free breath i feel the
          growing desire to make someone
          suffer for all i lost.  look at
          this, all this that for ten years i
          could not see!  what if i become a
          king -- a king no different from my
          brother?

                     athos
          the desire for vengeance... can be a
          poison.

                     phillippe
          what is its antidote?

                     athos
          i suppose... it is to remember there
          are many people who have never been
          in a prison, who pass such beauty
          every day, and never see it.

phillippe reaches to a flower, plucks it, and smells it.  he
looks around at the beauty of the garden, taking it all in.
athos looks around too; then athos realizes phillippe is no
longer looking at the garden, but at him.

                     phillippe
          you look so sad.  is it something i
          have done?

                     athos
          it is something i have done -- or
          did not do.

                     phillippe
          what is that?

                     athos
          i did not share beauty with
          someone... who is no longer here for
          me to share beauty with.

before phillippe can pursue this, athos turns businesslike.

                     athos
          we have much to do, we'd best get
          started.  now suppose you were to
          walk into a garden, as a king...
