int.  country manor house - front room - night

aramis is digging into a hearty meal, while porthos only
stares at his plate.

                     aramis
          see?  there is plenty of food in the
          country.  but the king keeps it
          going to the army instead of --

athos marches in, all business.

                     athos
          he is sleeping.  now see here,
          aramis, it's time you told us --

he breaks off as a voluptuous serving girl leans over to
spoon food onto porthos' plate; her breasts jiggle below his
nose, and she gives him a smile.

                     porthos
          i have no appetite for food, i am
          wasting away.  say goodbye to
          porthos, for he is gone.  even women
          don't interest me now.

the girl moves to whisper with two other serving girls, who
seem fascinated with the roguish porthos; their giggles and
winks make porthos even more morose; he tells his friends...

                     porthos
          i tell you a secret.  i sleep with
          three women at once, not because my
          appetite is so great, but because
          now it take three to excite me.

porthos heaves himself to his feet and shuffles off; aramis
sighs, having heard all this before.  athos sits down.

                     athos
          who is he, aramis?

                     aramis
          tomorrow.

                     athos
          tonight!  right now!  we steal a man
          from a royal prison, we hide in a
          country chateau among an assortment
          of saints and sluts such as only you
          could provide, and still you wish to
          tell me nothing?!

                     aramis
          you seek facts, when it would be
          better to seek truth.

                     athos
          you are not my priest, aramis!  you
          would not be, even if i had one.

                     aramis
          you are bitter, athos.  you are torn
          by grief, not only for raoul, but
          for d'artagnan, whom you love, and
          now treat as an enemy.

                     athos
          he who is not with us is against us.

                     aramis
          those are the words of a broken
          spirit.  my spirit is whole.  i have
          trusted d'artagnan with my deepest
          secrets, and i will never believe
          he is my enemy.

                     athos
          then you are a fool -- a fool who
          has never lost a son.  what gives
          you the right to judge me, to play
          god with the lives of others?  is it
          because you are so much holier than
          everyone else?!

                     aramis
          there is that, of course -- but
          mainly it is because i am so much
          smarter than everyone else.

they are interrupted by porthos' bloodcurdling scream.

                     aramis
          porthos?!

he draws his sword and runs for the outside.
