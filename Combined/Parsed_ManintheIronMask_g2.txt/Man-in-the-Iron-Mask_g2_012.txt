d'artagnan's room is along the same corridor as the royal
apartments.  d'artagnan sits at the small table, going over
paperwork.  through his open door he sees that anne and her
attendants are filing along in the corridor, and he rivets
his eyes back to his work.

in the corridor

anne reaches the door to her apartment, and looks back to
where d'artagnan's door is open.
