int.  chateau bedroom - night

we pan from the window to the bed... where porthos is making
love -- or trying to.  we see his huge, bare, broad back,
blotting out all view of his partner.  he grunts, then roles
over in despair -- revealing not one but three serving girls
lying beneath him, jammed side-by-side like firewood, all
nearly smothered by porthos' bulk.

                     porthos
          it's no use.  my sword is bent.

                     serving woman
          it'll be all right.  you're just
          taking a while to get started.

                     porthos
          no, it's dead.  i am useless.

porthos heaves himself out of bed.
