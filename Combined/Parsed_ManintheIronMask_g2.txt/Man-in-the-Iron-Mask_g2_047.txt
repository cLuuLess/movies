ext.  prison - day

the prison's warden general stands at the wall of the
fortress high above the sea and watches as his guards throw
off the body, wrapped in canvas weighted with stones.  as the
corpse makes a long fall and crashes into the sea, the warden
writes a message on a royal scroll:

               the unseen prisoner is dead.

the warden seals the scroll and hands it to a messenger.
