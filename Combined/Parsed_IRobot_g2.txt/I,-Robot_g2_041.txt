                 like i said, sir -- we have one
                 hundred fully assembled ns-2s
                 housed here. that's our capacity.
                 last week we had one hundred.
                 yesterday we had one hundred --

     spooner, slowing.   finally spotting what he was looking for.

     a gap.   on the assembly belt.    one leg missing.

                 well today you have one-hundred and
                 one.
