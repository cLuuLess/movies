45   int. assembly room - continuous                               45

     ...the assembly room. every surface looking like part of a
     great glass and metal machine. endless high-tech planes
     holding robots in various states of assembly. the deafening
     roar of the assembly line as it slides, rotates, and gnashes
     metal bodies...

     spooner.   motioning calvin to stay behind him.   as they
     descend.   into the cavernous room.

     and enter. a narrow corridor of bodies. sliding past them.
     brushing shoulders, thighs, hands. spooner. wiping sweat
     from his brow. trying. to pivot himself...

     when the room. suddenly rearranges itself. another line of
     robots. descending between spooner and calvin. cutting them
     off from one another...

     spooner. catching glimpses of calvin. on the other side of
     the metal bodies. trying. to cut through. his heart.
     starting to pound. as calvin. disappears...

     he swivels round. but another line of robots. drops down.
     cutting him off. he stumbles back. as another line.
     appears before him...

     breathing. getting heavier. he looks down at his hand.
     it's trembling. noise crashing, all around him. everywhere
     he turns. more robots...blank eyes...gaping mouths...

     he darts through the line. finds a wall. leaning against
     it, pulls a small bottle from his pocket. rips off the lid.
     shakes out a couple pills. swallows them. staring down. at
     his trembling hand. squeezing his eyes. open and shut...

     when suddenly. a passing robot. grabs him by the collar.
     smashing him against the wall. it's the suspect. spooner.
     sinks to the ground. as the suspect robot. slips off the
     line. standing. over him. raising his arms. could end it.
     right now. but looks. into spooner's eyes...

     then turns.   disappearing.

     spooner. stunned for a second. then. rallies. scrambles
     to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies. hears
     a pounding. in the distance. catches a glimpse. of the
     robot. trying to smash through a large security door. with
     his metal fists...

     spooner's view. blocked once again.   by a shifting row.
     when a hand. lands on his shoulder.   he wheels round.

                                                                 37.


     to find calvin. takes her by the arm.     and forces them
     through a line...

     emerging into the open. the robot. still pounding.
     desperate. like a trapped animal...

                          calvin
                now what do we do?

                          spooner
                i've already done it.

     and suddenly, the massive security door rises...
