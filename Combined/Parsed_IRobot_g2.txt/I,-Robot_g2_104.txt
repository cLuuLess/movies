105   ext. wasteland - junkyard - continuous                         105

      ...massive power lines. running from horizon to horizon.
      spooner slides down some loose shale. begins to walk along
      the line. electricity. crackling in the air.

      he squints. into the darkness. nothing around him. until.
      he hears. something. the grating. of mechanical joints.
      he stops. not sure. if that's what he heard.

      not moving.   a muscle. when he hears. the sound again.
      behind him.   swings around. cocking his gun. sees...

      glowing eyes.   appear.   then recede.   into the darkness.

                            spooner
                 police!   show yourself!

      nothing. then. that sound again.      of metallic joints.     as a
      robot. suddenly emerges...

                           spooner
                 come out where i can see you!

      another robot steps out into the light. spooner, pointing
      his gun at one robot. then the other. then...

      a third and fourth appear.    surrounding him.   they start
      moving towards him...

      spooner. stumbling back. panic. rising in him like a wave.
      trips over a rock, falling to the ground. his gun fires.
      the shot echoing through the night...

      the first robot turns, awkwardly. revealing a broken arm,
      hanging off its side. another robot teeters on one leg with
      a tick tick tick...walking back the way it came.

                                                              79.


      spooner. confused. sweeps his flashlight. all around him.
      the beam. illuminating the shell of a couple cars. some
      rusted machinery.

      spooner. shaking his head. seeing more and more repair shop
      junk. piled up around him. his expression, hardening.
      anger giving way to embarrassment. then. he laughs. a
      laugh of loathing and self-pity.

      another broken robot, lumbering towards him.

                           hybrid robot
                 welcome home...zzz...sir.
                 how...zzz was your day?...

                           spooner
                 great. i'm in a junkyard.
                     (into the air)
                 "a place where robots meet." a
                 place where i'm losing my mind!

                           hybrid robot
                 very good...zzz...sir...

      spooner. sitting down on the ground. hopeless. lost. a
      robotic hand. crawling across the gravel next to him.
      dragging part of an arm behind it. its metal fingers moving
      like some sick metal spider. spooner stares at it for a
      moment. disturbed...

      when. something glitters. in the distance. the moonlight.
      revealing a strangely-shaped building. something familiar
      about it.

      spooner. pulls out sonny's drawing. a landscape with the
      same strangely-shaped building to one side.
