49   int. holding cell - early morning                               49

     spooner enters. pulls out a chair and drags it far from the
     table. he's been jumped too many times by this machine.

     four mounted cameras whir to life.     the robot.   perfectly
     still.

                          spooner
                    (sitting)
                identify.

     the robot tilts its head with a muted whir.     as if it doesn't
     understand him. spooner. disdainful.

                                                        39.


                       spooner
             you are an ns-2 nestor-class robot.
             your primary function is to perform
             the tasks assigned to you.
             identify.

                       the robot
             i am an ns-2 nestor-class robot.
             my primary function --

                       spooner
                 (interrupting)
             cancel. perform task.

spooner wings a file onto the table. it comes to a stop near
the robot. the robot, lifts one of its hands. gently
resting its metal fingers on top of the file. then opens it.

a stack of pictures.     hogenmiller's corpse.

                         spooner
             describe.

the robot's emotionless face studies the grim images.

                       spooner
             you have over 10,000 words stored
             in your memory. one third of those
             are adjectives. describe.

nothing.

                       spooner
             why don't i take a crack? heinrich
             hogenmiller, your creator. with a
             bullet in his brain. a bullet you
             put there.

the robot.   looks up at spooner.

                       spooner
             cold-blooded murder is a pretty new
             trick for a robot, don't you think?
             answer.

the robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across
the table. spooner. crosses his arms.

                       spooner
             maybe you're stonewalling me.
             maybe you're sitting there right
             now thinking, "this guy's a
             complete asshole." that it?

                                                      40.


still nothing.

                      spooner
           come on.   am i right?

                     the robot
           yes. you are right.      you are a
           complete asshole.

and for a moment, spooner is shocked. you can see it in his
eyes. he sits back in his chair. forcing a tight smile.

                     spooner
           okay. i guess that's a start. now
           maybe you can tell me what you were
           doing hiding five feet away from
           hogenmiller's corpse?

                     the robot
           i was frightened.

                     spooner
           frightened. why do you suppose dr.
           hogenmiller would create a robot
           that could simulate fear?

                     the robot
           i don't know.

                     spooner
           doesn't seem like a very useful
           thing for a robot to have.

                     the robot
           i don't know why.

                     spooner
           i wouldn't want my toaster to be
           frightened. or my vacuum cleaner --

suddenly the robot slams its metal hands down on the table.

                     the robot
           i don't know!

spooner flinches.   slightly.

                     spooner
           looks like you can simulate other
           emotional states. i think that
           one's called "anger." have you
           ever simulated anger before?

                                                         41.


the robot doesn't respond.

                     spooner
           answer me, robot.

                     the robot
           my name is sonny.

                     spooner
               (amused)
           so we're naming you now.

                     sonny
           dr. hogenmiller would make me
           sleep.

                     spooner
           you mean he'd turn you off.

                       sonny
           yes.

                     spooner
           and you didn't like being turned
           off. so one day you decided to
           stop him.

                       sonny
           no.

                     spooner
           you found his gun, pointed it at
           his head. and pulled the trigger.

sonny shakes his head.    faster and faster.   getting upset.

                       sonny
           no.

                     spooner
           you put a bullet in the brain of
           the man who made you.

                       sonny
           no!    i could never hurt anyone!

                     spooner
           but you tried to hurt me.    you took
           a shot at me.

                     sonny
           my aim is perfect. if i'd wanted
           to hit you, i would have.

                                                              42.


     spooner's expression hardens.

                          spooner
                why would the man who wrote the
                laws of robotics build a machine
                that violates them?

                          sonny
                the laws say i can protect my own
                existence.

                          spooner
                only if that protection doesn't
                harm a human being.

     a short pause.   sonny.   tilts his head.

                          sonny
                that doesn't seem fair, does it?

     spooner. stares at him. just as...the door swings open.
     bergin enters. sticks his head in.

                          lt. bergin
                i need you outside.

     spooner.   not wanting to go.   not wanting to stay.   gets
     up...

                          sonny
                detective.

     he stops. turns back to the robot.      it looks up at him.    for
     a moment -- so human...

                          sonny
                i did not kill him.

                          spooner
                you were the only one in the room.
                if you didn't, who did?

     he turns and heads out the door.
