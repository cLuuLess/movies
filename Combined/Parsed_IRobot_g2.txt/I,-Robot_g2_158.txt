159   ext. maintenance exit - u.s. robotics - night                159

      spooner, calvin and sonny emerging from an out-of-the-way
      maintenance exit. all looking the worse for wear. spooner.
      turns to sonny.

                           spooner
                 why'd you come back, sonny? i
                 thought you weren't programmed with
                 the three laws.

                                                  108.


                     sonny
           let's just say i wrote some of my
           own laws today, detective: a robot
           must protect a friend from
           harm...as long as he's not a
           complete asshole.

spooner smiles.

                     spooner
           well, that's certainly a start,
           sonny.

sonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too.

                      sonny
           sonny.   you called me sonny.

                     spooner
           don't get used to it.

sonny, holds out his hand. spooner. looks at it. then
takes it. close on their two metal hands. locked in a
handshake.

                     sonny
           detective spooner, i...

                     spooner
               (anticipating)
           let's just save the thanks, okay?

sonny nods.   looks out at the city scape.

                     sonny
           i don't know what i'm going to do
           now.

                     spooner
           good -- that's one of the perks of
           freedom.

sonny looks at him. grateful. looks at calvin. then
hesitates. turns. and hurries off across the plaza.

calvin and spooner.   watching them go.

                     spooner
           you're going to have a hell of a
           time explaining this.

                                                              109.


                           calvin
                 don't worry. i have a feeling that
                 u.s. robotics will be needing my
                 services very badly in the future.

      she turns to spooner and gives him a dazzling smile. then
      suddenly plants a kiss on his lips. spooner, completely
      surprised.

                           calvin
                 i am the only robo-psychologist
                 around.

      she turns on her heel and heads back inside.    spooner smiles.
