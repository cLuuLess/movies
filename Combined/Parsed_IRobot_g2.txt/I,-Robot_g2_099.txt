100   int. glass room - u.s. robotics - night                         100

      a room. made entirely of glass. at the very top of the u.s.
      robotics building. looking out, 360, across the whole city.

      spooner and calvin. brought to the room by a couple escort
      robots. they see a man. standing at one of the glass walls
      looking out at the twinkling lights.

                            man
                  i thought this investigation was
                  over, detective spooner.

      the man turns.   it's lance robertson.

                            robertson
                  we have the evidence. we have the
                  suspect. we have a ruling. so
                  imagine my surprise when i was told
                  you were in my building.

      shoots a look at calvin.

                            robertson
                  and that one of my own employees
                  brought you here.
                      (beat)
                  you can go now, susan.

                            calvin
                  dr. robertson, i...

                            robertson
                      (cutting her off)
                  just be thankful i'm not asking you
                  to clean out your office.

      beat.   calvin, nods.   heads out.   robertson.   watching her.

                            robertson
                  you don't seem to be able to let go
                  of this case, detective.

                            spooner
                  i'm not satisfied.

                                                            76.


                       robertson
             the relentless pursuit of truth.
             isn't that what cops are known for?
             to the point of futility.

                       spooner
             there's nothing futile about a
             man's murder being covered up.

                       robertson
             "covered up?" that's a little
             dramatic, don't you think? thanks
             to you, we caught the machine that
             did this and are destroying it
             in...
                 (checks watch)
             ...three hours.

                       spooner
             is that for the sake of humanity or
             your stock holders?

robertson.   walks across the spooner.   looks him.   right in
the eye.

                       robertson
             believe me -- i'd like nothing more
             than to have that robot. if i
             could have it in ten years, but not
             today. as you can see from the
             press, people are struggling to
             keep up as it is. there's a hunger
             for progress, detective. but also
             a fear. today it would bury this
             company. that's why i've notified
             the authorities that we're going to
             end this -- tonight.
                 (looks out at the city)
             the announcement of heinrich's
             death at the hands of a robot wiped
             a billion dollars off our stock.
             so you tell me. if you were in my
             position, what would you do?

he looks back at spooner and smiles.     that charismatic
robertson we saw before.

                       robertson
             now. i believe this conversation
             is over. i don't want to see you
             near this building again,
             detective.

                                                               77.


      he turns.   calling over.   to the escort robots...

                            robertson
                  get him out of here.
