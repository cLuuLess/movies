162   ext. wasteland - dawn                                         162

      sonny steps onto the grounds of the junkyard. the power
      lines above him, surging with energy. he walks past the
      burned-out husks of industrial machinery.

      then we hear it. the sound of mechanical joints. getting
      louder and louder. and just as before, a broken-down robot
      emerges into the dawn light. and another. and another.

      but not quite like before. the robots aren't teetering.
      aren't lumbering. they keep on coming. their bent and
      broken bodies, straightening out as...

      dozens of robots rise up. slowly. gathering around in a
      large circle. as they all turn to look at:

      sonny's silhouette. slowly climbing to the top of the hill.
      looking out at the vast junkyard below.

      close on sonny. standing proud and defiant. the sun,
      creeping over the horizon. a new day filled with infinite
      possibilities.

      the robots.   staring up at him.   eager for what comes next.
