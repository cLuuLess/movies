60   int. back room - continuous                                      60

     ...the back room. covered. in writing. walls, floors,
     ceiling. drawings. of robots, of men, side by side. in the
     corner, a computer. a line of cabinets - data storage.

     spooner, curious. heads over to one of the cabinets. takes
     a device out of his pocket and clamps it over the keypad.
     the device blinks red. then green. the drawer, slides out.

     lined. with flat metal objects. shiny. thin.          with writing
     on them. spooner. reaches for one when...

                                                             52.


     boom! something pounds the outside of the room.    spooner.
     grabs onto the cabinet...

     boom! on the other side. objects. flying off table-tops.
     a crack spidering along the wall. holy shit...

                          spooner
                    (screaming)
                halt!

     boom! vibrations, tearing through the room.     more cracks.
     spreading...

     boom! the sound, horrifying. spooner stumbles back.      the
     cabinet. crashing down on his leg. he cries out...

     boom! boom! boom! the house. getting pummeled.        chunks of
     ceiling. raining down. glass...exploding...

     relentless booming! spooner...dragging his legs from under
     the cabinet. scrambling for purchase as...

     the floor...begins to tilt...the tiles...snapping
     up...ricocheting...around the room...as another cabinet...
     crashes to the ground...crumpling...

     spooner.   spinning around.   looking for some kind of exit...

     boom! the corner of the room...coming in on itself...the
     floor...listing even more...like a ship...

     spooner...turning to claw his way up to the cracked
     doorway...when...

     something catches his eye. in the bottom drawer. of a
     crumpled cabinet. one of those flat metal plates. he can
     just read what it says: s.o.n.n.y....

     spooner...flings his arm back...reaching for the plate...
     snaps it up...just as...

     boom! a hydraulic pounder smashes through the wall...inches
     from his head...outside light...pouring in...

     spooner scurries for the doorway...tumbling out...
