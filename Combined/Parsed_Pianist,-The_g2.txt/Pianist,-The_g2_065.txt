               szpilman has unpacked the sacks and laid them in the corner. 
               he kneels before the smallest of the sacks and unties the 
               string around its neck.

               he puts his hand inside the sack and potatoes tumble out. 
               he reaches to the bottom and is still as his hand finds 
               something. carefully, he removes a pistol, then another, 
               both wrapped in oil cloths. he hides them under his jacket.
