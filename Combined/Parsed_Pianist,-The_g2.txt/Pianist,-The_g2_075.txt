               int. bogucki apartment - night

               andrzej bogucki, a handsome man, fortyish, tries to conceal 
               his sense of shock at seeing szpilman he holds out his 
               hand and szpilman shakes it.

               szpilman looks around the nicely furnished, large apartment. 
               he looks at bogucki and janina. tears well up in his eyes. 
               he fights it hard, not to cry. so does janina.

                                     bogucki
                         we haven't much time.
