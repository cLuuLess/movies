               ext. street leading to ghetto - night

               freezing cold. the jewish workers, with their bundles of 
               potatoes and bread, march back towards the ghetto gates 
               escorted by the two polish policemen. in the column, 
               szpilman, near the policeman with the moustache, and a 
               little behind them, majorek. distant sounds of gunfire. 

               majorek falls in beside szpilman.

                                     majorek
                         i tried your friends. they're not 
                         at that address any more.  but.

                                     szpilman
                         you made contact? 

                                     majorek
                         be ready to leave in two days' 
                         time. same place as last night.

               sudden, frantic cries from the head of the column, which 
               comes to a stop.

               two ss men, blind drunk, drinking vodka from bottles, are 
               lashing the column with whips. one of them is zikk-zack, .

                                     szpilman
                         oh, shit!

               as the ss men advance on szpilman and majorek's section, 
               majorek slips back to his place in the column. szpilman 
               hides his package inside his coat.

               zick-zack lashes out at the workers blindly.

                                     zick-zack
                         und-zick! und-zack!

               he takes a swig of vodka and comes face to face with 
               szpilman.

                                     zick-zack
                              (shouting")
                         i'll soon teach you discipline! 
                         jew pigs!

               he is staring directly at szpilman with glassy eyes. 
               szpilman is terrified, trying as surreptitiously as possible 
               to cover his hidden package with his hands. a moment of 
               danger. zick-zack grabs szpilman by the cottar.

                                     zick-zack
                         know why we beat you?

               no response; shaking him.

                                     zick-zack
                         know why we beat you?

                                     szpilman
                              (tentatively, in 
                              german)
                         no. why?

                                     zick-zack
                         to celebrate new year's eve!

               he and his comrade find this hilarious; recovering from 
               his laughter.

                                     zick-zack
                         now, march! go on, march!

               the column starts to march. ....

                                     zick-zack
                         and sing!
                              (he belches.)
                         sing something cheerful!
                              (laughs.)
                         and sing it good and loud!

               a brief silence, then from the back, a solo voice starts 
               to sing, 'children of warsaw will go to fight!' 

               szpilman glances back, sees that it's majorek singing. 
               szpilman smiles, majorek nods. szpilman joins in. now, so 
               do the others.

               they march on, singing lustily. 

                                     all workers
                              (singing)
                         hey, ranks unite 
                         and follow the white eagle! 
                         stand up and fight 
                         our mortal enemy.
                         riflemen, hey!
                         let's give them fire and brimstone.
                         we'll blow away 
                         the yoke of slavery.
                         punish and rout 
                         the rapists of our nation.
                         we'll smash the knout 
                         to save our dignity.
                         soon we'll be proud
                         of our liberation - 
                         
                         hey, take your sights! 
                         aim sharply at the heart. 
                         hey, load! hey, shoot! 
                         hey, load! hey, shoot!  
                         give 'em a bloody start! 
                         hey, load! hey, shoot! 
                         aim sharply at the heart.

               the column reaches the lamp posts near the ghetto gates. 
               szpilman his package over the wall. so does majorek.
