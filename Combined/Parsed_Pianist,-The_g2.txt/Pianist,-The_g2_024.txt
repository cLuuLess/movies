               int. jehuda zyskind's room - evening

               the noise of a mimeograph machine. a huge, cheerful man 
               with a perpetual cigarette in his mouth.

                                     jehuda
                         i always say look on the bright 
                         side. you're in the small ghetto, 
                         intellectuals, professional people, 
                         you're better off than us. here, 
                         in the large ghetto, it's a 
                         cesspool. but you, you're living 
                         in monte carlo. you could say you're 
                         privileged and that, of course, 
                         goes against my principles.  
                         nevertheless...

               he laughs and coughs, starts looking through papers. his 
               room is piled from floor to ceiling with old papers and 
               stuff. dark, shabby, run-down.

               one of his sons, symche, is operating the mimeograph 
               machine. the other, dolek, is sorting the sheets as they 
               come off the roller.  mrs. zyskind, holding a toddler, is 
               cooking at a small stove.

               jehuda finds what he's been looking for, a newspaper made 
               up of a few sheets.

                                     jehuda
                         ah, here. today's news from the 
                         other side.

                                     szpilman
                         you're amazing, jehuda.

                                     jehuda
                         no, i'm a socialist. i have brothers 
                         everywhere. they bring me news and 
                         food. we care about our fellow 
                         human beings. workers of the world 
                         unite.

                                     szpilman
                         so, what's the news?

                                     jehuda
                              (scanning the paper)
                         the germans are advancing on 
                         kharkhov.

                                     szpilman
                         i don't know why i come here every 
                         evening, it's always such bad news.

                                     jehuda
                         bad news, you crazy? you have no 
                         world view, wladek, that's your 
                         trouble. the news couldn't be 
                         better. the moment hitler invaded 
                         russia, i knew we'd be all right. 
                         remember napoleon. same business. 
                         the germans will freeze to death, 
                         please god.

               he beams. szpilman leans over, takes a sheet from the 
               mimeograph.

                                     szpilman
                         jehuda, give me something to do.

                                     jehuda
                         you're an artist, wladek, you keep 
                         people's spirits up. you do enough.

                                     szpilman
                         but i want to help, i want to.

                                     jehuda
                         you're too well known, wladek. and 
                         you know what? you musicians don't 
                         make good conspirators. you're 
                         too...too musical.

               he loves this, laughs, coughs.

                                     szpilman
                         there are notices going up. the 
                         city's to be cleansed of 
                         undesirables.

                                     jehuda
                         there are always notices going up.

               a distinctive knock on the door. szpilman tenses but jehuda 
               beams. to one of his boys: symche - the boy opens the door 
               to admit a short, neat man, majorek.

                                     majorek
                         hello, symche, dolek, mrs zyskind, 
                         jehuda. working hard?

               he stops, seeing szpilman.

                                     jehuda
                         majorek, this is the greatest 
                         pianist in poland, maybe in the 
                         whole world. wladyslaw szpilman. 
                         meet majorek.

                                     majorek
                              (shakes szpilman's 
                              hand)
                         i know your name. i've never heard 
                         you play.

                                     jehuda
                         majorek used to be in the army. 
                         brilliant man. he's got a mind 
                         like a searchlight. the only thing 
                         i've got against him is he's not a 
                         socialist.
                              (he looks out of 
                              the window.)
                         you'd better go now, wladek. it's 
                         nearly curfew.
                              (he hands over 
                              pamphlets to 
                              majorek.)
                         you see these, wladek?  you know 
                         how many copies we print of our 
                         newspaper?

               szpilman shrugs.

                                     jehuda
                         five hundred. you know how many 
                         people on average read one copy?  
                         twenty.  that makes ten thousand 
                         readers. these will start the 
                         uprising. majorek hides them in 
                         his underpants. and leaves them in 
                         toilets.

                                     szpilman
                         toilets?

                                     majorek
                         as many toilets as i can find. 
                         germans never go into jewish 
                         toilets. they're too clean for 
                         them.

               jehuda loves this too, but his laugh makes him cough 
               appallingly.
