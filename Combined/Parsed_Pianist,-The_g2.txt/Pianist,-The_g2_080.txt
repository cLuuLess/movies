               int. gebczynski's store - night

               gebcznyski shakes hands with szpilman, ushers him in and 
               then pulls down the shutter.

               gebczynski's store is for sanitary furnishings and supplies: 
               lavatories, basins, baths, taps etc.

                                     gebczynski
                         i'll show you where you're going 
                         to sleep.

               he leads the way and as he goes he picks up a cushion from 
               a chair and a blanket. szpilman follows.

               stairs to basement:

               gebczynski leads szpilman down the stairs.

               basement store room:

               dark, shadowy. shelves with taps, washers, pipes. gebczynski 
               leads the may to a particular set of shelves. he puts aside 
               the cushion and blanket, then starts to push at the shelves. 
               szpilman, although puzzled, helps. slowly, the shelves 
               move to reveal a secret compartment.

                                     gebczynski
                         it's not going to be very 
                         comfortable.

                                     szpilman
                         i'll be fine.

                                     gebczynski
                         you'll have to stay here until 
                         tomorrow afternoon.

               he helps szpilman into the compartment.

                                     gebczynski
                         we've got a flat for you. near the 
                         ghetto wall. but it's safe.

               he hands over the cushion and the blanket to szpilman; 
               then, putting his back to the shelves and his feet against 
               the wall, he pushes the shelves back into place so that 
               szpilman is now hidden.
