               ext. street leading to ghetto - day autumn

               a great column of jews of all ages make their way towards 
               the area that will become the ghetto. on foot, on bicycles, 
               on horse-drawn platforms, some pushing prams loaded with 
               belongings. a great moving mass of humanity.

               they're watched on either side of the street by poles. 

               on a horse-drawn platform, the szpilmans with their 
               belongings.  all wear armbands. 

               szpilman, halina and henryk walk beside the platform with 
               mother, father and regina seated on it. 

               szpilman catches sight of someone among the onlookers, 
               smiles and pushes through the crowd to dorota, close to 
               tears.

                                     szpilman
                         dorota!

                                     dorota
                         i didn't want to come, i didn't 
                         want to see all this, but i couldn't 
                         stop myself.

                                     szpilman
                         how are you doing?

                                     dorota
                         fine, no, not really, they arrested 
                         my cousin, but jurek says they'll 
                         let him out.
                              (stops, tears in 
                              her eyes.)
                         this is disgraceful.

                                     szpilman
                         don't worry, it won't last long.

                                     dorota
                         that's what i said, it's so - it's 
                         too absurd!

                                     szpilman
                         i'll see you...soon.

               he smiles and runs to catch up with his family. he looks 
               back, but dorota is lost to sight and the procession 
               continues on its way.
