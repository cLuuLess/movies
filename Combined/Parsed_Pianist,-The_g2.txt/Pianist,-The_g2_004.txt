               int. warsaw apartment - dusk

               the szpilman family in panic: coming and going out of rooms, 
               packing clothes and belongings into open suitcases and a 
               trunk in a comfortable, tastefully furnished bourgeois 
               apartment, the living room lined with books, paintings and 
               boasting a boudoir grand, silver platters and candlesticks. 
               the family consist of mother, in a state of great anxiety, 
               father, regina, twenty-six, halina, twenty-two, and henryk, 
               twenty-four, the only one not in movement. he sits by the 
               radio set, ear to the speaker, trying to tune to a station. 
               no bombs now, just the distant sound of artillery fire. 
               father, holding a silver-framed photograph, crosses to 
               mother.

                                     father
                         what you think, should i take uncle 
                         szymon's photograph?

                                     mother
                         take it, don't take it, take what 
                         you like. can't you see i'm worried 
                         sick?

                                     father
                         he'll come home, he'll be all right.

               he goes into his room. she can barely control her tears 
               and hurries into the kitchen just as the front door opens 
               and szpilman enters, looks round bemused by the activity.

                                     regina
                         mama, wladek's home.

               mother dashes out of the kitchen.

                                     mother
                         thank god - wladek! you're wounded.

                                     szpilman
                         it's a little cut, nothing.

                                     mother
                         i've been worried sick.

                                     henryk
                         i told her not to worry. you had 
                         your papers on you. if you'd been 
                         hit by a bomb, they'd have known 
                         where to take you.

               the girls suppress smiles.

                                     mother
                         henryk, don't say things like that, 
                         god forbid, god forbid.

                                     halina
                              (calling through a 
                              door)
                         papa, wladek's home.

               father appears in the doorway, beaming, clutching a violin 
               case.

                                     father
                         what did i tell you?

                                     szpilman
                              (looking around the 
                              room, bemused)
                         what are you doing?

                                     regina
                         what's it look like we're doing?

               the toing and froing continues non-stop.

                                     szpilman
                              (to henryk)
                         they bombed us, we're off the air.

                                     henryk
                         warsaw's not the only radio station.

                                     mother
                         pack, darling, get your things, 
                         pack.

                                     szpilman
                         where are we going? 

                                     mother
                         out of warsaw.

                                     szpilman
                         out of warsaw. where?

                                     regina
                         you haven't heard?

                                     szpilman
                         heard what?

                                     regina
                         haven't you seen the paper? where's 
                         the paper?

               she starts to look. the others continue to bustle and pack.

                                     halina
                         i used it for packing.

                                     regina
                              (exasperated)
                         she used it for packing.

                                     father
                         the government's moved to lublin.

                                     halina
                         all able-bodied men must leave the 
                         city, go across the river and set 
                         up a new line of defence, that's 
                         what it said.

                                     father
                         there's hardly anybody left in 
                         this building, only women, the men 
                         have gone.

                                     szpilman
                         and what do you think you'll do 
                         while you're setting up a new line 
                         of defence? wander round lugging 
                         your suitcases?

                                     mother
                         pack, wladek, there's no time.

                                     szpilman
                         i'm not going anywhere.

                                     halina
                         good! i'm not going anywhere either!

                                     mother
                         don't be ridiculous, we've got to 
                         keep together.

                                     szpilman
                         no, no, no, i'm staying put. if 
                         i'm going to die, i prefer to die 
                         at home.

                                     mother
                         god forbid!

                                     henryk
                         sssh!

               crackles, whistles and static from the radio.

                                     henryk
                         ssh! i've got something, listen...

               they gather round.

                                     radio announcer
                         ... an important announcement.

               the polish national anthem plays. all are still.
