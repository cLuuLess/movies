               szpilman is on the public telephone, waiting for someone 
               to answer his call. then:

                                     szpilman
                         jurek? wladek szpilman.

                                     jurek
                              (filtered)
                         wladek! how are you?

                                     szpilman
                         fine, we're fine, thank you, and 
                         you?

                                     jurek
                              (filtered)
                         fine, we're fine in the 
                         circumstances. but i can guess 
                         what you've called about. there's 
                         nothing we can do; they won't reopen 
                         the station--

                                     szpilman
                              (trying to interrupt)
                         yes, i know, but jurek, jurek...

                                     jurek
                              (filtered)
                         ...not even music, nothing, no 
                         radios for the poles. but i'm sure 
                         you'll find work, wladek, a pianist 
                         like you.

                                     szpilman
                         maybe, maybe not, but, jurek, don't 
                         be offended, i didn't call to 
                         discuss my future career.
