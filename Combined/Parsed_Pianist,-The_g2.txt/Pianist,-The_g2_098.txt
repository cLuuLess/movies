               ext. side street - evening

               szpilman lurches into the narrow street. no one about. he 
               stops, almost collapses, but manages to keep hold of 
               himself. he puts on his coat and wraps the scarf round his 
               neck. he leans up against a wall.

               he removes a shoe and takes out the scrap of paper 
               gebczynski gave him. he reads it.
