               int./ext. stores and building site - evening

               the jewish workers lined up to get their potatoes and bread. 
               szpilman and two others weigh the potatoes.

                                     german voices
                         get on with it and fall in! fall 
                         in!

               calmly, szpilman leaves the table with the scales, walks 
               past majorek and the others, who, having got their potatoes, 
               are assembling in a column, preparing to march back into 
               the ghetto. the polish workers have packed up their tools 
               and are talking among themselves, also about to leave the 
               site but in a casual way.

               the ss guards shout orders for the jewish column to move 
               off. szpilman seems as if he's going to join them, but at 
               the last moment turns and falls in with the polish workers, 
               beside barczak, who just glances at him then moves so that 
               szpilman is in the middle of the group.

               szpilman slips off his armband, stuffs it into his pocket. 

               the group walk into the darkness.
