               father pours liqueur into glasses.

               the family are seated around the dining table, having just 
               finished a meal. the table groans with the remains of the 
               dinner. szpilman has a plaster over his cut.

                              (lighting up a 
                              cigarette)
                         mama, that was a great dinner.

                                     szpilman
                         it certainly was.

                         when there's something to celebrate, 
                         you've got to make an effort.

               the glasses are handed round.

                                     father
                         here's to great britain and france.

               they all clink glasses and drink.

                                     father
