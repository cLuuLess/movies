               int./ext.  1st apartment - later - day

               szpilman at the window, watching, his mood downcast. 

               the noise of a key in the door.

               he turns to see the door of the flat open. janina enters 
               with a parcel of food. she kisses szpilman on the cheek.

                                     janina
                         wanted to come earlier but...

               she hands him the parcel.

                                     szpilman
                         thank you.

               he goes into the small kitchen and unpacks the contents 
               while janina gazes out of the window.

                                     janina
                         no one thought they'd hold out so 
                         long.

                                     szpilman
                         should never have come out. i 
                         should've stayed there, fought 
                         with them.

                                     janina
                              (turning to him)
                         wladek, stop that. it's over now. 
                         just be proud it happened. my god, 
                         did they put up a fight.

                                     szpilman
                         yes, so did the germans.

                                     janina
                         they're in shock. they didn't expect 
                         it. nobody expected it. jews 
                         fighting back? who'd have thought?

                                     szpilman
                         yes, but what good did it do?

                                     janina
                              (passionate)
                         what good? wladek, i'm surprised 
                         at you. they died with  dignity, 
                         that's what good it did. and you 
                         know something else?  now the poles 
                         will rise. we're ready. we'll fight, 
                         too. you'll see.

               she turns to look again out of the window.
