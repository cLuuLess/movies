               ext. inside the ghetto - minutes later - early morning

               the german commander and two officers alight from the car 
               and take cover.

               the commander orders the field gun to be trained on the 
               buildings. spasmodic firing continues. 

               he gives the order to fire.

               the gun roars. the shell tears into the building. at once 
               the german soldiers open fire with their rifles and lob 
               grenades into the building. the gun fires again. 

               the building begins to burn. flames and smoke.

               german soldiers with flame-throwers advance carefully then 
               unleash their fire into doorways and windows, and quickly 
               retreat.

               at ground level, jewish fighters try to fight their way 
               out and are mowed down.

               the fire spreads quickly through the building. smoke begins 
               to pour from the upper floors.

               the germans, less cautious now, stand and watch.

               a woman struggles out on to her narrow third-floor balcony. 
               she climbs over, holds on to the wrought-iron railings and 
               hangs on for dear life. shots ring out and she drops like 
               a stone. 

               from inside the building, screams and shouts.

               from another upper window, a man in flames jumps and falls 
               to his death on the pavement below.

               the germans have stopped firing. they stand, spectators, 
               watching the building burn.
