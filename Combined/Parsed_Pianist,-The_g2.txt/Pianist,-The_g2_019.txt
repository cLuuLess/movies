               int. ghetto apartment - day

               szpilman and henryk enter and stop. uneasy.

                                     mother
                         good, they're here. yitzchak 
                         heller's been waiting for you, 
                         henryk.

               seated at the table with mother and father is a uniformed 
               young man, yitzchak heller, unusual appearance, a man with 
               red hair and a hitler moustache. 

               heller remains seated, just nods at the brothers.

                                     henryk
                         what's this about?

                                     mother
                         sit down, have tea, i'll start 
                         lunch when the girls get back.

               henryk and szpilman sit. they eye heller suspiciously.

                                     henryk
                         so, what are you doing here?

                                     father
                         he brought cakes.

               awkward silence.

                                     father
                         his father's back in the jewellery 
                         business and doing well, isn't 
                         that so, yitzchak? amazing.  
                         jewellery.

               he runs dry. another awkward silence. then:

                                     heller
                         we're recruiting.

                                     henryk
                         who's recruiting?

                                     heller
                         don't be clever with me, henryk. 
                         i've come here as a friend. they're 
                         bringing jews in from all over the 
                         country. soon there'll be half a 
                         million people in the ghetto. we 
                         need more jewish police...

                                     henryk
                              (sarcastic)
                         oh? more jewish police? you mean 
                         you want me to wear a cap like 
                         yours, beat up jews with my 
                         truncheon and catch the gestapo 
                         spirit. i see!

                                     heller
                              (eyes narrowed, 
                              dangerous)
                         someone's got to do it, henryk.

                                     henryk
                         but why me? i thought you only 
                         recruited boys with rich fathers. 
                         look at my father, look at us, i 
                         mean...

                                     heller
                              (interrupting, 
                              flaring)
                         yes, i'm looking at you and that's 
                         why i'm here. your whole family 
                         can have a better life. you want 
                         to go on struggling for survival, 
                         selling books on the street?

                                     henryk
                              (a smile)
                         yes, please.

                                     heller
                              (to szpilman)
                         i'm doing you people a favour. and 
                         what about you, wladek? you're a 
                         great pianist. and we've got an 
                         excellent police jazz band. they'd 
                         welcome you with open arms. join 
                         us. you've got no work...

                                     szpilman
                         thank you. but i've got work.

               silence. heller rises angrily.
