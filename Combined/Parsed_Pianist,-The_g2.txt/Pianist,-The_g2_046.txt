               ext. umschlagplatz - day

               szpilman, mother, regina and father, with others, enter 
               through one of the gates, which closes on them. they pause 
               for a moment to take in their new surroundings. 

               the szpilmans and their pov: 

               their first sight of the large rectangle, walled on two 
               sides and overlooked by buildings. several hundred people. 
               people walk up and down.

                                     szpilman
                         let's sit over there.

               but he stops again, and so do the others. something they 
               see causes them to stand stock still, expressionless.

               the szpilmans' pov:

               an unoccupied space at the edge of the compound where 
               bloated, decaying bodies lie near to a wall. the wall itself 
               is spattered with blood. large flies walk over the dead. 
               nobody goes near.

               the szpilmans:

               szpilman turns away and leads the others to another space. 

               later:

               glaring sun. the szpilmans have settled down on the kerb 
               of a pavement and are waiting. szpilman stands, observing 
               the scene.

               mother sits on a bundle of things, staring vacantly, her 
               hair hanging down in strands. regina, beside her, has her 
               hands over her face and is weeping, the tears running 
               through her fingers.

               father walks nervously up and down, hands behind his back, 
               four steps one way, four steps back. near them, a young 
               woman begins to wail.

                                     the young woman
                         why did i do it? why did i do it?

               a young man, beside her, whispers to her, but she does not 
               seem to take in what he's saying. her cries continue at 
               intervals. 

                                     the young woman
                         why did i do it? why did i do it?

               the sound of trucks. everyone looks towards the gates. 

               more jews are being unloaded from trucks and are marched 
               through the gates. mothers, children, old people, begging, 
               most of them holding papers. pandemonium. 

               later: 

               the sun high, blazing. szpilman is wandering around, 
               occasionally greeting people. the place is crowded now, 
               packed. trucks bring more and more jews at intervals. 

               old people lying down, exhausted, impossible to tell whether 
               some of them are alive or dead. women carrying dehydrated 
               children drag themselves from group to group. one woman 
               approaches szpilman.

                                     woman with child
                         he's dying, don't you have a drop 
                         of water? my child's dying of 
                         thirst, he's dying, he's dying, i 
                         beg you!

               szpilman shakes his head sadly. the woman with child wanders 
               off to another group.

                                     a man's voice
                         i'm telling you, it's a disgrace.

               szpilman turns to see a man, dr. ehrlich, haranguing father.

                                     father
                         i can hear you.

               szpilman goes to them.

                                     dr. ehrlich
                              (overlapping)
                         we're letting them take us to our 
                         death like sheep to the slaughter!

                                     father
                         dr. ehrlich, not so loud!

                                     dr. ehrlich
                         why don't we attack them? there's 
                         half a million of us, we could 
                         break out of the ghetto. at least 
                         we could die honourably, not as a 
                         stain on the face of history!

               another man, grun, joins in.

                                     grun
                         why you so sure they're sending us 
                         to our death?

                                     dr. ehrlich
                         i'm not sure. you know why i'm not 
                         sure? because they didn't tell me. 
                         but i'm telling you they plan to 
                         wipe us all out!

                                     father
                         dr. ehrlich, what do you want me 
                         to do? you want me to fight?

                                     grun
                         to fight you need organisation, 
                         plans, guns!

                                     father
                         he's right. what d'you think i can 
                         do? fight them with my violin bow?

                                     grun
                         the germans would never squander a 
                         huge labour force like this. they're 
                         sending us to a labour camp.

                                     dr. ehrlich
                         oh, sure. look at that cripple, 
                         look at those old people, the 
                         children, they're going to work? 
                         look at mr szpilman here, he's 
                         going to carry iron girders on his 
                         back?

               a loud cry from mother. szpilman and father spin round.

                                     mother
                         henryk!

                                     regina
                              (glancing up, shocked)
                         oh my god!

               near the gates, among a large bunch of new arrivals, henryk 
               and halina.

                                     mother
                         halina! henryk!

               regina and szpilman also call and wave. henryk and halina 
               struggle through to them. halina falls into mother's arms 
               and they hug.

                                     halina
                         we heard you were here...we...didn't 
                         want...we...we wanted to be with 
                         you.

               mother comforts her. and so does regina. father smiles 
               sadly.

                                     szpilman
                              (shakes his head, 
                              almost to himself, 
                              a forlorn smile)
                         stupid, stupid!

                                     the young woman
                         why did i do it? why did i do it?

               szpilman stands and stares at her. 

               later: 

               the sun lower but the heat still intense.

               the place is now packed to suffocation. people calling out 
               names, trying to find each other. the wailing of women and 
               the cries of children.

               a cordon of jewish policemen and ss guards are, almost 
               surreptitiously, ringing the compound.

               the szpilmans sit in the same place, with henryk sitting a 
               little apart and now reading a small book.

                                     the young woman
                         why did i do it? why did i do it?

                                     halina
                         she's getting on my nerves. what 
                         did she do, for god's sake?

               grun leans across to her.

                                     grun
                              (quietly, to halina)
                         she smothered her baby.

               halina looks at him in disbelief.

                                     grun
                         they'd prepared a hiding place and 
                         so, of course, they went there. 
                         but the baby cried just as the 
                         police came. she smothered the 
                         cries with her hands. the baby 
                         died. a policeman heard the death 
                         rattle. he found where they were 
                         hiding.

               later:

               szpilman and henryk.

                                     szpilman
                         what are you reading?

                                     henryk
                              (a crooked, ironic 
                              smile)
                         'if you prick us, do we not bleed? 
                         if you tickle us, do we not laugh? 
                         if you poison us, do we not die? 
                         and if you wrong us, shall we not 
                         revenge?'

               szpilman takes the book and reads the title page: 
               the merchant of venice by william shakespeare.

                                     szpilman
                         very appropriate.

                                     henryk
                              (taking the book 
                              back and resuming 
                              his reading)
                         yes, that's why i brought it. 

               later:

               the szpilmans seated on the kerb. their attention is caught 
               by a boy who has a box of sweets on a string round his 
               neck. and he's setting the sweets, pocketing money.

                                     henryk
                         idiot. what's he think he's going 
                         to do with the money?

               father calls to the sweet boy and beckons him over.

                                     father
                         how much for a caramel?

                                     the sweet boy
                         twenty zlotys.

                                     father
                         what? for one caramel? what d'you 
                         think you're going to do with the 
                         money?

                                     the sweet boy
                         twenty zlotys.

                                     father
                              (turning to the 
                              family)
                         have we got twenty between us?

               they search their pockets and handbags, hand over to father 
               what change they can find. he, in turn, hands the money to 
               the sweet boy, who hands over one caramel and goes on his 
               way.

               father holds the caramel between thumb and forefinger and 
               examines it carefully. then, carefully takes out his 
               penknife and with great care divides the caramel into six 
               pans. he hands a part to each of the family.

               they all exchange a look, an acknowledgement of each other, 
               almost like a toast, and then they chew, slowly, 
               deliberately.

               the whistle of a locomotive. sound of trucks rattling over 
               the rails.

               at once, a sound of great agitation from the jews in the 
               compound.
