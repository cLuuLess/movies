               ext. streets - day

               szpilman running. streets crowded. corpses. szpilman, 
               sweating, dodges and sidesteps. then, suddenly, a woman 
               bars his way. she's the feather woman, brightly rouged, 
               with her thickly painted eyebrows, the unsteady mauve 
               ostrich feather rising from her straw hat.

                                     the feather woman
                         excuse me, but have you seen my 
                         husband izaak szerman?

                                     szpilman
                         i'm afraid not.

               he tries to dodge past but she grabs his arm.

                                     the feather woman
                         he's tall, he's handsome. he has a 
                         little grey beard. if you see him, 
                         please do write, izaak szerman's 
                         his name, don't forget.

               szpilman manages to free himself and runs on.
