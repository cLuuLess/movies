               int. warsaw apartment - evening

               szpilman composing at the piano. he plays, makes adjustments 
               with a pencil to the manuscript, plays again. the flat is 
               almost bare. halina, enters with a newspaper.

                                     halina
                         have you seen this?

                                     szpilman
                              (irritated)
                         what, i'm working, what?

               she hands him the paper. he looks at it. his expression 
               darkens.

               insert:

               the newspaper. a map of the proposed jewish area: two 
               distinct districts, one large, one smaller.

                                     szpilman's voice
                         what is it?

                                     halina's voice
                         that's where they're going to put 
                         us.

                                     szpilman's voice
                         what d'you mean, put us?

               the apartment: 

               she looks over his shoulder and reads. as she does so, the 
               door of henryk's room opens and he stands leaning in the 
               doorway, watching, as if amused.

                                     halina
                         'by order of the governor of the 
                         warsaw district, dr. fischer, 
                         concerning the establishment of 
                         the jewish district in warsaw. 
                         there will be created a jewish 
                         district in which all jews living 
                         in warsaw or moving to warsaw will 
                         have to reside."  and look here: 
                         'jews living outside of the 
                         prescribed area will have to move 
                         to the jewish district by 31st of 
                         october 1940.'

               szpilman gazes at the map, horrified.

                                     szpilman
                         but...they won't get all of us... 
                         we'll...it's too small...there's 
                         four hundred thousand of us in 
                         warsaw!

                                     henryk
                         no. three hundred and sixty 
                         thousand, so it'll be easy.

               he laughs but they're disturbed by a sound from another 
               room, the sound of crying. they look at each other puzzled, 
               then halina opens a door and looks in. szpilman and henryk 
               join her. 

               bedroom:

               father is asleep but mother is sitting on the bed, holding 
               a purse, crying. halina sits beside her, puts an arm round 
               her.

                                     halina
                         mama, what is it?

               mother opens the purse to reveal a crumpled note.

                                     mother
                         twenty zlotys. that's all we've 
                         got left. what can i buy with twenty 
                         zlotys?
                              (breaking down)
                         i'm sick of cooking potatoes, 
                         potatoes, potatoes.

               she weeps. halina tries to comfort her. szpilman and henryk 
               watch.
