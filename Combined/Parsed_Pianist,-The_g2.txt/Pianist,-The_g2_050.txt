               ext.  street by the siding - day

               szpilman catches his breath by a building. an ss man and 
               jewish policeman emerge. the jewish policeman is servile, 
               crawling to the german. he points to the train -

                                     jewish policeman
                         well, off they go for meltdown!

               they laugh as they walk away. szpilman turns and stumbles 
               down the empty street. the cries from the trucks fading. 
               he begins to weep, loud, agonised sobs, and staggers on.
