               int.  1st apartment - dusk

               snow. howling wind.

               szpilman lies on the divan. he is cold, unshaven, hair 
               filthy and long. he manages to rise.

               the small kitchen. 

               a mess. szpilman goes into the kitchen. from a bread tin 
               he takes a small, flat greaseproof paper parcel and unwraps 
               it. a slice of bread, stale and mouldy. he tries to bite 
               it but can't. he finds a knife and tries to chop a piece 
               off the bread but knocks the bread tin, which falls to the 
               floor with a clatter. 

               he continues to try to cut the bread, when there's a loud 
               hammering on the front door.

               szpilman stiffens.

               the living room. 

               the hammering continues as szpilman stumbles into the room, 
               looks around, confused, not knowing what to do.

               from the other side of the door female voices, words 
               indistinct, and then:

                                     kitty's voice
                         open this door at once, or we'll 
                         call the police!

               he is galvanised into action, puts on a crumpled jacket, 
               grabs his tattered coat and scarf, collects up a few of 
               his things, stuffs them into a paper bag. 

               the hammering stops. szpilman cautiously approaches the 
               door, listens, then opens it quietly and slips out.
