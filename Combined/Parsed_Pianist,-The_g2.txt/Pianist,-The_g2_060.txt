               ext. building site, outside ghetto - day

               szpilman, bent almost double, carries a hod on his back 
               piled with bricks. he is mounting a wooden ramp that runs 
               up beside scaffolding on a small building site where an 
               extra floor is being added to a house. there are polish 
               workers, too, who don't, of course, wear armbands as the 
               jews do. there's a wooden hut serving as a store on the 
               site.

               halfway up the ramp, szpilman hears someone whistle. he 
               stops, turns to see, at the bottom of the ramp, majorek, 
               smiling and giving a discreet wave.

               later: 

               szpilman and majorek sip gruel out of mugs. they sit apart 
               from the others who are also taking a break.

                                     szpilman
                         how long have you been here?

                                     majorek
                         since last night. i was pleased to 
                         see you.

               brief silence.

                                     majorek
                         they're going to start the final 
                         resettlement now. we know what it 
                         means. we sent someone out. zygmunt. 
                         a good man. his orders were to 
                         follow the trains out of warsaw. 
                         he got to sokolow. a local 
                         railwayman told him the tracks are 
                         divided, one branch leading to 
                         treblinka. he said every day freight 
                         trains carrying people from warsaw 
                         forked to treblinka and returned 
                         empty. no transports of food are 
                         ever seen on that line. and 
                         civilians are forbidden to approach 
                         the treblinka station. they're 
                         exterminating us. won't take them 
                         long. we're sixty thousand left. 
                         out of half a million. mostly young 
                         people. and this time we're going 
                         to fight. we're in good shape. 
                         we're organised. we're prepared.

                                     szpilman
                         if you need help...

               whistle blows.

               a little later: 

               szpilman again mounting the ramp with a hod full of bricks 
               on his back. the noise of airplanes overhead.
