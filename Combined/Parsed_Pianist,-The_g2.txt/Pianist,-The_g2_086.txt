               int./ext. 1st apartment - day

               szpilman still fast asleep. voices wake him. he opens his 
               eyes. he's not certain where he is for a moment. 

               he hears the voices again, coming from the adjoining flat.

               intrigued, he rises, goes closer to the watt, puts his ear 
               against it, listens. after a brief silence:

                                     kitten's voice
                              (angry)
                         puppydog, what d'you mean, you 
                         forgot?

                                     puppydog's voice
                         what d'you think i mean, kitten? i 
                         forgot, that's what i mean.

                                     kitten's voice
                         you know what? you treat me like 
                         dirt!

                                     puppydog's voice
                         i treat you like dirt because you 
                         are dirt.

                                     kitten's voice
                         pig!

                                     puppydog's voice
                         cow!

                                     kitten's voice
                         pig!

                                     puppydog's voice
                         bitch!

                                     kitten's voice
                         dirty pig!

                                     puppydog's voice
                         you're a dirty pig!

                                     kitten's voice
                         takes one to know one! pig!

               silence.  szpilman is enjoying himself. 

               then the sound of a piano being played with great feeling 
               but a lot of wrong notes.

                                     puppydog's voice
                         you play like an angel, kitten.

               the piano continues for a moment, but suddenly stops:

                                     kitten's voice
                         if i play like an angel, why don't 
                         you listen?

                                     puppydog's voice
                         i was listening, kitten.

                                     kitten's voice
                         liar, you fell asleep. pig!

               a door slams.

                                     puppydog's voice
                              (wheedling)
                         kitten, let me in.

               silence.  szpilman smiles but then hears the sound of rifle 
               shots and a huge explosion. 

               he crosses quickly to the window, looks out.  

               szpilman's pov - the ghetto.

               deserted. stillness. silence. from the ghetto smoke drifting 
               slowly.
