               ext./int.  1st apartment - day

               snow. ice on the windows. 

               the sound of the key in the door. 

               szpilman turns as the door opens and gebczynski enters, 
               distraught. whispered, at speed:

                                     gebczynski
                         get your things together, you have 
                         to leave!

                                     szpilman
                         what's happened?

               gebczynski takes out a cigarette and lights it. while he 
               does so:

                                     gebczynski
                         i'm on the run!

                                     szpilman
                         what's happened?

                                     gebczynski
                         the gestapo found our weapons. 
                         they've arrested janina and andrzej. 
                         they're bound to find out about 
                         this place, too - you must get 
                         away at once.

                                     szpilman
                         where do you want me to go?  look 
                         at me. no, no, i'm not leaving. 
                         can't i take my chances here?

                                     gebczynski
                         that's your decision.
                              (stubs out cigarette.)
                         but when they storm the flat, throw 
                         yourself out of die window - don't 
                         let them get you alive. i have 
                         poison on me, they won't get me 
                         alive either!

               and he goes. szpilman listens to his footsteps clattering 
               down the stairs.

               he sees the cigarette stub, takes it, lights it, coughs, 
               smokes awkwardly. 

               later: 

               szpilman hears a car engine and the screech of brakes. he 
               tenses. german voices shouting and their heavy footsteps 
               on the stairs.

               he goes to the window, opens it. he gets a chair, places 
               it sideways in front of the window to make a step. he's 
               working out how best to throw himself out.

               he leans against the wall near the door and waits.. 

               slamming of doors, german shouts, a scream.

               szpilman steels himself, ready to jump.

               again footsteps on the stairs, but this time descending. a 
               door slams.

               he cautiously goes to the window and looks out.
