               int. small bathroom, bogucki apartment - night

               szpilman lies in a steaming bath, eyes closed, as though 
               he's in a trance.

               a gentle knock on the door and bogucki slips in with some 
               clothes. he gazes at szpilman, whose eyes remain closed.

                                     bogucki
                         you must hurry.

               bogucki holds up a towel. szpilman lifts himself out of 
               the bath and dries himself.

                                     bogucki

                              clothes')
