               int. secret compartment - night

               in the cramped space, szpilman is not quite able to stretch 
               full out. with difficulty, he puts the cushion behind his 
               head, starts to cover himself with the blanket but stops, 
               seeing something.  

               in niches, neatly stacked: rifles, pistols, grenades, 
               ammunition

               szpilman stares, expressionless.
