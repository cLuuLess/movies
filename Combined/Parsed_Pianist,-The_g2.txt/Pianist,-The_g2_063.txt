               int./ext. stores and building site - day

               winter. rain. cold. the store, a wooden hut, contains wood, 
               nails, tools, paint, metal brackets.

               szpilman sits at a table, where a line of workers has 
               formed. szpilman makes a record in a ledger of the tools 
               each worker takes out on the site.

               a worker puts his head into the store.

                              (hissing)
                         trouble.

                                     a german voice
                         assemble! fall in! only the jews! 
                         poles go on working! only the jews! 
                         poles go on working!

               the jewish workers start to assemble on the site in 
               haphazard ranks as an ss captain strides in.

               the ss captain, with much jollity and jokes, hops up on to 
               scaffolding and stands, beaming broadly, surveying the 
               workers.

                                     ss captain
                              (in english)
                         i have important and good news for 
                         you. there are rumours circulating 
                         that resettlement measures are 
                         again going to be taken.

               a glance between szpilman and majorek.

                                     ss captain
                              (in english)
                         i want to assure you personally 
                         that no such measures will be taken 
                         now or in the future. posters will 
                         be going up also to this effect. 
                         as proof of our good will, we want 
                         you to select a delegate, who will 
                         be permitted to go into town once 
                         a day to buy, on each worker's 
                         behalf, five kilos of potatoes and 
                         one loaf of bread, which you will 
                         be allowed to take back into the 
                         ghetto. now, why would we do that 
                         j if we meant to resettle you?

               he beams; no reaction from the workers.

                                     ss captain
                              (in english)
                         you can do good business on what 
                         you don't eat. isn't that what you 
                         jews are best at? making 'geld'?

               rubs thumb and forefinger and leers; still no reaction; 
               his smile vanishes.

                                     ss captain
                              (in english)
                         carry on.
