               int. studio, radio station, warsaw - day

               wladyslav szpilman plays chopin's nocturne in c sharp minor, 
               posthumous. he's twenty-eight years old, elegant and 
               handsome. 

               in the booth, separated from the studio by a glass screen, 
               an engineer, wearing collar and tie, monitors the broadcast. 
               behind him, a window to the street with strips of paper 
               taped on it as protection against blast. 

               without warning, a bomb drops nearby, then another and 
               another. the whole building shudders alarmingly and the 
               window in the booth shatters. 

               the engineer and szpilman exchange a look as a man enters 
               the booth and talks urgently to the engineer, then goes. 

               the engineer makes a 'cut-throat' gesture, but szpilman 
               shakes his head, determined to play on. 

               he plays, then glances at the booth. the engineer has gone, 
               but through the shattered window he sees fires raging. 

               very near, a loud, terrifying explosion. the reverberations 
               cause plaster to flake and dust to trickle down over his 
               face. 

               and then a bomb explodes even closer. the glass screen 
               separating booth from studio implodes, showering szpilman 
               with glass. he stops, frozen.
