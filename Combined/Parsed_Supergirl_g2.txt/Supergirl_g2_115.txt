 ext. hospital entry. twilight

aura of power. he drops his useless nikon into his camera bag and starts rummaging for another camera.

bianca

					selena
				no way. i'm not going to let that little hussy make a 
				monkey out of me.

					bianca
				      (shrewdly)
				is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?

selena looks at bianca with wounded dignity.

she gets in the back seat of the car, just as jimmy olsen snaps a photo of her with a polaroid. selena slams the car door and bianca drives off. jimmy examines the instant photo he just took. his eyes widen with wonder and the hair prickles on the back of his neck as he sees the image.

insert: the polaroid in jimmy's hand. the picture of selena entering her car, but behind her there is a hideous looming shadow---much larger than when nigel showed it to her.
