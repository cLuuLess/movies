ext. form. tennis court. campus. night

huge footprints sink into the damp grass of the campus. a bicycle rack full of schwinns is flattened into the dirt with a metallic screech. the monster proceeds inexorably toward the wooden rain shelter on one side of the tennis court. the shelter is crushed to kindling wood. the monster drags its enormous unseen bulk across the smooth clay surface of the tennis court, crunching , deep cracked depressions in the clay. the net stretches and groans toward linda as the' invisible enormity comes closer, and finally snaps with a loud twanging sound as the steel cables part. the tall cyclone fence bulges outward toward linda and momentarily outlines the form of" the monster before it crumples and falls with the screech of twisted steel. the only thing between linda and the monster is lucy.' s parked car. the monster stomps the car flat with a noise like colliding express trains and heads for linda.
