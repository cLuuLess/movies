int. selena's house.  living room

the camera follows selena through the french doors and into her large living room. on one wall is a huge, ornate gold-framed mirror, covered with a thick veil.

selena sits down in front of a large hearth, and opens a secret compartment in the floor. she reaches inside and removes a finely wrought metal box in the shape of a gargoyle and a pack of cards. she puts the gargoyle box on her lap, and begins to cast tarot cards onto the floor in mystic patterns.

the elderly man in the pinstripe suit enters from the garden. outside the excited shouts and sounds of firefighting can still be heard. someone runs by in the b.g. with a coil of garden hose. the elderly man walks over to selena, timidly.

elderly man 
is this nigel's doing?

selena
				it's a warning, that's for sure.

					elderly man
				maybe it was just an accident.

					selena
				     (mysteriously)
				there's no such thing as an accident. everything has 
meaning, if you can read the signs.

the elderly man looks down at the pattern of tarot cards selena has cast on the floor.

elderly man
				then what does it mean???




selena shrugs and puts aside her cards.

selena
				don't ask me. i can't read the signs worth spit.
