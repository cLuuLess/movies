ext. mansion --- garden party

a big impressive house somewhere in the middle west. people mill about on the neatly manicured lawn sipping drinks and snagging hors d'oeuvres off silver trays from. passing waiters. all the quests have a name tag on, like at some kind of conference.

selena, the blonde who discovered the power source, is circulating among the quests. she has changed since we saw her last. no longer the girl next door, she now wears a fabulous designer dress dripping with jewels. she walks with the regal air of someone used to being obeyed, and graciously accepts the homage of the quests. a smile, a nod, a kind word from her leaves them all basking in the warm afterglow of her attention. but we notice odd details of the party: the decorations are all based on mystic occult symbols. at the refreshment table, there is a big ten-foot wicker sculpture of a female goat covered with paper flowers. and the quests all have an indefinable air of strangeness about them. bianca, a tall cold-eyed brunette in black silk dress, whispers in selena's ear .

bianca
				be careful. nigel is going to try something.



					selena
				don't worry about old nigel, i can take care of him. 
he's just a sore loser.

an elderly man in a three-piece pin-stripe suit grabs her elbow.

elderly man
				i don't want much, selena. i have simple tastes.

selena 
what do you want?

	elderly man 
western europe.

	selena
i'm sorry, but i already promised bianca she could 
have switzerland. you know how she loves to ski.

	elderly man
no problem. she can have it. i hate mountains.

selena leaves him negotiating boundary lines with bianca and strolls over to a sour-faced man in suede who has been scowling at her over his cigarette.

selena 
cheer up, nigel. it's not the end of the world.

nigel
				it may well be. i know how you won that election 
selena. you can't fool me.

	selena
i have plans nigel. you could come with me...
i'm going places.

					nigel
				you're not going anywhere. except back to nowheresville.
you're too impatient, selena. look around you--all 
these people have served years and years of apprenticeship.
some of their families have been in the craft for generations. 
you can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.

selena smirks at him, self-confidently.

selena
				i just did. because i have the power.

					nigel
				you're going to pay a terrible price. the power of shadow 
is tricky. use it too much and it takes over. 

nigel drops his cigarette, stubs it out on the lawn, and takes out his platinum cigarette case.

selena
bianca's taught me all! need to know. i'll be safe, as 
long as i don't go too far. 

	nigel
cigarette?

he holds the shiny mirror-like cigarette case in front of her so she can see her reflection.

insert. surface of the cigarette case. selena's reflection. she is still the glamorous beauty, but looming behind her...invisible to ordinary eyes...is a dark eerie shape of something hideous.

back to scene.

quick as a cat, selena bats the cigarette case out of his hand and sends it spinning into the shrubbery. all traces of the shadow behind her have disappeared.

					nigel
				sorry. forgot you were trying to quit.


nigel snags a glass of champagne off the tray of a nearby waiter and sips it insolently.

selena
				nigel, get out of here. and don't come slithering 
back.
nigel shakes his head.

nigel
				you need me, selena. i'm the only one who can save 
you from a terrible fate.

	selena
i need you like an eskimo needs a lawnmower. now 
burn rubber.

nigel locks eyes with her.

nigel
				make me.

he takes another insolent sip of champagne...arid discovers a scorpion perched on the rim of his glass.

nigel spits out the champagne and, drops the glass. everyone laughs at him.


nigel
				balefire on you, selena!

					selena
				    (grinning)
				you scorpios can never take a joke.

all quests have fallen silent, staring at the altercation between the two of them. 

					nigel
				you think you are on top now. well there is someone 
coming to challenge you. i saw it in the cards this morning.

	selena 
throw him out.

two burly waiters seize nigel and drag him off toward the valet parking.

nigel
				you won't last a year, selena. the cards don't lie!

the crowd breaks into a buzz of conversation. 

bianca stands up on a chair. the crowd falls silent.
	
					bianca
				let's not let one rotten apple spoil the party. i give you 
the first woman in eight hundred years to head 
the circle: selena!

applause. selena steps up onto a raised dais. and holds up her hands in an invocational gesture.

selena
				thank you, sisters and brothers of the craft. it is a 
great honor you have given me, and i will try to be
worthy. and when my secret plans are revealed --
you will learn that we are on the threshold of 
power and influence undreamed of when nigel was 
our leader.

more applause. one of the cooks applauding at the refreshment table knocks over a fuel-pot under a chafing dish. the fuel-pot falls on the ground at the base of the wicker goat statue.  

					selena
				and now, ,i call upon the great mother--the spirit 
of nature --- to bless all our endeavors in the 
coming year...

a woman in the .audience screams. everyone looks where, she is pointing. the huge ten-foot tall wicker statue ,bursts into flames.

panic and pandemonium. some of the quests run for safety. others try to throw water onto the blazing, torch-like statue, but in vain. selena frowns at the spectacle, and, without a word, turns and stalks into her house.
