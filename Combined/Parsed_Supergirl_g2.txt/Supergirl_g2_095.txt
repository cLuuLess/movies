int. x-ray room

ethan bursts into an empty surgical x-ray room---the pursuing apparatus visible a few yards behind. he slams the heavy lead-lined door and bolts it shut.

he hears the thud of the apparatus beating impotently against the door. he leans against the door panting, his cotton hospital gown and robe soaked with cold sweat. suddenly, with a whir of motors, the giant multi-armed c.a.t. scanner behind him comes to life, its lights glowing, and reaches out its chrome steel arms toward him.

ethan yells, runs across the room, climbs on a gurney, rips a metal grill off the wall, and dives into the air conditioning duct.
