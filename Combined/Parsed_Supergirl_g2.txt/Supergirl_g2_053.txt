ext. street opposite h]1..mbup.ger restaurant. night

there is a construction site next to the hamburger place.  a giant bulldozer suddenly roars to life and bursts through the chain link fence surrounding the construction site. with no one at the controls, the bulldozer drives out onto the street. ethan sees its gaping jaws and runs clumsily away. they snap at him with the clash of steel. he stumbles and the bulldozer scoops him up. it wheels around and starts to carry him away, with one of his legs protruding through the teeth of its giant mouth. the onlookers are stunned and horrified.

				omigod, it's a runaway!

lucy sprints out into the street, running after the driverless bulldozer.

linda 
lucy; come back!

	lucy
somebody's gotta do something!!

lucy dodges through the cars and alongside the bulldozer. she climbs bravely up into the driver's seat and tries to tug at the controls. they are frozen. in desperation lucy yanks on the steering wheel. the bulldozer turns ninety degrees into the gas station.
