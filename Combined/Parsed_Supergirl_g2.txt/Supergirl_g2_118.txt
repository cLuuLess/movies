ext. top of ferris wheel

supergirl
				all this talk about love, it's silly.

					ethan
				you don't like me? you hate me?

there is such a look of tragedy on ethan's face, that supergirl is afraid he might instantly fling himself to his death if she said yes. 

supergirl
				of course i don't hate you. i  don't hate anyone.

ethan
				what do you feel about me?


					supergirl
				i...i don't know. this is all so sudden.

the camera racks focus for a moment to discover :

selena, lurking.be1ow them in the shadows of the spine snapper ride.

ethan 
				there's one sure way to find out how you feel.

supergirl 
what's that?

	ethan 
let me kiss you.

supergirl
				no.

					ethan
				you're not afraid are you?

					supergirl
				of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.

ethan
				if we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead.
come on. you can learn more from one kiss than from 
years in school.

	supergirl
well...i guess one is all right.

she closes her eyes, parts her lips, and leans forward.

supergirl 
is this how?

	ethan
terrific.

their lips meet. zowie.

					selena
				what a touching scene!

her voice is like having a bucket of ice water dashed over you. ethan and supergirl pull apart. the ferris wheel has carried them all the way around and back down again. selena is standing beside them. supergirl stands up and steps boldly out of the gondola to confront her.

supergirl
				who are you ?

					selena
				i am selena. give him to me. now. or you'll both 
be sorry.

					supergirl
				i don't scare that easily.

selena rummages down deep in her handbag and pulls out the gargoyle box.

selena
				all right, miss know-it-all. if i can't have him, 
nobody can.

she holds the gargoyle box out toward the ferris wheel.

selena
				coffer of shadow, show your power!

insert c.u. of the bolts holding ethan's gondola to the ferris wheel: the bolts unscrew and fall out.

back to scene

ethan yells as his gondola falls off the ferris wheel and down onto the tent, which covers the dodgem cars.
