int. linda's room. night

linda enters the room she shares with lucy. she puts lucy's car keys on her bedside table next to the snapshots of  lucy's family and of her half-dozen current boyfriends. linda turns and crosses the room to her own monastic bed in its drab, undecorated corner. she lies down on her bed with a sigh, staring at the ceiling in a melancholy mood.

suddenly, she senses that something is not right. she gets up from the bed, walks to the window, and gazes out a-t the deserted campus.
