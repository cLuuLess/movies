she lands and walks among the huge trunks of a primeval forest. shafts of sunlight pierce the gloom. these trees are much more impressive than zaltar's imitation back in argo city. she hears a mournful sound and pulls back a spray of brambles. she sees a baby deer hopelessly tangled in the long canes. she shoots rays of heat vision from her eyes and slices through the tough stems. the fawn scrambles free, and scampers off into the forest. kara watches it with a benevolent smile. she removes a brunette wig and some street clothing from a secret pocket in her cape.
