int. selena's living room. night

selena paces agitatedly in her living room. finally she stops in front of the ornate mirror hanging on the wall. she puts her hand on the heavy veil covering it.

selena
				show me ethan.

she rips aside the veil. the image in the mirror shows ethan staggering drunkenly through the night cown the centre white line of a highway. cars whizz past him in both directions.

selena 
the silly fool!
