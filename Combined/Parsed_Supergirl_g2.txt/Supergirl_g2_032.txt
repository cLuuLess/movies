int. linda and lucy's room. day

lucy runs in, fresh from her softball game, and sits down on the bed as usual to dig the mud out of her cleats. lucy's bed is still a riot of stuffed animals and frilly lace pillows. linda's bed' across the room is austere and almost monastic, with no family photos, posters, or toys.

lucy
				hey, linda, you in there?

linda (o.s.)
				uh-huh.

linda answers from inside the shut bathroom door.
lucy
				how much longer you gonna be?

linda (o.s.)
				not long. i'm cutting my hair.

lucy crosses to the bathroom door. 

lucy
				you're a maniac! let me do it for you. you'll look awful.
