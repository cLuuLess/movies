ext. front door of mansion

selena is listening impatiently to nigel, and staring oddly at him.

nigel
				...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the great 
mother to protect us... why. are you staring at me 
like that?

selena
				i was just thinking, if i had your skin problems, i'd use a 
good tannisroot ointment. every night.

nigel is rather vain about his smooth olive complexion, so he is completely thrown off his stride.

nigel
				nothing's wrong with my skin.

					selena
				such a shame. you ought to take better care of 
yourself.

selena closes the door while he's off his guard. nigel takes a pocket mirror out of his shoulder bag and stares with horror at his reflection. his face is erupting all over in ugly red blotches.

nigel 
nasty bitch!
