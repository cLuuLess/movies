int. selena's mansion. front hall/living room

supergirl looks around. the house seems deserted and drastically neglected. cobwebs hang over everything. the dust has the thickness of a hundred years. moths have eaten away all the splendid tapestries. rats cavort along the baseboards. bats sleep in the chandeliers. in the living room supergirl finds bianca crouched in a corner, gibbering mindlessly. bianca too has changed: she is dressed in rags, and her wild staring eyes are rimmed with dark circles. when she sees supergirl she cries with fright.

supergirl
				hey take it easy. i won't hurt you.

bianca
				i thought .it was her, coming back. spared me. 
but i thought. . . maybe changed her mind. 
nigel warned us. wouldn't listen to him.

	supergirl
what are you talking about? where's selena?

bianca
				no. don't want to know. she's bad. don't go near her.
				hurt you.

supergirl 
i have to find her. tell me.

supergirl looks into bianca's eyes with her calm, heroic gaze, and bianca comes somewhat to her senses. bianca points to the adjoining bar. supergirl walks over warily and sees five golden cages suspended among the bottles. nigel and the four remaining members of the circle are imprisoned in them, shrunken but alive. nige1 is in a perpetually turning squirrel wheel. he sees her and calls out.

nigel
				supergirl! she's waiting for you. on taliesen mountain. 
stop her before it's too late!

supergirl gets a look of determination on her face. she turns and flies out through the french doors and heads straight up into the air.
