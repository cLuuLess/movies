ext. amusement park

selena is trapped inside the ring of posts, fumbling in her bag. one by one she takes out dried herbs, feathers, dusts, and flings them at the bars while she shouts magic word. nothing works.

selena
				yookoohoo! no, that's not it. sis-o-reb! nope. 
ka-ma-hoochie!

bianca appears out of the shadows. selena looks up, embarrassed.

					bianca
				sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.

					selena
				shut up, and get me a hacksaw.

bianca pauses uncertainly.

bianca
				why don't you use the coffer of shadow?


					selena
                  (evasively)
i don't feel like it right now.

					bianca
				she didn't take it from you, did she?

					selena
				that little girl? ha.  now go on, get me some tools.

bianca
				there's no need. i learned the craft from my 						grandmother.

bianca takes out a bundle of twigs from her pocket and strokes the bars of the fence with it.

bianca 
sycoraka f'kah s'koo...

the bars fall down like boiled spaghetti. selena steps out of the circle of confinement with queenly dignity.

selena
				good. now bring the car. we must call a meeting of 
the seven.

bianca bows.

bianca 
yes, mistress.

bianca hurries off toward the parking lot. selena watches her until she turns the corner of the haunted house. then selena kneels down and carefully reaches under the deck of the carousel for the gargoyle box.

					selena
				there you are. come to mama.

she takes out the box, s1ips it inside her cloak, and stands up. she casts a last glance around the scene of her defeat, and strides off after bianca.
