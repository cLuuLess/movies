int. cadillac

selena is gathering up her scattered things from the floor of the car.

selena
				i said stop, i didn't say run into a brick wall.

					bianca 
what is it?

		selena
the coffer of shadow. look at it.

the metal gargoyle box is glowing with an inner radiance.

					selena 
what does it mean?

bianca
				the danger. the one nigel spoke of. it must be near .

they stare out the car window at the girls' softball game, which was resumed.

selena
oh, fiddlesticks. what could be dangerous about a 
baseball game?

	bianca
softball.

	
selena
				it must be the girls. one of the girls.

					bianca 
but which one?

selena
				drive on. we have already attracted enough 
attention.

bianca starts up the car again and drives smoothly away.

selena
				we'll bide our time and keep watch. young girls 
just can't keep a secret. if one of them's up to 
something--we'll find out.

	bianca
and then, like great cats---we pounce! and destroy!

the car swerves slightly.

selena
				bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at 
the wheel. ok?

	bianca 
sorry, mistress.
