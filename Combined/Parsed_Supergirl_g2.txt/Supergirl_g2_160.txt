int. hamburger heaven. day

the restaurant has been converted into a clandestine print shop. a few serious teenagers are working the press and turning out seditious handbills. freshly printed pages are hung on clothes-lines so the ink can dry. "the truth about selena" is the headline over jimmy's photo of her getting into the cadillac with her huge shadow looming behind. lucy crosses to jimmy olsen, who is tying up bundles of handbills.

lucy
				i had to dump the papers in a trashcan. the danvers 
have been arrested!

					jimmy
				how do you know?

					lucy
				i saw them dragged out of the administration building.

					jimmy 
did anybody notice you?

	lucy
i can't help it if men notice me.

	jimmy
lucy! be serious. we could be executed for  treason!

she kisses him on the nose.

lucy 
just kidding. nobody saw me.

jimmy gives her another bundle of handbills. helmeted guards in the livery of selena's service kick down the door. and rush in, weapons drawn. they smash up the print shop and arrest everybody. jimmy and lucy are handcuffed and dragged away.
