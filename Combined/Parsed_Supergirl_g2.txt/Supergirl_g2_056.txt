ext. motel/gas station. night

lucy fights the wheel in vain. the bulldozer circles through the motel, smashing the individual cabins into matchsticks. the bulldozer drives under the motel sign which hits lucy on the head, knocking her unconscious. finally, the bulldozer comes full circle and halts against a utility pole next to the gas station. the utility pole leans at a crazy angle. its electric wires break and dangle down, flashing blue arcs of electricity where they touch the pavement. the river of gasoline from the broken pump flows inexorably toward the arcing power lines. the mother kneels beside her dazed husband and looks over at her toddler running toward the arcing wires, his arms held out eagerly.

mother
my baby!!!!!

instead of helping, the onlookers turn and flee the inevitable fire.
