lucy
				i cut my own hair once. i looked so awful the only 
thing was to go totally punk!

linda opens the door and steps out of the bathroom. she is wearing her brunette wig and her linda clothing. lucy is puzzled.

lucy
				your hair looks the same.

linda
				it was just a trim.

the student hall monitor sticks her head in the door and yells excitedly.

jody
				hey guys, gloria just got a package from home.

					lucy 
what's in it?

jody
				a hair dryer that makes popcorn!

					lucy 
wow! pig-out time. come on linda.

lucy hurries to the door. linda holds back.

linda
no thanks. you go on.

	lucy
you sure?

linda nods bravely, and lucy dashes off down the hall toward the lounge. linda stands alone in the room.

a beam of light from the setting sun shines through the room, and casts a pool of light on the opposite wall. linda looks at the beam of light with nostalgia.
