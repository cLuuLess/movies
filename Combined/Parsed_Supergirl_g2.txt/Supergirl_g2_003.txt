ext. a springtime meadow - u.s.a. - day. under titles

a beautiful blonde in jeans and a frilly blouse is walking across a field of wildflowers. butterflies flitter and dart from flower to flower. the blonde's name is selena. she is our ideal image of the girl next door, who grew up into a dynamite lady.

her current boyfriend follows along behind her, lugging a big wicker hamper from their pickup truck parked at the edge of the road. selena finds a grassy spot under an old oak. and spreads out a red and white checked gingham cloth..

selena 
over here george. it's the perfect spot. nice view.

george sets down the wicker basket and selena starts to unpack a scrumptious picnic of home cooked food. she unpacks fried chicken, hard-boiled eggs, potato salad, cold beer and a big rich creamy-frosted devils food cake.

					george
				you sure are a good cook, selena. man, that looks 
too pretty to eat.

	selena
better eat it quick. it won't look too pretty when it's 
all covered with ants.

she hands him a chicken drumstick and a hard-boiled egg.

					george
				selena, i've been thinking. it's time i settled 
down---and i don't know a nicer lady to settle
down with than you.

selena
				why george, are you proposing?

					george
marry me, selena. the hardware store doesn't bring 
in much now, but...

selena
				george---i thought you'd never ask.

a shrill whistling sound from above makes them look up. with a loud plop and a spatter of icing the omegahedron falls into the middle of the chocolate cake.

george
				what the heck is that?

they look up in the boughs of the tree overhead, and then down at the chocolate cake splashed all over the checked cloth.

selena
a squirrel frisbee?

selena reaches out and picks up the omegahedron. it comes away from the cake without a trace of the chocolate icing sticking to its surface, as if made of some substance, which repels other kinds of matter.

selena holds the shining omegahedron in her hand and examines it, turning it around and around as if hypnotized. her face takes on a new expression. almost as if the simple, wholesome innocence of her nature had been blasted away by some profound new knowledge of the universe.

selena
				that's funny. i'd swear i know just what this is, 
but i've never seen it before.

she stands up and walks across the checkered cloth, in a beeline for the pickup truck.

george
				hey, where you going?

					selena
				     (calling over her shoulder) 
i've got things to do.

	george 
what about my proposal?

	selena 
         (dismissively) 
call me next week. maybe we can have lunch.

she gets in the pickup and. drives away.

george 
hey! my truck!

dissolve to:








 kara' s face

she is ten years older now, a young lady. almost ready to assume the long flowing gown of an adult, but still in the tunic worn by those under eighteen.

alura
				      (voice over)
				but kara, you are too young to go.

another angle. argo city. dimmed

they are in the assembly amphitheater of the city, where the kindergarten nuclear physics class was seen. kara is in the centre of the ring, with adults seated in scattered rows around her. her parents zor-el and alura are standing in front of her.

kara
				i am almost an adult. this is what i want.

zor-el
				but kara, no one has ever gone from here to 
earth. the journey is dangerous.

	kara
it was my fault we lost the power source.

	zor-el
years ago. and it was zaltar who stole it.

	kara
i allowed it to escape the city.

	alura
ever since we told you how your cousin superman 
was sent there as an infant, all you have wanted to do 
was visit this place.

	kara
yes, i do want to go. but someone must go. our 
scanning shows the power source has finally 
reached the earth. it could destroy everything unless 
someone brings it back.

	zor-el 
superman will return it.

	kara
why haven't you been able to contact him? he should 
have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. he 
may be dead.
zor-el
but what can you, a mere girl-

	kara
i'll have super powers there. like him. we can't wait. 
our lights are fading. look around you. when i was a 
child the city was bright and shining. look at it now.

zor-el and alura sigh. there is no denying that the brilliance of argo city has been much dimmed since kara was a little girl.

					alura
				what do your teachers think?

zor-el looks around the circle. a beautiful woman speaks.

					teacher
				it would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones 
to the dimension barrier-- but the city cannot last much 
longer without the power source. it is her future she's 
fighting for, zor-el.

	zor-el
very well, let it be done.

alura embraces kara emotionally, fighting back the tears. kara too is struggling to control her own emotions.

kara
				don't worry, mother, i'll be all right. i've studied 
the transmissions from earth. i know their customs.

kara walks out of the amphitheater with her parents.

alura
				but they are such strange, unstable people.

					kara
				then i will learn to act strange like them.

kara holds up a small handbag. inside we glimpse red and blue material.

					kara
				i have made clothing and copies of their money, i 
will be fine.




her father puts his hand on her shoulder .

					zor-el
				be brave, my .daughter. be wise.

					kara
				as brave as my father. as wise.

they embrace, briefly. kara then steps onto a circular platform set into the pavement of the city.

 instantly transparent bubble forms around her.

her parents watch as she floats away.

she passes into an air lock through the membrane that surrounds the city, and off into an infinity of space.

montage: the journey of kara inside "her sphere from the inner dimension to our world.

her sphere moves from blackness, to a dark green limbo. the atmosphere thickens around her. soon it is unmistakably water, and she is heading toward the light above. a fish darts past with a flash of silver. the sphere rushes upward faster and faster. it breaks the surface of the , water. kara springs free of the bubble, which disappears. she is now wearing a blue and red costume like her cousin superman.

she lands on a nearby beach.
