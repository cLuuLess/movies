ext. inner space

supergirl and selena fly together through the dark reaches of inner space. supergirl is tired but triumphant. the omegahedron glows brightly in her hand. selena looks around her with awe and wonder.

selena
				will they be angry with me for 
stealing the power source?



	supergirl
they'll be grateful. if you hadn't found 
it, it would still be lost. look, up ahead.

selena
				yes, i see it. shining like a jewel.

					supergirl 
				that's home.

p.o.v. of supergirl and selena

argo city floats ahead, seeming to welcome them, its lights, growing brighter and brighter as they return with the lost source


fade out:
