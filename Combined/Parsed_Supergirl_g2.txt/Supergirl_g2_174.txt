int. selena's living room

supergirl smashes through the ceiling and lands next to the french doors. ethan and selena are standing against the opposite wall, next to the veiled mirror.

				you've had your fun, selena, the game is over.

					ethan 
she has hostages.

	selena
the danvers. and two of your little friends.

	supergirl
it's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.

ethan points to the conservatory and mimes the words 'out there'. selena blows on the silver whistle on the chain around her neck.

insert: the serpent holding jimmy olsen's cage opens its mouth and the cage drops away.
