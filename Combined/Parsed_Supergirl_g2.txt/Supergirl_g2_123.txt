ext. tropical beach. day

supergirl lands ethan in his battered dodgem car on a beautiful, deserted tropical beach. palm trees wave over a white sand beach. the blue ca1m of a lagoon mirrors huge white clouds that hang motipn1ess on the horizon like colossal snowy mountains. gaily-coloured parrots screech in the branches of blooming hibiscus and jacaranda. ethan gets out of his carnival ride and gazes around w1th awe at the beautiful scene.

supergirl
				i thought i'd show you one of my favourite places.

					ethan 
it's paradise . we could be very happy here.

supergirl
				but i have to go back. i brought you here so 
you'd be safe. from her.

	ethan
you can't just abandon me.  alone.

his words strike a sensitive nerve in her. she relents.

supergirl 
i'll stay for a while.

ethan is filled with enthusiasm.

ethan
				great! i'ii build a house-- right over there, with 
a veranda looking out to sea. and i'll plant a 
garden! papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes---
anything'll grow here. and i'ii fish in the lagoon, 
and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---

	supergirl 
ethan---when i said 'a while' i meant a couple of hours.

ethan's face falls. he looks at her beseechingly.

supergirl
				well, maybe a little longer than that.

she smiles and takes his hand. together they walk along the beach.
