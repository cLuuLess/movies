ext. beside a stream. tropical paradise. day

ethan is sitting beside a stream on a gravelly bank idly tossing pebbles into the water. supergirl steps out of the jungle and watches for a moment. then she comes and sits down beside him.

ethan
				hi.

					supergirl
				hello. are you still mad at me?

					ethan
				i'm not mad at you.

					supergirl
				it seemed that way to me.

					ethan
				i know i was acting funny---i'm sorry. it's just...i miss it.

					supergirl 
miss what?

ethan
				what i had before. what's not there now. it's like i 
woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more:
something that made me feel really alive and aware of 
things. it was like, for the first time in my life, everything 
fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world 
around us--like we were a wonderful song...

he falls silent, and tosses a few pebbles into the stream.

supergirl
				and now?

					ethan
				and now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words 
don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...



	supergirl
well...i don it know much about these things, but maybe 
if you had that feeling once...it can, come back. 

he turns to her hopefully.

					ethan 
you think so?

	supergirl 
i don't see why not.

	ethan
but what if---it wasn't real? 

supergirl
				feelings are real. once you've had them, they're yours 
forever.

ethan's face lights up. the future begins to exist for him again.

					ethan
				hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we 
could get together every now and then and see each 
other. and maybe something might. happen again. 
what do you think?

	supergirl
are you asking me for a "date"?

ethan
				why not? you're a good-looking girl. and i'm---
available.

	supergirl
aren't you forgetting about selena?

	ethan
she'll forget about us eventually.
