int. living room. day

selena witnesses the destruction of her hostage scheme.

selena
				all right, supergirl. the game's not over till 
the last card's dealt.

selena opens the lid of the grotesquely swollen coffer of shadow sitting beside her on the floor. the omegahedron inside spins.

all the furniture in the room suddenly launches itself at supergirl. huge oak refectory tables, alabaster thrones, marble urns, iron firegrates, shie1ds and armour, bronze statuary, and razor sharp panes of glass from the windows all shatter themselves against her invulnerable body. ethan stands in the corner, ducking the stray fragments that come his way.

supergirl
				you've run out of things to throw, selena.
	
					selena
				not yet.

selena points her hand at supergirl with a gesture of attack. the coffer of shadow emits a dense black mist that darkens the room. a giant invisible hand seizes supergirl and hurls her into the alchemical bar with a crash of bottles. supergirl stands up with the wand held in front of her to ward off another attack.

ethan
				it's her shadow-self! her dark side!

supergirl
				how do i fight it?

					ethan
				turn it against her.

supergirl raises the wand and applies it to her own body. there is a flash of blinding light, and supergirl is transformed into a perfect image of selena---as she was at the fairgrounds.

there are now two selenas in the room---the real one beside the coffer of shadow, and the one holding the matterwand in the alchemical bar. the real selena is first astonished, and then furious.

real selena
				power of shadow, kill her!!

the second selena calls out to the shadow-self in selena's own unmistakable voice.

second selena 
no. i am your mistress. do not harm me.

real selena 
don't listen to her! kill her! she's lying.

	second selena
you are my shadow, you must obey me.

the real selena is distracted by the duel of willpower with her double and doesn't notice ethan creeping along the wall toward the coffer of shadow.

ethan lunges for the shining omegahedron inside, and snatches it out just as the heavy lid slams shut with a clang of metal. ethan rolls over and over on the floor, away from selena, clutching the, shining ring to him like a football in the end zone after a quarterback sneak on a fourth down trailing seven to six with three seconds on the clock.

ethan
				i've got it! the power source!

the real se1ena cries out with despair.

and then the shadow attacks her. the real selena cries out as she is surrounded by a black mist that starts slowly choking the life out of her.

real selena
        (terrified)
no! stop! please!


ethan hands the power source to the second selena in the bar. 

					second selena
				thank you. i'll take this back to argo city.

					ethan
				it is you, then, really?

without a word, the second selena kisses him on the lips.

second selena
				well?

ethan
				it's you all right.

					second selena
				i'll make it easy for you.

she again applies the wand to her own body. there is a flash of light, and once more supergirl stands before him, clutching both the power source and the wand.

					ethan
				i couldn't help what i did, before. she drugged me.


					supergirl
				i never doubted you for a moment.

					real selena
				supergirl. please! help! i'm dying...

supergirl steps toward the corner of the room beside the mirror where the real selena is imprisoned in the cloud of blackness. supergirl touches the shadow with her wand. there is a cosmic musical chord, and the shadow is destroyed; it falls to the floor in a rain of hard, dark cinders.

the real selena rises from the corner of the room where she was released from the grip of the shadow. she looks at herself in the mirror. she is changed into the softer, more innocent person she was at the picnic before she found the omegahedron. there is no more evil shadow looming behind her in the mirror reflection. she turns to supergirl and ethan.

selena
				i'm free. i can never thank you enough.

supergirl
				for what?

				
selena points to the glittering omegahedron supergirl holds.

selena
				ever since i found that thing i've been like 
a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. you have 
no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.

supergirl
				your nightmares are over. i'm taking this back to 
argo city where it won't be misused.
         (to ethan)
you could come too. it might be safer for you.

ethan
				no thanks. i have friends in the resistance. they'll 
vouch for me. i figure i might get a million bucks 
for my memoirs.

					supergirl
				i'll come back as soon as i can.

					selena
				what about me? they'll make, hash out of me around 
here.

supergirl and ethan exchange a glance. selena's innocence is the one problem they have not foreseen.

ethan
				she's right. they'll string her up.

supergirl
				do you want to come to argo city?

selena 
				what's it like?

supergirl
				it's the most beautiful place in the universe.

selena 
				sounds o.k. to me. let's go.

supergirl holds out the matterwand to selena.

supergirl
				grab hold of this. it forms a force field for the 
journey through inner space.

selena grasps the matterwand and the two of them fly together out the french doors.
