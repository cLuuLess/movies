ext. hamburger heaven. midvale. day

the roadside complex where lucy's traffic accident occurred. the hamburger place is boarded up. the area is almost deserted and no cars pass on the street. all of the huge advertising billboards along the way are now covered with pictures of selena. the only writing is in mystic symbols. a lone figure walks furtively along the street. it is lucy lane, her face disguised with dark glasses. she goes to the rear of the abandoned hamburger place and knocks four times. the door opens quickly and she ducks inside.
