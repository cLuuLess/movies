ext. high in the air above the hospital. sunset

supergirl carries ethan beside her, her arm tight around his upper chest, his arm over her shoulders. they are above the clouds bathed in the rich warm glow of sunset. he looks at her ecstatically, his eyes drunk with love.

ethan

life. i'll die if i can't spend the rest of my life just looking 
at you, holding you in my arms...
