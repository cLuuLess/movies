int. ethan's room. day

he is sitting in bed, an ice bag on his head, drawing a picture of supergirl on a piece of cardboard. he is in pajamas and robe.

selena steps beside the bed. he looks up.

					ethan
				oh no, not you again.

					selena
				what an adorable hat.

					ethan 
				they think i have a concussion.

					selena
				and you think you're in love.

					ethan 
i know it.

	selena
this "love" of yours will soon wear off. i gave you 
a temporary love potion.

ethan
				why should i believe you?

					selena 
				it's the truth. in twenty-four hours you'll forget all 
about that girl.

ethan. reaches out and grabs her cloak with a grip of such urgency that she is pulled slightly off balance.

					ethan
				then i'm not the only one who saw her. you did too!

selena pulls his hand away from her cloak.
selena
				yes, yes i saw the whole thing. how could you be 
interested in that puny little girl?

	ethan
but she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.

	selena
forget her, you're mine. i saw you first.

selena sits on the side of the bed. she removes a vial of liquid from her bodice.
i saw you

selena 
                (continuing)
	here. drink this. it's an antidote to the love drug i 
gave you.

ethan sweeps it on the floor, where it shatters. he starts frantically ringing the buzzer pinned to his bed.

ethan 
nurse! nurse!

selena
you can't escape from me that easily. i'm afraid 
you don't know who i am.

	ethan
nurse!

	selena
don't think i'm weak, just because i'm a woman. i have 
power. give in, stop fighting me, ethan. i always get 
what i want.

ethan 
nurse! help !

the door opens and a nurse walks in.

					nurse
				would you stop screaming. there are sick people trying 
to sleep.

ethan
				get her away from me.  she's crazy.


					nurse 
                   (to selena) 
are you family? visiting hours are over.

selena
				they're over for you sweetheart.

selena removes the gargoyle-shaped box from her sleeve and opens the lid. the omegahedron inside spins and sends out a powerful force, which slides the nurse backwards out the door and pins her to the wall of the corridor outside. the door slams shut. selena closes the lid of the coffer and turns to ethan.

selena
				now you see who you're dealing with.

ethan scrambles out of the bed and away from her, backing toward the window.

ethan 
leave me alone.

selena, at the bed, discovers his sketch of supergirl on the piece of cardboard.

					selena
				this is your problem, right here. this girl's driving 
you insane, ethan. let me help you.

	ethan
i don't want your help.

	selena
come back to my house. my car's outside.

selena reaches out a hand to ethan.

					ethan
				no!

					selena
				i never met a man i couldn't have--and you're no 
different from the rest!

the door opens behind her and two security officers push  inside, with guns drawn.


security officer
				okay, what's going on in h--



selena gestures with the gargoyle box at the men and their guns fly out of their hands and up to the ceiling. the men stare at the ce1ling, astonished. ethan takes advantage of the distraction to dash out through the open door. selena turns to look at ethan escaping and the
guns fall to the floor and discharge. the security men run into ethan's bathroom, slamming the door behind them.

selena ducks out into the corridor.
