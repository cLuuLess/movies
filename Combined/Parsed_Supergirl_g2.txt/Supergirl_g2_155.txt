int. selena's sitting room

the secretary closes the doors leaving ethan and selena alone. she strokes his head. outside crowds can be heard chanting her name: "selena! selena!"

selena
				they want me. doesn't it make you proud?

					ethan
				yeah.

selena gets up and walks over to the door leading out to her balcony.

selena
				coming?

ethan follows her sullenly.
