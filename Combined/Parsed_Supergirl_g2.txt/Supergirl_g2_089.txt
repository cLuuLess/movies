int. hospital. day

lucy lane is sitting up in bed with a white bandage around her head. superman's pal jimmy olsen is standing awkwardly beside the bed holding a small bunch of daffodils. lucy is talking animatedly on her bedside telephone, when linda enters.

lucy
				...come see me. and smuggle in a pint, they won't 
let me have anything, but make sure it's jamocha 
almond fudge . . listen, i got to run, my 
roommate just walked in. bye.

lucy hangs up and turns to linda.

lucy
				hey, linda-babes! i've got so much to tell you, i 
don't know where to begin! oh -- this is jimmy 
olsen, he works with clark and my sister at the 
newspaper.




					jimmy
				nice to meet you. lucy's told me all about you. your 
cousin clark taught me everything i know about
the newspaper business.

	linda 
nice to meet you.

she shakes hands shyly with jimmy, then turns to lucy.

linda
				i'm afraid i have some bad news about your car.

					lucy
				mr. danvers called. i'll get a new one with the 
insurance money. b.f.d. 

jimmy keeps looking at linda.

jimmy
				do you have any theories about last night?

					linda
				theories?

					jimmy
				how lucy and that guy got to the hospital. and all 
that damage at the school. the police are calling it 
a freak tornado. i'd like to interview you for the daily- -

lucy 
      (overlapping) 
oh, jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one 
second?

jimmy
				-- planet. i mean, you were there. do you think it was natural,
				 or like some people are claiming, supernatural?

					linda
				i believe there's a rational explanation for everything. but 
i don't know what it is.

	jimmy
can i quote you?




lucy hands jimmy a stainless steel urinal.

lucy
				jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers 
in water before they die?

jimmy
				oh, sure.

he steps into lucy's bathroom with the urinal and fills it with water from her shower. lucy grabs linda's arm and whispers urgently in her ear.

lucy
				listen, i know i've been saying you ought party 
more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? 
he's private property. i've been waiting years 
for him to develop.

	linda 
he's nice.

lucy
				nice? he's cute enough to melt lead!

jimmy emerges from the bathroom with his daffodils neatly arranged in the stainless steel jug.

jimmy
				where is your cousin clark, by the way?

					linda
				he's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.

					jimmy
				i knew it ! he's working on a  hot scoop !
