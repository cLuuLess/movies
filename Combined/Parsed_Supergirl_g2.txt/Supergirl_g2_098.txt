int. hospital corridor

linda walks out of lucy's room and quickly down the corridor. jimmy hurries to catch up with her.

jimmy

linda 
oh, no thanks.

	jimmy
it's no trouble. i'd like to ask you some more questions.

linda's heart sinks as she realises she doesn't know how to get rid of him politely.
