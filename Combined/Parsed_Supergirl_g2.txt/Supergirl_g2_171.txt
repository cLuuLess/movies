int. the phantom zone/quantum vortex

flaming spheres of ball lightning begin to whizz past zaltar and supergirl. zaltar is startled, and he stops his forward progress.

zaltar
				what's that? never saw anything like that.

					supergirl
				don't stop. keep moving.

					zaltar 
yes, mustn't stop.

	supergirl
       (grimly) 
 it's selena. i'm getting so i can recognise her work.

another flaming sphere whizzes toward them. it hits zaltar on the shoulder and knocks him off the safe path. he starts to roll backwards down the vortex.


supergirl 
zaltar. use the wand!

zaltar
				too late. too late. save yourself.

he is being swept faster and .faster away from her, receding like the image of ethan when she was trapped in the zone. zaltar throws the wand to her, and then is swept away, out of sight, downward to his death. he calls out after he disappears.

zaltar 
  				       (voice over) 
goodbye...

	supergirl
zaltar!

she begins to be swept backwards, but she uses the wand, and stops her slide. gripping the wand fiercely, she starts to forge ahead. all the while she has to dodge the flaming spheres that selena sends down the vortex.

supergirl
				you're not going to win, selena. i won't let you.

suddenly supergirl enters another area of the vortex. she begins to move forward, upward, without clawing her way. she accelerates, moving faster and faster.
