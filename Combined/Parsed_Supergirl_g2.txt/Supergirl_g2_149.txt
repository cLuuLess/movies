int. zaltar's house

he helps her down a long spiraling staircase to the floor of a high domed room. in the centre of the room is a huge round table cluttered with tools, models and unfinished projects.

supergirl 
it's lovely. . .

	zaltar
no, no. not lovely. 'perfect'. did everything 
just right. nobody telling you to change this, 
move that around. please yourself. that's

zaltar sighs with great martyrdom, and starts to fiddle with his controls.
