int. the phantom zone/quantum vortex

zaltar is continuing his climb, but the way is getting steeper, and he is tired and short of breath. he pauses.

					supergirl
				why are you stopping?


					zaltar
				stopping? was i? silly. one thing you 
musn't do.

he continues forward, and upward, firming their path with the matterwand. the wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the phantom zone. because of the inherent curvature of the phantom zone vortex, they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now. supergirl is close beside zaltar helping him along, not merely following as she had before. the throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed. zaltar stumbles, and drops the matterwand.

zaltar
				oh dear!

the vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards, down to where they have just climbed from.  supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past. but now she is being swept backwards.

zaltar 
the wand. use it.

supergirl somehow finds the right grip on the controls and points the wand at the undulating surface beneath her. she stills the moving surface and stops her backwards motion.

					zaltar
				good girl! that's the way!

but now zaltar is being swept backwards toward her. she points the wand at his feet and halts his downhill slide.

					zaltar
				you can use the wand.

					supergirl
				better than when i was a child.

she hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress.

zaltar
				i remember you then. cute thing you were. like 
your mother.
