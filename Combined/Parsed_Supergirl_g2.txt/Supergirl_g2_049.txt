int. the danvers' living room. night

linda is playing chess with mr. danvers, while his wife knits on the sofa.

mrs. danvers
				i think you'd better be getting back to the dorm, linda. 
the housemother'll expect you to sign in by eight.

linda stands up from the chessboard.

linda
				thank you both so much. it was a lovely lunch, mrs. 
danvers. i had a wonderful time. and you're a 
terrific chess player mr. danvers.

	mr. danvers

linda
				sure. mate in five moves.

she moves the pieces chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk...

linda
				...and there goes my king. got to hand it to you, i didn't 
see it coming. well, bye.

she walks out the door into the night.

mrs . danvers
				what a lovely child. such nice manners. we must 
have her back, don't you think?

mr. danvers 'grunts absent-mindedly, bemused at his loss.
