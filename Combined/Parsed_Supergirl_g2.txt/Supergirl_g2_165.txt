int. selena's living room. day

ethan enters. selena is staring into her magic mirror. her face is white with fear.

ethan 
what's going on?

selena snaps irritably at him.

selena 
guess! go on.

ethan
				i don't know. you seem afraid.

					selena
				you're a regular einstein, aren't you?

					ethan
				     (the truth dawns on him)
				supergirl?

selena doesn't answer, but looks back at the mirror. ethan moves to her side and watches with her the image of the phantom zone.
