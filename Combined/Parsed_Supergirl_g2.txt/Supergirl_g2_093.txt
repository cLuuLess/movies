int. hospital corridor

ethan is running away down the corridor. frightened patients peek out of their rooms. the nurse who was ejected from the room cringes in fear as selena emerges into the corridor.

ethan dodges past two orderlies who are pushing a heart-lung machine down from the surgery. selena raises the gargoyle box and points it at the heart-lung machine.

selena
				power of shadow---seize him.

the heart-lung machine comes to life---its lights flash, its array of tubes tipped with needle probes writhe like medusa's hair, its wheels turn around, and it chases  ethan down the corridor. selena laughs her deep throaty chuckle of triumph. ethan looks behind, sees the machine chasing him and cries out with alarm. a cart of surgical instruments rolls out of a closet in front of him, its scalpels standing up and pointing at him, quivering eagerly, blocking his path.

ethan dives through a swinging door to his left.
