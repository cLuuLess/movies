ext. selena's house. garden.  conservatory

ethan sees a green plastic garden hose, which the gardener has left running in a trickle to irrigate the hydrangeas. ethan remembers that he is very thirsty. he picks up the hose, rinses out his mouth hurriedly, and then takes long, desperate gulps of the water. behind him he hears selena's laughter. he drops the hose as if stung by an electric eel and turns to see her emerge from behind a large strangler fig.

insert ethan's p.o.v.

the same effect as when he drank the love potion the first time. the plants of the conservatory swirl and distort in garish nightmare colours. at the centre of his vision is an area of crystal clarity surrounding selena. she approaches him seductively, fully confident of her power. as she comes nearer, the clear area expands and drives out the visual chaos. selena speaks, and her voice is a close-miked throaty purr.

selena
				i told you i'd win.

back to scene

ethan is held by the spell of her magic. and yet there is part of him that still resists. you can see him try to turn his head away from the vision of ideal beauty before him, and then give in as she comes closer and i touches him with her hand. a zap of energy passes between them at her touch.

selena
				kiss me.
	
he embraces her roughly and crushes her lips with a kiss. he is filled with a tigerish lust that thrills her deeply. she rakes her long red fingernails across his back and moans with pleasure.
