ext. hamburger restaurant. night

linda can't take it any longer. she ducks into the deserted hamburger restaurant. an instant later, she emerges through a skylight in the roof in red and blue costume as supergirl! she stands on-the roof in front of a big illuminated advertising sign, which hides her from the fleeing crowd. supergirl takes a deep breath and blows with her super lungs:. the toddler is blown safely 1nto his mother's arms.

mother
				my baby.

she grasps the child in her arms and helps her husband hobble to safety just as the river of gasoline reaches the sparking wires and bursts into flames .

the bulldozer, with lucy lane unconscious at the controls and ethan imprisoned in the scoop, is surrounded by an impenetrable ring of fire . 



supergirl dashes through the ring of fire so fast that if there were any spectators who weren't running for their lives she would only be visible as a red and blue streak.
