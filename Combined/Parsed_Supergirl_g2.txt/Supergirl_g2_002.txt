int. argo city

and reveals the inside of a domed city honeycombed with fantastic arches. the city is inhabited by young beautiful people in luxurious but simple costumes.

the camera roams through the city, observing some people seated at a kind of cafe sipping drinks and relaxing; other people are in some kind of exercise class doing beautiful graceful movement; and finally a class of five year old children listen intently to a teacher who is demonstrating a molecular model.

					teacher
				and now, who can give me the electron 
				wave functions for kryptonian covalent 
				bonding?

the five year olds eagerly raise their hands. the teacher points to one.

child
				the cube root of the wavelength over the 
natural log of the integral of the speed of 
light squared.

the teacher smiles.

teacher
				well, maybe that was a bit too easy...

the camera roams on through the city, following the sound of a strange, ethereally beautiful singing. the camera discovers the source of the sound: an artist sculpting a beautiful crystalline object with a matterwand. the wand makes the singing noise as it creates matter out of energy. the artist, whose name is zaltar, sometimes whistles along in counterpoint. .

a small girl is watching him with fascination. her name is kara, and she is seven.

behind her, the dome, which encloses the city, marks the edge of the limbo outside.

kara
what are you making:

	zaltar
it's going to be a tree, i think.




kara 
what's a tree?

	zaltar
it's something they have on earth. you know,
 where your cousin went.

	kara 
where is earth?

	zaltar
didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in 
school?

	kara
yes, i know the equations---i just can't see it in 
my head.

zaltar laughs.

					zaltar
				even i have trouble with that sometimes. earth is in 
outer space. and we're in inner space. 

	kara
i don't understand.

	zaltar
wait till you're older. here -- watch this. 

zaltar takes a small omegahedron out of his pocket and holds it in his hand.

					zaltar.
				this is one of the four power sources of the city. 
i borrowed it from the guardians. look what i 
can do with it. 

zaltar touches his matter.wand to the omegahedron and the wand instantly becomes charged with flickering light. he touches his wand to the tree sculpture---and the 
sculpture comes alive with dancing lights and shadows. kara claps her hands with delight 
at the spectacle. zaltar steps back and admires his handiwork. he carefully puts down the
omegahedron at his feet, takes a small flask from his belt, and drinks.

				zaltar
			you see, a tree is a living thing.

				kara
			can you create life?

	
zaltar
				no, no, just the illusion of life. a kind of 
half-life, maybe. a pale shadow of the real 
thing. but it is lovely, the way the light plays 
over the surface. . . 

a woman's voice can be heard calling in the distance.

woman's voice 
kara. kara.

kara calls out in reply.

					kara 
i'm here, mother.

kara's mother alura appears through the lacey architecture of the city.

alura
				kara, you shouldn't be so near the edge 
without a grown-up.

	kara
i'm sorry, mother.

	zaltar
i was keeping an eye on her.


alura puts her arm around her daughter affectionately, showing she's not really angry. together they watch zaltar's latest sculpture, flickering with the play of inner light and shadow.

alura
				thank you, zaltar, but she has to obey the rules.

zaltar takes another swig from his flask. and lowers his voice confidentially.

zaltar
				you and your husband have been kind to me, 
alura. i have something to tell you: i'm going 
away. soon.

	alura 
but where?


zaltar bends down to kara and hands her his matterwand.

zaltar
				put your fingers there, kara. and press hard.

she does, and the wand makes a horrible squawk. kara laughs with delight.

zaltar
				good. now, go make something pretty.

kara scampers away, hardly able to believe her good fortune, and starts to make all kinds of 
surprising sounds with the wand on the plaza nearby. zaltar speaks to alura in a low, confidential voice.

zaltar
i've discovered a new way into the phantom 
zone.

	alura
but the phantom zone is for criminals.

	zaltar
it's big. and empty. i'm tired of limiting myself 
to  argo city. i want to do something new. i'm 
starting to repeat myself here with this airy, 
glittery stuff....

zaltar waves a hand deprecatingly at the city around him.

alura
				but zaltar---you founded the city! it's yours. we 
were all just refugees from krypton when you gathered 
us together and brought us here, to the inner dimension. 
you can't abandon us now. you have a responsibility to us!

in the background, kara has been modeling a spiky insect-like creature. now she suddenly finds the omegahedron on the ground beside her. she doesn't stop to wonder how it got there from beside zaltar's feet. she simply picks up the omegahedron and touches it to the spiky creature. the creature suddenly flicks its wings and comes to life, unnoticed by the adults. kara drops the wand and laughs out loud with delight as the magical creature takes off from the ground and starts flying in circles around her head, glittering as if it were made of diamonds.

zaltar
i'm an artist, alura. my work comes first. other 
people come second.

	alura
how can you create beauty...with a selfish heart?
the spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. her look of delight turns to fear. she tries to shoo the creature away. it flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.

the spiky creature flies into the membrane and tears a ragged hole in it. with a giant whoosh all the air in the city starts to rush out the hole. kara is swept along toward the hole by the wind. she cries out and stretches pleading hands toward her mother. the omegahedron is swept toward the hole as well. kara grabs onto the ragged edge of the membrane.

zaltar 
kara---the power source!

kara reaches for it, but it is too far from her, and the omegahedron is sucked out into infinity by the wind. zaltar picks up the matterwand from where kara dropped it and touches her with the wand. she is instantly held fast. zaltar pulls her back inside. he gives her to her mother alura. then zaltar touches his wand to the membrane and seals the hole with masterful chords like a brass choir. 

the wind dies down and all is silent, except for the quiet sobbing of kara in her mother's arms. zaltar kneels down beside her and strokes her golden hair  tenderly.

kara
				i'm sorry... i didn't know.

					zaltar
				it was my fault. you aren't old enough to use 
the wand. i shouldn't have given it to you.

	alura
but the power source, zaltar.

	zaltar
it couldn't be helped. the city will have to make do 
with three.

	alura
but what will happen?

	zaltar 
the guardians will be angry. they may even 
send me to the phantom zone. you see, i didn't 
really have permission to borrow it. i must go 
explain to them...

zaltar hurries off nervously. the camera holds on kara's face as she senses this may be her last sight of zaltar.
