int. hospital corridor. late afternoon

selena strides down the hospital corridor almost as if she is floating an inch above the floor. her huge silk cape billows around her, making her seem larger-than-life. nurses, orderlies, patients scatter to get out of her way. her presence is so formidable and she moves so fast and inexorably that no one has a chance to stop her and inquire what she's doing there. she knows exactly where she's going to. she turns a corner, and steps inside an open door and closes it behind her.
