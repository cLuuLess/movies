89   int. truck - day.                                            89

     as the truck leaves the tunnel and all is cliffs, sand, and
     waves..cristina taking it in, unaware that her mother's eyes
     never leave her.




                                                             59.







     she gasps frequently..major giant organic gasps of wonder and
     pleasure..this is awe as an active physical exercise. the
     moving shot dramatizes the crossroads of the mother-daughter
     relationship as the two shot finds flor becoming first
     blurred then lost as we focus on cristina exclaiming over
     each new sight.

               the first time one sees natural
               beauty which is owned by others

               imagined the word "money" could be
               associated with anything but the
               anxiety of not having enough. i
               didn't know god had a toy store for
               the rich.
