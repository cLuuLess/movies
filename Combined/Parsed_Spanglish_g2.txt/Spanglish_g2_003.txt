3   ext. dusty road - the bus                                     3

    as cristina, six years old and adorable, waits patiently to
    step down. she sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly,
    digging into her little pack to pull out an english book
    which she displays with pride. now she steps down from the
    bus and, as she walks toward camera, narration begins. the
    voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see.

                        narrator

              to princeton university's director
              of admissions: in considering me
              for a scholarship you have asked
              for, and have every reason to
              expect, an essay from me about
              myself. and, as a clever high
              school graduate, i of course
              realize the subtext of this essay
              about who i am and why i want to
              enter princeton, is actually to
              make clear to you why you should
              have me. i have gotten tips, from
              friends who have preceded me to
              college, that being a latina, with
              my grades, list of activities and
              relative poverty, i am as good as
              in if i simply do the dance and
              work in a word like
              "bipolarization" every so often.
              and while i love dances -- this
              dance of self is one i am afraid to
              master.
                  (young girl looks off and
                   lights up)
              i prefer to write about my mother.
