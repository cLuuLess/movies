93   int. maid's room - afternoon                                 93

     deborah has re-decorated the room with casual
     brilliance...flor is tense..distraught...her daughter
     giddy...excited over the sheets, the tv, the pile of
     towels..a chaise..she goes to work on her mother to go
     swimming....wanting her to appreciate the fun element of
     being here...the spirit of the kid such that flor relents....
