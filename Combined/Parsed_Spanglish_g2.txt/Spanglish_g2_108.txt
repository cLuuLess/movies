109   ext. beach - same scene - sunset..                          109

      lots of people on their decks..hot-tubbing, sunning,
      partying..rich people forming new yorker cartoons in the
      background as cristina continues to doggedly collect her sea
      glass. at one point, she comes upon a teenage couple making
      out near a mass of pebbles, and politely asks them to roll
      over so she can search the area.
