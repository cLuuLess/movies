26   ext. stone canyon - day                                      26

     music change..as they disembark and start walking, joining
     the busload of domestics into the canyon and up the
     hill....they walk past a perfect country club fairway. grand
     trees from either side meet each other high over the road.

     on our gal..as they walk

     she sees the stuff...the dream that makes you migrate. she is
     not awed..she is jazzed. to her aunt she does the latin
     version of oh.....my...god!!!!!!!!...at regular intervals in
     the background, one black suv after another has a mother
     taking kids home from school.
