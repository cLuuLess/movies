97   int. flor's room - morning - two hours later                 97

     as flor wakes..looks around.

                              flor

                  cristina?
     she goes to cristina's bed...atop the bed is a note. she
     picks it up.

     insert..the note

     dear flor,




                                                             64.







     i decided to steal your daughter for a bit.

     love,


     deborah

     with great energy born of bottled fury, flor begins to go
     through her daughter's things...finding her backpack and
     extracting a spanish/english dictionary.

     insert dictionary.

     as her finger points to:
     "steal...robar"
     and then she flips some pages feverishly..her finger
     indicating:
     "daughter .... hija"
