10   int. mother's bedroom - the two of them in bed - night       10


                         narrator

               each night my mother promised me a
               wonderful life.. each night i
               looked for a new expressive way to
               tell my mother how much i loved
               her.
     the child is ardent..clutching at her heart...kissing her
     mother.. holding her mother's face, talking directly into her
     eyes. the mother, enormously pleased, is nonetheless thrown
     by the extremes of it.

                         narrator (cont'd)

               i just played and did my lessons
               and every time i looked up my
               mother was in the process of saving
               us.
