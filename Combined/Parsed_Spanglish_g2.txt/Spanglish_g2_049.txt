     john is in bernie's room - helping her with her homework.
     they lay at right angles to each other..he is testing her.

               free your mind...the president
               whose policies many consider
               responsible for the great
               depression...

                         bernice

               i don't know...

               money out of everyone's pockets.

               by..

                         bernice

               i'm just drawing blanks. i'm
               embarrassed. it's my own fault i
               spent my time on math, which i'm
               lucky if i don't flunk anyway and..

                         john

               the guy we are looking for is not a
               ruse..

                         bernice

               what's ruse mean?

                         john

               phony. so this president was not a
               ruse..he was the real thing.




                                                             37.








                         john

                   (she looks at him blankly)
               ruse??

                         bernice

                   (enjoying her father's
                    absurdity)
               rusevelt..if i'd ever heard of the
               word before - that would lock it
               in..it's so stupid it might work
               anyway...
     deborah enters followed by flor. they are carrying several
     boxes of clothes...

                         deborah

               surprise new clothes..
     bernie gasps..as she looks at a sweater..

                         bernice

               what'd i do right?

                         deborah

               warehouse sale..
     bernice tries on the sweater over her t-shirt..and mirth
     ends..the sweater is tight...bernice picks up a blouse and
     then skirt and checks the size.

     on flor and john.

     as they are coupled by the camera angle as each catches on
     and is dumbfounded.

     on bernice..

     whose style, wit and grace should not have to be used to
     deflect such trauma. but so be it, as, though mightily stung:

                         bernice

               thanks, mom..i'm glad you didn't
               get here a little earlier or else i
               wouldn't be able to tell you that
               your gift is a ruse. please, excuse
               me..
     she exits to her bathroom.
