182   int. master bedroom - day                                   182

      deborah holds open the door while flor walks inside..then
      closes it.

                          deborah

                what's with avoiding me, am i this
                horrible person?
      as flor just looks at her.

                          deborah (cont'd)

                i know. it's a ridiculous question
                but sometimes i'm ridi...

                          flor

                no. it's a good question. a fine
                question. complicated.
                    (beat then)
                i was just thinking to answer.

                           deborah

                oh stop.   come on. weren't we
                close?

                            flor

                      (like a shot)
                no.

                          deborah

                    (truly hurt)
                well, i'm very, very disappointed
                to hear that. it makes me feel like
                a fool.

                          flor

                    (compassion forces a
                     crumb)
                we weren't close..but we were
                connected...in a bad way.

                          deborah

                    (strangely soothed)
                you know something, i think we're
                saying the same thing...look as
                long as we're doing closure..what
                did you and my husband, john, do
                last night?
      flor pauses for less of a beat than we would have imagined.

                          flor

                i can only tell you what i did.




                                                               126.








                          deborah

                that will be sufficient.

                          flor

                    (these are tender
                     feelings)
                i became sure of what an incredibly
                lucky woman you are and i must make
                myself not envy you which is hard.
                no, it's not hard. it's impossible.
                now please..i am exhausted.

                          deborah

                same here - believe me.
      deborah would hug..but it's only an eighth of a gesture
      because flor has turned to exit, calling for her daughter to
      hurry as she goes.

                          flor

                cristina, ap√∫rate.
