126   int. beach house - den - late night                        126

      as john enters the room to find chum proffering the ball to
      flor who is watching one of video language tapes. she tosses
      the ball without a look or a thought..then starts when she
      sees john standing there. he cheers, seeing her predicament.




                                                        81.




when she speaks english, at this point, her words are
halting.

                    john

          you gotta do something about
          chum..your arm's going to go.
she waves it off and hurries to get her tape and get out of
his way. chum complicates the task, proffering the ball. flor
wearily throws it.

                    john (cont'd)

          don't you sleep anymore?

                    flor

          no..you get more if you keep at it.

                    john

          you're doing fantastic.

                    flor

          now i am like a three year-old.
          your wife go out.

                    john

          she say where?

                    flor

          no.
              (on his reaction)
          sorry.

                    john

          listen..i just forgot she was going
          out..don't be a smart ass.
              (jolted by his own remark)
          uh-oh..well, you and i communicate
          mostly in apologies anyway..i'm
          sorry. i should be whipped. i
          should be stoned- it's been a while
          - i meant to say, i think, don't be
          smart, don't be kind, don't be
          sensitive, don't be beautiful. i
          meant to say, "hi, flor, good night
          flor..that show you're watching is
          going to be a hit."
he staggers out. flor watches his lonely back for a beat and
then urgently gestures chum to join him. chum is reluctant,
but relenting, runs and accompanies his appreciative master.
flor, now alone, finds herself staring at a framed picture of
john in the den. he is younger and smiling. she studies the
picture and then blinks when she realizes her own emotion and
purposefully goes back to her lessons.
