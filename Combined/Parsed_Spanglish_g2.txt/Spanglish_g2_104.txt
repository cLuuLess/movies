105   int. clasky rented beach house - bedroom - morning         105

      deborah surreptitiously finishing putting on her running
      clothes and is making for the door when the alarm clock goes
      off and john awakens.

                          john

                she didn't even want us to know she
                had a daughter - then, on the first
                day, you take the kid without
                asking. i think that's...

                          deborah

                    (starting to lose it)
                what!?! insensitive? elitist?
                irresponsible? perverse? dizzy?

                          john

                    (slow and emphatic)
                dumb.
      she looks at him...he has been atypical...her immediate
      emotional cocktail is panic, fury and deep, deep hurt. her
      words are slow...her voice ragged...

                          deborah

                when is anyone in this damn house
                or this damn life going to consider
                my feelings? i just tried to make
                a lovely kid feel welcome. there's
                no reason to rake it over...i let
                it go..and gave flor the room to
                let it go. which i'm sure she has!
                it's over!! so get on board.




                                                              70.







      she opens the door and almost runs into flor who is standing
      immediately in her way holding the letter.

                           flor

                i slept.
