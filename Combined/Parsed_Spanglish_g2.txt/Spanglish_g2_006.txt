6   int. / ext. kitchen - on girl.                                6

    standing proudly, smoothing her skirt.

    close up girl.





                                                                 4.







    as she clears her throat and says directly into camera.

                           girl

                 hi.
    the girl and woman are enormously excited over this word even
    though, outside, her life's mate is being loaded into the
    back of a police car.(note: mexican police do not duck the
    perpetrator's head when loading them in the back seat..they
    just allow the concussion.) it seems the mother will save her
    child the trauma of her father being carted off; but the
    police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her
    father as the car pulls away. the child is stricken. a tear
    starts to form in her eye. her mother acts quickly. we are
    about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of
    will..the mother leans down, gives three quick kisses - power
    pecks - to the girl's cheeks and then an admonition in
    spanish.

                           mother

                 una l√°grima...sola una sola...haz
                 la mejor possible.

                           narrator

                 "one tear..only one...so make it a
                 good one." this was my mother's
                 instruction to me.

    on child.

    baffled by the edict..

    on mother.

    holding up one finger. that's it..one tear..she means it.

    on child..

    as she complies..one great tear forming and falling..her
    mother's thumb wipes it away..but now her eyes well with more
    tears..her mother gestures she must have strength and
    resolve..and so she does..a toss of her pretty little
    head...the eyes clear.
