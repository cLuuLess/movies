     back to scene:


                         deborah

               you, mister, are crazy making..i
               can't take this calm thing you've




                                                        27.








                    deborah

          started doing. it's like this is
          your way of letting me know there's
          something deeply wrong with me
          because i'm not calm.

                    john

              (calmly)
          let's not go all over the
          place..can't we...

                    deborah

              (shouted burst)
          if you're going to talk to me
          please have the decency to raise
          your voice.

                     john

              (a beat then sudden
               urgency and change of
               tone)
          let's make a break for it.

                    deborah

          what are you talking about?
he signals her with his eyes and head and then takes a large
but tentative step away from the spot where he was
standing...then additional faster steps. he gestures with
enormous energy for her to follow him to his new spot in the
room. she eyes him suspiciously.

                    john

          just for a second.
she walks to him...he puts an arm around her shoulder. and
gestures back to where they were standing. he talks in an
almost hushed, conspiratorial voice.

                    john (cont'd)

          we don't have to be those people.
          nobody's watching. they've been
          masquerading as us for a while
          here..i'll distract them - you make
          a break for it and i'll meet you
          outside.

                    deborah

          you're ridiculing me because i care
          about this.

                    john

              (firmly)
          no. i'm not. i mean this..let's get
          away from those two in case they're
          as miserable as they look..




                                                           28.








                    john

              (urging..like a southern
               coach)
          come on, baby.
he is looking at her with wit and conviction..trying to
squirt lighter fluid at the flame of their love. deborah
looks up at him..intimacy of a different sort.

                    deborah

          let me ask you a question..let me
          change the subject..forget for a
          moment that you won't support me
          with georgie..

                    john

              (reasonably)
          well, i don't think...
she makes a noise of frustration to stop him..it   works. john
is rendered still and intimidated by her conduct   but he is
"man" enough for his jaw to set...to pause for a   beat as he
looks her straight in the eye..and walks back to   the spot
they occupied previously.

                      john (cont'd)

          go ahead.

                    deborah

          here's the question. it's been on
          my mind more and more. do you do
          that calm thing for the purpose of
          infuriating me?

                    john

              (genuinely puzzled)
          what? why would ...
              (on her exasperated look)
          why would anyone do something to
          someone they love for the purpose
          of messing them up?

                    deborah

              (unconvinced/distant)
          okay.
he hates that look of isolation on her face..he needs to make
her feel better.

                    john

          deb, since high school we've been
          able to read each other...take
          advantage of it..the answer to the
          question is,"absolutely not." now
          take a look and tell me if you
          believe me.




                                                              29.







     she looks at him..with a finger motion he directs her gaze to
     his eyes..
     close on john's eyes.
     open, smiling, trusting. trying to get a laugh out of her.

     close on deborah's eyes.

     studying, questioning, probing, doubting, exhausted...

                         deborah

               i don't.. believe you. i think you
               just want me to feel badly about
               myself..sorry, honey.
