      john is talking to all three kids in an effort to lift the
      overall atmosphere. in the background we see deborah handing
      flor her letter..cristina taking sidelong glances...relieved
      to see them shake hands (flor engaging), hug (flor
      reluctant).

                          john

                so here's the idea..i want to make
                a serving platter for serving fish
                using sea glass like this..
      he holds out some sea glass.

                          john (cont'd)

                i used to hunt for this stuff every
                free minute when i apprenticed in
                italy. this is bits of broken glass
                that the ocean sand blasts over the
                years..great looking, huh? so you
                guys go hunting and i'll pay 50
                cents for any piece, a dollar for
                anything as big as this and five
                dollars for any color that isn't
                brown, clear or green.

                          georgie

                do we have to do this?

                          bernice

                    (to georgie)
                oh, come on...
      georgie and bernice start off..




                                                                 71.








                          john

                come on, cristina - go get em.
      her eyes widen and off she runs, intoxicated with being
      included and having the chance to make money.
