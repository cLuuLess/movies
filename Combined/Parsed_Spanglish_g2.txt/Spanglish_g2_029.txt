30   ext. house - backyard - day                                  30

     moments later. as the group arrives at the outdoor table.
     evelyn makes half-hearted incomplete gestures of shaking
     hands, nodding, indicating a seat...each simple act a test
     which she fails -- every gesture a bit too late and then
     some..simply too much for her to manage with the drinks under
     her belt. in the background workers roll out sod, the yard
     becoming more beautiful even as we look.

                         monica

               she is my niece. she and her
               daughter live in the apartment i
               manage. yolanda, who worked for
               you, lived there before she went
               back home. that's how i heard about
               the job.

                         deborah

               so who am i interviewing?

                            monica

               her.

                         deborah

                   (forcefully)
               you're gorgeous.
     on our gal..as she, not understanding the word, smiles and
     nods.

                         monica

                   (translating sotto)
               vistosos.
     our gal thrown. not knowing how now to react.

                         evelyn

               she doesn't mean it as a
               compliment. it's more of an
               accusation.




                                                        13.








                    deborah

          this is my daughter bernice and
          this is my mother, evelyn norwich..

                     bernice

              (rising)
          excuse me...glad you're okay.
              (then to other latina)
          good luck.
our gal smiles back in appreciation.

                    deborah

          no, stay..this involves you.

                    bernice

          i wouldn't want some kid around for
          my interview. you understand, mom.

                    evelyn

              (to bernice)
          strength of character..empathy..big
          heart..taste for futility - god i
          love you.
she eyes with disapproval her mother's empty glass.

                     deborah


          mother!

               (then to bernice)
          stop. it's just a conversation -
          not an interview. please sit.
               (to visitors)
          don't you want to get out of the
          sun?
she indicates a shaded seat. deborah is protected by hat,
umbrella, sun glasses while her guest sits bareheaded
enjoying the rays and indicates she is fine. underneath
deborah's surface is a russian roulette of deeply felt
emotions..at this moment she is earnest and vulnerable.

                    deborah (to our gal) (cont'd)

          you guys want some lemonade?
              (they demur)
          let's just talk. i have two
          children. my husband works
          nights..he's a chef and has his own
          place.

                    monica

          do you work?

                    deborah

          i helped run a commercial design
          company until ten months ago when




                                                        14.








                    deborah (cont'd)

          it was downsized to zip. okay. i
          have two children. i like the house
          to be like me in that i'm very
          loose and meticulous at the same
          time. it's all about first names
          and closeness here but i care about
          the place, you know. it's what they
          used to call homemaker..
the two visitors exchange a wide-eyed look. which deborah
sees and understands.

                     deborah (cont'd)

              (to monica)
          i'm not leaving time for you to
          translate.
monica says, in spanish, "this woman is very strange. the
only thing i understand is she has two kids." deborah leans
into monica. face to face, tender but unblinking..

                    deborah (cont'd)

          too bad for you that it just never
          occurred to you to check on how
          much spanish i know.

                    monica

              (a solid beat of
               humiliation then)
          i'm sorry what i say about
          you...don't hold it against her.

                    bernice

          mom!!

                    deborah

          i don't speak any spanish. but i'm
          not an idiot - i talk for an hour
          and you say two words. what did you
          say?
monica squirms - unusual for her.

                    deborah (cont'd)

          never mind. you got your nose
          bopped. i got my feelings hurt.
          onward.
as monica paraphrases what has happened, her translation is
dialed down for the:

                    narrator

              (as deborah continues
               talking)
          i will major in linguistics and
          make sociology my sub-
          concentration. because it has been
          my experience that the barriers of

                    (more)





                                                        15.

                    narrator (cont'd)
          language are more than we dare
          admit. that, as much as we
          translate, finally we will never
          understand each other. my mother's
          name, for example, beautiful in
          spanish, becomes leaden and awful
          when pronounced by a non-latin.

                    deborah (in the clear)

          what's your name? llamo? one of my
          five spanish words..

                    our gal

          flor moreno.
she pronounces flor in the latin way...lots of rrrr's with a
curling of the tongue sound at the end.

                      deborah

          flor.
she pronounces it flat like the "floor" we walk
on...throughout the following each of the women sticks to
their pronunciation as indicated by the extra "r's.

                    flor

              (correcting)
          florrrrr.

                      deborah

          flor.

                    flor

              (correcting)
          florrrrr.

                      deborah

          flor.

                    flor

              (correcting)
          florrrrr.

                      deborah

          flor.

                    flor

              (trying)
          florrrrr.

                    deborah

          flor..what i walk on?

                      monica and evelyn

          florrrrr.




                                                        16.








                      flor

          florrrrr.

                    bernice

          it means flower, right?

                    monica

          yes. flower. florrrrr.

                      evelyn

          florrrrr.

                      flor

          florrrrr.
deborah is beginning to feel criticized...she takes a
beat..eyes everyone with some hostility.

                    deborah

              (directly to flor)
          is there some school of the ear i'm
          flunking out of right now?
flor says to monica, in spanish, a tip to pronounce her name.
monica warns flor to leave it rest..since deborah is becoming
clearly and strangely pissed..

                    deborah (cont'd)

          what did she say?

close on flor...

she feels the tension but, so far in her life, her own
irrepressible personality has served her - so she moves
forward with surprising and quiet confidence and assurance.
she tells her aunt to repeat her words so that now, for the
first time, she is, through monica, talking directly to
deborah.

                    monica

              (translating)
          she says..if you curl your tongue
          and let it be loose you will have
          it..that it's hard for americans..
          she says it's great that you try so
          hard. many people wouldn't bother.

                    deborah

              (an emotional
               pronouncement/her
               greatest accolade)
          she gets me....
she smiles at flor, who returns the smile.




                                                         17.








                    deborah (cont'd)

          you want some lemonade? take some
          lemonade.
she pours some for flor and monica. then she closes her eyes
and pauses in utter dedication to a final effort:

                      deborah (cont'd)

          florrrrr.
it is perfect..flor grins at deborah's victory...claps her
hands together.

                    flor

              (a spanish word)
          sublime.
deborah feels relief..free for a moment from the dark
corridors of self-criticism..she is lighter, prettier,
innocent..wholly and completely attractive.

                    deborah

          whew, dense but stubborn, right?
          thanks.
              (an important declaration)
          what you just did with me is just
          what kids need..patience and
          encouragement. alright, money...
bernice rises like a shot to take off..

                    bernice

          goodbye, really..
              (to flor)
          look forward to seeing you.
as she leaves.

                    deborah

              (absently to bernie)
          love you...
              (then with not a
               monoseconds break)
          ... the job is six days a week,
          seven to seven..the kids and all
          housekeeping, how much a week would
          you like?
monica translates..flor, embarrassed a bit by the directness,
ducks the question..saying in spanish -- "whatever you say.."

                    deborah (cont'd)

          no.. this is an important
          question..if you ask for too little
          it means you don't value




                                                                18.










                  yourself..too much and you're
                  taking advantage.
                      (after monica translates)
                  so?
     flor is dumbstruck by the challenge of this pop quiz but not
     without some native wit and style to maneuver around it.

                            flor

                      (extremely heavy accent)
                  one thousand dollars.
     deborah falls for it until flor laughs..others join...deborah
     now a big smile, snort of a laugh, putting her hand to her
     face and shaking her head.

     other angle..

     as monica uses deborah's reaction time to, in mid-laugh,
     flash four fingers to flor..

     on evelyn.

     catching the gesture and secretly indicating to monica they
     should go for six.

                            monica

                      (firmly)
                  six hundred dollars.
     flor shoots her a look of fear...a tense beat.

                            deborah

                  welcome to the family..
     deborah kisses her..sort of on the mouth. in the midst of
     flor's delight she is thrown by deborah's kiss...it is the
     first of many borders to be violated.
