92   int./ext. hallway / patio - day                              92

     behind flor and cristina as they move toward the claskys and
     their destiny....flor behind her daughter.

     reverse - close on cristina.

     as her eyes pop on seeing the clasky beach house.

     very close on deborah

     as her eyes pop on seeing the stunning twelve year-old enter
     her home, haloed by the sun. again, flor less distinct in
     the background.
     bernice, just outside the open patio door, is putting on a
     shirt over her bathing suit as she looks at cristina and
     emits a small, prescient moan.

                         deborah

                   (to flor)
               look at this child..flor, you could
               make a fortune at surrogate
               pregnancy....
     flor looks to her daughter for some understanding of what
     deborah said..

                         flor

               que?
     cristina is as nonplussed by the remark as her mother.

                         john

               hi. i'm john..it's good to see you.
                   (to flor indicating
                    cristina)
               great..

                         deborah

                   (to cristina)
               hi. this is my daughter,
               bernice..i'm deborah..and out
               there...are georgie and.




                                                        61.







as she turns to gesture toward her mother and son, evelyn has
almost reached them ..

                    evelyn

          i'm so glad to meet you. i'm a fan
          of your mother's.

                    cristina

          i'm cristina.
as all acknowledge each other deborah tugs at bernie's top
which is half tucked in.

                    bernice

              (kidding around but right
               on)
          no comparisons, please, no
          comparisons.
evelyn shoves her granddaughter for the self-
deprecation..flor says something to her daughter in spanish.

                    cristina

          my mother says it's best if we get
          out of the way and put our things
          away.

                    john

          have you ever been to the beach
          here?

                    cristina

          i've never been anyplace but mexico
          and texas.....before today.
john goes to a big toy box and opens it up..it is filled with
beach paddles, frisbees and boogie boards.

                    john

          here's the most important place in
          the house..grab this stuff whenever
          you want.

                    cristina

              (delighted)
          thank you..thank you so much.

                    deborah

          very little accent?

                       flor

                 (suspiciously)
          que?

                    cristina

              (to flor)
          sin acento.




                                                                62.







     her mom, not crazy about the lack of accent to begin with,
     nods.

                           cristina (cont'd)

                     (to deborah)
                 thank you..there's an a.p. total
                 fluency class where they work you
                 pretty hard at sounding american.
     flor doesn't want her daughter to have an extended
     conversation with deborah of which she doesn't understand a
     word.

                              flor

                 cristina..

                           deborah

                 right. settle in..

                           cristina

                 thank you. i am thrilled to be
                 here.
