65   int. den - day..                                             65

     john finds evelyn and georgie in their night clothes. they
     are singing an old song...something like "lush life" -
     something preposterous for a nine year-old boy..but you can't
     knock the quality of the voices..world class. they see him
     and stop.

                         evelyn

               every time he has a nightmare, i
               teach him one of my old songs. that
               way the nightmares have a purpose.

                         georgie

               but i don't have to sing it for
               anyone.

                         john

               right. you're clear on that..

                         georgie

               how many did you sell of this song?

                          evelyn

                   (embarrassed in front of
                    john)
               he likes to know that stuff.

                         john

                   (to georgie)
               she was huge.




                                                                45.








                          evelyn

                seventy-six thousand..which is
                great for a jazz album.
      they resume harmonizing. as john leaves, the song lyric
      making some comment on:
