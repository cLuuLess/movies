49   int. clasky kitchen - day.                                49

     evelyn, having a glass of white wine and a sandwich, is
     talking to bernice in the kitchen also including flor though
     she is only catching a word here or there..

                         evelyn

               well, i'm in the vitamin section
               and this little hip hop
               girl..what's her name..grammys -
               adorable -- big voice..subtle
               phrasing...oh, she's famous..the
               kids know her...oh - little blue
               shoes..darn me.
     flor looks concerned over evelyn's displeasure with herself,
     a fact picked up by the older woman...it is actually a small




                                                        35.







but resonant good-natured, affectionate moment between the
lush and the latina.

                    evelyn (cont'd)

          god bless the language barrier, it
          keeps you from being bored with me.
spoken to directly like this, flor is confused..

                    evelyn (cont'd)

          anyway, she said, "aren't you
          evelyn wright?" first of all, that
          she recognized me from the old
          covers and then she .... oh, please
          her name..it makes the story so
          much better...she said,
              (genuinely stirred)
          "whenever i think everything is.."
              (aside)
          pardon my french..pardon her french
              (back to quote)
          "a mother hmmmhmmm...i put on one
          of your records.."

                    bernice

          awwww. how sweet....
evelyn looks transparently vulnerable for a second. flor
reacts. bernie squeezes her grandmother's hand..flor smiles.

                    evelyn

          just such a lovely thing to come
          from the blue....
deborah enters, carrying a load of packages. with lightning
speed, her eye picks out...the glass her mother is drinking
from.

                    deborah

          oh, mother...it's not even noon.

                    evelyn

              (defensively)
          it's almost two o'clock.

                    deborah

          god, where is this day going...flor
          could you come with me?

                    bernice

          grandma, tell mom what happened.

                      evelyn

                (very deliberately)
          no.




                                                             36.







     deborah leads the way out...but flor stops before following
     her out to give evelyn a gesture of support and appreciation.
