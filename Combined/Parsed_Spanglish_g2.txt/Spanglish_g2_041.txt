42   int. clasky house - upstairs - master bathroom - day        42

     deb in the shower...you have never seen so many shampoos,
     conditioners and bath balms...never seen so huge a
     sponge..such fluffy towels.




                                                             26.







     skylight over the shower allows a beam of god's warmth. there
     is a fireplace in the bathroom. the only significance of
     this being that these people have a fireplace in their
     bathroom. the woman who made it all happen is putting in a
     contact lens..she is upset. we see that she has one blue eye
     and one brown.

                         john

               this isn't an argument, honey.

                         deborah

               yes. yes it is. so stop being so
               maniacally calm.

                          john

                   (emphatically)
               no..it's not. because i understand
               your side.

                         deborah

               i can't be wrong about that too.
               this is a fight. we're having a
               fight. yo, i feel anger.
     deborah turns from the sink revealing one brown eye and one
     blue. she blinks, realizes one lens is not in and turns back
     to the sink.

                         deborah (cont'd)

               can i have a moment?
     john exits into the..
