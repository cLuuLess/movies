149   ext. clasky driveway - night...                            149

      as deborah leaves the house in a hurry.

                          evelyn

                    (calling out)
                wait!
      deborah turns, startled.

                          evelyn (cont'd)

                i need to talk to you privately,
                honey.

                          deborah

                "honey?"-- can't now, mom...i'm
                late..i was looking all over for
                you...keep an eye on the kids. you
                know my secret cell number.

                          evelyn

                just give me a moment to talk
                here..

                          deborah

                what is it? are you buzzed?

                          evelyn

                no. i gave up drinking weeks ago.
                    (on deborah's reaction)
                yes. nobody noticed -- which shows
                i probably conducted myself pretty
                well as a drunk. but duty called
                and i'm sober so may i say just one
                thing.

                          deborah

                one thing..go ahead...

                          evelyn

                thanks..deborah, you're going to
                lose your husband and you'll never
                find someone as good. there will
                only be men who you know are cheap
                and shallow and have no real warmth
                in their souls. you may have gotten
                by on those surfaces once but now
                you've been spoiled by a good man
                and you can no longer glide on such
                thin ice. if you do not act
                quickly you will soon cement an
                awful fate for yourself. a life,
                with no hope of repair, which has
                already begun to turn desperate and
                dumb. that's it. drive safely.
      she grabs a deep breath and then turns and walks to the
      house.

                      (to herself)
                  if we're out of coffee, it's over
                  for me.
      suddenly a sharp horn is heard..evelyn jumps..then turns to
      see her daughter calling to her from the driver's seat of the

      suv..


                            deborah

                  you've done it again, mom, made me
                  hate myself..one of the things i
                  can count on..

                            evelyn

                  honey, lately your low self-esteem
                  is just good common sense.
      deborah considers that last thought for a long beat before
      she drives off..
