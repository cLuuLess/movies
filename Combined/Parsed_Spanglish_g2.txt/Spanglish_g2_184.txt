      as they wait...flor talks sharply to cristina to control
      herself.

                          narrator

                my mother changed our lives once
                more. this time because she saw in
                me, to her great alarm, a character
                flaw of some size. she has taught
                me to be a watch dog of my
                character, to control my ambition.
                i am not quite there.
