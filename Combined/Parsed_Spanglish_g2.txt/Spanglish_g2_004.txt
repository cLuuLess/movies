4   int. / ext. house - school girl's pov - mom                   4

    a drop-dead gorgeous latin woman in her early 20's. as mother
    and daughter move inside, a car pulls up with an ominous man
    getting out. he nods in another direction calling our
    attention to a police car parked off the street. the woman
    does not notice - instead shepherding the child to her
    father. the woman makes a big fuss over the text books the
    child has..this is one supportive mom..again she is
    disbelieving that her husband shows no interest, especially
    when the child seems briefly hurt. the woman's husband looks
    from the window and sees the ominous man coming. the woman
    now does everything humanly possible to distract the child so
    she does not see what is transpiring.
