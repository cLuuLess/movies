16   ext. field - later - night - on mother and daughter..        16

     standing on the tarmac..latin flavored music suddenly gives
     way to a texas country harmonica riff..the child tries to
     comfort her apprehensive mother with the one wondrous fact
     she finds so thrilling.

                            girl

                      (exulting)
                  texas...
     the mother hurries her along in the direction of distant
     lights.

                            girl (cont'd)

                      (more emphatically)
                  texas.
