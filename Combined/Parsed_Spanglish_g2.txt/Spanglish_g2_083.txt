84   int. clasky rented beach house - day.                       84

     as deborah, flor and evelyn enter. they carry boxes of stuff.

                         deborah (cont'd)

               i don't care if it's a rental..this
               place is getting a fixing.
     she leads flor to a small bedroom.

                         deborah (cont'd)

                   (to flor with gestures)
               this will be yours..
     flor doesn't understand..certainly doesn't want to.

                         evelyn

               did you ask her if she could live
               in?

                         deborah

               come on...there's no buses from her
               to here. there's no question.
               double come on...
     deborah uses her hand as if weighing something momentous like
     the law vs. the bible then with heavy sarcasm.

                         deborah (cont'd)

               the barrio - carbon beach..the
               barrio - carbon beach. what to do?
                   (to flor)
               don't worry. i'm putting nicer
               stuff in here too.
     when flor gives no indication of anything - just standing,
     somewhat stupefied..deborah takes her by the hand and leads
     her out.
