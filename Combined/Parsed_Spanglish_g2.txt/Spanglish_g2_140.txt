141   ext. street - hill - angle on flor...                       141

      walking up the hill, blinking in disbelief at her own
      fury..deborah in the background feeling a bit abandoned..flor
      keeps walking toward the camera..

                          narrator

                there is a terrible crisis which
                comes when your own personality is
                not equal to the challenge you
                face. when being who you are no
                longer works.
      deborah has started to jog. as she approaches flor, she calls
      for a clear path well in advance.

                          deborah

                left...left.
      flor does not alter course though she does start to walk
      faster...

                          deborah (cont'd)

                left...left...
      deborah is close behind now.

                          deborah (cont'd)


                left!

      suddenly, flor breaks into a run..she is lithe and quick.

      on deborah...

      a blink of confusion...then something resembling innate
      satisfaction as she quickens her gait and...the race is on.

      angle as deborah draws abreast of flor.

      strangely, she is interpreting this as closeness. she is
      genuinely warm.




                                                              93.








                            deborah (cont'd)

                      (to flor)
                  why am i not surprised you're
                  competitive?
      deborah looks up the street at a delivery truck.

                            deborah (cont'd)

                  oh, they're delivering my table.
      flor stays on task ..forces her stride. she just needs to win
      so very much..that's all..to her current surprise, that's
      everything...

                            deborah (cont'd)

                  you are fast.. better pace yourself
                  though..
      flor, even more upset and provoked by the words now lets it
      all out...

      on deborah..

      realizing she may not be a certain winner...she is concerned
      as she goes after the rabbit.

      other angle.

      showing the delivery truck as finish line in the distance...

      various shots..

      flor fueled by desperation. deborah, relentlessly gaining,
      exhilarated.

      the finish..

      decidedly anti-climactic..deborah draws even -- passes her--
      arrives at the house with a large margin of victory.

                            deborah (cont'd)

                      (calling back)
                  i love you for trying.
