53   int. john's car - early evening..                            53

     as they drive down the canyon. he is wildly frustrated. even
     if flor were not there, he would be talking to himself
     anyway, in the manner of bag ladies and all of us.

                         john (cont'd)

               i am running out of excuses for the
               lady of the house.
     flor doesn't understand his words...yet fully agrees. but
     then john takes rein of his emotions.




                                                        39.








                    john (cont'd)

          but you know, you gotta watch out
          for the times you think you're
          absolutely right..but, man, bernice
          has finals tomorrow. she didn't
          need this one..and just that look
          on her face when she got the gifts--
              (now his voice cracks; he
               grows wet-eyed)
          --like for a second she thought all
          her problems with her mother had
          been solved...
flor is flabbergasted..she peeks to see if he is actually
crying. at first her heart is touched by john but then there
is distinct disapproval (a real roll of the eyes) that the
macho meter can read that low. he looks at her and she faces
front quickly.

                    narrator

          my mother did not understand her
          male boss. his heart was good and
          he was rare in not flirting with
          her. but they were starkly
          different. privacy and dignity were
          the same word to my mother.
          naturally, when she found herself
          sitting next to a man who cried
          over his child's hurt she had no
          idea how to process the event.
meanwhile, he has stopped for traffic near the end of the
canyon. flor takes the opportunity to bolt.

                     flor

          gracias.
she opens the door and starts to get out though the car is
still rolling a bit...

                    john

          what are you doing? let me take you
          all the way.
reluctantly she re-enters the car..it rolls another ten feet
to her bus stop and she gets out again.

                    john (cont'd)

          how weird was this ride? sorry.

                    flor

          no es nada.
he doesn't quite know what that means...indicates same in a
little helpless gesture..
