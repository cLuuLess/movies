168   int. restaurant kitchen - half hour later - night           168

      they sit at a small table in the kitchen..finishing the
      greatest late-night meal in the history of western man.

                          flor

                i will remember every
                taste..forever.

                          john

                tell you the truth..i wanted a shot
                at cooking for you.
                    (shy/his heart)
                i'm very glad you liked it.

                          flor

                it's something watching you.
      he looks up at her...she has not been seen like this for a
      very long time, if ever.. lit up by a man.

                          john

                well, if it's anything at your end
                imagine over here...scratch
                that..the last thing you want to
                hear is somebody going off on your
                looks.

                          flor

                don't be crazy. tell me every
                detail.

                          john

                okay, flor, yes i will...they
                should name a gender after
                you..looking at you doesn't do
                it..staring is the only thing that
                makes sense..and trying not to
                blink so you don't miss anything.
      she squeals with laughter..he laughs a little himself and in
      so doing loses his courage..he looks down at his
      hands..shyness again belting him a good one..still looking
      down.

                          john (cont'd)

                look..forgive me..i'm.....it's just
                that you are drop-dead, crazy-
                gorgeous..so much so that i am
                really considering looking at you
                again before we finish up here.

                          flor

                soon, please.
      and now he looks at her.

      close on flor..





                                                               112.







      utterly open...utterly optimistic...the half second before
      being swept away.

                             flor (cont'd)

                   right now....immediately..we have
                   to dance or kiss.
      he stands. she stands..he kids just a bit, clowning at
      weighing the two options and then:

      his pov..

      her face..

                             john

                   no contest.
      they kiss.

                             flor

                   you sure you're not mexican.

                             john

                       (smiling/he likes this)
                   what do you mean?

                             flor

                   i meant you talk like a spanish
                   song.

                             john

                   you kiss like a spanish fly..
                       (on her confusion)
                   joking around. i don't know what
                   i'm talking about...

                             flor

                   yes you do.
      she breaks and heads for the dining room. john has a moment
      to consider.. he does not have his wits about him..a
      condition every bit as fearsome as liberating.
