      friends watching a movie in the family room. a clock
      prominently reads nine p.m.

                       (into phone)
                   flor? deb..look, sorry to call you
                   so late, but they're still studying
                   and i'm going out but i promised to
                   get her back so if you want me to
                   cut off the school work,
                   fine...whatever you want me to do.
                   well, okay..you think about it..
                       (she holds on to give flor
                        time)
                   and hey, if you're tired, or want
                   to play, let her sleep here and
                   i'll get her back there tomorrow.
                   you still want to think about it?
                   okay..
      she hangs up...and exchanges a mischievous look with
      cristina.
