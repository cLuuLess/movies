140   ext. stone canyon and sunset - morning                    140

      as the bus stops...bernice is across the street, along with
      some other kids and deborah, who is wearing her running
      clothes..flor and cristina exit the bus...




                                                        91.








                    bernice

              (calling)
          you just made it...i was getting
          worried..
deborah has a backpack loaded with books which she hands to
cristina..

                     deborah

          i picked up your books yesterday..
              (by way of explanation to
               flor)
          this is one of bernie's
          old..ancient backpacks.
cristina taking it...

                    cristina

          oh, thank you..
as she shoulders it and almost falls over..

                    cristina (cont'd)

              (impressed with the heft)
          this is a great school.

                    deborah

              (to cristina)
          i got you a little first-day-at-a-
          new-school present...
a school bus appears and heads toward them putting a certain
deadline pressure on the transaction.

                    deborah (cont'd)

          it's from me and....bernice.
              (to flor)
          okay? it is a big day.
flor's uncertain reaction is taken as a yes.

                    bernice

              (dry)
          what did we get her?
deborah hands cristina a locket..then, noting flor's
expression.

                     deborah

               (to cristina)
          it's from all of us. your mother
          too.

                    flor

              (to cristina)
          it's not from me...




                                                                 92.







      deborah does a good-natured "take" accepting flor's reaction
      as if it where an eccentricity..as cristina and bernice board
      the bus, cristina generally says goodbye to both women,
      thereby depriving flor of her own moment of passage with her
      daughter.

                          deborah

                have a great year, girls..
                    (for flor)
                this is so great. it fills your
                heart, doesn't it?
      deborah turns and sees flor has already started doggedly up
      the hill..
