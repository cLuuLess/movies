48   int. restaurant kitchen - late afternoon                  48

     john cooking...the theory that nobody's sexier than when they
     are seen doing what they do best applies here.. in the
     background john's number two, peter, the sous chef, being
     bossy and anal as he organizes his cooking and gwen, who
     spends most nights trying not to show her enormous affection
     for john. at the moment, john's work is a strange mixture of
     art and cloddishness.....the hands blur with expertise...but
     he keeps dropping items.....each time a latin kitchen worker,
     alex, 20, dives on the spillage..at one point they bump.

                          john

               sorry...

                         peter

                   (sharply to alex)
               not the best place to stand, fella.

                         john

                   (to alex)
               no. it's me. you're the new
               helper, huh..

                         alex

               i didn't mean to...

                         john

               no..no..it's okay. it's me being
               bugged.
     two people head for john almost simultaneously. peg, an arty
     looking woman in her late 50's..wild, scraggly gray hair,
     enters lugging an ice chest and the maitre d'.

                         peg

               you are going to be so happy..
     the maitre d' enters.




                                                        32.








                    maitre d'

          i have something very important to
          tell you.
john makes a no-brainer of a decision pointing to the woman
who promised happiness. she hefts her ice chest up on the
counter.

                    peg

          perfect cod this is john -- john,
          perfect cod..best one i've seen all
          season and he was swimming twenty
          minutes ago.
the fish is that special, a sentence that kicks out for a
writer, the right brush stroke for an artist. you get it..

                    john

          knockout.
              (to alex)
          you want to learn something? you
          want to pack it away?
the kid nods.. he picks up the fish.

                    john (cont'd)

          cradle it...put it in the cooler
          but not on its side.. in the same
          position it swims.
              (important added thought)
          and check the ice pack..make sure
          it can drain away..if it can't the
          chlorine can hurt the flesh. do all
          that and nobody can put a fish in
          the fridge better than you...and
          that's a solid start.. first day
          and you already did something
          perfect.

                    kid

              (smiling)
          yes, i understand.

                    maitre d'

          please. now?

                    john

          oh, sorry..i forgot.
he whispers in john's ear..

                    john (cont'd)

          damn.. "ohhhh damn."

                    peter

          what, buddy, what?




                                                        33.








                     john

           victor spotted a food critic..

                     peter

           from?

                     victor

           the new york times..i'll bet they
           sent her out just for us.
               (hands john a slip)
           here's what she ordered.

                     peter

           look, if you're nervous take a
           walk..

                     john

           i don't need a walk.

                     gwen

           i'll walk with you..i know a
           breathing thing.

                      john

           what do you think i'm worried
           about... how i'll cook? that's not
           the problem..
               (looks at slip/then to
                alex)
           the lady wants fish. get the fish.
he starts to prepare for cooking.

                     john (cont'd)

           i worked in a kitchen once in new
           york that got four stars. it was
           like a line formed for the chance
           to become an asshole. people's
           accents changed. the heart went out
           of the place. you understand.

                     peter

           no.

                      gwen

               (w/barely understated
                passion)
           i agree with everything you've
           said. i admire you for your
           feelings. i hope to adopt them as
           my own....

on john.

as he works..let's be clear here...this is that sequence that
either kicks out or doesn't..no food channel..no simple knife
stuff..something casually brilliant..meticulous...smart and
gifted as he prepares the critic's meal.




                                                             34.







     he is talking quickly..almost to himself.

                         john

               i don't know what to root for.. the
               thought of one star makes me
               nauseous..but with four there's no
               place to go but, "oh my god, they
               took away a star."
                   (musing)
               three..three and a half. that's
               what you want..no. wrong! three and
               a half you feel disappointed that
               you just missed out on four. you
               know what you want? three and a
               quarter..
                   (a eureka moment)
               that would be perfect!!
                   (getting off on it)
               it would mean you're good..but
               you're not good enough to feel
               disappointed that you just missed
               out on excellent..but nothing truly
               bad happened, you still got your
               three and a quarter stars. which
               encourages you to try and
               improve..and you still get enough
               respect so that you can get good
               people to work with you..business
               is good but not crazy. you're right
               there underneath the radar where
               you get to mind your own business.
               that's a solid life.
     he tastes a sliver of the food dish he is preparing.

                         john (cont'd)

                   (with professional honesty
                    and some regret)
               aw, man..this is amazing. no three
               and a quarter here.
