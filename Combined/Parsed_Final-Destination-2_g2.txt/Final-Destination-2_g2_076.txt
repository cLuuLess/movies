ext. windy roads - day

the pick up truck races to the hospital. as kimberly speeds past a
billboard, a police car pulls in hot pursuit.

                       kimberly
              shouldn't we pull over?

                       thomas
              no time. keep going. i wouldn't
              know how to explain any of this
              anyway.

at the next intersection, two more cop cars appear.

                       kimberly
              oh come on.

the pick up truck blows by the second pair of cop cars, which
instantly join the high speed chase. kimberly takes a long look in
the rearview mirror at the tailgating cops. she then inspects the
road ahead.

up in the distance

a busy six-lane intersection.

                       kimberly
              what do you want me to do?

                      clear
                    (hesitated beat)
             speed up.

                       kimberly
              yeah, fuck 'em.
                     (to thomas)
              no offense.

kimberly speeds toward the intersection. she pulls her seatbelt
aside, making sure it offers zero protection. thomas jumps in the
backseat, buckles up...

                      clear
             be alive, isabella, please be
             alive.

kimberly's eyes widen in fear. her foot hesitates over the brake
pedal as --

the truck blindly blazes through the busy intersection, miraculously
missing every car!

the police are just barely able to fishtail into 90 degree turns,
avoiding the intersection completely.

kimberly's eyes open and she lets out a victory cry.
