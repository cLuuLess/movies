the nurse is startled when kimberly and thomas burst through the
door. in the bg, a puzzled steve peeks inside until kimberly pulls
the door closed.

                      nurse
             what are you doing in here?    get
             the hell out! right now!

finally we hear the baby cry! the nurse immediately moves in to
swaddle the newborn. dr. kalarjian beams at the very groggy looking
isabella.

                       obstetrician
              isabella, look down and see your
              son.

to the confusion of everyone around them, kimberly and thomas burst
into cheers! they jump, dance and hug each other.

it's a magical moment --
