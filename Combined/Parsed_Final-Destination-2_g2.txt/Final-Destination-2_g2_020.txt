int. kimberly's room - night

the room is dark except for one burning candle. kimberly tosses and
turns. the wind sends a single branch scraping against her window. a
porch swing squeaks back and forth. adding to her anxiety.

a breeze enters, sputtering out the candle. kimberly sits upright in
bed and sees the window is shut. huh? she lights a match and sees the
candle wax dripped onto her table, forming the gooey shape of
a...180? the match goes out in her hand. the room is dark again.

headlights fr om passing cars cast eerie shadows on her ceiling.
shadows resembling planes seem to transform into a skull.

kimberly, freaked out, looks around to see the blinking light from
the vcr: it flashes 18:0 a few times, then 12:00.

she can't take it anymore. she yanks the vcr cord from the wall and
flicks on the lights, ridding the room of shadows. and anxiously
turns on her computer.
