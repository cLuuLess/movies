ext. westchester county - day

kat's expedition speeds through a yellow light and continues on.

close on expedition's left tire

metal sheers away more rubber.

inside the expedition

rory, antsy, rubbing his nostrils, stares at two yankee tickets.

                       rory
              here's what i don't get. for nine
              months, death does all this shit to
              make sure i win these tickets and
              end up on route 18 at exactly the
              right time for the pile up...

                        kat
              yeah?

                       rory
              but why single me out? what am i
              in the great scheme of things?
              you'd think i stepped off flight
              180 or something... fucking weird,
              man.

                       thomas
              you want weird? last year, my
              partner and i were heading out for
              the graveyard shift. a call comes
              in about a train wreck and frank
              decides to let me handle it alone.

                    (beat)
             frank died that night in a
             shootout. i'd be dead too if that
             call had come in just ten seconds
             later.

everyone nods in that 'life's weird' reverence kind of way.

                      kat
             i got that beat. so like, last
             may, i was supposed to stay at this
             cheesy bed and breakfast in
             pennsylvania. there was a major
             gas leak no one knew about and all
             the guests suffocated during the
             night.

                      rory
             yeah, so what happened?

                      kat
             i never mad it. the greyhound bus
             i was on splattered some chick all
             over the road and we had to stop.

                      clear
             was that in mt. abraham?

                        kat
              yeah.   how did you know?

                      clear
                    (sinking realization)
             that bus you were on? it killed
             terry mathers. she was supposed to
             die on flight 180.

                      kat
             i'm not sure i--

                       thomas
              shit. the call about the train
              wreck that saved my life? that was
              the night i scraped up billy
              hitchcock.

                       rory
              who?

                      kimberly
             another kid from flight 180.

a chill passes over the group.
