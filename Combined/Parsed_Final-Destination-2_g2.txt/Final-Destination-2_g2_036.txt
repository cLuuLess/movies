ext. funeral home - day

thomas' car pulls into a partially filled parking lot. kimberly,
thomas and clear file out and head to the door.

                       kimberly
              this is cheery.

                       thomas
              who is this guy, anyway?

                       clear
              a mortician. he seemed to know a
              hell of a lot more about death than
              he ever told us.

                       thomas
              should we knock?

                        clear
                      (looking ill)
              he probably already knows we're
              coming.
