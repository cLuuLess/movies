int. thomas' apartment - moments later

eugene suddenly bursts through the door, babbling incoherently.
kimberly, thomas and rory look on, bewildered.

                      eugene
             ...no escapes my ass. i control my
             fate. i die on my terms, hear me
             reaper cockscuker?!

eugene's in another world. he approaches thomas and lunges for his
gun - yanking it from the holster!

                      thomas
             what the hell are you...?

                       eugene
              ain't going out like that.   on my
              terms!

                      thomas
             just take it easy!

a twisted insane smile comes to eugene's face as he jams the
gunbarrel to his temple. the others shrink back in terror.

he pulls the trigger. click! eugene tries again. click!

thomas looks stunned as eugene goes through every round, click click

             you don't keep it loaded?

thomas' eyes disagree. he reaches in and grabs the gun away from
eugene, who stands there trembling. thomas cracks open the cylinder.
loaded.

                      rory
             maybe they were all duds.

                       thomas
              six in a row? never. impossible.
              that's like
                     (sinking realization)
              ...winning the lottery.

                       clear (o.s.)
              it wasn't his turn to die.

everyone turns to see clear and kat, standing in the doorway,
drenched in blood. kat trembles uncontrollably.

                      kat
             can we find the pregnant woman,
             please?
