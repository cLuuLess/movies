ext. suburban street - continuous

kimberly speeds the truck down some dangerously twisty roads slick
from wet leaves.

                       kimberly
              this makes no sense. isabella was
              supposed to crash her van into a
              lake. could we have altered her
              destiny when we had her arrested?

                       clear
              i don't think so. alex's
              premonitions happened exactly as he
              saw them no matter how much we

               tried to change it.

               then the only way to survive is to
               get to the hospital and protect
               eugene and isabella for as long as
               we can.

                        clear
               if only alex and i had done that
               with the others, alex might still
               be...

a somber beat. then thomas looks over at the speedometer.

                        thomas
               um, kimberly? this is a
               neighborhood. you may wanna slow
               it down.

                        kimberly
               don't worry. nothing can happen to
               us.

                        thomas
               i wasn't worried about us.

suddenly, kimberly clutches her throat!

hard cut to:
