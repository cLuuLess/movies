int. thomas' apartment - dawn

flashing lights from rescue vehicles illuminate the living room. in
the newly conformed safe house, kat and clear relax as best they can
in thomas' dry clothes.

thomas makes another phone call. in the corner, eugene shivers to
himself. desperately looking for signs of danger. he looks over to
clear.

                      eugene
             um, clear? i'm sorry...about
             before. i...

                      clear
             your entire world view just went
             out the window. i couldn't expect
             a religious conversation overnight.
             we'll get through this.
                    (beat)
             i promise.

eugene looks immensely relieved. rory ambles over to kimberly, his
typical callousness gone.

                      rory
             can i ask you a question?

                       kimberly
              sure.

                       rory
              when i die. is it gonna hurt?

                      kimberly
             i...i don't know.

rory nods. he expected as much. he fishes his license and keys out of
his pocket.

                       rory
              and you're gonna die after me,
              right?

                      kimberly
             i guess so.

                      rory
                    (re: keys and license)
             would you take these? and if i
             die...
                    (tears well up)
             could you throw all my drugs out?
             paraphernalia, porno, you know...
             anything that would break my mom's
             heart.

kimberly looks deeply into his eyes, looking for the punchline. when
she doesn't see one, she nods tenderly and takes the keys.

the phone rings. rory jumps at the sound, paranoid eyes in scan mode.
thomas answers, speaks softly, hangs up.

                      thomas
             a one very pissed off ms. isabella
             cruz is being detained up in
             greenwood. let's finish this
             thing.
