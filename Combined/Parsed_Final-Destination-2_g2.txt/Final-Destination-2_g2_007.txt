int. observation room - continuous

the door opens. detective suby enters, leading thomas. through a two -
way mirror, they can see the others chatting anxiously.


                       detective suby
              tell me you didn't start up on that
              flight 180 shit again.
                  (beat)
              did you?

                         thomas

              of course not. that would be
              irresponsible and unprofessional.

detective suby's persistent glare makes thomas uncomfortable.


                       thomas
              look, you weren't there. it was
              weird. she knew that log truck was
              gonna cause an accident, she knew.
                  (beat)
              never mind.

                       detective suby
              i thought we we re finished with
              this bullshit. this is police
              work, not the psychic hot line.

but thomas isn't listening. he's glued to kimberly's words. when
detective suby realizes this, he stops and listens.


                       kimber ly
              but if i was never meant to pull
              over, then we all should have died
              in the pile up.

                       tim
              which means death could be coming
              for us.

detective suby looks pissed o ff.


                       detective suby
              way to console the witnesses burke.

at the same time, we watch evan enter the other room, grab his jacket
and wave goodbye to the others.


                       detective suby
              you got 'em thinking death is after
              them? shit, they're the luckiest
              sons o' bitches on the planet. get
              this guy evan shaeffer; yesterday
              the kid wins the lotto and today
              some looney bitch b locks traffic
              and he avoids the worst pile up in
              years. i should be so damn
              unlucky.
