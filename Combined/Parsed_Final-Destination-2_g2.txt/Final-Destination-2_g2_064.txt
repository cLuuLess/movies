int. kat's expedition - continuous

rory excitedly makes a connection.

                      rory
             remember the theater in paris that
             collapsed last year, killed
             everyone inside?

everyone nods, anticipating...

                      rory
             i had tickets to go, but one day
             i'm in paris, trippin' on acid,
             sippin' lattes an' such, and this
             dude gets whacked by a falling
             sign.

                        clear
              carter.

                      rory
             freaked me out so bad i hid in a
             shopping cart for four hours.
             'course, missed the show...

                        clear

                 what about you, kimberly?   did you
                 anyone from flight- ?

clear stops when she sees all the color has drained from kimberly's
face. even eugene looks concerned.

                      eugene
             are you okay?

the car becomes completely silent (except for the slight scraping) as
kimberly prepares to tell her story.

                      kimberly
             a little over a year ago, my mother
             and i went to the mall. i was
             supposed to meet her outside, but i
             got caught up watching some news
             report about some kid who committed
             suicide. i kept thinking, "how can
             you strangle yourself in a
             bathtub?" that's retarded.

thomas mouths, "tod?" to clear. clear nods.

                          kimberly
                 it felt wrong. and yet...
                        (continuing)
                 there were gunshots outside and i
                 ran...
                        (chokes up)
                 some kids tried to jack her car.
                 she fought them off - she was a
                 fighter - and they killed her.

kimberly looks to clear.

                      kimberly
             after the funeral i had this
             overwhelming feeling that it should
             have been me. i figured that's how
             everyone must feel. but i guess i
             was right.

thomas reaches between the seats and takes kimberly's hand. as he
looks into her eyes, kat takes her own eyes off the road to light a
cigarette.

intercut brian

the tractor is safely off the road next to a wood pile. brian grabs a
cord and starts up the whoodchipper.
