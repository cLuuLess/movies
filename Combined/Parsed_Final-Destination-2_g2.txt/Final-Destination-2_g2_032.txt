int. waiting room - continuous

nora stares at a pigeon with a broken wing frantically trying to fly
right. dr. lees makes a half- hearted attempt to soothe and catch it.

back in dr. lees' office

slow dolly up to tim. choking, gurgling. his eyes are open, but
rolled up. his hand limply reaches up...then drops.

sounds of commotion in the next room seem to fade away as we continue
our slow dolly into tim's eyes.

they glaze over...the choking stops. and a hand reaches into frame
and pulls the puffer fish out of tim's mouth.

reveal jean looking petrified at the close call, looking around to
make sure nobody saw...
