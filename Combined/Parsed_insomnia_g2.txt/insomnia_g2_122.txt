             ext. randy stetz's room - later

             will stands just outside the doorway into randy's room.
             uniformed officers inside searching the place.  tearing down
             pictures.  turning out doors.  ripping up carpet.  randy's
             voice.  in protest.

                                 randy (o.s.)
                       you can't fucking do this!

             will hears some scuffling.  the sheet being pulled down.  the
             clatter of tools.

                                 randy (o.s.)
                       hey!  i'm working on that!

             parts pulled off the shelves.  the bike, shoved to the side.
             then.  a silence.  followed by...

                                 officer (o.s.)
                       found something.

             will shuts his eyes.  heavy footsteps head over to the bike.
             someone's pulled the gun from the can.

                                 randy (o.s.)
                       what the fuck is that!

             fred's voice, calm.

                                 fred (o.s.)
                       that's it.  let's bag it.

             more footsteps.  randy, desperate.

                                 randy (o.s.)
                       that's not mine, man!  that's not mine!

             will opens his eyes.  fred's voice.  almost sympathetic.

                                 fred (o.s.)
                       randy...

                                 randy (o.s.)
                       no way, man!

             more scuffling.  a chair knocked over.  something smashes.
             will looks down at the floor as

             fred and a uniformed cop struggle to drag randy through the
             doorway.  randy writhes, kicks, tugs.  screams.

                                 randy (cont'd)
                       that ain't mine!

             fred grabs randy's shoulder.

                                 fred
                       c'mon, randy.

             randy squirms.  turns.  looks right into will's eyes.  gone
             is the bluster.  gone is the attitude.  randy stetz, lost
             kid.  tears streaming down his face.

                                 randy
                       i swear to god.  i didn't kill her.  i 
                       swear to god...
