             will jogs along in a sonics sweatshirt, a ring of sweat
             around his collar.  he looks out over the harbor.  fishing
             boats coming in with their early morning haul.  more halibut.
             he checks his watch.  slows to a walk.  looks up and sees...

             ellie burr standing on the front steps of the pioneer lodge.
             smiles.  holds up some car keys.

                                 ellie
                       fred wants us to meet him at the
                       connell's.
