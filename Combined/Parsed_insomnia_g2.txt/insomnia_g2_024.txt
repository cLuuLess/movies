             int. tunnel - continuous

             ...drops down into a dark, dank tunnel.  water dripping.
             footfalls echoing.  will cocks his head.  left or right?
             starts sprinting down towards the lighter end of the tunnel,
             his own footsteps bouncing against the tunnel walls.  he
             rounds a curve.  sound recedes...
