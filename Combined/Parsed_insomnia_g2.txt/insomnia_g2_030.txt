             int. chief charles nyback's office - night

             chief nyback sits in his chair.  fingers interlaced.  a 
             somber expression on his face.

                                 chief nyback
                       and then you lost him.

             will sits opposite him.  wet, dishevelled, dirty.  hap's
             blood smeared all over his shirt.  staring off into space.

                                 will
                       and then i lost him.  in the fog.

                                 chief nyback
                       about how long 'til you heard the
                       suspect's second shot?

             will, hesitates.

                                 will
                       twenty, thirty seconds.  i followed the
                       sound down to the water.  that's where...

             he blinks.  looks down.  swallows.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       that's where i found hap.

             nyback sighs, shakes his head.  reaches down to his bottom
             drawer and pulls out a bottle of bourbon and a glass.

                                 chief nyback
                       i think you need a glass of this.

             he goes to unscrew the bottle, but will shakes his head.
             stands.  paces.  rakes his hand through his hair.

             turns suddenly and swipes his arm across nyback's desk.
             everything crashes to the floor.

                                 will
                           (yells)
                       why didn't i know about that goddamn
                       tunnel, charlie?

             nyback looks up at him.  calm.

                                 chief nyback
                       there's a bunch of those tunnels out
                       there, will.  from bunkers over sixty
                       years old.  i don't even know half of
                       them myself, and i grew up here.

             will clenches his fists.

                                 will
                       i had him, charlie.  right in front of
                       me.  not two feet.  i could smell the son-
                       of-a-bitch.  playing with me.  and i
                       missed the shot.  he was right there and
                       i missed the shot!  then my goddamned gun
                       jammed...

             nyback gets up.  limps over to his old friend.

                                 chief nyback
                       will, you can't blame yourself.

                                 will
                       i had him!

                                 chief nyback
                       it's only gonna make you crazy.

             just then there's a soft knock on the door.  the men look
             over.  ellie sticks her head in.  speaks in a tone that
             belies that a man has recently died.

                                 ellie
                       you wanted to see me?

             will turns his back to her.  nyback heads over.

                                 chief nyback
                       right, ellie.

             ellie flicks a look at the pile on the floor.  at will's
             back.

                                 chief nyback (cont'd)
                       i want you to take care of the
                       investigation into detective eckhart's
                       shooting.

             ellie looks at him.  confused.  lowers her voice.

                                 ellie
                       but what about the connell case?  i'm on
                       the connell case.

             nyback puts a hand on her shoulder.

                                 chief nyback
                       we need paperwork, ellie.  you know that.
                       just write up a quick report.

             ellie's shoulders droop.  thought she was playing with the
             big boys.  just then will turns abruptly and grabs his coat.

                                 will
                       i'm going to check on the roadblocks...

             nyback catches his arm.

                                 chief nyback
                       you're no good right now, will.  go back
                       to the lodge.  try to get some rest.

             will looks at him.  know's he's right.
