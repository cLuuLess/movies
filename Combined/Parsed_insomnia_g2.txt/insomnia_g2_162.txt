             ext. weeds
   
             will.  pulling himself through the weeds.  losing blood fast.
             dragging his body.  approaches the side of the boathouse.

             walter's gun barrel, sticking out.

             will ducks his head.  winces in pain.  breathing, becoming
             ragged.  rounds to the other side.  hoists himself up to
             another window.  cautiously looks in...

             walter at the far window.

             will jerks back.  steps on the dock.  a plank creaks.  shit.
             peers back through the window.  
    
             walter.  still looking out.  didn't hear a thing.

             will remembers.  walter doesn't have his hearing aid.  he's
             deaf on that side.
