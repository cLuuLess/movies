             int. will's room - 1:05 a.m.

             the files spread across the floor.  their edges buckled from
             the rain.  dozens of pictures of kay connell.  school
             records.  private letters.  health files.  coroner's report.

             will.  pacing.  back and forth.  thinking.  over that same
             squeaky floorboard.  the clock reads: 1:05.
