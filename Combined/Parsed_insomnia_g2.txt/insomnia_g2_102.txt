             ext. convenience store - minutes later

             will exits the store.  a bag under his arm.  we miss you, kay
             looming over his shoulder.  steps out onto the sidewalk and
             sees...

             ellie leaning against her truck.  waiting for him.  smiles.

                                 ellie
                       which way are you walking?

             a tingle, all across will's body.  christ.  this girl's
             everywhere!  he hunches into his coat.  flicks up his collar.
             doesn't want her to see him fully.  nods down the road.

                                 will
                       back to the lodge.

             ellie grabs her bag.  joins him.  they start walking.

                                 ellie
                       i needed to get your signature on
                       something.

             she pulls a folder from her bag.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       the report on detective eckhart.  chief
                       made me finish it this morning.  said it
                       was taking too long.

             will takes the file.  flips it open.  the death of his
             partner.  neatly typed.  neatly stapled.  pulls out a pen.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       aren't you going to read it?

                                 will
                       i trust you.

             he signs.  hands it back to her.  she slips it into her bag.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       now i can help you with the connell case. 
                       that writer's coming in tomorrow.  walter
                       byrd.

             a slight stutter in will's step.

                                 will
                       duggar called him?

                                 ellie
                       about an hour ago.  said he was more than
                       happy to cooperate.

             ellie looks over at will as they cross the street.  studying
             his face.  his gait.  noticing the slight limp in his right
             leg.  the cut on his forehead.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       you haven't been sleeping much, have you,
                       detective dormer?

             they arrive at the stone steps of the pioneer lodge.

                                 will
                       not really.

                                 ellie
                       isn't that the difference between a good
                       cop and a bad cop?  a good cop can't
                       sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's
                       missing.  a bad cop can't sleep 'cause
                       his conscience won't let him.
                           (smiles)
                       you said that once, remember?

             will, finally looks at her.

                                 will
                       no.  but it sounds like something i
                       would've said.

             turns and starts up the steps.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       see you tomorrow, ellie.

             ellie, watches him for a second.  then calls out.

                                 ellie
                       oh!  i forgot to tell you.  the puffins
                       won.

             will stops, turns to look back at her.  confused.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       the baseball game.  our team...

             slings the bag over her shoulder.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       ...we won.
