             ext. icicle fishing cannery - day

             ...screeches to a stop near an old sign, icicle cannery.
             gravel flying.  will gets out.  slams his door.  rounds the 
             car and opens tanya's door.  she's screaming at him.

                                 tanya
                       you crazy son-of-a-bitch!  you could have
                       killed us!

             will reaches in and pulls her out of the car.

                                 tanya (cont'd)
                       ow!  you're hurting me!

             will pulls her up a steep hill of garbage and broken crates.
             pushes her down the other side.  she stumbles.

                                 tanya (cont'd)
                       you want to tell me what the fuck this is
                       all about?

             will stands above her, on the hill.  his face set like stone.

                                 will
                       you and kay were like sisters?

                                 tanya
                       that's what i said.

                                 will
                       told each other everything.
                           (heads down the hill)
                       that why your picture's torn up in the
                       top drawer of her bureau?

             tanya steps back.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       why her boyfriend's hand was clamped on 
                       your ass at her funeral?

             he grabs her by the arm.  jerks it up.  she cries out.  will
             leans in.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       you like games, little girl?  well how
                       about this one - you're standing right
                       where her naked body was found wrapped up
                       in a garbage bag.

             tanya's eyes grow wide.  she looks around her.  disgusting,
             rotten.  a seagull pecking at the body of a dead bird.  she
             tries to break away...

                                 tanya
                       no...

                                 will
                       who was kay seeing besides randy stetz?

             tanya looks away.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       who gave her those dresses?

             she struggles more.  no good.  will's grip is like a vice.

                                 will (cont'd)
                       i need a name.

                                 tanya
                       i don't know.

                                 will
                       you don't know.

                                 tanya
                       she wouldn't tell me!

                                 will
                       but you were such good friends...

             tanya, squirming.  angry.

                                 tanya
                       it was like some big fucking secret!

                                 will
                       what was?

                                 tanya
                       she kept saying she was gonna get out of
                       here.  leave us all behind.  that he was
                       going to take her!

                                 will
                       who?

                                 tanya
                       my arm!

                                 will
                       who?

                                 tanya
                       she used some stupid code name.

                                 will
                       what was it?

                                 tanya
                       brody...i don't know...
                           (crying)
                       ...something brody!

             will straightens.  he's heard that name before.

             suddenly tanya jams her heel into his shoe.  he cries out.
             she breaks away from him.  runs up the hill.  turns.  tears
             streaking her face.  throws the carnation to the ground.

                                 tanya (cont'd)
                       you happy now, you fucking bastard?
