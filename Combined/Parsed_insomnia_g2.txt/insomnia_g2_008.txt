             fred steps out of the station, pulls on a baseball cap.

                                 fred
                       we can walk from here.

             he heads off across the parking lot.  will and hap exchange a
             glance.

                                 will
                       guess that's what they call alaskan

                                 ellie (o.s.)
                       don't worry about him...

             they turn.  ellie's come up behind them.  looks over at the
             hunched figure to fred.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       he's just mad 'cause you're taking over.

             fred stops up ahead.  sees her.  annoyed.

                                 fred
                       ellie!  go type something!
