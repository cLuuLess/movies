             int. hallway - nightmute morgue - early morning

             will walking down a hallway.  fluorescent lights.
             cinderblock walls.  on his cell phone.

                                 will
                           (into phone)
                       duggar - i'm at the coroner's now.  i'll
                       be back in about twenty minutes...

             stops at an open doorway in time to see
    
             the coroner pull a sheet over the cold, blue body of hap
             eckhart.

             will's heart lurches.  he grabs on to the door jamb.  wasn't
             ready for that.  the coroner looks up.

                                 coroner
                       detective.  thought you were sending one
                       of your lackeys.

             will clears his throat.  closes his cell phone.

                                 will
                       i thought it was better if i came.  under
                       the circumstances.

             the coroner nods.  goes to wash her hands.

                                 coroner
                       it's different when you know them, isn't
                       it?
                           (nods to clipboard)
                       just sign over there and she's all yours.

             shrugs off her lab coat.  she's wearing a blue dress.  looks
             like a piano teacher.  heads into an adjoining office.

             will.  alone.  steps into the room.  the smell of
             formaldehyde.  bloody instruments on a stainless steel tray.
             walks towards the clipboard, eyes flicking over to the shape
             under the sheet when...

             suddenly hap's hand drops down.  thick fingers.  wedding
             band.

             will jumps...

                                 coroner (o.s.)
                       your partner didn't suffer much...

             the coroner re-emerges from the office with a manila
             envelope.  hap eckhart written on it in black pen.

                                 coroner (cont'd)
                       maybe for a minute or two.

             will rubs his face.  tries to focus on the clipboard.  the
             coroner holds out the envelope.  smiles.

                                 coroner (cont'd)
                       just enough time to reflect.

                                 will
                       thanks, doc.

             he takes the envelope.  the coroner peers up at him.

                                 coroner
                       you're looking a little green, detective.
