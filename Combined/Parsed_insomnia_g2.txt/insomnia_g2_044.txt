             ext. rocky beach - outside nightmute - morning

             back at the beach.  we see nothing but fog.  a voice comes
             through.

                                 ellie (o.s.)
                       ...and it was at this point that detective
                       dormer headed towards the noise...

             ellie emerges from the fog.  carrying the map and talking
             into a small tape recorder.  she's climbing over the rocks,
             wearing a windbreaker a couple sizes too big.

             a uniformed officer follows, carrying a camera.  she turns to
             him.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       remember, kepp, shoot everything...
                           (back to the tape recorder)
                       ...wherein he discovered the wounded
                       detective farrell brooks, having been
                      shot in the vastus externus of the upper
                      left thigh...

             she climbs over the same bank will dormer climbed two
             evenings before.  finds...

             another uniformed officer, hanging out and smoking.

                                 ellie (cont'd)
                       francis!

             he looks up.  pimples on his chin.

                                 francis
                       what?

                                 ellie
                       you're supposed to be farrell.  shot in
                       the thigh and writhing in pain.

                                 francis
                       c'mon, ellie.  what's it matter?

                                 ellie
                       accuracy.  that's what.
                           (points to the ground)
                       now get down.

             francis looks up at her.  flicks his cigarette away and gets
             down amongst the rocks.  holds his thigh like he was shot.

                                 francis
                       ow.

             click!  kepp takes the picture.
