             int. pioneer lodge - nightmute - night

             rachel winding an old grandfather clock with a key.  looks
             about a hundred years old.

             will enters the lobby.  soaked through.  carrying an armload
             of wet files.  rachel turns, sees him.  reaches over to an
             umbrella stand.  hands him an umbrella.

                                 rachel
                       here.  it's on the house.

             will takes it.  preoccupied.

                                 will
                       thanks.

             he starts up the stairs.  notices rachel straining to return
             the key to the top of the clock.  backtracks to help her.
             she gets it without his help.

                                 rachel
                       i got it.
                           (smiles)
                       don't know why i bother.  it's been
                       broken for two years.

                                 will
                       habit.

             rachel looks at him.  can't figure this guy out.  remembers
             something.

                                 rachel (cont'd)
                       oh.  a man came by to see you earlier.
                       said he was your new partner.

             a tingle skips down will's spine.  he looks at her.

                                 will
                       fred duggar?

                                 rachel
                       no.  he didn't say what his name was.
                       only that you were expecting him.

                                 will
                       i'm not expecting anyone.

                                 rachel
                       that's not what he thinks.

                                 will
                       what did he look like?

             rachel thinks for a second.  leaning against the clock.

                                 rachel
                       short.  dark hair.  not that memorable.

             will nods, rubs his forehead.  suddenly has a pounding
             headache.  turns for the stairs.  hesitates.

                                 will
                       i need to borrow something.
