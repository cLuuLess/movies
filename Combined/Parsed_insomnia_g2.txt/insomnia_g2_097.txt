             ext. ferry station - outside umkumiut - day

             a ferry at the end of the pier.  a small wooden booth for
             selling tickets.  beautiful, sweeping snow-capped mountains
             on the other side of the bay.  nothing else for miles around.

             the pick-up pulls up next to the bus and a couple other cars.
             will jumps out.  scans the area for byrd.  nothing.  then,
             sees the last few people boarding the ferry.
