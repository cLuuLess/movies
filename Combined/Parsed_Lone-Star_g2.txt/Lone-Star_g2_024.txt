	ext. bledsoe house -- day -- rocker

	we start on a cu of a rocker creaking back and forth on an 
	old wooden porch. a woman hums.

	minnie

	minnie bledsoe, in her 60s, sits on her porch in the old 
	black section of town, playing with a gameboy. she has very 
	thick glasses on. sam walks up to her from his car--

				sam
		mrs. bledsoe?

				minnie
		that's me.

				sam
		i'm sheriff deeds--

				minnie
		sheriff deeds' dead, honey--you just 
		sheriff junior.

				sam
			(smiles)
		yeah, that's the story of my life.

				minnie
		you ever play one of these?

				sam
		i've seen 'em.

				minnie
		well, don't ever start up on 'em, 
		cause once you do you can't stop. i 
		tell myself i'm gonna play just three 
		little games after breakfast, and 
		here i sit with half the day gone.

				sam
		you mind if i ask a few questions 
		about your husband? roderick?

				minnie
		i won't say nothing bad about the 
		man, but you can ask away.

				sam
		he had the club out on the old trail 
		road--

				minnie
		we run that twenty-odd years. give 
		it over to otis payne in 1967. april.

				sam
		so you must remember sheriff wade.

				minnie
		not if i can help it.

				sam
		you had to deal with him in running 
		the club.

				minnie
		them days, you deal with sheriff 
		wade or you didn't deal at all. first 
		of the month, every month, he remind 
		you of who you really workin' for.

				sam
		he squeezed money out of you?

				minnie
		wasn't legal to sell liquor in a 
		glass back then unless you was a 
		club, see. roderick used to say, 
		"buy yourself a drink, you get a 
		free membership." but sheriff wade, 
		he could shut you down anytime.

				sam
		and my father?

				minnie
		sheriff buddy was a different story. 
		long as roderick throw his weight 
		the right way on election day, make 
		sure all the colored get out to vote-
		we was called colored back then, if 
		you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue 
		for the right people now and then, 
		things was peaceful. that sheriff 
		wade, though, he took an awful big 
		bite.

				sam
		people didn't complain?

				minnie
		not if they was colored or meskin. 
		not if they wanted to keep breathin'.

				sam
		do you remember the last time you 
		saw him?

	minnie thinks, puts down the gameboy--

				minnie
		i seen him in our place the last 
		week before he gone missin'.

	we track in to a close-up of her. r&b music fades up slowly--

				minnie
		he used to come in whilst we was in 
		full swing, make people nervous. had 
		him a smile like the grim reaper--
