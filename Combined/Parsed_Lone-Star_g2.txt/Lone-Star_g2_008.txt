	int. cafe santa barbara -- afternoon -- enrique

	sweat beads the forehead of a thin, tired-looking recent 
	immigrant, enrique, as he delivers platters of chile rellenos 
	to a booth. mexican music plays on a jukebox in the b.g. we 
	hold on the booth, where hollis pogue, in his 60s entertains 
	two good old boys--

				hollis
		so buddy walks up to the porch and 
		there's old fishbait mchenry, cleanin' 
		the dirt out his toenails with a 
		pocketknife--he was the most hygienic 
		of all the mchenrys--

	the breakfast companions are laughing already--

				hollis
		"fishbait," says buddy, in that quiet 
		way of his, "what you know about 
		them tires that went missing from 
		markets?" fishbait thinks for a 
		minute, then he lifts up a loose 
		board from the porch floor and calls 
		down into it, "c'mon out, pooter, 
		they caught us!"

				fenton
			(laughing)
		buddy deeds. he had a way.

				hollis
		he known who it was onnacouna the 
		tire tracks in the dirt from the 
		back of the garage to where they 
		loaded up. "old fishbait," he says, 
		"never lifted a thing in this world 
		if there was a way he could roll 
		it."

	more laughter--

				fenton
		won't be another like him. that boy 
		of his doesn't come near it. you ask 
		me, he's all hat and no cattle

				sam (o.s.)
		fellas--

	we widen to see sam standing by their booth. no telling how 
	long he's been listening, fenton is embarrassed.

				hollis
		sam! i was just telling a few about 
		your old man.

				fenton
		he was a unique individual.

				sam
		yeah, he was that.

	we sense a little strain when sam has to talk about his father--

				hollis
		big day coming up--i wish we'd have 
		thought of it while he was still 
		living. but he went so unexpected.

				fenton
		better late than never. korean war 
		hero, sheriff for near thirty years-- 
		buddy deeds memorial p--

				sam
		i heard there was a bit of a fuss.

				hollis
		oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. 
		danny padilla from the sentinel, 
		that crowd.

				fenton
		every other damn thing in the country 
		is called after martin luther king, 
		they can't let our side have one 
		measly park?

				hollis
		king wasn't mexican, fenton--

				fenton
		bad enough all the street names are 
		in spanish--

				sam
		they were here first.

				fenton
		then name it after big chief 
		shitinabucket! whoever that tonkawa 
		fella was. he had the mexes beat by 
		centuries.

				hollis
		there was a faction pulling for that 
		boy who was killed in the gulf war-- 
		ruben--

				sam
		--santiago.

				hollis
		right. but nobody here ever noticed 
		him till they read his name on the 
		national news--

				fenton
		they just wanted it to be one of 
		theirs--

				hollis
		that's not the whole story. the 
		mexicans that know, that remember, 
		understand what buddy was for their 
		people.  hell, it was mercedes over 
		there who swung the deciding vote 
		for him.

	sam looks to the register where pilar's mother, mercedes 
	cruz, whacks rolls of change apart on the counter. she seems 
	to be avoiding looking toward him.

				sam
		that so?

				hollis
		she put it even at three to three, 
		so as the mayor i get to cast the 
		tiebreaker. the older generation 
		won't have any problem with it. they 
		remember how buddy come to be sheriff, 
		that it was all 'cause he took their 
		part.

				fenton
		tell that one, hollis--

				hollis
		hell, everybody heard that story a 
		million times.

				sam
		i'd like to hear it. your version of 
		it.

	something about the way sam says it puts hollis on guard.

				fenton
		go ahead, hollis.

	cu hollis

	hollis is hooked into it now--

				hollis
		the two of us were the only deputies 
		back then me and buddy--it's what--
		'58--

				fenton (o.s.)
		'57, 1 believe--

				hollis
		and the sheriff at the time was big 
		charley wade. charley was one of 
		your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets 
		kind of sheriffs, he took a healthy 
		bite out of whatever moved through 
		this county.

	he looks down at the table--

				hollis
		it was in here one night, back  when 
		jimmy herrera run the place.   started 
		right here in this booth.

	we pan down to the table, the food has changed. the tortillas 
	are in a straw basket instead of plastic. the jukebox changes 
	to another song and the light dims slightly. a hand with a 
	big masonic ring on one finger appears to lift a tortilla--
	underneath it lie three ten-dollar bills.  the hand lifts 
	them up and we tilt to see the face of sheriff charley wade, 
	a big, mean redneck with shrewd eyes. it is 1957--

				wade
			(grins)
		this beaner fare doesn't agree with 
		me, but the price sure is right.

	wider

	wade sits across from his young deputies, young hollis (30s) 
	and buddy deeds (20s). a chicken-fried steak sits untouched 
	in front of buddy. hollis has the anxious look of an errand 
	boy, while buddy is self-contained and quietly forceful for 
	his age.

				buddy
		what's that for?

				wade
		jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, 
		most of 'em relatives. people breed 
		like chickens.

				buddy
		so?

				wade
		i roust some muchacho on the street, 
		doesn't have his papers, all he got 
		to say is "yo trabajo para jimmy 
		herrera."

	wade folds the money and stuffs if in his pocket--

				wade
		you got to keep the wheels greased, 
		son. sheriff does his job right, 
		everybody makes out. now this is 
		gonna be one of your pickups, buddy. 
		first of the month, just like the 
		rent. get the car, hollis.

	wade and hollis slide out of the booth to stand.

				buddy
		i'm not doing it.

	hollis stops a few feet away, shocked. wade just stares down 
	at buddy.

				wade
		come again?

	buddy looks wade in the eye, seemingly unafraid.

				buddy
		it's your deal. you sweated it out 
		of him, you pick it up.

				wade
		there's gonna be some left over for 
		you, buddy. i take care of my boys.

				buddy
		that's not the point.

				wade
		you feeling bad for jimmy? have him 
		tell you the size of the mordida 
		they took out of his hide when he 
		run a place on the other side. those 
		old boys in ciudad leon--

				buddy
		i'm not picking it up.

				wade
		you do whatever i say you do or else 
		you put it on the trail, son.

	the customers are all watching now, nervous. buddy thinks 
	for a moment, not taking his eyes off wade.

				buddy
		how 'bout this--how 'bout you put 
		that shield on this table and  vanish 
		before you end up dead or in jail?

	wade rests his hand on his pistol.  it is dead silent but 
	for the music on the box.

				buddy
		you ever shoot anybody was looking 
		you in the eye?

				wade
		who said anything about shootin' 
		anybody?

	buddy has his gun out under the table.  he slowly brings it 
	up and lays it flat on the table, not taking his hand off it 
	or his eyes off wade.

				buddy
		whole different story; isn't it?

				wade
		you're fired. you're outta the 
		department.

				buddy
		there's not a soul in this county 
		isn't sick to death of your bullshit, 
		charley. you made yourself scarce, 
		you could make a lot of people happy.

				wade
		you little pissant--

				buddy
		now or later, charley. you won't 
		have any trouble finding me.

	wade feels the people around him waiting for a reaction.  he 
	leans close to buddy to croak in a hoarse whisper.

				wade
		you're a dead man.

	he turns and nearly bumps into hollis. he gives the deputy a 
	shove.

				wade
		get the goddamn car. we're going to 
		roderick's.

	cu buddy

	he watches till the screen door shuts behind them, then 
	holsters his gun and begins to saw at the steak as if nothing 
	had happened. he calls softly--

				buddy
		muchacho--mas cerveza por favor.

	he looks up at somebody and we pan till we see sam, still 
	standing over the booth, listening. we are back in 1995--

				hollis (o.s.)
		"mas cerveza por favor."

				fenton (o.s.)
		that buddy was a cool breeze.

	we pull back to see hollis and his buddies at the table, 
	eating their lunches as they listen.

				fenton
		charley wade were known to have put 
		a good number of people in the ground, 
		and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball 
		with him.

				hollis
		we made our collection at roderick's 
		place and that was the last anybody 
		seen hide nor hair of him.  he went 
		missing the next day, along with ten 
		thousand dollars in county funds 
		from the safe at the jail.

				sam
		never heard from him again?

				hollis
		not a peep. buddy run the man out of 
		town.

				fenton
		buddy deeds said a thing, he damn 
		well backed it up. won't be another 
		like him.

				sam
		so he arrested all of jimmy herrera's 
		people and sent 'em back to the other 
		side?

	hollis sees what sam is getting at, grins--

				hollis
		oh--he come to an accommodation. 
		money doesn't always need to change 
		hands to keep the wheels turning.

				sam
		right.

				hollis
		look, i know you had some problems 
		with your father, and he and muriel-- 
		well--

				fenton
		your mother was a saint.

				hollis
		--but buddy deeds was my salvation.

	sam nods, speaks softly--

				sam
		won't be another like him.
