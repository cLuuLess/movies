	ext. roadside stand -- day -- cu cattle skull

	a georgia o'keefe-looking cattle skull sits on a pedestal 
	against the western sky--

				wesley (o.s.)
		the longhorns go for ten times the 
		price--

	we widen as the skull is lifted by wesley birdsong, a native 
	american man in his 70s who wears extremely thick glasses. 
	sam tags along as the old man rearranges the display of texas 
	curios laid out in front of his trailer. empty scrubland 
	surrounds them.

				wesley
		--but longhorns are hard to come by 
		these days.

				sam
		you sell much out here?

				wesley
		how am i gonna sell things if nobody 
		comes by? this stretch of road runs 
		between nowheres and nothin' much.

				sam
		hell of a spot to put a business.

				wesley
		but you don't see much competition, 
		do you?

	he winks at sam, picks up a wooden radio carved to resemble 
	the alamo--

				wesley
		these things used to sell like 
		hotcakes. now, if it can't play those 
		discs, they won't look at it.

	he puts the radio on, looks out at the emptiness around--

				wesley
		i like it here. once i tried going 
		onto that reservation to live. 
		couldn't take the politics. damn 
		indian'll drive you crazy with that, 
		now your father--this wasn't what he 
		had in mind at all. he come out of 
		korea, he had this chevy with too 
		much engine in it. he'd come roarin' 
		up and down this road all hours of 
		the day and night,looking for somebody 
		to race.

	he lifts a jar with a leathery brown thing in it--

				wesley
		buffalo chips. fella in santa fe 
		told me he sells these as fast as 
		the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.

				sam
		so when did buddy leave?

				wesley
		for frontera? hell, i can't remember 
		dates no more. i do recall it was 
		after an affair of the heart had 
		gone sour on him. he almost took 
		some poor fella's head off at the 
		legion in arroyo grande, and figured 
		it was time to move on.

				sam
		you think he killed anybody in korea?

				wesley
		they don't hand those medals out for 
		hidin'in your foxhole. would you buy 
		this?

				sam
		no--

				wesley
		me neither.

	he searches for something among the curios--

				wesley
		if he hadn't found that deputy job, 
		i believe buddy might've gone down 
		the other path, got into some serious 
		trouble. settled him right down. 
		that and your mother. 'course he had 
		that other one later.

				sam
		another woman?

				wesley
		your mother wasn't one to get chased 
		off her patch. half the damn county 
		knew and nobody thought the worse of 
		her for seein' it through.

				sam
		you know who it was?

				wesley
		the other one? hell, at my age, every 
		time you learn a new name you got to 
		forget an old one. your head's all 
		crowded up--here it is--

	wesley stretches out a four-foot rattlesnake skin, rattles 
	still attached--

				wesley
		this big fella was sleepin' in a 
		crate at cisco's junkyard right when 
		i looked to see what was in it. jumped 
		up at my face--scared me so bad i 
		killed him without thinkin'.

	he shakes the rattles at sam--

				wesley
		gotta be careful where you're pokin'--
		who knows what you'll find.
