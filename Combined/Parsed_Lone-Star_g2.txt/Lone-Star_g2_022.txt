	ext. lake -- day -- cu fishing lure

	a nasty-looking thing. only a bass would want to eat this. 
	hollis leans in to peer at the thing dangling before his 
	face.

	wider

	hollis sits in the swivel chair of a bass boat tied to a 
	dock at the lake, going through his box of lures. sam appears 
	on the dock and steps down.

				sam
		i always wondered what you mayors do 
		when you're not cutting ribbons.

				hollis
		sam! hey podner! you caught me playing 
		hooky--

				sam
			(looks across lake)
		floating around out here, playin' 
		hell with them bass--play a little 
		cards, play a little golf, drink 
		some beer--

				hollis
		sounds great. where do i sign up?

				sam
		i haven't been out here for a while.

				hollis
		you go by your old house?

				sam
		no.

				hollis
		just as well. the new people just 
		painted it some god-awful color--

				sam
		we found a body out by the army base 
		yesterday. been there for a long 
		time.

	hollis squints at a rubber lure, rejects it--

				hollis
		was it davy crockett or jim bowie?

				sam
			(smiles)
		you recall if charley wade was a 
		mason?

				hollis
		charley? i believe he was. used to 
		go for lodge meetings over to laredo. 
		what's he got to do with your body?

				sam
		all it was wearing was a big old 
		masonic ring and a rio county sheriffs 
		badge.

	hollis reacts. sam puts a foot on the gunwale of the boat.

				sam
		you don't remember anything else 
		from that last night you saw him, do 
		you?

				hollis
		i told the story enough times--hell, 
		we were just in the car, he was 
		stewing about the fight with buddy 
		while we drove over to roderick 
		bledsoe's--

				sam
		bledso

				hollis
		he owned the colored roadhouse before 
		big o--

				sam
		he still living?

				hollis
		no. i think his widow's still in 
		their place in darktown, though.
			(shakes his bead)
		you think it's charley wade, huh?

				sam
		forensics people are sure of it. you 
		have any idea who might have put him 
		there?

	hollis makes a great show of considering--

				sam
		besides my father, i mean.

				hollis
		there's no call for that, sam. fella 
		made himself a pile of enemies over 
		the years.

				sam
		and buddy was one of them.

				hollis
		we got that dedication tomorrow. 
		this is a hell of a time to be 
		draggin' up old business.

				sam
		people have worked this whole big 
		thing up around my father. if it's 
		built on a crime, they deserve to 
		know. now i understand why you might 
		want to believe he couldn't do it.

				hollis
		and i understand why you might want 
		to think he could.

	this is a low blow, but accurate enough to shake sam.

				sam
		thanks for your time, hollis.

	hollis holds up a double handful of lures--dozens of rubber 
	and plastic worms and shiners and frogs and spinners--

				hollis
		look at all this, would you? my 
		tackle, the boat, all to catch a 
		little old fish just minding its 
		business on the bottom of the lake.

	he gives sam a look--

				hollis
		hardly seems worth the effort--does 
		it, sam? sam walks away--
