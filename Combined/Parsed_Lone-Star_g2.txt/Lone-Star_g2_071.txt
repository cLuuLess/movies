	int. cafe -- night

	sam and pilar sit on chairs next to each other, facing the 
	window, talking softly. the streetlight shining through the 
	letters in the front window makes patterns on their faces

				pilar
		we thought we were something, didn't 
		we?

				sam
		yeah.

				pilar
		i look at my kids in school--tenth, 
		eleventh graders. that's who we were. 
		children.

				sam
		yeah.

				pilar
		i mean what did we know about 
		anything?

				sam
		nothing.

	pilar looks at him--

				pilar
		when nando died--it was so sudden--i 
		was kind of in shock for awhile.   
		then i woke up and there was the 
		whole rest of my life and i didn't 
		have any idea what to do with it.

				sam
		you know the other day, you asked 
		why i came back?

				pilar
		yeah?

				sam
		i came back 'cause you were here.

	pilar nods. she gets up and we follow her across the dark 
	room to the jukebox. she looks at the selections--

				pilar
		my mother hasn't changed the songs 
		since i was 10.

	she puts in a quarter, punches some numbers. a mexican ballad 
	comes on. she crosses back to sam, holds her hand out. he 
	stands to greet her. they slow-dance in the empty cafe--
