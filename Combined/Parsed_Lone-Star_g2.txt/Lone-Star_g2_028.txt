	ext. san jacinto street -- late afternoon

	danny padilla is arguing with h.l. briggs, a construction 
	company big shot, and jorge guerra, a council member in his 
	40s and sam, as they walk down the sidewalk of the main street--

				jorge
		what i'm saying is, i don't see the 
		point. you had your chance when the 
		dedication committee was meeting--

				danny
		i've got new information--

				h.l.
		it's ancient goddarn history, danny--

				danny
		1963, they dam up the north branch 
		to make lake pescadero. a whole little 
		town disappears--

				h.l.
		squatter town--

				danny
		people had been living in perdido 
		for over a hundred years. mexicans 
		and chicanos are deported, evicted, 
		moved forcibly out of their houses 
		by our local hero, buddy deeds, and 
		his department--

				jorge
		there was a bill from the state 
		legislature--

				danny
		families were split apart, a whole 
		community was destroyed--

				h.l.
		they were trespassing, danny--

				danny
		--and who ends up with lakefront 
		property bought for a fraction of 
		the market price? buddy deeds, sheriff 
		of rio county, and his chief deputy, 
		hollis pogue.

	they all look at sam, who has been listening patiently the 
	whole while.  they've reached his office.

				sam
		you finished?

				danny
		look, i'm not after you, sam.  i 
		just think people in town ought to 
		know the full story on buddy deeds.

				sam
			(nods)
		that makes two of us.

	sam steps into his office, leaving h.l. shaking his head--

				h.l.
		you best be thankful that's the son 
		and not the father. buddy woulda 
		kicked your ass from here to sundown.
