	ext. river -- night

	people, crouching low, wade across the river toward us. when 
	he gets close enough to us, we recognize enrique, nervously 
	leading a group of mexican men, women and children to the 
	u.s. side. they are spaced out in the dark, loosely holding 
	the line enrique made in one hand and holding their bundles 
	high away from the water with the other. enrique turns as he 
	hears a woman's cry.  the line goes slack, then nestor steps 
	out of the darkness to join him--

				enrique
		que paso? [what happened?]

				nestor
		anselma cayo en las rocas. creo que 
		la pierna ha sido root--[anselma 
		felt on the rocks. i think her leg's 
		broken--]

	two men struggle forward supporting anselma, trying to hold 
	her leg out straight in front of her. she is in a lot of 
	pain--

				nestor
		no podemos alcanzar el camion llevando 
		a ella. hay lugar para esconderla? 
		[we can't reach the truck if we're 
		carrying her. is there somewhere to 
		hide her?]

	enrique thinks, trying not to panic, as the others come up 
	around him--

				enrique
		conozco solamente una persona con 
		casa--[i only know one person with a 
		house--]

				anselma
			(in pain)
		esta lejos? [is it far?]
