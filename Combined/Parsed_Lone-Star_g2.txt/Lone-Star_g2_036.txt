	int. mikey's workshop -- morning

	we start on a two-foot-high statue of a cowboy made from old 
	bullets and shell casings. we pan past a few others, the 
	poses lifted from frederic remington paintings, till we see 
	mikey, gluing together a work in progress, a remington book 
	propped open in front of him. cliff sits at the worktable 
	playing absently with the old bullets spilled out from mikey's 
	bag

				mikey
		never thought i'd see the day a buddy 
		of mine was dating a woman with three 
		up and three down on her shoulder.

				cliff
		i think it's beyond what you'd call 
		dating.

				mikey
		you going to get married?

				cliff
			(shrugs)
		maybe.

				mikey
		you met her family? they gonna be 
		cool about you being a white guy?

				cliff
		priscilla says they think any woman 
		over 30 who isn't married must be a 
		lesbian. she figures they'll be so 
		relieved i'm a man--

				mikey
		always heartwarming to see a prejudice 
		defeated by a deeper prejudice.  but 
		marriage, man--i did two tours in 
		southeast asia and i was married for 
		five years--i couldn't tell you which 
		experience was worse.

	cliff picks up a slug--

				cliff
		hey, mikey--

				mikey
		i knew she was japanese going into 
		it, but she didn't tell me the ninja 
		assassin part--

				cliff
		mikey--

				mikey
		her parents acted like i was gonna 
		blow my nose on their curtains--

				cliff
		mikey--

				mikey
		if i stayed out past ten with the 
		guys she'd go into her madame 
		butterfly routine--

				cliff
		mikey look at this--

				mikey
		what--it's a bullet. i'm lousy with 
		bullets here.

				cliff
		it's a .45.

				mikey
		yeah?

				cliff
		this is the stuff we picked up the 
		other day, right? the rest of this 
		is all .30 caliber--

				mikey
		they were using m-1's, yeah--

				cliff
		what's it doing on a rifle range?

	mikey holds the slug in front of his face--

				mikey
		we better call that sheriff.
