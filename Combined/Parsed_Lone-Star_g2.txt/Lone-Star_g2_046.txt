	ext. front porch, pilar's house -- night

	pilar sits on her front porch, listening to the music in the 
	distance. a woman singing a mexican love ballad. after a 
	while we hear paloma open the screen door behind her--

				paloma (o.s.)
		mom?

				pilar
		yeah?

				paloma (o.s.)
		you gonna stay out here?

				pilar
		for a while.

	a silence. they listen to the record--

				paloma (o.s.)
		what's she singing about?

				pilar
			(smiles)
		what do you think?

							fade out
