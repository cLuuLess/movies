	int. living room

	sam's ex-wife, bunny kincaid, shuffles across her living 
	room in slippers, crossing to turn off a big-screen tv playing 
	football highlights. bunny wears shorts, a houston oilers 
	sweatshirt and a dallas cowboys cap. the living room is like 
	a sports museum-- signed footballs, team posters, a bookcase 
	filled with tapes of texas pro and college football games--

				bunny
		the longhorns gonna kick some serious 
		butt this saturday, you just watch. 
		we got a kid at tailback from down 
		your way--outta el indio--

				sam (o.s.)
		that's in maverick county.

	she brings us to sam, sitting uncomfortably, beneath a full-
	sized blowup of tony dorsett hurdling a tackler--

				bunny
		oh. right. and you're in--?

				sam
		rio. bunny right. this kid, hosea 
		brown? does tire 40 in 3.4, soft 
		hands, lateral movement--the whole 
		package. only a sophomore--

				sam
		you still going to all the home games?

				bunny
		well, daddy's got his box at the 
		stadium, of course, and i'll fly to 
		the cowboy away games when they're 
		in the conference. then there's the 
		high school on friday' nights. west 
		side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like 
		a cat. high school, we're talkin'. 
		guess how much he can bench-press?

				sam
		bunny, you--uhm--you on that same 
		medication?

				bunny
		do i seem jumpy?

				sam
		no, you look good. i was just 
		wondering.

				bunny
		last year was awful rough--mama 
		passing on and the whole business 
		with o.j.--i mean it's not like it 
		was don meredith or roger staubach 
		or one of our own boys, but it really 
		knocked me for a loop--

				sam
		you look good--

				bunny
		--and that squeaker the aggies dropped 
		to oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in 
		some lucky shit before he kicked 
		that goal--

				sam
		yeah, well--

				bunny
		--they hadn't pulled me off that 
		woman i would have jerked a knot in 
		her.

				sam
		you were in a fight--

				bunny
		daddy calls it an "altercation." how 
		you doing, sam? you look skinny.

				sam
		same weight i always was.

				bunny
		you look awful good in that uniform, 
		though.

				sam
		best part of the job.

				bunny
		daddy hired a pinhead to take your 
		job. he says so himself. says "even 
		my son-in-law was better than this 
		pinhead i got now".

				sam
		bunny, is that stuff i left in the 
		garage still there?

				bunny
		least he never called me that. with 
		me, it was always "high-strung." "my 
		bunny might have done something with 
		her life, she wasn't so high-strung." 
		or "tightly wound," that was another 
		one. you seeing anyone?

				sam
		no. you?

				bunny
		yeah. sort of. daddy rounds 'em up. 
		you aren't talking about money, their 
		beady little eyes go dead.

				sam
		you didn't--uhm--you didn't have one 
		of your fires, did you? the stuff i 
		left in the garage--some of it was 
		my father's--

				bunny
		you watch the draft this year? 'course 
		you didn't, idiot question. they try 
		to make it dramatic, like there's 
		some big surprise who picks who in 
		the first round? only they been 
		working it over with their experts 
		and their computers for months. 
		doctor's reports, highlight reels, 
		coaches' evaluations, psychological 
		profiles--hell, i wouldn't be 
		surprised if they collected stool 
		samples on these boys, have 'em 
		analyzed. all this stuff to pick a 
		football player for your squad. 
		compared to that, what you know about 
		the person you get married to don't 
		amount to diddly, does it?

				sam
		suppose not.

				bunny
		you kind of bought yourself a pig in 
		a poke, didn't you, sam? all that 
		time we were first seeing each other 
		you didn't know i was tightly wound--

				sam
		it wasn't just you, bunny.

				bunny
		no, it wasn't, was it? you didn't 
		exactly throw yourself into it heart 
		and soul, did you?

	she looks at him for an uncomfortably long moment--

				bunny
		your shit's still in the garage if 
		that's what you came for.

	sam nods, stands. bunny is in tears--

				bunny
		350 pounds.

				sam
		what?

				bunny
		this boy from west side, plays tackle 
		both ways. bench-presses 350 pounds. 
		you imagine having that much weight 
		on top of you? pushing down? be hard 
		to breathe. hard to swallow.

				sam
		i think they have another fella there 
		to keep it off your chest. a spotter.

				bunny
		"i only got my little girl now," he 
		says, "she's my lifeline." then he 
		tells me i can't be in the box anymore 
		if i can't control myself. sonofabitch 
		don't even watch the damn game, just 
		sits there drinking with his bidness 
		friends, look up at the tv now and 
		then. i do better to sit in the cheap 
		seats with some real football people.

				sam
			(edging out)
		you look good, bunny. it's nice to 
		see you.

				bunny
			(smiles)
		thanks. i like it when you say that, 
		sam.
