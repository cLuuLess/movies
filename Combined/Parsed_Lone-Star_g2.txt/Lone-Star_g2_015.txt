	int. sheriff's office -- night -- shadow

	shadow, face bruised, hands cuffed behind him, is pushed in 
	through the door to be booked.

				shadow
		i hope the sucker does die, man! 
		mess with me, that's what you get!

	sam steps in behind him and meets his chief deputy ray 
	hernandez, coming from the other direction.

				ray
		hospital says the other kid is in 
		bad shape--

				sam
			(glances ahead)
		the shooter local?

				ray
			(shakes his bead)
		down from houston. i think he knew 
		the girl before.

				sam
		okay--we'll take a statement from 
		all the gis before they go back to 
		post. you can get the story from 
		otis over at the club.

				ray
		any poop on the john doe you found 
		out there today?

				sam
		nothin' much. the rangers put ben 
		wetzel on it. catch you later.

	as ray steps out, pilar looking distraught, walks into the 
	station, passing right by sam without seeing him.

	cu sam

	wonders what she's doing there--

	sam's pov -- pilar

	she stands by an unoccupied reception desk, very upset, unable 
	to attract anyone's attention because of the activity around 
	the shooting.  she looks tired and a bit scared under the 
	harsh overhead light.

				sam (o.s.)
		pilar.

	pilar and sam

	pilar looks around. sam is standing by her. we can tell there 
	is some history between these two.

				sam
		something wrong?

				pilar
		they've got my amado.

				sam
		got him here?

				pilar
		somebody called--something about an 
		electronics store.

				sam
		i'll see what's going on.

	he starts away, stops, comes back--

				sam
		i was--i was real sorry about nando. 
		he was a good fella. we haven't talked 
		since.

				pilar
		we haven't talked since high school.

				sam
		yeah. i'll go check on your boy.

	pilar watches sam go--

	rear of office

	travis sits typing away at a word processor as athena, in 
	tears, gives testimony.

				athena
		--so richie just didn't say nothin' 
		'cause he didn't want to get into 
		it, see, and the next thing i know 
		there's shots and richie is down. it 
		happened so fast--

				sam (o.s.)
		excuse me--

	we widen to see sam standing over the desk--

				sam
		we got some boys you run in earlier 
		today?

				travis
		yeah. i pulled the bunch that hangs 
		at pico bernal's place. we finally 
		caught them with something.

				sam
		you got a juvenile with 'ern--amado 
		cruz?

	travis looks at his booking sheets--

				travis
		yeah--let's see--the other ones say 
		he wasn't in on the theft, he just 
		knows how to hook things up. we've 
		been trying to contact a parent.
