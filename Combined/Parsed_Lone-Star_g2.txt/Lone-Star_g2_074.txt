	int. cafe -- morning

	hollis is sitting alone in a booth, working on some heuvos 
	rancheros.  sam slides in across from him--

				sam
		morning, hollis.

				hollis
		sam! quite a do the other day. it 
		meant a lot to folks that you said 
		something.

				sam
		you thought any more about our murder?

				hollis
		we have a murder?

				sam
		charley wade.

				hollis
		i wish i could tell you i remembered 
		something new, but i can't.

				sam
		i got an idea what happened.

				hollis
		do you?

				sam
		i think somewhere between roderick 
		bledsoe's club and his house, wade 
		ran into buddy deeds. i think buddy 
		put a bullet in him, waited for him 
		to die, threw him in the trunk of 
		the sheriff's car and drove him out 
		by the army post, i think he buried 
		him under four feet of sand and never 
		looked back.

	hollis sits back to look sam in the eye--

				hollis
		you lived in the man's house what--
		seventeen, eighteen years? and you 
		didn't get to know him any better 
		than that?

				sam
		i got to go see somebody in san 
		antonio today. your memory gets any 
		better, i'll be back tonight.

	sam stands and walks away. we hold on hollis, his appetite 
	gone--
