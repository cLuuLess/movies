	int. del's office -- day

	athena stands at attention as del sits at his desk, reviewing 
	her record. he lets her stand for a long time before speaking--

				del
		private johnson, are you unhappy in 
		the army?

				athena
		no, sir--

				del
		then how would you explain the fact 
		that out of one hundred twenty people 
		we tested, you're the only one who 
		came up positive for drugs?

				athena
		i'm sorry, sir.

				del
		when you were given the opportunity 
		to enlist, a kind of contract was 
		agreed upon. i think the army has 
		honored its part of that agreement.

				athena
		yes, sir--

				del
		do you believe in what we're doing 
		here, private johnson?

				athena
		i-i can do the job, sir.

				del
		you don't sound too enthusiastic.

				athena
		i am, sir.

				del
		what exactly do you think your job 
		is, private?

				athena
		follow orders. do whatever they say.

				del
		who's "they"?

				athena
		the--the officers.

				del
		and that's the job? nothing about 
		serving your country?

	athena is confused, hesitates to speak--

				del
		these aren't trick questions, private. 
		you'll be given an article 15 and be 
		going into the adcap program one way 
		or the other. what happens after 
		that is up to you. i'm just trying 
		to understand how somebody like you 
		thinks.

	silence--

				del
		well?

				athena
			(hesitant)
		you really want to know, sir?

				del
		please.

				athena
		it's their country. this is one of 
		the best deals they offer.

	del knows he asked for it, but doesn't like the answer--

				del
		how do you think i got to be a 
		colonel?

				athena
		work hard, be good at your job. sir. 
		do whatever they tell you.

				del
		do whatever they tell you--

				athena
		i mean, follow orders, sir.

				del
		with your attitude, private, i'm 
		surprised you want to stay in the 
		service.

				athena
		i do, sir.

				del
		because it's a job?

				athena
			(struggling)
		outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--

				del
		chaos.

	athena is sure she's overstepped her rank--

				del
		why do you think they let us in on 
		the "deal"?

				athena
		they got people to fight. arabs, 
		yellow people, whatever. might as 
		well use us.

				del
		do you think you've been discriminated 
		against on this post?

				athena
		no, sir. not at all.

				del
		any serious problems with your 
		sergeant or your fellow soldiers?

				athena
		no, sir. they all been real straight 
		with me.

	del stands, thinking, trying not to bullshit her--

				del
		it works like this, private--every 
		soldier in a war doesn't have to 
		believe in what he's fighting for.  
		most of them fight just to back up 
		the soldiers in their squad--you try 
		not to get them killed, try not to 
		get them extra duty, try not to 
		embarrass yourself in front of them.

	he is right in her face now--

				del
		why don't you start with that?

				athena
		yes, sir.

				del
		you're dismissed, private.

				athena
		thank you, sir.

	athena salutes, steps out. del looks out the window, troubled 
	by the encounter.
