	ext. truck

	young hollis strolls around the truck as if he's considering 
	buying it.  he reaches in and flicks the radio off--

				eladio
		not much, jefe. some watermelons.

				wade
		i heard somebody been haulin' wets 
		on this road.

				eladio
		i haven't seen anybody doing that.

				wade

		cut that big gringo sheriff in on it--
		he can run his own operation 'thout 
		any help. como se llama, amigo?

				eladio
		eladio cruz.

				wade
		you know this road got a bad 
		reputation, eladio--

	arroyo -- chucho

	young chucho pecks over the edge to see what's happening.

				eladio
		reputation?

				wade
		bandidos, injuns--

	closer -- men

	hollis wanders over to stand by wade--

				wade
		there's many an unfortunate soul 
		been ambushed out on this stretch. 
		hope you're carrying some protection.

				eladio
		protection?

				wade

		lie to me now.

				eladio
		si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--

				wade
		just a shotgun, huh? better let me 
		take a look at that.

	eladio opens the truck door and digs under the seat. wade 
	winks to hollis, then turns and blam! shoots eladio through 
	the head. hollis jumps back startled and horrified--

				young hollis
		oh no--oh jesus--oh my lord--

				wade
		little greaser sonofabitch been 
		running a goddarn bus service. think 
		he can make a fool out of charley 
		wade! get them wets outta the back, 
		hollis, see what we've got--

	cu chucho

	squatting in a ball to make himself as small as possible, 
	eyes covered with his hands.

				young hollis (o.s.)

				wade (o.s.)
		you got a talent for statin' the 
		obvious, son muchachos! venga 
		afuera!brazos arribas! [come on out! 
		hands up!]

	young chucho hears footsteps approaching. we pan as he looks-- 
	a man's boots appear at the top of the arroyo. we tilt up to 
	see a sheriff, backlit, then crane to see it is sam, back in 
	the present looking over the site, troubled. his car sits on 
	the empty road behind him. he frowns, turns to go--
