	int. country and western bar -- afternoon

	c&w music playing, the regulars starting to show up. sam 
	makes his way to a table where ben wetzel, a texas ranger, 
	sits with a file of forensic reports.

				ben
		sam the man.

				sam
		hey, ben. thanks for coming down.

	they shake, sam sits.

				ben
		how's business?

				sam
		business is booming. got your drugs, 
		got your illegals--had a shooting 
		the other night at big o's--soldier 
		got ventilated.

				ben
		i hear they're closing that post 
		down.

				sam
		september '97, that's all she wrote.

				ben
		gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this 
		county.

				sam
		yeah, we'll have folks swimming over 
		to mexico to work in the sweatshops.

	sam looks at the folder of reports.

				sam
		that the word on our boy?

				ben
		yeah, this is skinny.

				sam
		skinny?

				ben
		we find a body, it's either skinny 
		or stinky, depending on how much 
		meat there is on the bones.

				sam
		nice job.

				ben
			(opens folder)
		male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot-
		eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get 
		into the dental records--

				sam
		charley wade.

				ben
			(nods)
		that badge--

				sam
		--it didn't come out of a cereal 
		box.

				ben
		yeah.

				sam
		you know the popular version of how 
		he left town.

				ben
		everybody on the border knows that 
		story.

				sam
		you got a cause of death?

				ben
		skull was intact, no soft tissue 
		left--not much to go on.

				sam
		so he could have gone out to the 
		base, hopped the fence, dug down 
		into the dirt on the old rifle range 
		and had a heart attack.

	ben smiles, closes the folder--

				ben
		you uhm--you remember what old buddy 
		carried for a side arm?

				sam
		colt peacemaker.

				ben
		a .45--

				sam
		he swore by it.
			(ben frowns)
		what?

				ben
		just wondering.

				sam
		so is buddy on your short list?

				ben
		if it was some poor mojado, swam 
		across at night, got lost in the 
		scrub and starved out there, we 
		wouldn't go any further. but this is 
		a formerly prominent citizen.

				sam
		you got to investigate. no question 
		about it.

				ben
		what i will do is keep names out of 
		it till we got some answers or hit a 
		dead end. you know how the press is 
		with a murder story--even if it's 
		forty years old.

				sam
		yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.

	they sit in awkward silence for a moment. ben feels bad about 
	it.

				ben
		i remember charley wade come to my 
		father's hardware store once when i 
		was a little boy. i'd heard stories 
		how he shot this one, how he shot 
		that one--man winked at me and i 
		peed in my pants.
			(shakes his head)
		winked at me.
