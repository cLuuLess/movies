	ext. drive-in movie -- night

	it is 1972. an early-'70s cheezy action picture (filipino 
	women-in-chains or biker flick is playing. we tilt down to a 
	man's boots crunching across the gravel of the parking area. 
	now and then, the man turns a flashlight beam on a license 
	plate. the cars are all pre-'72, lots of pickups, and the 
	patrons are almost all teenagers. some have turned their 
	pickups around to sit on the tailgate and watch, while others 
	have set lawn furniture out to sit on. we tilt up slightly 
	to see the glint of a rio county sheriff's badge pinned on 
	the man's shirt. he meets a deputy coming in the other 
	direction. both train their flashlights on the license of 
	the car we see in the b.g. between them.  we tilt and rack 
	to see that nobody is visible through the window--

				buddy (o.s.)
		let's go.

	we follow buddy up to the driver's side of the car as the 
	deputy goes to the passenger side. we pan with buddy's hand 
	down to the door handle--he grabs it, flings it open--the 
	overhead light flicks on and there lie young sam and pilar, 
	teenagers, half their clothes off and just about to close 
	the deal. pilar screams and the deputy throws the door open 
	by their heads--

				buddy
		goddammit!

	buddy grabs sam's ankles and yanks him out of the car onto 
	the ground as the deputy awkwardly pulls pilar, out the other 
	side--

				young sam
		what the hell are you doing? you 
		fucking asshole!

				buddy
		how old is that girl? goddammit, 
		where's your goddam sense?

				young pilar (o.s.)
		let me go!  pendejo!

				young hollis (o.s.)
		come on now, missy, get your clothes 
		in order--

	sam is trying to kick and punch at his father, pausing in 
	between to pull his pants up. people are booing and honking 
	their horns all around--

				young sam
		you got no fuckin' right! you stay 
		out of my fuckin' life!

				buddy
		gimme the keys--gimme the goddamn 
		car keys, son--

				young hollis (o.s.)
		what am i s'posed to do with her, 
		buddy?

				buddy
		you drive her home and tell her mother 
		where we found her--

				young pilar (o.s.)
		sam!

	the kids are dragged forward into the headlights that are 
	being turned on to see what the ruckus is. both are crying, 
	struggling--

				young sam
		you leave her the fuck alone!

				buddy
		you just shut that filthy mouth, 
		son. i'll deal with you when we get 
		home--

				young pilar
		please, don't tell my mother! she's 
		gonna kill me!

	they step closer into the glaring headlights which white out 
	the scene, then fade.
