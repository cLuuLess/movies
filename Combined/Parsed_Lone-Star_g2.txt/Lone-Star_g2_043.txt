	ext. sam's house -- night

	sam, out of uniform, stands behind his little house chucking 
	fallen pecans out into the dark, thinking, listening to the 
	night sounds.

	cu sam

	working something out in his head. he looks off into the 
	dark and we pan with his gaze--a man steps toward us, barely 
	visible in the darkness. it is charley wade--we're in sam's 
	reverie, in 1957--

				wade
		who is that? come out here where i 
		can see you!

	blam! a gunshot, and wade falls to his knees--

				wade
		you sonofabitch--

	wade falls on his face. a flashlight beam flicks on and plays 
	over his body. we pan back along the be to see buddy, 
	holstering his pistol. he hears something, swings the 
	flashlight up.

	sam

	we are back in 1995. sam is blasted in the face with a 
	flashlight beam--

				patrolman (o.s.)
		hold it right there! brazos  arriba! 
		sam, squinting toward the light to 
		see who it is, raises his hands over 
		his head--

				zack (o.s.)
		get that thing off 'im! he's one of 
		ours--

				sam
		zack?

	the flashlight beam pans away and zack pollard, a border 
	patrol agent, steps out of the dark to sam--

				zack
		hey sam. sorry 'bout that.

				sam
		what's up?

				zack
		we had about a dozen wets come over 
		just upriver. they ran into one of 
		our posts--it was like a breakshot 
		on a pool table, illegals runnin' 
		every which way.

				sam
		i haven't seen anybody come by.

				zack
		we'll get 'em--
			(looks around)
		so you livin' out here now?

				sam
		yeah. it's quiet--

				zack
		i heard about that deal for your 
		father--you must be real proud.

				sam
		sure.

				zack
		the stories people tell, he was a 
		real colorful fella--

				patrolman (o.s.)
		zack! we got one!

				zack
		well--back on the clock. you see any 
		of our neighbors from the south, let 
		'em know i'm lookin' for 'em.

				sam
		'night--

	zack steps away.  sam shakes the pecans still in his band, 
	goes back to chucking them--
