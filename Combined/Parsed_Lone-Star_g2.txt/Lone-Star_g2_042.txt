	ext. back patio -- night

	the back light is flicked on and mercedes steps out with her 
	drink in hand, the music audible from inside. she sinks into 
	a recliner. we tighten as she closes her eyes. something 
	rustles out in the dark. mercedes opens her eyes. there is 
	whispering. mercedes sits up and suddenly two men run past 
	the edge of the patio toward the front of the house. mercedes 
	sighs--

				mercedes
		otra vez los mojados--[wetbacks  
		again--]

	mercedes searches to find a portable phone on the patio table, 
	punches a number in--

				mercedes
		hello? border patrol?
