	ext. pilar's house -- morning

	paloma sits on the top step of the porch, reading teen 
	magazines. pilar steps out behind her, dressed casually, and 
	squints at the day--

				paloma
		she finally got in--

				pilar
		it's saturday.

				paloma
		you got in late last night.

				pilar
		yeah. i had uhm--school business.

	paloma gives her a look, then holds a fashion page up for 
	her to see--

				paloma
		can i get this?

				pilar
		nobody really wears that stuff, 
		paloma.

				paloma
		i could name five girls at school 
		who have one just like it--

				pilar
		enough with the clothes--

				paloma
		just 'cause you went to catholic 
		school and wore a uniform.

				pilar
		i only went for my last two years.

				paloma
		how come?

				pilar
		oh, my mother wanted to keep me away 
		from away from boys.

	pilar steps out into the sun--

				paloma
		did it work?
