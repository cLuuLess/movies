	int. classroom -- army base -- day -- cu athena

	athena stands at attention, trying to keep her composure--

				cliff (o.s.)
		so you knew this young man before?

				athena
		from back in houston. we both come 
		up on fifth street.

				priscilla (o.s.)
		did you know he was going to be there 
		last night?

				athena
		if i had i wouldn't have gone in.

				priscilla (o.s.)
		and you and private graves--

				athena
		we were just dancing--

	wider

	cliff leans against a desk, a blackboard covered with radar 
	diagrams behind him. priscilla sits nearby, both of them 
	focused on athena.

				priscilla
		we're not running a dating service 
		here.

				athena
		i know that, sergeant. we were just 
		dancing. there was a bunch of us 
		there. shadow just come down looking 
		for trouble.

				cliff
		it's not our job to get involved in 
		your personal life, but when it 
		interferes with the training here--

				athena
		i'm sorry, sergeant major. there 
		wasn't anything i could do. shadow 
		gets crazy--

	a silence as the sergeant lets her stew for a moment. she 
	works up her courage--

				athena
		sergeant major? how is richie doing? 
		private graves?

				cliff
		he'll live.

				priscilla
		he'll be transferred to a military 
		hospital as soon as he's stabilized--

				cliff
		he'll probably be getting a medical 
		discharge--

				athena
		out of the army?

				cliff
		he's going to lose a lung. this is 
		not good news for athena--

				athena
		will this go on my record?

	cliff considers for a long moment--

				cliff
		if the incident happened the way you 
		say it did, there hasn't been an 
		infraction.

				athena
		thank you, sergeant major.

				cliff
		you're dismissed.

				athena
		thank you, sergeant major.

	athena steps out of the room. cliff sits on the desk--

				priscilla
		you spoil 'em, cliff.

				cliff
		hey--she's in a tough situation. i 
		cut her some slack--

				priscilla
		but i'm the one in charge of her 
		sorry ass.

				cliff
		she's pulled herself out of a pretty 
		rough neighborhood.

	crossing to the door--

				priscilla
		and if she isn't careful she's gonna 
		slide right back into it.
