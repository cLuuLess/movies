38 int. the ivy - day 38 
it's busy.  lots of customers arriving, leaving and 
seated at tables.  waiters criss-cross the terrace.  near 
the entrance, rachel is saying goodbye to a middle-aged 
woman.  frank stands nearby with nicki.  the woman says 
something to rachel, who turns and looks at frank. 
rachel whispers something to the woman and they both 
laugh.  they kiss and rachel moves toward the entrance.

woman 
(an afterthought; 
 phony) 
goodbye, nicki.  so great to see you. 
nicki waves and follows rachel.  frank stays very close 
without seeming to walk with rachel. 
a little girl darts into their path and approaches rachel. 
rachel glances at frank, who has stopped with her, then 
she signs an autograph for the girl.  the girl's mother, 
close behind her, hands a small camera casually to nicki 
to be photographed as she and her daughter pose with 
rachel.  frank watches nicki quietly comply. 
rachel, spector and frank all reach the front entrance 
together, and frank slips out first, glancing around. 
rachel comes out and passes within inches of him. 
rachel 
i'm surprised you didn't plug them.
