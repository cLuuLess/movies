23 int. room - day 23 
frank follows spector and devaney into the room.  he 
glances around, taking in the murals, the decor, the 
kitsch attempt at fornicatorial splendour right from 
the pages of a tabloid layout. 
frank 
is this her bedroom? 
spector 
yes. 
devaney 
no.  she sleeps in a room next to 
fletcher's down the hall.  sy had 
this done for a magazine layout, 
spector 
'superstars in their boudoirs.'
23. 
did you see it? 
frank 
no. 
devaney 
rachel never liked it. 
spector 
she didn't have to like it... 
devaney gently lays the cut-out letter on the bed. 
devaney 
we found the letter here. 
frank 
somebody was in here? 
devaney 
somebody broke in and ... 
masturbated on the bed. 
frank 
and she doesn't know about this 
either? 
devaney shakes his head. 
spector 
are you kidding?  this would really 
freak her out. 
devaney 
what do you think? 
frank 
someone penetrates the house, gets 
upstairs and jerks off on the bed 
... i'd say that qualifies as a 
problem. 
devaney 
what kind of problem? 
spector 
(agitated) 
of fuck, we don't need this now... 
frank 
this house is wide open.  
spector 
excuse me? 
frank 
i said this house is wide open
24. 
and you people have no clue what 
real security is or what it takes 
to achieve it. 
devaney 
(does a quick read 
 on frank) 
frank, i totally respect what 
you're telling me.  tell me how 
you want to work and i'll 
accommodate you. 
frank 
look, i can't protect her.  i won't 
be responsible for her safety if 
she doesn't know what's going on. 
devaney 
i'll talk to her, i'll make her 
understand.  i can do that. 
spector 
no.  i'll talk to her. 
spector exits the room in a huff.
