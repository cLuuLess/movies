7 ext. charity concert - evening 7 
a blur of hands and faces.  excited fans.  pieces of paper, 
autograph books, notes are thrust forward into the camera. 
again, a mass chanting "rachel!  rachel!  rachel!" 
hands of rachel's entourage accept some of the proffered 
items. 
in closeup, we see rachel's hands signing "best wishes,
4. 
rachel marron" on an out-stretched open palm.  in the 
midst of the urgent forest of hands and paper, a be- 
ribboned black doll is thrust forward, bearing the legend 
"rachel, we love you."
