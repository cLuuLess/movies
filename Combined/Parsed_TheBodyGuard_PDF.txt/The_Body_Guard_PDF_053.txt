the mob reacts to the sight of the approaching limo which 
turns into the parking area and heads for the backstage. 
faces of the fans are at the windows leering at rachel. 
many are grotesquely painted.  some go into a wild frenzy 
as rachel's limo pulls up.  there is a punch-up and a man 
is beaten back.  someone has a video camera.  its quartz 
light shines in through the limo windows.  everybody 
squints at the glare.
