61 int. onstage - night 61 
a lone mike stands onstage.  the crowd's growing im- 
patient.  a rhythmic clapping begins.  devaney walks 
timidly onstage.  he's not happy to be there.  he reaches 
the mike and taps it with a finger. 
devaney 
excuse me... hello... i've got 
an announcement to make.  i'm 
sorry but... due to circumstances 
beyond... 
voices shout.  "where's rachel?"... a groan begins. 
a chorus of boos fills the room.  he raises his hands.
51.
