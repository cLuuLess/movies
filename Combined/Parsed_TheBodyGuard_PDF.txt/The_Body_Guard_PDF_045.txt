47 ext. marron estate - gate/guard house - day 47 
in a big closeup on a black and white tv screen, we see 
devaney's immaculate convertible mercedes 500sl as it 
roars up the drive.  frank, henry and fletcher watch in 
the newly-erected guard house.  the area is greatly 
changed.  there is a uniformed guard with an impressive 
array of switches, lights and phones at his command. 
there are several tv screens; one of them shows a series 
of endlessly-panning shots from cameras at the rear of
38. 
the grounds.  on the other, the mercedes kicks up dust 
from the last few curves in the drive.  fletcher shakes 
his head.  he's seen it all before. 
henry 
is that devaney? 
fletcher 
(to frank) 
she's got him by the short ones, 
doesn't she, frank? 
frank squelches a smile at henry.  where did he learn 
that? 
frank 
yeah, she makes him nervous. 
they watch as devaney screeches to a stop, gets out and 
hurries inside.
