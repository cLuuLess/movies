2 ext. city street - night 2 
passing traffic reveals the storefront of a tv showroom. 
inside, behind the reflections of the city lights, all 
the tv sets are showing the same picture, the glittering 
image of a woman singing.  (we will recognize the woman 
as rachel marron.)  we cut tighter and tighter on the 
image until it is almost broken up into its scanning 
lines.  through the city noise comes the sound of her 
song "i have nothing." 
2a int. dan's apartment - desk top - night 2a 
a battered old desk.  scattered across the top -- a pile 
of blank white paper, a jar of glue, a stack of 
magazines, a pair of scissors, a tv remote control, 
softly in the b.g., a tv is playing the same image we saw 
in the store window, the same song. 
hands appear.  male hands.  they open a drawer and remove 
a pair of translucent rubber gloves.  carefully they put the 
gloves on.  the snapping of the rubber is the only sound. 
the hands pick a magazine off the stack:  screen stars. 
they put the magazine down and pick up the scissors.  a 
headline on the cover reads:  "rachel marron's greatest 
triumph!"  the scissors start to cut.  meticulously they 
excise the name "rachel marron" from the page.  with the 
care of a surgeon.
