spector, frank, and devaney are there.  rachel seems 
dazed, unfocussed.  devaney hands the note to frank. 
devaney 
he sent another one. 
rachel immediately picks up on this. 
rachel

frank quickly shoots a look at spector. 
frank

devaney

rachel... same kind of thing, 
threats, oddball stuff... 
spector 
we didn't want to worry you... 
devaney 
... and somebody got into the 
house... 
rachel 
(starting to panic) 
someone was in my house? 
spector 
okay.  let's not get hysterical... 
frank 
let's get her out of here. 
rachel 
someone was in my house?  
spector

town... 
rachel 
while fletcher was there? 
spector

house is like fort knox now.  
right, frank?  
frank

spector 
let's just see how she is. 
(to rachel) 
how do you feel, honey? 
someone comes through the door with some flowers.  frank 
eases them out and gently closes the door. 
frank 
i can't protect her out there. 
rachel 
do you think he's out there? 
devaney can't answer.  she turns to frank. 
rachel 
he's here, isn't he? 
frank 
he might be. 
spector

don't know that. 
rachel is enraged. 
rachel

make an announcement. 
spector

the fucking place apart.
