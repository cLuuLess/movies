8 ext. frank farmer's house - evening 8 
slam of a car door.  frank gets out of a cab with two 
suitcases.  his house is a modest stucco affair on a 
small lot.  he goes up the walk and puts down his suit- 
cases.  he looks at rampant foliage and overgrown grass. 
supermarket circulars cover his doorstep.  he picks up a 
few and fishes a bunch of keys from his pocket.  a 
curious neighbor peers from behind a net curtain.  as the 
door opens, we are aware of a further pile of mail 
inside.  frank's feet push the letters aside and go 
inside.  the door shuts.
