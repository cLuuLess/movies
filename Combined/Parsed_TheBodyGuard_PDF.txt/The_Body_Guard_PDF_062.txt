64 int. stage - night 64 
rachel scans the crowd, spread before her like a surreal 
mural. 
camera flashbulbs explode like crazy through the glare. 
the thundering adoration is like a stimulant.  she darts 
a look to frank and gives him a fierce "naughty girl" 
smile. 
rachel 
(turning back to 
 crowd) 
you like that?  would like to 
hear another?  billy?
54. 
from the wings, billy thomas gives her the nod to go for 
it.  it seems to be alright with everyone.  the band 
starts playing a dance beat. 
rachel 
(on the prowl) 
i think my feet are trying to 
tell me something... wanna see a 
new video? 
the crowd explodes.  they know what song is coming. 
they start to move with rachel. 
rachel 
(dancing, talking) 
i want to dance... 
she skitters to the other side of the stage, baiting her 
fans.  her new video explodes across the video wall 
behind her.  the crowd surges forward. 
two security guards nervously tense up, watching the 
crowd.  when one fan tries to climb onstage, frank  
reaches out and unbalances him, so that the man falls 
back into the audience.  another man climbs the stage on 
the other side.  one of the guards darts out like a 
ballboy at a tennis match, pushes the fan back and 
scurries to the far side to resume his vigilance.  the 
crowd is getting even more excited, pressing closer, 
trying to touch rachel. 
the security guards move in, but rachel gestures for 
them to back off. 
angle - frank 
frank's task has suddenly become impossible.  a forest of 
hands and faces start to engulf rachel.  anyone could be 
the killer.  frank's eyes dart over them all, his gaze 
intense, as if trying to hold them off by sheer willpower. 
rachel's pov 
looking offstage at frank.  his frustration is almost 
intoxicating to her.  she struts over the lip of the 
stage.  a man leaps up from audience to join her.  frank 
starts forward.  rachel gestures to him to hold back, 
waving him off.
