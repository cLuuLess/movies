76 int. dan-dee car wash-o-rama (l.a.) - wash tunnel - 76 
day 
the sound is deafening.  a wet car comes out of the 
tunnel of machinery.  in the distance, glimpsed through 
the spinning brushes, henry talks to a couple of workers 
as he waits for the limo to be cleaned. 
hands appear with a large chamois cloth, moving easily 
and fast over the hood and windshield.  a black in his 
early twenties is finishing the exterior of the car. 
a second pair of hands appear.  white hands in rubber 
gloves.  they open the driver's door and push a vacuum 
suction hose inside.  the hands switch on the car radio, 
loud.  loud enough to hear over the din outside the car. 
the hose works its way over the front seats.

... and here's another biggie 
from a lady very much in the news 
these days, miss rachel marron... 
we see the owner of the hands.  it is the young blond 
man frank kicked aside at the mayan.  his name is dan. 
his face is impassive. 
d.j. (v.o.) 
... the hit song from the movie... 
queen of the night... i have 
nothing. 
the song begins and rachel's voice fights the din.  in 
the back of the car, dan's hose probes around, nosing 
into all the crevices of the upholstery.  it sucks up a 
crumpled pre-signed photograph of rachel from the gap 
beside the rear seat.  the hose is switched off and the 
gloved hands retrieve the picture.
