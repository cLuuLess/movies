13 ext. marron estate - waverly lane (bel air) - day 13 
frank stops his nondescript chevy across the quiet street 
from the closed, unmanned gate at the bottom of the marron 
driveway. 
frank's pov 
as he looks over the gate, the wall, the heavy vegetation 
and the rising grounds beyond. 
(note:  the use of the term frank's pov, is not to be 
taken simply as a camera direction.  rather, it re- 
presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in 
the special way frank sees.  frank lives by constant 
vigilance, heightened awareness.  it is his genius and 
his burden.  the audience must be put in the position of 
looking, searching, scanning with him.) 
he has a curious sense of being watched, a kind of prick- 
ling on the back of his neck.  as he looks around, a 
black toyota 4x4, parked some way down the road, drives 
rapidly off -- too fast to get a clear look.  he watches 
it go. 
frank pulls up to the gate and gets out of his car.  he 
grabs a bar of the gate and pulls.  the whole gate 
rattles.  frank gets back in his car and pushes a button 
on the intercom box at the side of the gate.  a man's 
voice crackles out of the box.  transmission is terrible. 
man's voice (v.o.) 
yes? 
frank

man's voice (v.o.)

frank 
alexander graham bell to see miss

man's voice (v.o.) 
(obviously has not heard) 
have you got an appointment? 
frank 
the atomic number of zinc is 30. 
man's voice (v.o.) 
all right. 
there is a loud buzzing and the gate swings arthritically 
open.
