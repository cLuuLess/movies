45 ext. marron estate poolside - day 45 
rachel has been watching fletcher and frank down the 
hill.  now she leans back on the chaise lounge where 
she is sunning, trying to listen to a new song on a 
walkman. 
there is the screeching howl of a drill on metal from 
the direction of the house.  rachel jumps up and yells 
toward the house. 
rachel 
shut up you assholes!
