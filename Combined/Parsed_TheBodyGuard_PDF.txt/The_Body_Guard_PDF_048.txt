we see a man's hands remove a video cassette from its 
sleeve.  the cover reads "rachel marron - the #1 hits." 
the cassette is gently eased into the slot of the video 
player. 
rachel's image appears on the screen, singing softly, 
intensely, passionately into the camera.  we track into 
the image, as if a little hypnotized by it.

frank sits alone in his room, lit by the glow of the tv, 
dressed in a business-style blue suit and tie.  he's 
watching rachel's videos.  scattered around the video 
player are a collection of other rachel marron cd's, 
tapes and videos.  frank has been noting down lyrics on 
the yellow legal pad on his lap.  some of the phrases 
are circled. 
as he watches, we see a subtle change in his expression. 
it is as if he really were looking at rachel for the first 
time, here, watching her sing.  for a second, she seems to 
be singing to him alone, passionate and vulnerable. 
he opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled russian 
orthodox-type cross.  he fastens the clasp, checking that 
it holds, then looks back to the screen.
