12 ext. frank farmer's house - back yard - day 12 
frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree, sun- 
glasses on, a glass of iced tea by his side.  strains of 
"don't walk away renee" come from a beat-up transistor 
radio. 
an old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back 
and forth over the freshly cut grass.  throwing knives 
lay scattered nearby.  a wooden post is sticking out of 
the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard. 
bill devaney, fiftyish, a distinguished-looking black 
gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage frank in a 
conversation that up to this point hasn't been going well. 
he's rachel's personal manager. 
devaney 
so, you won't protect rachel marron 
just because she's in show business? 
frank 
i don't do celebrities. 
devaney 
but the biggest money's in show 
business people. 
frank says nothing.  his eyes are closed behind the sun- 
glasses.  devaney picks up one of the throwing knives. 
he holds it carefully by the blade and throws it.  it 
misses the post by three feet and clatters against the 
fence. 
frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his 
eyes again. 
devaney 
(picking up another 
 knife) 
do you really do these things? 
frank 
isn't she the one who collects 
dolls? 
this is enough to distract devaney from his knife-throwing. 
devaney 
(exasperated) 
farmer, rachel marron is one of the 
most famous people in america.  she's 
won every music award invented.  she's 
got the number one song in the country 
right now and she'll probably be 
nominated for an oscar in her very
6. 
first picture.  and you want to know 
'isn't she the one...?'  christ, 
man, where've you been? 
frank 
you mean she doesn't collect dolls? 
devaney 
(defeated) 
yes.  she collects dolls. 
frank 
i thought i knew who she was. 
devaney tries to size up whether frank is kidding him or 
not.  frank's face betrays nothing.  devaney gestures with 
a knife. 
devaney 
you're probably deadly with these 
things, aren't you? 
frank 
deadly. 
devaney 
show me. 
frank doesn't move. 
devaney 
why are you resisting this job? 
$2,000 bucks a week. 
(no response) 
$2,500. 
frank 
there are several good men 
available for that kind of money. 
have you talked to fitzgerald or 
racine?  portman? 
devaney 
yeah.  portman was interested... 
he senses an opening and sits down beside frank for what 
he takes to be the first serious talk. 
devaney 
... but we're told you're the best. 
frank 
there's no such thing. 
devaney 
farmer, we're talking about a 
very frightened lady.  with a
7. 
seven-year old son.  believe me, 
i wouldn't be here if i didn't 
think this was for real. 
(long pause) 
farmer, she begged me to get you. 
frank sits up finally and looks at devaney a long time. 
he picks up five throwing knives and stands up. 
frank 
all right.  i'll come and i'll look 
the situation over.  if i take it, 
it's three thousand a week. 
devaney 
(whistles) 
okay.  you must be very deadly 
for three grand a week. 
frank is now about twenty feet from the wooden post.  he 
throws one of the knives.  it misses the post and 
clatters against the fence. 
frank 
shit. 
devaney's face drops.  frank examines the next knife. 
frank 
(mumbling) 
i know it's something like... 
the second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc 
and disappears into some bushes about three feet from 
devaney.  devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind 
frank. 
frank 
sorry. 
frank raises his hand to throw again, then stops and 
motions devaney off to the side. 
frank 
better not stand right behind me. 
devaney smiles weakly.  frank lets the third knife go 
with one smooth motion. 
the knife sinks an inch into the center of the post.  thump. 
frank's hand arching again.  throwing the remaining knives. 
both knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical 
line with the first one.
