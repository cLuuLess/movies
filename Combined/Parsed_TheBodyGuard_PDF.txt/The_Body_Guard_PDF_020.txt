22 ext. patio - day 22 
devaney slides the file across the table at frank, open- 
ing it.  inside are letters of every size and condition. 
repeatedly throughout this scene frank's gaze is drawn to 
fletcher, who has started his boat again. 
devaney 
this is just in the last six months. 
frank 
(looks at the pile) 
have you ever tried having these 
professionally assessed? 
devaney shakes his head no. 
frank begins to look through the letters, flipping them by 
the corner of the page.  from many different sources, some 
are scrawled, some typed, some assembled from cutouts. 
many are soiled and torn, others immaculate.  occasionally, 
one will have a photo of rachel with crude markings on it. 
spector enters sucking on a popsicle.  he comes to stand 
over frank's shoulder, peering nonchalantly at the piles 
of letters. 
spector 
devaney says you were in the secret 
service. 
frank nods.
21. 
frank goes through them quickly, with an expert eye.  he 
sometimes pauses to read one more carefully.  a few he 
removes from the stack and places in the center of the 
table. 
spector 
ever guard the main man? 
frank 
i was two years with carter and 
four years with reagan. 
frank sets another letter in the center pile.  he stops, 
smiling at it. 
frank 
this is a little old lady in 
akron.  she's written to 
everybody i've ever worked for. 
he continues to turn until something stops him.  several 
letters are paper-clipped together.  they are the pasted- 
up type we saw being assembled on the desk top. 
spector 
reagan got shot. 
his chatter is beginning to annoy frank. 
frank 
not on my shift. 
spector emits a gratuitous laugh, acknowledges the joke. 
spector 
that's good. 
frank goes back to his letters.  he taps the stack in 
the center of the table. 
frank 
at first glance, these don't 
bother me.  but keep them.  you 
never know. 
he separates one letter from the others. 
frank 
this could be something. 
devaney searches frank's face. 
devaney 
you think it could be the same 
guy?  the one who rigged the doll?
22. 
frank 
i don't know.  did you tell miss 
marron about it?  does she know 
about the doll? 
devaney and spector exchange looks.  this is evidently a 
sore point between them. 
spector 
we said there'd been some electrical 
problem while she was on stage. 
short circuit.  look, she doesn't 
need that kind of worry right now. 
it would upset her. 
frank 
what about the police? 
spector 
there was no reason for the police. 
no one got hurt. 
frank 
what about the chauffeur? 
spector 
it was nothing.  it was just our 
people there. 
frank turns and watches fletcher by the pool.  devaney's 
eyes are still on frank's face. 
devaney 
sy, i think we should show him 
the room.
