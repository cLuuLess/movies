43 ext. marron estate - day 43 
as frank comes through some bushes, he suddenly catches a 
glimpse of the 4 x 4 through the trees.  it starts to 
accelerate. 
as it pulls away (it is too far to record the license 
number), he breaks into a full run toward the other end 
of the property. 
leaping hedges, frank crashes through tropical vegetation. 
crashing through a bamboo forest, he scurries down a 
steep wooded slope toward the road below.  the 4 x 4 can 
be glimpsed through the trees as he runs to head it off.
36. 
a retaining wall about 14 feet high rises from the road 
to the slope.  without a pause, as the car speeds beneath, 
frank leaps and drops the full distance to the road.  the 
4 x 4 roars past just missing him and turns a corner. 
hitting hard, frank allows his knees to take the force of 
the fall, deliberately rolling once before he springs 
into a crouched upright position. 
but the 4 x 4 speeds around a corner and is gone.
