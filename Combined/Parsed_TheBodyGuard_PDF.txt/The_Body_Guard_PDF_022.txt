24 ext. marron house front - day 24 
frank emerges with devaney and crosses toward his car. 
devaney 
...she won't give you any static, 
frank, you've got my word on that. 
frank is still focused on fletcher. 
frank 
sure she will. 
devaney 
so what job's perfect?  you're 
a bodyguard, aren't you? 
slowly, frank faces him. 
frank 
(quietly) 
yeah. 
as they reach the car, devaney is relieved.  he dares a 
perfect smile. 
frank 
devaney, if you ever lie to me 
again, i'll take you apart.
