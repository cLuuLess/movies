11 int. dressing room - closeup - corner of dressing table 11 
lots of people are schmoozing in the dressing room. 
there's a loud buzz of excited chatter.  hands are stack- 
ing flowers, good luck messages, cards and cables by the 
mirror.  through the blur and bustle, we glimpse the doll 
with its embroidered ribbon message "rachel, we love you." 
hands casually move it to one side, among the flowers 
resting on the small portable tv set.  on the screen is 
an image of rachel performing on stage, acknowledging 
applause, bowing. 
the doll explodes, shattering the tv, the mirror and the 
light bulbs. 
the screen goes black, amid shouts, screams and 
confusion. 
titles end.
