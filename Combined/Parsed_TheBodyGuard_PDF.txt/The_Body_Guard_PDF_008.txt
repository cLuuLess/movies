10 int. farmer's kitchen - night 10 
farmer has carefully set a place for himself at the table 
in a breakfast nook.  a bottle of red wine is open with a 
glass beside it. 
at the stove he stirs and flavors a boeuf bourgignon and 
reads a time magazine.  he adds a splash of wine.  he 
lifts the pot from the stove and tries a piece of meat. 
at the table, he looks at the place setting and absently 
eats another piece of meat.  finally he sets the pot on 
the plate and eats from it directly while glancing 
through the magazine.
