25 int. marron mansion - frank's room - day 25 
henry dupres is leaning against the doorjamb.  the room 
is comfortable, a guest bedroom.  frank flops one 
battered suitcase onto the bed and opens it.  he pulls 
open some drawers in the dresser and starts putting away 
his clothes. 
henry 
why'd you say your name was 
edison? 
frank 
i wanted to see how hard it 
was to get in. 
henry 
and it wasn't, was it? 
henry unconsciously flexes his fingers, easing the muscles 
in his hands.  frank notices and pulls out a small tube of 
ointment from a pouch he's unpacking.  he hands it to henry. 
frank 
put this on your arm.  it'll help 
the ache. 
henry takes it but is noncommittal. 
frank 
i'll bet you can fill up a whole 
day just washing the cars and 
driving rachel marron around town. 
henry 
that's my job. 
frank 
we're adding to your duties.  
henry 
huh? 
frank 
you're my new assistant. 
frank removes three boxes of cartridges from the suitcase 
and puts them in the back of a dresser drawer as henry 
watches. 
henry 
says who? 
frank 
henry, i've spent a lot of time 
guarding people all over the world
26. 
and i've found one thing to be 
true.  no matter how incompetent 
the assassins, no matter how much 
they miss their target by, there's 
one person who always gets hit. 
henry 
who? 
frank 
the cocky black chauffeur. 
henry considers this for a moment and smiles. 
over scenes 26-28, we hear the voice of cnn's martin 
grove from "showbiz today." 
martin grove (v.o.) 
it's oscar time again, folks, and 
with academy members marking their 
ballots today for this year's 
nominations; some canny tipsters in 
vegas have announced their picks 
for the awards. 
martin grove (v.o.)(cont'd) 
echoing the prevailing buzz in 
hollywood, the vegas hilton is 
gambling on one sure thing at 
least.  newcomer rachel marron 
is tipped at 3 to 1 to lead this 
year's best actress runners. 
martin grove (v.o.)(cont'd) 
the sultry singer made a notable 
acting debut last fall in queen 
of the night, singing the hit song 
'i have nothing'.  the lady may 
end up eating her words if she 
takes home that statuette march 
20th...
