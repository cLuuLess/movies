26 ext. perimeter of estate - various shots - day 26 
the fortification of the estate begins as frank and 
henry walk the grounds.  frank talks and points, henry 
takes notes on a pad.  frank gestures at the stonework 
of the gate, points at the top of the stone wall along 
waverly lane.  at the tall hedges which separate the 
estate from its neighbors, frank gestures to take in 
the entire length of the hedged border.  henry stops 
in amazement.  frank keeps walking.
