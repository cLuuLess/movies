          father janovich paces back and forth. the squad car
          pulls up to him, which is exactly what he's been afraid
          of all day.

          officer
          sorry, father, we have to go.

          father janovich
          i'm telling you. if we're not
          here, there will be bloodshed.

          officer
          we've been here for hours. we
          can't afford to anchor a unit to
          one location.

          father janovich
          i'm begging you to stay.

          officer
          i just got word from my sergeant,
          we're pulling the plug.

          father janovich
          i'm staying.

          officer
          no you aren't. my orders are
          specific. you came with us,
          you're leaving with us.
          father janovich looks hard at the duplex before getting
          into the squad car. the squad car drives off.
          walt pulls up in front, gets out of his pickup and slams
          the door. he looks at the duplex. it's a total eyesore.

          walt

          (mutters)
          what a goddamned mess. you slopes
          should be ashamed of yourselves.

          walt walks up the sidewalk and stops twenty feet from the
          duplex.
          six very scared, very jittery hmong gangbangers look out
          at walt from various doorways and windows.

          walt
          is that all you swamp rats or is
          there more vermin scurrying in the
          shadows?
          smokie and spider step out and stand on the porch.
          smokie smiles at walt. walt spits on the ground.

          smokie
          i wasn't sure that you'd...

          walt
          shut up, gook. i'm not here to
          listen to one goddamned syllable
          of what a shrimp-dicked little
          baby midget like you has to say.
          spider pulls his pistol.

          walt
          that's right, boy. defend your
          boyfriend after he or you or
          whoever rapes a member of your
          family. your own blood, for
          christ's sake. go ahead, pull
          your pistols, just like a bunch of
          ridiculous miniature toy cowboys.
          smokie and several other hmong gangbangers pull their
          guns.

          walt
          you have no honor. you're the
          scum of the earth and when you're
          gone, do you think anyone will
          care? no one will mourn. you
          won't be missed.
          all the hmong are spooked at walt's absolute lack of
          fear.

          smokie
          where's tao, old man? he too
          scared to come and stick up for
          himself?

          walt
          no. tao is too good for this.
          you pukes aren't worth one second
          of his time.
          walt slowly puts a cigarette in his mouth. even this
          slight movement has the gangbangers waving their pistols
          around.
          walt laughs.

          walt
          you boys are a little bit jumpy.

          spider
          you watch it, old man.

          walt
          no, i think you'd better watch it.
          walt looks around. other than the gangbangers, a small
          group of people have gathered to watch this showdown.
