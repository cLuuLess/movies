          tao is at the top of the ladder. walt and the hmong
          neighbor grin at him from the bottom.

          when you're done caulking the
          siding, nail that gutter back up,
          i can see it right out my kitchen
          window, it's been bugging me for
          three years.
          the neighbor says something in hmong to walt.

          walt
          you said it, brother.
