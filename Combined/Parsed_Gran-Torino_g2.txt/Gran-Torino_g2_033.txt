          the doorbell rings. walt opens it to find father
          janovich standing on his front step.

          father janovich
          good afternoon, walt.
          walt's eyes narrow.

          father janovich
          i mean, mr. kowalski.

          walt
          i already told you i'm not going
          to confession.

          father janovich
          why didn't you just call the
          police?

          walt
          pardon?

          father janovich
          i do work with some of the hmong
          gangs and i heard there was some
          trouble in the neighborhood. why
          didn't you call the police?

          walt
          oh, i prayed for them to show up,
          but guess what? no answer.

          father janovich
          what were you thinking? someone
          could have been killed. we're
          talking life and death here.

          walt
          not that it's any of your
          goddamned business, but when
          things happen quickly like that,
          you have to react. in korea, we
          never Â‘called the police' when a
          swarm of screaming gooks came
          pouring into our lines. we
          reacted.

          father janovich
          we're not in korea, mr. kowalski.
          walt says nothing.

          father janovich
          i've been thinking about our
          discussion on life and death.
          about what you said. about how
          you carry around the horrible
          things you were forced to do.
          horrible things that won't leave
          you. it seems that it would do
          you good to unload some of that
          burden. things done during war
          are terrible, being ordered to
          kill, killing to save others,
          killing to save yourself. you're
          right, those are things i don't
          know anything about. but i do
          know about forgiveness. and i've
          seen a lot of men who have
          confessed their sins, admitted
          their guilt and left their burdens
          behind them. stronger men than
          you. men at war who were ordered
          to do appalling things and are now
          at peace.
          walt nods. father janovich threw a bull's-eye. almost.

          walt
          i'm impressed. you came with your
          guns loaded, for once.

          father janovich
          thank you.

          walt
          you have balls, father. and what
          you said, you're right. i'm sure
          stronger men than me have found
          their salvation. hallelujah. but
          there's one thing you're way wrong
          about.

          father janovich
          what's that, mr. kowalski?

          walt
          the thing that haunts a guy is the
          stuff he wasn't ordered to do.
