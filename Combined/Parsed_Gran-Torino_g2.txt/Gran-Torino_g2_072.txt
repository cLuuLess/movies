          walt and tao look at the freezer strapped to the dolly.

          walt
          i just need a little push. all
          the weight is up top, so you stay
          down and give me a little shove at
          each step.

          tao
          let me take the top.

          walt
          naw, i got it.

          tao
          no really, i'll take the top. it
          looks pretty heavy.

          walt
          i'm not crippled. i got it.

          tao
          if you don't let me take the top,
          i ain't helping. i'll go home.

          walt
          listen, zipper head, now's not the
          time to go and...

          tao
          you listen, old man. you came and
          got me because you needed help, so
          let me help you. either it's top
          or i'm out of here.
          walt studies tao for a second. tao doesn't blink, he
          holds his ground. walt nods, trying not to grin.

          okay then, be my guest. just
          don't let it slip out of your
          little girl hands and crush me.
          tao laughs.

          tao
          don't give me any ideas.
