          walt sits at the bar in the vfw (veterans of foreign
          wars) drinking with the old buddies and cracking off-
          color jokes.

          walt
          i got one. a mexican, a jew and a
          colored guy walk into a bar, the
          bartender looks up at them and
          says -- Â‘get the fuck out.'
          the gang laughs, until they see father janovich step up
          to the bar. he smiles as he recognizes several faces.

          father janovich
          so, here's where my flock
          congregates when they're not in
          church.

          father janovich
          hi, mel. hey there, darrel.

          darrel
          hello, father.

          father janovich
          hi, walt.
          walt says nothing. he just sips his beer.

          darrel
          what brings you in here, father?
          the meat raffle?

          father janovich
          no. i came down to talk to walt,
          if that's okay.
          mel and darrel look at walt. it puts him on the spot.

          walt
          i have to hand it to you, padre.
          you are persistent.

          father janovich
          i promised your wife.
          walt looks over at mel and darrel and then back at father
          janovich.

          walt
          oh jesus christ, let's grab a
          booth.
