          walt sits amongst several old hmong women, who take great
          delight in feeding him different hmong dishes which he's
          obviously never tasted before.
          walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food,
          occasionally making jokes like he's choking, etc. this
          corny stuff goes over like gangbusters with the hmong
          ladies.
          sue comes in and rolls her eyes at walt.

          sue
          come on, you glutton, let's go
          downstairs.

          walt
          why?

          sue
          to mingle.

          walt
          i'm fine right here. i'm
          mingling.

          sue
          come on, you said Â‘not to leave
          you alone.'
