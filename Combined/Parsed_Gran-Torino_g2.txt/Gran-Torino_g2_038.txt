          walt drinks coffee and reads the newspaper. he flips
          from section to section. daisy's at his feet.
          next door, phong sits watching walt. he can see her
          mumbling under her breath.

          walt
          old hag, giving me the evil eye?
          walt opens the paper to the tv guide section and lingers
          at the horoscopes for a second.

          walt
          aw, what the hell...
          walt reads aloud to himself.

          walt
          your birthday today; this year you
          have to make a choice between two
          life paths. second chances come
          your way. extraordinary events
          culminate in what might seem to be
          an anti-climax. your lucky
          numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and

          99.
          walt drains his coffee and tosses the paper onto the
          porch.

          walt
          what a load of crap.
          walt lights up a cigarette and exhales.
          walt watches as the only white woman on the block
          struggles to unload her groceries from her car. one of
          her bags rips.

          three teenagers walk past and laugh at her spilled
          groceries. one of them makes a crude gesture behind her
          back.

          walt
          christ all friday. what's wrong
          with kids today?
          walt gets up to go help, but before he can get to the
          sidewalk, another neighbor has gone over to help...
          it's tao. tao bends down and carries her bags up to her
          door.

          walt
          well, i'll be damned.
