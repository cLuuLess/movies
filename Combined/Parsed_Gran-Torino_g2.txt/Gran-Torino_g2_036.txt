          sue walks with her ridiculous wigger (urban white kid)
          boyfriend, trey. trey wears big baggy pants, a sports
          jersey and an oakland raiders visor upside-down and
          backwards.
          they walk past three black guys leaning against a
          building. the tall black guy spots sue and smiles.

          tall black guy
          hey, girl, you come over here and
          talk to me. come on, baby, don't
          be shy.
          trey and sue move as far over on the sidewalk as they can
          to avoid the black guys. they try to ignore them.

          tall black guy
          come on, sweetie, don't be like
          that. you talk to me, don't be
          all stuck up and shit.

          across the street
          walt waits at a stoplight. he watches sue and trey and
          the three black guys who block their path.
          one black guy flips trey's visor onto the ground. the
          tall guy makes kissy faces at sue as he touches his
          crotch.
          walt sits there for a second; he shouldn't help, but walt
          solves every situation by being aggressive.
          walt drives off, then makes a u-turn.
          the tall black guy now focuses on trey.

          tall black guy
          what are you sposed to be?
          trey puts up his hand to hi-five. the tall black guy
          just looks at him.

          trey
          yo, it's cool, dog.

          tall black guy
          what the fuck are you doing in my
          neighborhood, boy?

          trey
          nothing. we're going to red roost
          to get some cds. that place is
          trippin', bro.

          tall black guy
          what you call me, you fucking with
          me, bitch? you think you're
          funny?

          trey
          nothing. no.

          tall black guy
          i'm warning you, boy. what you
          all come up in here for? you here
          to bring me this present?

          trey
          huh?

          tall black guy
          this oriental yummy for me? don't
          worry, i'll take good care of her.

          sue
          great, another asshole with a
          fetish for asian girls. god, it
          gets so old.

          tall black guy
          what's your name, girl?

          sue
          my name? it's take your crude,
          overly obvious come-on to every
          woman who walks past and cram it.'
          that's my name.

          tall black guy
          you should keep your bitch on a
          leash, put a choke chain on this
          whore and yank.

          sue
          oh, of course, right to the
          stereotype thesaurus. call me
          whore' and bitch' in the same
          sentence.

          the tall black guy grabs sue by the arm. trey moves
          slightly towards sue and is pushed down into a pile of
          garbage.

          tall black guy
          you think you're pretty funny,
          don't you?

          sue
          what, are you gonna hit me now?
          that'd pretty much complete the
          picture.
          the tall black guy pushes sue hard against the wall.

          tall black guy
          you don't know when to quit.
          the old, black pickup pulls up and stops next to them.
          sue, trey and the black guys look over.
          walt sits behind the wheel, he looks right through the
          tall black guy.

          tall black guy
          what the fuck you looking at, old
          man?

          walt
          you... and your buddies. what's
          the matter with you? don't any of
          you work? i see you lazy show-
          offs in the middle of the day,
          slowly walking across the street
          or harassing women. nobody owes
          you bastards anything so go out
          and get a job instead of pushing
          little girls around, for christ's
          sake.

          tall black guy
          why don't you get the fuck out of
          here, while i'll still let you.

          black guy #2
          that's right, bitch.

          walt
          what makes you spooks think you
          can bully a couple kids with
          impunity?

          tall black guy
          what?! are you fucking crazy?

          walt
          look at me, slick. you're crazy
          if you thinking i'm fooling
          around.

          tall black guy
          you are fucking crazy.

          walt
          you have to be pretty goddamned
          dumb to think you can push people
          around without running into
          someone who will push back.
          the black guys are a bit dumbfounded. walt stares them
          down.

          walt
          but you might just be dumb enough
          not to recognize that your luck
          just ran out.
          all bravado drains away from the black guys. walt is a
          rock.
          walt grins slightly and spits on the ground.

          tall black guy
          fuck this guy. he ain't worth it.
          the trio walks slowly across the street, forcing a car to
          miss a green light.
          trey puts his hand out to shake walt's...

          trey
          man, thanks a lot, mister.
          walt doesn't extend a hand, he lets trey stand there like
          an idiot. trey slowly lowers his arm.
          walt looks at trey's outfit.

          walt
          go home, clown... and pull up your
          goddamned pants.
          walt turns to sue.

          walt
          come on, i'll give you a ride.
