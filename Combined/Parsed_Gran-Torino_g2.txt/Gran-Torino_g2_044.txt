          walt opens another beer, as sue speaks hmong to a
          relative. walt notices an old hmong man staring at him.
          walt interrupts sue.

          walt
          hey, sue.

          sue
          what?

          walt
          you said you guys don't look you
          in the eye, but that guy keeps
          staring at me.
          sue laughs and gestures to the old hmong man. the old
          hmong man steps over and nods to walt.

          sue
          this is kor khue. he's the lor
          family shaman.

          walt
          witch doctor?
          sue smiles and nods.

          sue
          something like that. the hmong
          hold their clan shaman in very
          high regards.

          walt
          boo-ga, boo-ga.
          kor khue says something to sue in hmong. she turns and
          translates to walt.

          sue
          kor khue is interested in you, he
          heard what you did. he says he
          would like to read you.

          walt
          huh?

          sue
          he wants to read you. tell you
          your soul. it'd be rude not to
          allow him this, it's a great
          honor.

          walt
          tell kor to be my guest, fire
          away.
          sue speaks hmong to the shaman. the shaman responds and
          sits down across from walt. he looks at walt for a long
          time.
          walt stares straight back at him. the shaman mumbles to
          himself.
          finally the shaman turns to sue and speaks very rapidly.
          as sue translates, the shaman watches walt's reaction.

          sue
          kor khue says that you think
          you've been disrespected. you do
          not live your life. your food has
          no flavor. you are scared of your
          past.

          49.

          you stopped living years and years
          ago. kor khue says you're not at
          peace.
          walt looks like he's been hit by a truck. the shaman
          watches walt closely, he knows he hit the nail on the
          head.
          walt looks pale. he's been spooked good. he wipes sweat
          from his forehead.

          walt
          excuse me.
          walt gets up and steps into the kitchen. he takes
          several deep breaths. he's pretty shook up.

          walt
          je -- zuz -- christ.
          walt looks around at all the hmongs eating and carrying
          on.
          walt sees a young man give up his seat to an elder.
          walt sees a young woman go to each of the older folks and
          offer tea and cookies from a tray.
          walt sees a child help an old man out of the bathroom.
          walt coughs hard. he wipes blood from his lips. sue
          comes in and looks at walt.

          sue
          are you okay?
          walt brushes past her and goes into the bathroom.
