          walt empties the lawnmower bag as two elderly hmong women
          come over, each carrying a flower bouquet.

          walt
          no. no thanks. no more flowers.
          the elderly hmong women nod and speak rapid sentences in
          hmong to walt. he has no idea what they are saying.

          walt
          no more. please, keep your
          flowers.
          the hmong women nod, smile and chatter away, ignoring
          walt. they walk past him and set the bouquets on his
          porch.

          walt

          (defeated)
          okay, just put them on the porch.
          but that's it. no more.
