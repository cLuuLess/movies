          walt sits drinking coffee and reading the newspaper. tao
          walks sheepishly over to the property line.

          walt
          son of a bitch, i didn't think
          he'd show.
          walt waves tao over. tao barely looks at walt.

          walt
          okay. what are you good at?

          tao
          like what?

          walt

          you good at?

          if you're gonna work for me, i
          have to know what you can do.

          tao
          i don't know.

          walt
          that's about what i expected.
          okay, why don't you go over by the
          spruce tree and count how many
          birds feed at the bird feeder.

          tao
          count the birds?

          walt
          yeah, you can count? you slopes
          are supposed to be good at math,
          right?

          tao
          yes, i can count.
