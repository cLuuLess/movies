          all of walt's family are seated in an office as a lawyer
          reads walt kowalski's will.
          tao is present along with walt's family.

          lawyer
          which brings us to our last item.
          and again, please forgive the
          language used in mr. kowalski's
          will. i'm simply reading it as it
          was written.
          the lawyer takes a sip of water before reading...

          lawyer
          Â‘and to my friend, tao vang lor, i
          leave my 1972 gran torino on the
          condition that you don't choptop
          the roof like a damned spick,
          don't paint any idiotic flames on
          it like some white-trash hillbilly
          and don't put a big gay spoiler on
          the rear-end like you see on all
          the other zipper heads' cars. it
          just looks like hell. if you can
          refrain from doing any of that,
          it's yours.

          fade out.
