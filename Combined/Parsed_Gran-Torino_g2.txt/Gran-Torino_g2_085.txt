          walt pounds loudly on the door. a moment later the door
          starts to swing open and a voice is heard...

          smokie (o.s.)
          what the hell did...

          walt kicks open the door and grabs smokie by the collar.
          walt drags the 105 pound smokie out of his house and
          tosses him off the front porch onto the front sidewalk.
          smokie is stunned. walt kicks him hard in the ribs.

          smokie
          how the fuck did you get here?!

          walt
          you aren't that hard to track
          down.
          walt boots him again. smokie curls up in the fetal
          position.

          smokie
          what do you want?
          walt kicks him a second time.

          walt
          i came to give you a chance.
          something comes out of the shadows under the porch.
          walt swings the barrel of the big colt .45 at the
          movement.
          it's a cat. walt puts his pistol away. smokie exhales.

          walt
          it's just you and me. nobody
          knows or has to know i was here.
          you lay off tao. tell your guys
          he ain't worth it or whatever the
          hell you want. you don't talk to
          him, you don't go near him. this
          is your one chance. you lay off
          and no one will ever be the wiser.
          smokie says nothing.

          walt
          i'll take that as a yes. i don't
          want to come back here. but if i
          do, believe me, it'll be goddamned
          ugly.
          walt kicks smokie again and stalks off into the dark.
