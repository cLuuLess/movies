          walt calmly sits on one side and a very nervous, sweating
          father janovich sits on the other.

          father janovich
          how long has it been since your
          last confession?

          walt
          forever. bless me, father, for i
          have sinned.

          father janovich
          what are your sins, my son.

          walt
          in 1968, i kissed betty jablonski
          at the work christmas party.
          dorothy was talking with the other
          wives and it just happened.

          father janovich
          yes. go on.

          walt
          i made nine hundred dollars profit
          selling a boat and motor and never
          reported the taxes which is the
          same as stealing.

          father janovich
          yes. fine.

          walt
          and lastly, i was never close to
          my two sons. i don't know them.
          i didn't know how.

          father janovich
          that's it?

          walt
          whatta you mean, that's it?'
          it's bothered me for years.

          father janovich
          god loves and forgives you. say
          ten hail marys' and five our
          fathers.' are you going to
          retaliate for what happened to
          sue?
          walt says nothing. father janovich looks hard at walt.

          father janovich
          i'm going over to that house
          today, mr. kowalski.

          walt
          is that so?

          father janovich
          it is. and every other day until
          you see the folly in what you are
          planning.

          walt
          i gotta go, padre. busy day
          ahead.

          father janovich
          go in peace.

          walt
          i am at peace.
          walt and father janovich shake hands. walt exits.
          father janovich exhales loudly and drops into his chair.

          father janovich
          je -- zuz -- christ.
