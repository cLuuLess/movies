          walt steps inside and catches ashley sneaking a
          cigarette. she has pulled back the canvas tarp that
          covers his pride and joy, his beloved 1972 gran torino.
          the gran torino is in mint condition. it has been babied
          since the day it rolled off the line.
          ashley tosses her cigarette when she sees grandpa walt.

          ashley
          wow, grandpa, when'd you get the
          vintage car?
          walt looks at her for a second, then steps on her still
          burning cigarette before answering.

          walt

          1972.

          ashley
          i never knew you had a cool old
          car.

          walt
          it's only been in here since
          before you were born.

          ashley
          so, what are you like going to do
          with it like, when... you die?
          walt lights up a smoke --

          walt
          jesus, joseph and mary.
          walt pulls the cover back over the gran torino.

          ashley
          then what about that super cool
          retro couch in the den, i'm going
          to state next year and i don't
          have, like, any furniture?
          walt walks out without commenting.

          back in walt's house

          8
          the doorbell rings and walt opens the door. standing
          there is tao, a sixteen-year-old hmong boy. walt scowls.
          tao is slight, he has long hair, long lashes, but is very
          good-looking -- like an asian johnny depp.

          walt
          who the hell are you?

          tao
          (very quietly)
          i'm tao, i live next door.

          walt
          what?! speak up, boy, get the
          shit out of your mouth. what do
          you want?

          tao
          do you have jumper cables? my
          uncle's car is old and...

          walt
          no. and have some goddamned
          respect, zipper head, we're
          mourning over here.
          walt slams the door in tao's face.
          walt turns and is suddenly cornered by father janovich.
          walt hates situations like this.

          father janovich
          how you holding up, walt?

          walt
          mr. kowalski.

          father janovich
          huh?

          walt
          it's mr. kowalski, not walt.

          father janovich
          right, mr. kowalski. your wife
          and i became quite close these
          last few months. she asked that i
          watch over you when she passed on.
          i told her i watch out for my
          entire flock, but she made me
          promise i'd keep an extra sharp
          eye on you.

          walt
          i appreciate your kindness to my
          wife and now that you've spoken
          your piece, why don't you move on
          to the next sheep?
          walt starts to step away, but father janovich blocks him.

          father janovich
          dorothy mentioned specifically
          that it was her wish for you to go
          to confession. she said she
          couldn't remember the last time
          you went.

          walt
          is that so?

          father janovich
          it is.
          walt drains his lowball glass.

          walt
          well, i confess i never much liked
          church and only went because of
          the wife. and i confess i have no
          desire to confess to a boy who is
          fresh out of the seminary.
