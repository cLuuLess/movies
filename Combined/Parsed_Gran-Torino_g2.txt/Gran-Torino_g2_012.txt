          tao exits the store, gets on his bike and rides off.

          a few blocks away, tao rides past a snowbank when --
          wham! a hockey stick is thrown through the spokes of his
          front wheel. tao flies over the handlebars into the
          snow.
          a chorus of laughter is heard. three latinos stand
          around the stunned, prone tao.

          head latino
          whatta you gonna do, gook? you
          gonna Â‘kung fu' us?
          tao just lies there as latino #2 picks up his bike.

          latino #2
          surprised it ain't a girl's bike.
          the latinos laugh. tao remains on the ground.

          head latino
          you gonna get up or what?
          tao doesn't move.

          head latino
          tell you what, i'll let you take
          the first swing. you drop me and
          you can have your bike back.
          tao smiles, he can't help it.

          head latino
          what the fuck you smiling at,
          gook? something funny?
          he grabs tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet.

          head latino
          you better get the fuck outta
          here, bitch.
          he pushes tao backwards. tao falls back into the snow.
          this time tao crab-walks back away from the latinos.
          the latinos stroll away with tao's bike.
