          the choir sings the beatitudes.
          walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as
          one woman looks through her day planner, an old guy dozes
          and his granddaughter ashley applies nail polish.
          father janovich, the very young parish priest, steps up
          to the altar and delivers the eulogy for walt's wife.
          walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin, weak,
          unconvincing words of father janovich.

          father janovich
          death... is often a bittersweet
          occasion to us catholics. bitter
          in the pain it causes the deceased
          ... and their families. sweet to
          those who know the salvation that
          awaits them. and some may ask,
          what is death. is it the end? or
          is it the beginning? and what is
          life? what is this thing we call
          life?

          walt
          jesus.
          walt coughs. he takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips.
          he looks down and notices a speck of blood on the white
          cloth.
