          walt and tao walk up to the barbershop.

          walt

          now watch how me and martin
          communicate. we just throw it
          back and forth. you ready?

          tao
          sure.

          walt
          okay, let's go in.
          walt holds the door for tao and they enter. the barber
          has his feet up reading a playboy.

          barber

          walt
          afternoon, martin, you dumb
          italian prick.

          barber
          walt, you cheap asshole, i should
          have known you'd come in, i was
          having such a pleasant day.

          walt
          why, did you jew some blind man
          out of a few bucks, give him the
          wrong change?
          walt and the barber shake hands warmly. tao is wide-
          eyed.

          barber
          who's the nip?

          walt
          this is tao. he's a pussy kid who
          lives next door and i'm trying to
          man him up a little.
          walt points at tao.

          walt
          did you see? that's how men talk
          to each other.

          tao
          they do?

          barber
          what, do you have shit in your
          ears?

          walt
          okay. you go out, come back in
          and give it a try.

          tao
          come on, walt.

          walt
          i said go out there, come back in
          and talk to the barber like a man.
          do it.
          tao shrugs, goes outside, lets the door shut then comes
          back in. the barber stands there with a sneer on his
          face.

          tao
          wus up, you old italian prick?
          the barber levels a sawed-off shotgun at tao.

          barber
          get outta my shop before i blow
          your head off, you long-haired
          faggy little gook!
          tao is terrified, frozen stiff.
          walt and the barber throw their heads back and laugh.
          the barber lowers the shotgun.

          walt
          jesus christ, toad, you don't walk
          in and insult a guy. what are
          you, an idiot?

          tao
          but... but that's what you said.
          that's what you said men say.

          walt
          not if you never met the guy. if
          you say that shit to the wrong
          stranger, they'll blow your
          goddamned gook head off!
          walt and the barber laugh again.

          tao
          what should i have said?

          walt
          anything but that.

          barber
          kid, you shoulda just started with
          hi' or hello.'

          walt
          right. you should have said,
          excuse me, i'm looking for a
          haircut if you have time.'

          barber
          yeah. be polite, but don't kiss
          ass.

          walt
          or, even better is act like you
          just got off a construction job.

          another guy who ain't there. my
          son of a bitch prick fucking boss
          made me work overtime and he knew

          two fucking hours about how they

          grocery store and the minute i
          turn on the goddamned game, she
          starts crying how we never talk.

          walt
          see? you come back in, toad. be
          polite and then you bring up
          something you can both talk about.
          it ain't rocket science.

          tao
          yeah, but i don't have a job or a
          car or a girlfriend.
          walt and the barber laugh.

          barber
          sweet jesus, i shoulda blown his
          head off when i had the chance.

          walt
          just go back outside and try it
          again. and don't mention you're a
          pussy with no car, girl, job,
          future or whatever. come in and
          act like a man, toad.
          tao goes out, turns around and comes back in.

          tao

          if you ain't too busy... you
