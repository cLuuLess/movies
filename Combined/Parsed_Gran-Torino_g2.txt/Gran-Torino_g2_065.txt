          tao ties up bundles of branches and twigs. walt lights a
          cigarette, looks up in the tree and nods.

          walt
          looks good. good job.
          tao nods.

          walt
          make sure you put the ladder back
          when you're done raking up the
          leaves.

          tao
          i know. i will.
          walt walks back over to his porch, grabs a pabst from the
          cooler and watches tao rake.
          a white honda turns the corner and drives slowly past
          tao.
          smokie and spider smile menacingly at tao as they pass.

          walt
          this kid doesn't have a chance.
          the honda now slowly passes walt's house. walt just
          stands there, sipping his beer.
          the honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at
          walt.
          the rear window of the honda opens.
          walt holds out his right hand like a gun. he closes one
          eye to better aim his imaginary gun and moves his thumb
          several times as if firing. bang -- bang -- bang.
          the honda takes off. walt watches it drive off and
          lights another cigarette.
          walt doesn't notice, but tao witnessed this whole
          interaction from his yard.
