          int. church

          we're at the funeral of dorothy kowalski. in attendance
          are mostly old folks, their offspring and several bored
          teenagers.
          walt kowalski stands towards the front of the church. he
          speaks to an older man in a bulky, out-of-date suit.

          older man
          i'm real sorry about dorothy,
          walt. she was a real peach.

          walt
          thanks for coming, al.
          walt kowalski looks young for his age. he has slate blue
          eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut
          hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953.
          walt is also a perfectionist. nothing escapes his
          hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge.
          walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at
          his wife's funeral. his eyes narrow at his
          granddaughter's belly button ring.

          walt
          jesus christ.
          walt's two sons, mitch and steve, watch their father from
          across the pews.

          mitch
          look at the old man glaring at
          ashley. he can't even tone it
          down at mom's funeral?

          steve
          what do you expect? dad's still
          living in the Â‘50s. he expects
          his granddaughter to dress a
          little more modestly.

          mitch
          yeah, well your kid's wearing a
          timberwolves jersey. i'm sure dad
          appreciates that.

          steve
          my point is that there's nothing
          anyone can do that won't
          disappoint the old man.

          it's inevitable. that's why we
          stopped doing thanksgivings; the
          deal with the boat motor, the
          broken bird bath, it's always
          something.

          mitch
          what are we going to do with him?
          don't you think he'll get in
          trouble by himself over in the old
          neighborhood?

          steve
          why don't you have him move in
          with you?

          mitch
          ha ha.
