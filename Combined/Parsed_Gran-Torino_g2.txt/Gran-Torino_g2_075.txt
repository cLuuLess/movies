          walt and tao spread mulch around walt's vegetable plants.

          tao
          you know, the hmong consider
          gardening to be women's work.

          walt
          is that why i see you out in your
          garden all the time? besides,
          zipper head, we ain't in hu-mong.

          tao
          funny.
          walt lights a cigarette.

          tao
          you should quit those. it's bad
          for you.

          walt

          tao
          seriously, you should quit, i saw
          you cough up blood.

          walt
          so, you ever think about what you
          want to do with your life?

          tao
          i don't know.

          walt
          you've never thought about it?

          tao
          of course i have.

          walt
          well, while you're thinking about
          it, try not to stomp all over my
          chives, you dipshit.
          tao looks down; sure enough, he's standing on walt's
          chives.

          tao
          sorry.

          walt
          put some mulch around the
          cucumbers.
          tao spreads more mulch.

          tao
          i was thinking about sales, maybe.

          walt
          my oldest son's a salesman. he
          sells cars.

          tao
          does he do well?

          walt
          license to steal. i worked in a
          ford plant for thirty years and my
          son sells goddamned japanese cars.

          tao
          you made cars?

          walt
          that's right. and i put the
          steering column in the gran torino
          when it rolled down the line in

          1972.

          tao
          wow, that's cool.

          walt
          it is, isn't it?

          tao
          does your son come over much?

          walt
          how are you going about getting
          into sales? you thinking about
          school?

          tao
          kinda.

          walt
          well, you should.

          tao
          school costs money.

          walt
          maybe you should get a job and
          save instead of spreading mulch in
          my garden.

          tao
          maybe you could just pay me.

          walt
          that's funny.

          tao
          what kind of job could i get?

          walt
          good question. who the hell would
          hire you?

          tao

          (deflated)
          yeah, i know.

          walt
          aw, go on. i'm kidding. you
          could get a job, easy.

          tao
          like what?

          walt
          i'd think about construction.

          tao
          me? construction? what, do you
          have alzheimer's or something?

          walt
          naw, you could hack it. you just
          need a little adjustment.

          tao
          you said yourself i'm worthless
          and i have soft little girl hands.

          walt
          that's exactly the point. i know
          some guys in the trades, but you
          have to get your shit together.
          we have to man you up a bit.

          tao
          man me up?

          walt
          yes. and you should ask out yum
          yum too.
