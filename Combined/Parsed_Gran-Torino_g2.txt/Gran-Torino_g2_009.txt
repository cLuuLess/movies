          did you see him look at the truck?
          it's always rice-burner this or
          jap-buggy that. even at mom's
          funeral, he can't let it go.

          at least he didn't say anything
          this time.

          mitch
          he didn't have to.

          well, what do you expect? the man
          worked at a ford plant for twenty-
          eight years.

          walt gets his guests' engine running.
          as they drive off, walt hears faint singing. walt looks
          into his neighbor's backyard and can't believe his eyes.
          the hmong all sing and chant as three chickens have their
          heads sliced off, right there in the yard.
          the chickens are held up and everyone chants louder.
          it's a sacrifice. walt spits in the snow and says to
          daisy.

          walt
          barbarians. goddamned barbarians.
