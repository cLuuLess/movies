          walt watches baseball. he hears a car outside. shouts
          are heard and glass breaks.
          walt gets up and looks out the shades...
          tao's house is raked with gunfire coming from a van!
          windows shatter and the siding splinters.
          fifty bullets shake the house before the van peels off.
