          walt sits, red-eyed. he's done crying. family photo
          albums are scattered around.
          father janovich knocks and eases open the front door.

          father janovich
          mr. kowalski, are you in here?

          walt
          come on in.
          father janovich comes in and sits down across from walt.

          father janovich
          are you okay?
          walt nods.

          father janovich
          the police finally left. no one
          is talking. one thing about the
          hmong, they keep their mouths
          shut.

          walt
          i've noticed that.
          father janovich picks up a photo album and flips through
          it. pictures of mitch and steve as babies.

          walt
          you know, there's no way that tao
          or sue are gonna have any peace if
          these gang guys don't go away. go
          away forever. you know it as well
          as i do.

          father janovich
          what are you saying?

          99.

          walt
          you heard what i said.

          father janovich
          they took sue to the hospital.
          she's scared. they're all scared.

          walt
          i'm not.

          father janovich
          i know that. believe me, they all
          know that. tao especially. he's
          sitting out there staring at your
          front door. you know what he
          expects, mr. kowalski.

          walt
          yeah, well what would you do if
          you were me? if you were tao?
          what would you do?
          father janovich shakes his head.

          father janovich
          i know what i'd do if i was you,
          or at least what you think you
          should do. if i was tao i guess
          i'd want vengeance. i'd want to
          stand shoulder to shoulder with
          you and kill those guys.

          walt
          and you?

          father janovich
          what would i do? i'd come over
          here and talk to you i guess. i
          know you're close with these
          people, but this pisses me off
          too, mr. kowalski.
          walt nods.

          walt
          wanna beer?

          father janovich
          i'd love one.

          walt
          they're in the cooler, grab me one
          too.

          100.

          father janovich grabs four beers, two for each of them.
          he opens a pabst and takes a big swig.

          father janovich
          damn all this. it just isn't
          fair.

          walt
          nothing's fair, father.
          father janovich and walt sit for awhile.

          father janovich
          so, what are you going to do, mr.
          kowalski?

          walt
          call me walt.
          father janovich nods.

          father janovich
          alright, what are you going to do,
          walt?

          walt
          not sure yet. all i do know is
          they don't have a goddamned
          chance.
