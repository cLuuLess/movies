          walt waters a flower bed. tao comes over and stands
          there. walt finishes watering before even looking at
          tao.

          tao
          what do you have for me today?
          you want me to watch paint dry or
          maybe count the clouds that pass
          by?

          walt
          don't get flip with me, zipper
          head. i ain't the one who tried
          to steal and don't forget it.

          tao
          go ahead. i don't care if you
          insult me and say racist things.
          i'll take it.

          walt
          that i know. you have no teeth,
          kid. that's your problem. you
          have no balls.

          tao
          look, i'm stuck here. why don't
          you give me something useful to
          do.

          walt
          because unlike you i'm not
          useless. i maintain my property,
          whereas you swamp rats let your
          houses go to hell.
          walt looks across the street at one very dilapidated
          house.

          walt
          wait a minute... how long do i
          have you for?
          tao pauses... he doesn't want to answer.

          walt
          how long, toad?

          60.

          (quietly)
          till next friday.
          walt laughs out loud. it makes tao cringe.

          walt
          go get my ladder out of the
          garage.
