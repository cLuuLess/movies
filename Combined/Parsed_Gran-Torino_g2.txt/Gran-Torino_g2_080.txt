          walt and tao walk the aisles. walt grabs a tool belt and
          tosses it to tao.

          walt
          you'll need this.
          walt then tosses tao a utility knife holder.

          walt
          and you'll need that. now where
          the hell do they hide the hardware
          holders?

          tao
          i can't afford any of this.

          walt
          i'll get it, but you're paying me
          back with your first check.

          tao
          cool.
          walt pitches a hardware pouch at tao.

          walt
          and you need this too. that
          should about do it.

          tao
          not to bitch, but won't i be
          needing some tools?

          walt
          tools i got, but i ain't loaning
          you my tool belt. you can buy
          tools as you go.

          tao
          i appreciate all this.

          walt
          aw, forget it.

          tao
          no, i really do. thank you.
          walt sticks out his jaw and looks tao straight in the
          eye. tao doesn't know what to expect.
          a pause. walt puts out his hand to tao. tao extends his
          and they shake hands.
          it's really quite a moment for both of them.
