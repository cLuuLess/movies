          mitch, karen and ashley are in the kitchen. the phone
          rings and ashley looks at the caller id.

          ashley
          it's grandpa walt.

          karen
          well, pick it up.

          ashley
          you talk to him.

          karen
          mitch?

          mitch
          i'm doing bills here.

          karen
          he's your father.
          ashley hands him the phone and he pushes the talk button.

          mitch
          hello, dad.

          walt (v.o.)
          hello? it's me... dad.

          mitch
          i know. what's up?
          the camera intercuts between mitch in his huge kitchen
          and walt sitting on the edge of his bed.

          walt
          um... not much, how about you?

          mitch
          i'm fine, fine.

          walt

          the kids and karen?

          mitch
          everyone is fine.

          walt
          good.
          there is a long, uncomfortable pause. walt looks at some
          xeroxed medical pamphlets scattered on his bed.

          mitch
          good.

          walt
          well, that's good... how's...
          work?

          mitch
          busy.

          walt
          right. i s'pose.

          mitch
          speaking of busy, i have a lot on
          my plate right now, unless there's
          something pressing.
          walt looks at a pale, blue pamphlet. mitch looks at his
          housekeeping bill.

          walt
          no. nope.
          another pause.

          walt
          okay then.

          mitch
          okay. yeah, so it's not a good
          time right now. why don't you
          call me over the weekend.

          walt
          sure.

          mitch
          okay, it was nice talking to you,
          bye, dad.
          walt hangs up. he lies down on his bed.
