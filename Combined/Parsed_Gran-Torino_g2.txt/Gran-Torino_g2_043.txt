          a lot of the people in this house
          are very traditional. number one,
          never touch a hmong person on the
          head, not even a child. hmong
          people believe that the soul
          resides in the head, so don't do
          that.

          walt
          that's dumb, but fine.

          sue
          hmong people also consider looking
          someone in the eye to be rude.
          that's why everyone looks away
          when you look at them.

          walt
          swell. anything else?

          sue
          yeah, some hmong smile or grin
          when they're yelled at or get into
          a confrontation. it's a cultural
          thing. it expresses embarrassment
          or insecurity, not that they're
          laughing at you.

          walt
          good god, you people are all nuts.
