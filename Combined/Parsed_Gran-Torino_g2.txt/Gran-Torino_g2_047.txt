          walt and sue descend the stairway. walt is really out of
          his element down with all the hmong teenagers.
          and the first person he sees across the room is tao.

          walt
          oh great.

          sue
          well, look who's over there.

          walt
          what's-his-name who tried to steal
          my gran torino.

          sue
          my brother tao.

          walt
          yeah, toad.
          tao is in the corner, he avoids walt's gaze. sue walks
          over to a group of boys, leaving walt alone.
          walt doesn't know what to do with himself. he leans
          against the dryer. the dryer wobbles.
          walt gets on his hands and knees. he looks under the
          dryer. he adjusts the short leg to balance out the
          machine.
          he just can't help it.
          all the hmong kids watch walt, trying not to laugh at
          this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a
          dryer during a party. walt looks up -- deer in the
          headlights.

          walt
          it was wobbly, but i fixed it.
          it's fine now, shouldn't wobble
          anymore.
          the hmong kids look away, covering their mouths with
          their hands.
          walt glares at tao, who immediately wipes the smile from
          his face. sue walks over and hands walt a drink.

          walt
          what's this?

          52.

          sue
          rice liquor. try it.

          walt
          alright.
          sue walks off. walt sips his rice liquor and watches the
          interaction between the boys and girls.
          one particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a girl
          stares across the room at tao. tao looks back at her,
          but then looks away.
          the girl keeps looking at tao, smiling and twisting her
          hair.
          tao doesn't approach her, but three other young men do.
          they do their best to charm her. she's polite, but not
          interested, she keeps looking at tao.
          walt laughs at tao's ineptitude, shakes his head at this
          wasted opportunity. suddenly the girl steps over to
          walt.
          she smiles --

          wa xam (girl)
          my friends and i were just
          wondering what you're doing here?

          walt

          here? anyways, i'm walt.

          wa xam

          i drove my aunt to the doctor to
          straighten out her prescription.
          even fixed my screen door before
          it was broke.

          wa xam
          you're funny.

          walt
          that's one thing i've never been
          accused of. a bastard, yes.
          funny, no.
          wa xam laughs.

          wa xam
          well, have fun. i'm going to take
          off.

          walt
          a pleasure to meet you, yum yum.
          she laughs at walt butchering her name and goes upstairs.
          the three young suitors follow her up. tao watches her.
          walt comes over to tao, who is startled. walt laughs.

          walt
          relax, zipper head, whatta you
          think i'm gonna do, shoot you?
          tao looks like he wants to run away.

          walt
          i wouldn't say anything either, if
          i was you.
          walt sips his rice liquor. walt can't help but rib tao.

          walt
          you know, i knew you were a
          dipshit even before the whole
          garage deal, but i have to say
          you're even worse with women than
          you are stealing cars, toad.

          tao
          it's tao.

          walt
          what's that?

          tao
          it's tao, not toad. my name is
          tao.

          walt
          good for you. anyways, you're
          blowing it with that girl. not
          that i give two shits about a toad
          like you.

          tao
          you don't know what you're talking
          about.

          walt
          wrong, egg roll. i completely
          know what i'm talking about. i
          know i'm not always the most
          pleasant person to be around, but
          i got the greatest woman who ever
          lived to marry me. i had to work
          at it, but i got her and it was
          the best thing that ever happened
          to me. hands down.
          walt points across the room. he sways slightly.

          walt
          but you? you just sit there and
          watch as ding dong and click clack
          and charlie chan walk away with
          what's-her-face. she likes you,
          you know.

          tao
          who?

          walt
          she was standing over there,
          orange dress, twisting her hair
          and smiling at you.

          tao
          you mean wa xam?
          walt takes a long swig off his drink and nods.

          walt
          yeah, yeah. anyways, she likes
          you, i know, i talked to her.
          great girl, charming girl. love
          her. i love yum yum. but you?
          you just watch her walk out the
          door with the three stooges. why?
          because you're a big fat pussy!
          walt drains his drink.
