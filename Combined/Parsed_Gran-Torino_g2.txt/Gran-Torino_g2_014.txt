          tao nods to an older woman rocking in a broken rocking
          chair. phong nods back to tao, then turns her evil eye
          back on walt, whom she's been seething at all morning.

          why doesn't that stupid, hairy
          white man move? he must be too
          dumb to realize he's not welcome
          here. all the mee-khah left in
          the neighborhood should just move
          away. look at him strut like a
          rooster.
          she sees walt glance at her and spit. phong glares back
          and spits beetle juice, which has turned her teeth black.
