          walt looks around with disdain at his neighbors' houses.
          walt's property is perfectly kept, whereas his neighbors'
          houses are rundown.
          walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped
          screen doors, peeling paint. one neighbor has installed
          a chicken coop.

          damn chinks let their yards go to
          hell. polarski would turn over in
          his grave if he could see what
          they did to his lawn.
          tao walks past. walt watches him pass.

          i don't know why these goddamned
          slopes had to move to my block.
          this used to be a nice
          neighborhood.
