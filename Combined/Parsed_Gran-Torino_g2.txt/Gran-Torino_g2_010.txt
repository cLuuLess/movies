          the house is a buzz of activity. the older hmong speak
          their native language, the younger generation speaks both
          english and hmong.

          tao's grandmother (phong) complains to a man.

          there's no man in this house,
          that's why my daughter should
          remarry. being a second wife is
          better than having a woman be the
          head of the household. it's not
          our way.

          what about tao?

          what about him?

          man

          (subtitled)
          he's the man in the house.

          phong

          tao's not a man.

          look at him in the kitchen,
          washing dishes like a woman. even
          his sister gives him orders and he
          obeys.
          the camera pans to the kitchen where tao washes a pile of
          dishes. an older relative drops dishes in the sink,
          without acknowledging tao's presence. it's clearly an
          insult.
          in the living room the hmong soul calling ceremony
          starts its next phase. an elder, the family shaman, is
          present and begins the ritual.
          as the entire hmong family gathers to watch. tao slips
          on his coat and goes out the back door.
