          walt looks at a photo in his wallet, his and dorothy's
          wedding photo. walt looks down at daisy --

          walt
          we miss momma, don't we, daisy.
          a vehicle pulls up to tao's house. a party is in full
          swing.
          sue comes out and helps the hmong women unload big
          platters of food and carry them to the house.
          sue catches walt's gaze and steps over to his porch.

          sue
          hey, walt, what are you up to?
          walt points his index finger at the can of pabst in his
          hand.

          sue
          we're having a barbecue. you want
          to come over?

          walt
          what do you think?

          sue
          there's tons of food.

          walt
          i'll bet. just keep your paws off
          my dog.

          sue
          no worries, we only eat cats.

          walt
          really?

          sue
          no, i'm kidding, you moron. come
          on, come on over. you can be my
          special guest.

          walt
          i'm fine right here.
          walt reaches into the cooler for another beer. it's
          empty, just water and ice.

          walt
          son of a bitch.

          what have you had to eat today,
          walt?

          walt
          a piece of cake and some beef
          jerky.

          sue
          come on over and get something to
          eat. we've got beer, too.
          walt exhales loudly --

          walt
          oh, what the hell. it's my
          birthday, i may as well drink with
          strangers instead of myself.
          walt gets up and walks with sue towards her house.

          sue
          happy birthday, wally.

          walt
          don't call me wally.
