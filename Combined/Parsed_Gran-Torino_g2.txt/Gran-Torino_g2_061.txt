          walt sits in the crowded waiting room. he looks around.
          he's the only white person in the room. even most of the
          staff is african or from india.
          as walt waits, names are called out such as alvarez,
          ngaima, yang and abdalla.
          finally when the name kowalski is called, the muslim
          woman can't pronounce it correctly. walt winces.
