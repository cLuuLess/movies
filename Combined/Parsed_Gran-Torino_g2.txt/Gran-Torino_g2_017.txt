          tao digs in the garden. tao's younger sister sue sits
          and reads jane magazine on the porch.
          the tricked-out honda with blue neon lights pulls up.
          spider, smokie and two other hmong gangbangers get out.

          spider
          hey, cuz. hey, sue.

          sue
          what do you want?

          spider
          came to talk to my cousin tao.
          smokie looks over to sue.

          smokie
          spider, who's the other cousin?
          sue laughs at the name spider. sue is seventeen, has
          long straight hair with red highlights.

          sue
          spider'? is that what he just
          called you, fong?

          spider
          this is my little cousin, sue.
          smokie takes off his sunglasses and smiles at sue.

          smokie
          hey, sue... how old are you, girl?

          sue
          mentally, i'm way too old for you.
          i'm going inside.

          spider
          that's right, go inside while the
          men talk.

          sue
          yeah, that's exactly what i'm
          doing, fong.
          sue rolls her eyes and goes inside. smokie stares at
          tao.

          spider
          you think about what we talked
          about?
          a pause. smokie watches tao carefully, offers him a
          cigarette. tao shakes his head no and looks at the
          ground.

          smokie
          that's exactly the point, tao.
          spider told me how everyone thinks
          you're a pushover, how everybody
          walks all over you and shit. i
          mean, look at you, out here
          working in the garden like a
          woman.
          tao nods silently, but still looks at the ground.

          smokie
          it ain't no big thing. you just
          need a little guidance.
          tao looks up at smokie. tao looks a little skeptical.

          smokie
          it's true, man. shit, i used to
          be kind of a quiet little punk
          like you, everybody fucking with
          me. but finally i said no more.'
          you, you're lucky, tao, we got
          your back. me? i didn't have
          nobody. had to mold my own tribe.

          spider
          smokie's right. we're family,
          right? you with us or what?

          smokie
          i swear, brother, we're the best
          friends you'll ever have. and
          anyone fucks with you, they're
          fucked.

          spider
          come on, man.
          tao clears his throat and speaks for the first time.

          tao
          what do i have to do?
          smokie points to walt's open garage.

          smokie
          spider mentioned that neighbor of
          yours.
