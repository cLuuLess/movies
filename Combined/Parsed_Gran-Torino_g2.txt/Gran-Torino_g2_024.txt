          walt drills heavy-gauge screen mesh over the windows on
          the garage. the phone rings and walt answers.

          walt
          hello?

          mitch (v.o.)
          morning, dad, it's your number one
          son, mitch.

          walt
          it's one in the afternoon.
          the camera now intercuts between walt and mitch in the
          kitchen of his huge, modern suburban house.

          mitch
          right, good afternoon, then.

          walt
          so, what do you want?

          mitch
          me? nothing. what would i want?

          walt
          i don't know. your wife already
          went through all of your mother's
          jewelry.

          mitch
          no. i was just wondering how you
          are, what's going on, anything new
          in the old neighborhood?
          walt looks at the bullet hole in his hamm's beer sign.

          walt
          nope.

          mitch
          great. smooth sailing then?

          walt
          yup.
          there's a very painful pause in the conversation.

          mitch
          well good... say, dad?

          walt
          uh-huh.

          mitch

          the plant who has viking season
          tickets?
