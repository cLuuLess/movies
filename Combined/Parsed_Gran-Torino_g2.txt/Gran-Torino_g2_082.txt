          walt spots tao as he takes out the trash.

          walt
          hey there.
          tao looks to the ground and heads in the other direction.

          tao
          hey, i gotta run.

          walt
          wait a minute. where have you
          been, i haven't seen you in days?

          tao
          busy.
          walt squints at tao. he steps closer. tao looks away.
          walt tilts tao's head up, he sees the burn.

          walt
          what in the hell happened to you?

          tao
          don't worry about it.

          walt
          don't worry about it? look at
          your goddamned face!

          tao
          i said don't worry about it. it's
          not your problem.
          walt looks at the ground and spits.

          walt
          when?

          tao
          couple days ago. grabbed me after
          i got off the bus coming home from
          work.

          walt
          cowards.

          tao
          i did everything i could possibly
          do. they broke some of your
          tools. i'll replace them.

          walt
          forget the tools. where does your
          cousin live?

          tao
          no, walt, i can manage. i don't
          want you doing anything.
          walt is angry, but eventually nods at tao.

          walt
          alright. you need any other tools
          for work?

          tao
          i could use a roofing hammer.

          walt
          go in the garage and get whatever
          you need.
