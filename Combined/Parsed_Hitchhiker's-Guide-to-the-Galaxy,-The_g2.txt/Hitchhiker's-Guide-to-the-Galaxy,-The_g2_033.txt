        zaphod's head 2 is still up, beaming.

                             zaphod head 2
                     damn, i'm good.

        hands slam head 2 down.         zaphod (head 1) turns to ford.

                             zaphod
                     so -- you along for the ride or am i
                     dropping you somewhere?

                             ford
                        (still wary of the two heads)
                     depends. where you going?

                             zaphod
                     into the pages of history, cousin.
                     and when you see what i'm about to show
                     you, you'll beg me to take you with us.

        with trillian -- who notices arthur looking ill.

                             trillian
                     you okay?

                              arthur
                      normally i would say "i'll live," but
                      given the circumstances...
                             (wiping his brow)
                     is there any tea on this spaceship?

                             trillian
                     this way.

        she exits.    arthur follows.       zaphod steps back, blocking
        his way.

                              zaphod
                     hey, apeman. earthman.      i'm sorry, what
                     was your name again?

                               arthur
                     arthur.




                                                             (continued)

                              zaphod
                     right.   no hard feelings, okay? and
                     sorry to hear about your planet, but don't
                     mention it to the girl because if you do
                     i'll...i'll...

        he smiles broader.    then head 2 pops up and finishes...

                             zaphod head 2
                     i'll pull your spleen out through your
                     ass!

        zaphod slams head 2 back into place..then smiles again.
        arthur furrows his brow and zaphod and follows trillian.

                             ford
                     two heads. interesting choice.

                              zaphod
                     apparently you can't be president with a
                     whole brain.

                             ford
                     so you carved it up?

                              zaphod
                     yes -- i think. and i think i did it in
                     such a way that it wouldn't be detected by
                     the government screening tests -- or by
                     me. so, what's so secret that i can't let
                     anybody know i know it, not the galactic
                     government, not even myself? and the
                     answer is--
                        (thinking)
                     --i don't know. obviously. but i put a
                     few things together and that's when i
                     realized i had this.
