        the transport cart moves past two half-finished planets
        and on toward a 3rd planet. construction gantries and
        clouds obscure our view.

                  the galaxy was a bit of a shambles, you
                  see. everyone enjoying themselves being
                  singers and comedians and really creative
                  and interesting things like that. no one
                  doing the boring jobs.

                  engineered to do the boring jobs. tax
                  inspectors, traffic wardens, government
                  officials. we were commissioned to build
                  a special planet for them.
                  problem was, some cleverdick made it so
                  any time one of the creatures had an
                  interesting idea it would get a hefty
                  smack around the face.

                          arthur
                  what? you did that? i've been there!

        the cart lowers down toward the surface of the planet.

                  then i gather you've met some of the

         two missiles screech overhead and soar up toward...

         the vogon ships -- descending from space. the missiles
         each hit a ship. they explode. two more missiles fire,
         taking out two more ships. but several ships do land.
