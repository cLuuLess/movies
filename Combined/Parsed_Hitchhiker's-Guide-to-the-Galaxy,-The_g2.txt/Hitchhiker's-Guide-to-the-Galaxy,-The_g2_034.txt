        close on - the nutri-matic machine. brownish liquid
        flows into it a martini glass, topped with dry-ice fog.

        arthur removes the glass.    sips.     grimaces

                             trillian
                     i suppose i should have said it
                     resembles tea.

                             arthur
                     so two heads is what does it for a girl,
                     then? i mean, if i'd had two heads. or
                     three?

                             trillian
                     or your own space ship.

                     anything else he's got two of?

                             trillian
                     come on, arthur, don't be like that.

                             arthur
                     well, what am i supposed to be like?
                     green? bleeping? what?

                             trillian
                     just be yourself. have some fun. does it
                     hurt?

                             arthur
                     no, i suppose it wouldn't..

                             trillian
                     i mean...

        she points to his jaw, he nods, she picks up her backpack.

                             trillian (cont'd)
                     i might have an aspirin.

        she unzips it. two mice scurry out and scamper off, a
        hair-clip is clipped to one of the mice's tail.

                              trillian (cont'd)
                     hey.   what are they doing in there?

        before she can catch them, they scurry under the door.

                             trillian {cont'd)
                     they were from my lab at university.    odd...

                             arthur
                     so all that's left is me and you, "mostly
                     harmless," and two lab rats.

        she furrows her brow.     what does he mean?

                             arthur (cont'd)
                     look, there's something i should tell
                     you...

                             zaphod (o.s.)
                     showtime, trill!

                             trillian
                     can it keep? you might want to see this.

        arthur nods. she leaves.        he looks at his "tea", throws
        it in the trash bin.
