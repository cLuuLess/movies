                     destroy earth?!

                               arthur
                     he did?

                               zaphod
                     i did?

                             trillian
                     "love and kisses, zaphod?"  i saw the
                     form. you didn't even read it, did you?

                             zaphod
                     honey, i'm president of the galaxy. i
                     don't get a lot of time for reading.

                             trillian
                     an entire planet, zaphod. my home. gone.
                     all because you thought someone wanted
                     your autograph!

        she slaps him again, storms away, bursting out the door.

                             zaphod
                     they framed me! it's routine for
                     controlling presidents!
