                            kwaltz
                     did they have proper hyperspace
                     authorization?

                             vogon worker
                     no, commander.

                             kwaltz
                     add that to their list of offences!
                        (scoffing)
                     blatant disregard for protocol.

                            questular
                     you do realize he did what he did because
                     he knew this is what you would do.

                            kwaltz
                     rules are rules, mr. vice president.     and
                     they are made to be followed.

        questular looks up to the screen at all the vogon ships.

                            questular
                     don't you think this many ships is a bit,
                     oh i don't know -- excessive?

                            kwaltz
                     the provisions are clear. under
                     subsection 37a these are the forces we
                     deploy to protect the president in the
                     case of an attempted or actual kidnapping-

        he holds up one fat official book with one hand.

                            kwaltz (cont'd)
                     -- and these are the forces we deploy to
                     apprehend any intentional or actual
                     kidnapper.

        he holds up another fat book with the other.

                            questular
                     you are aware, commander, that the
                     president kidnapped himself.

                            kwaltz
                     hence...

        he puts the two books together, slams them down.

                            questular
                     do you have any idea how ridiculous this
                     is?

                            kwaltz
                     i don't have ideas mr. vice president.     i
                     just do what i do.

        a vogon messenger runs up holding papers. kwaltz takes
        them, signs one in two places, initials others, lifts the
        top sheet, removes the pink copy. folds it.

                                                            (continued)

        he does this for the other two forms as well.

        questular watches dumbfounded as kwaltz hands the papers
        back to the messenger who turns and runs off.
