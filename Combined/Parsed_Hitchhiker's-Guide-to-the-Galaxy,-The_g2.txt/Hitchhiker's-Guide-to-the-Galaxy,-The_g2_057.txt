    9    different part of vogsphere/near swamp--                          69

         the ground is barren. a scintillatingly jeweled crab
         crawls out of a swamp and looks up at the sky. we hear
         the sound of the pod approaching (but hold on the crab)
         as eeeoooo-ka-kfffzzz! the crab runs back into the
         swamp. pan left to see the pod rammed into the ground,
         steam rising. the door opens. the three emerge.

                              ford
                    wow...

                              marvin
                    i know.    dreadful, isn't it?

                            arthur
                    sorry about the landing.    where are we?

                            zaphod
                    magrathea!

                            ford
                    wrong. this is the vogon planet.     this is
                    vogsphere.

                             zaphod
                    no.   it's magrathea!   i know it!

         ford reaches in his satchel, pulls out a sort of
         electronic beret, pulls it snugly onto zaphod's head.

                            ford
                    little something i learned about on an
                    altairian star cruiser. captains use them
                    when they really need to concentrate.

                            arthur
                    what is it?

                            ford
                    a thinking cap.

         zaphod squints hard to think as he looks around.
