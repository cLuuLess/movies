90      ext. rock formation - day                                     90

        arthur walks behind the others, his head down.

                             ford (o.s.)
                     hey...this looks familiar.

        arthur looks up, registers surprise.

        the rock formation -- looks like stonehenge - only newer.
        the rocks letters carved into them that read "design
        department" "showroom" "executive offices" "toilets"

                             ford (cont'd}
                     must be portal doors.

                             arthur
                     you mean -- the hippies were right?

        in the middle of the circle sits a stone receptionist
        desk with a sign on it that says "out to lunch."

        zaphod heads for the "to design department" stone.
        trillian and ford follow.

        zaphod feels around it, looking for a switch, a knob,
        anything. he must've hit something because the front of
        the stone suddenly slides open revealing a swirling
        vortex that looks like a jet engine.

                              zaphod
                     okay.   in we go.

                             arthur
                     what?! are you out of what's left of your
                     mind? we can't step into that...that.

                             ford
                     we gotta pick one, right? if it's not the
                     right one, we come back and pick another.
                     no biggie.

                             arthur
                     yes -- big biggie. what if that's the
                     last door we ever step through? what if
                     it rips us into tiny little atomic
                     particle...thingies.

        trillian, who hasn't said a word since leaving vogsphere,
        covers her ears - trying to block them out

                             zaphod
                     it's the right one.   i have a hunch.

                               arthur
                     ford..?

                             ford
                     he's got good hunches.   i say we go.

                             arthur
                     go with the hunch of a narcissist with
                     half a brain who's wearing a ridiculous
                     thinking cap!? are you insane?!

                             zaphod
                     hey, i think i resent that.

                             arthur
                     i don't care what you think you think...

        they all start arguing over each other. we focus on
        trillian -- anger and frustration building, she covers
        her ears -- then screams....

                             trillian
                     ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!

        and she takes off running for the door. suicide? bravery?

        they turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex.
        she yelps as her body is bent in half, twisted like a
        rung mop, then sucked inside.

        arthur is horrified, literally gasping for air.      ford is
        semi-impressed. zaphod, unfazed.

                             zaphod
                     that's supposed to happen...i think.

        ford shrugs, throws his towel around his neck like a
        scarf and dives through. same thing. bent, twisted...

                          zaphod (cont'd)
                  hey, wait for me!

        he runs after ford, stops at the door, turns like he's
        about to board air force one, gives a salute, jumps in.

        arthur finally gets his legs to move, steps up -- but
        hesitates at the threshold, paralyzed with fear, unable
        to take a step. then -- ffssssh - the door seals shut.

                               arthur
                  no.    no!     nooo!!!

        he bangs on the stone, slides his hand around like zaphod
        did, desperately looking for a way to open it. he
        collapses and buries his head in his hands.

                  i told you this would all end in tears.
