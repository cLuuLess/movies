97      int. temple of deep thought -- continuous                     97

        ford, zaphod and trillian enter the dimly lit temple.
        they hear a faint, tinny sound. they follow it.

        further down the corridor...

        the sound gets louder. tinny music. and laughter...
        flickering light illuminates the end of the corridor.

                             zaphod
                     this is it!

        he quickens his pace. trillian and ford follow.      they
        round the corner to find...

        deep thought -- sitting there majestically.     the tinny
        music emanates from somewhere near him.

        zaphod takes another step in and now sees the source of
        the tinny music.

        deep thought is watching tv.     a violent, stupid cartoon.

                             zaphod (cont'd)
                     deep thought...!

                              deep thought
                     shhh.   this is a good bit.

        the cartoon continues. zaphod enters, removes his
        thinking cap and reverently approaches. he kneels...

                             zaphod
                     oh great deep thought...we have traveled
                     long...and far.
                     have you calculated... the ultimate
                     question? of life, the universe and
                     everything?

                              deep thought
                     no.

                              zaphqd
                     no?

                             deep thought
                     i've been watching tv.

                              zaphod
                     oh...

        zaphod holds a smile but his world is slowly crumbling.

                             deep thought
                     i designed another computer to perform
                     that great task.

                             zaphod
                     oh, right...i forgot.
                        (looking around)
                     is it here?

                             deep thought
                     not here. another world.

                             zaphod
                     it's on another world?

                             deep thought
                     it is another world. or was.

                              zaphod
                     where?

                             deep thought
                     ask your companion.

        zaphod turns to ford.     ford looks confused.

                             deep thought (cont'd)
                     not him.

        zaphod looks to trillian. she looks equally confused.
        zaphod puts the thinking cap back on. strains hard.

                             zaphod
                     0kay -- you're sure you don't have the
                     question?
                     or a way to you, you know -- access it or
                     something. i think i've done like a lot
                     to get here...

                          deep thought
                  shhhhhh...

        zaphod looks up.    deep thought is shushing him?

                          deep thought (cont'd)
                  the show's back on.

        a robotic arm reaches out and turns up the volume.

        zaphod stands, turns to ford and trillian, smiles that
        smile -- but it's starting to look a bit crazed.

                          zaphod
                  great. this is just great. let's go find
                  something else for my entire life to be
                  about.

        he starts to march off.    ford grabs his arm.

                          ford
                  zaphod. the gun? the one humma sent us
                  for? we have to get it. you gave the guy
                  your head.

                            zaphod
                  i know.    why did i do that?

        he pulls his thinking cap down -- all the way over his
        eyes. ford rolls his eyes, turns...

                          ford
                  um...deep thought? we we're told you have
                  a g...

        before he finishes the sentence, a panel in the wall
        slides open revealing a large, scary looking gun. a
        robotic arm pushes it forward.

        ford goes over, takes it, carries it like it's
        nitroglycerin to zaphod who's already walking away,

        corridor leading away from deep thought

        ford hands zaphod the gun.

                             ford (cont'd)
                  here.     take it. i don't do guns.

        zaphod takes it with a smile...

                          zaphod
                  thank you.

        ...and instantly points it at his head. ford lunges for
        it. there's a struggle. ford's trying to get zaphod's
        finger off the trigger when click! the trigger is
        pulled. ford winces. but apparently, nothing has
        happened.

                            zaphod (cont'd)
                  great!    this is a bust, too!

                           ford
                  hey, man, you must be really frustrated.
                  to go through all you did only to come
                  here and get no answer, which means no
                  fame and money, and you deserve that, man.
                  because you're great -- you're just
                  really, really great.

        zaphod isn't sure what just happened. but he smiles
        anyway. trillian, however, is onto something.

                         trillian
                  give me that thing.
