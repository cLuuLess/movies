56      ext. viltvodle 6. spaceport. - night                          56

        all we can see are the lights of the heart of gold's
        entry ramp cutting through a dense fog. or is it fog?

        zaphod's 2nd head is up as he comes down the ramp ahead
        of the other three.

                             zaphod head 2
                     humma kavula!

        back a few steps with arthur, trillian and ford...

                             arthur
                     why does he keep saying that?

                             trillian
                     i don't know. i'm not used to seeing him
                     this way.

                             arthur
                     you mean fully clothed?

        she stops, fires him a look.

                             arthur (cont'd)
                     sorry, but i can't for the life of me
                     figure out why you, the most brilliant
                     woman i have ever met, have ended up with
                     that half-witted, self-obsessed, vapid
                     politician! i mean, look at him!

        they squint through the fog at zaphod, head 2 out. his
        hands keep trying to get it down but the 3rd arm keeps
        whacking them away. he disappears into the fog.

                             trillian
                     clearly unlike any guy i've ever met.
                        (back to arthur)
                     look, if you're going to pout your way
                     around space, then maybe you should just
                     go home.

                              arthur
                     i can't. that's the whole point -- and
                     i've been trying to tell you...

                              ford
                        (interrupting)
                     hey, look what i found in the guide.

        he hands the guide to trillian. she keeps walking.

                             ford (cont'd)
                     i wouldn't tell her if i were you.

                             arthur
                     she deserves to know.

                              ford
                     but if you tell her and she ends up with
                     you because you're literally the last guy
                     on earth -- you'll always doubt her
                     intentions.

        arthur considers this.      nods.

                             ford (cont'd)
                     got your towel?

                             arthur
                     do i need it?

                             ford
                     only always.

        ford puts his towel to his mouth as they follow trillian
        down the mist covered street. she's reading the guide.

                     in the beginning, the universe was created.
                     this made a lot of people very angry and
                     has been widely regarded as a bad move.

        zaphod continues several steps ahead of them.

                             guide voice (cont'd)
                     many races believe that it was created by
                     some sort of god, though the jatravartid
                     people of viltvodle 6 firmly believe that
                     the entire universe was in fact sneezed
                     out of the nose of a being called the
                     great green arkleseizure. the
                     jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear

                   of the time they call "the coming of great
                   white handkerchief" are small blue
                   creatures with more than fifty arms each.
                   ...who are therefore unique in being the
                   only race in history to have invented the
                   aerosol deodorant before the wheel.

        slam.   zaphod's two arms shove his chin back down.

                           zaphod
                   i'll handle this.

        the others approach, watching zaphod as he stops a
        passing an eight-armed alien creature, asks him
        something, oozing charm. the creature points down the
        street with 3 arms, then with 2 others hands him a pen
        and paper. zaphod signs an autograph and moves on.

        the alien beams, then squirts three cans of aerosol under
        several arms. more mist rises. follow it up revealing:

57      a large building -- a temple with two giant arches.           57

        the others follow. camera tilts up and we see this
        building looks like a nose lying horizontally, the "giant
        arches" are the nostrils.
