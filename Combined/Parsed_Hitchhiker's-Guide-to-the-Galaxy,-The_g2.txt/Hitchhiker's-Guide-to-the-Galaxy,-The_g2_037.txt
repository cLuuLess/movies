46      int. temple of deep thought.                                46

        the aisles are lined with priest-technicians. ahead is
        deep thought - a huge buddha-esque computer.

        the procession peels away to both sides. lunkwill and
        fook dismount and approach.

                          deep thought
                     (deep and sonorous)
                  what is this great task for which i, deep
                  thought, the second greatest computer of
                  all time have been called into existence?

                          lunkwill
                  your task, o computer...

                          fook
                  hang on. did you say second greatest?

                          deep thought
                  second greatest. yes.

                          fook
                  but we designed you to be the greatest
                  computer so you could...

                          lunkwill
                  you're not talking about the milliard
                  gargantubrain which can count all the
                  atoms in a star in a millisecond?

                          deep thought
                  the milliard gargantubrain? a mere abacus,
                  mention it not.

                          fook
                  the omnicognate neutron wrangler then?

                             deep thought
                     the omnicognate neutron wrangler could
                     argue all four legs off an arcturan
                     megadonkey, but only i could persuade it
                     to go for a walk afterwards.

                             fook
                     then what's the problem?

                             deep thought
                     i am the greatest computer you are able to
                     design without my help. which, one day,
                     you are going to need.

                              lunkwill
                         (to fook)
                     let's just ask the question.

                              fook
                     oh deep thought, your task is this. we
                     want you to tell us -- the answer.

        long pause.    deep thought bleeps and bloops.

                             deep thought
                     the answer...to what?

                              lunkwill
                     you know. the answer.      to life...the
                     universe...everything.

                              fook
                     we'd really like an answer. something
                     simple. can you do it?

                             deep thought
                     the ultimate question of life, the
                     universe and everything. yes. there is an
                     answer. but i'll have to think about it.

        lunkwill glances at his time piece, fook at the expectant
        throng behind them. they wait.

                             deep thought (cont'd)
                     return to this place in exactly... seven and
                     a half million years.

                              lunkwill & fook
                     what?!

        psssh.   the screen goes to snow.
