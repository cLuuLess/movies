         close on zaphod

                           zaphod
                   ...and you're right, i shouldn't be so
                   upset 'cause life goes on and i should
                   just go on with it, right?

         pull back to reveal -- ford is hesitantly aiming the gun
         at zaphod.

                           trillian
                   shoot him again.

         ford reluctantly pulls the trigger.    click.

                           zaphod
                  hitchhiking is good.    towels are good,
                  too.

                          trillian
                  brilliant.

                            ford
                  yeah.    i kinda like this.

         she take the gun from him.

                          trillian
                  a gun that makes people suddenly see
                  things from your point of view. useful
                  tool for the deranged evangelist trying to
                  convert the masses, eh?

         she starts walking.

                          trillian (cont'd)
                  we should get back. arthur's waiting.

                          zaphod
                  who cares?

                          trillian
                     (spinning on him; pointed)
                  i do -- especially since we're both
                  somewhat of an endangered species now.

                           zaphod
                   why so edgy?

         she can't believe he's asking this.     she aims the gun,
         click!

                           zaphod (cont'd)
                   of course you're edgy, your planet's been
                   blown up and you've been tooling around
                   the galaxy with the guy who signed the
                   order

         click.   she shoots him again.

                           zaphod (cont'd)
                   you actually wanted to know the question
                   because you always thought there was more
                   to life, and now you're crushed because
                   you find out there really isn't.

         she's getting angrier and more hurt.     click.

                              zaphod (cont'd)
                      you've got no home, no family, no one to
                      be with -- and you're stuck with me,
                      another in a long line of men who doesn't
                      appreciate you because he's too busy
                      appreciating himself.

         hearing this puts a lump in her throat, causes her eyes
         to well with tears. she lowers the gun.

         zaphod shakes his head -- the effect wearing off.       but he
         realizes what he said and doesn't like it.

                              zaphod (cont'd)
                      give me that thing.

         he grabs the gun, points it at her.

                              trillian
                      won't affect me.   i'm already a woman.

         before he can react, a bright light shines behind them.
         they turn, shielding their eyes.

                              zaphod
                      uh oh -- oh. it's okay, it's only a
                      couple of...

         flash! keeeooow!    they are engulfed in white light.
