58      int. arkleseizure temple - continuous                         58

        zaphod opens the huge doors inside the large
        nostril/arches. a rush of air blows the mist past ford,
        trillian and arthur a few steps behind. they stop.

        a congregation of worshipers faces front where humma kavula
        stands behind a podium. he's a humanoid wearing a white
        robe and night-vision sun glasses.

                           humma kavula
                   the handkerchief is coming, beloveds. are
                   you ready? let us pray that the almighty
                   will exhale a breath of compassion on us.

        instead of bowing, they all point their noses heavenward.
        zaphod marches down the center aisle while humma prays.

                           humma kavula (cont'd)
                   almighty arkleseizure, we lift our noses,
                   clogged and unblown in reverence to you.

        zaphod stops a few feet away from humma's chair.

                           zaphod
                   hello, humma.

        on ford and arthur

                             arthur
                     that's humma kavula? i thought he was
                     just using a swear word.

                             ford
                        (shaking his head)
                     humma kavula was his opponent in the
                     election. something happened during the
                     campaign. zaphod never forgave him.

                             arthur
                     what was it?

        ford shrugs.    humma looks up, sees zaphod, smiles.

                             humma kavula
                        (wrapping up the prayer)
                     send the handkerchief, lord, so that it may
                     wipe us clean. we ask this in your
                     precious holy name...

                              congregation
                     achoo.

        and they all sneeze. akin to crossing himself, humma
        raises a hand to his nose, then down again.

                             humma kavula
                     bless you.
