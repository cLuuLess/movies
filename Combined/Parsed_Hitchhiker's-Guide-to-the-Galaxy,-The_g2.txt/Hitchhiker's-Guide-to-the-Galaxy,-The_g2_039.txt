48      int. temple of deep thought --                                     48

        lunkwill and fook enter the now modern temple, flanked by a
        crowd. they have beards and look like they're in their
        40's. deep thought rises, looks lifeless. worried mutters
        from the crowd. slowly, deep thought groans to life.

                             deep thought
                     can i help you?

                             fook
                     deep thought.    do you have...

                             deep thought
                     an answer for you? yes. i have.

                             fook
                     there really is an answer?

                             deep thought
                     yes. there really is one.

                                fook
                           (almost strangled with emotion)
                     oh!

                             lunkwill
                     can you tell us what it is?

                             deep thought
                     yes. though i don't think you're going to
                     like it.

                             fook
                     doesn't matter! we must know it!

                             deep thought
                     you're really not going to like it.

                             fook
                     tell us!

                             deep thought
                     alright. the answer to the ultimate
                     question ...

                               lunkwill
                     yes ...

                             deep thought
                     ... of life, the universe, and everything ...

                                fook
                     yes!

                             deep thought
                     ... is ...

                                crowd
                     yes ...!

                             deep thought
                     (longest pause yet)
                     forty two.

        the surrounding crowd is stunned.    more muttering.

                             deep thought (o.s.) (cont'd)
                     i checked it thoroughly. it would have
                     been simpler, of course, to have known
                     what the actual question was.

                             lunkwill
                     but it was the question. the ultimate
                     question!

                             deep thought
                     yes, but what actually is it?

                             fook (o.s.)
                     everything! you know ... just everything!

                             deep thought (o.s.)
                     that's not a question. only when you know
                     what the actual question will you know
                     what the answer means.

                             lunkwill
                     give us the ultimate question then!!

                             deep thought
                     i can't.
                        (long pause)
                     but there is one who can. a computer that
                     is to come after me, one that i will
                     design. a computer to calculate the
                     ultimate question, one of such infinite
                     complexity that life itself will form part
                     of its operational matrix. and you
                     yourselves shall take on new more primitive
                     forms and go down into the computer to
                     navigate its ten million year program. i
                     shall design this computer for you. and it
                     shall be called...

        the picture distorts and whites out.    psssshhhhhh.
