59      int. humma's quarters - continuous                             59

        humma's quarters are opulent. he sits behind his desk
        flanked by several armed body guards. ford, arthur and
        trillian keep a safe distance as zaphod faces off with
        humma who has the air of a cool news anchor man.

                         humma kavula
                 zaphod beeblebrox, our famous president.
                 the arkleseizure has exhaled many
                 blessings upon you. what brings you to
                 our humble planet?

                         zaphod
                 i think you know why i'm here.

                         humma kavula
                 i don't think i do.

                         zaphod
                 oh, i think you think you don't, but we
                 both know -- you do.

                         humma kavula
                 elequent as always, zaphod. your ability
                 to communicate a clear thought never
                 ceases to amaze.

        head 2 suddenly springs up -- to the surprise of all.

                         zaphod head 2
                 you called me stupid!

                         humka kavula
                    (re: the heads)
                 interesting. and i don't know what you're
                 talking about.

                         zaphod head 2
                 during the campaign, humma -- you said i
                 was stupid.

                         humma kavula
                 this humma you speak of no longer exists.
                 he came here in his consolation position
                 as ambassador to gamma z10 to squelch an
                 ideological threat to the system and
                 repented from his wicked ways. he now
                 goes by the holy name tazelo the
                 unceasingly righteous, given to him by his
                 devoted followers.

                            zaphod head 2
                     i don't care what you call yourself, you
                     righteous freak!! you started the rumor
                     that i'm stupid and you're gonna pay!!!

        the 3rd arm reaches for a gun in zaphod's vest. the body
        guards aim their weapons. one runs up and smacks zaphod
        in the back of the head -- slamming head 2 back in place.

                            zaphod
                     thank you.

        the 3rd arm disappears.      the gun falls.   a body guard
        picks it up.

        with arthur, ford and trillian

                            arthur
                     why do i get the feeling he's going to get
                     us all killed?

                            ford
                     probably because it's very possible.    just
                     don't save me, okay? we're even.

        humma lays his palms on the table and lifts himself as if
        to stand - but there is nothing of him below the table
        line except for thirty, one inch metal legs, attached to
        the base of his torso. he glides towards zaphod, the
        little legs extending to reach the floor as he reaches
        the end of the table.

                          humma kavula
                  the election is ancient history, zaphod,
                  but if memory serves -- you won, proving
                  that good looks and charm win over
                  brilliance and ability to govern.

        a guard drapes a white robes over humma's shoulders - which
        he ties with a belt - hiding his peculiar undercarriage.

                          humma kavula (cont'd)
                  and incidently -- you are stupid.

        his head jerks up.   zaphod stops it, paints on a smile.

                          zaphod
                  that's really not the point.

                          humma kavula
                  you haven't come halfway across the galaxy
                  to settle a campaign grudge. why are you
                  here, zaphod?

        zaphod doesn't answer. humma motions to a guard who
        grabs his arm, twists it -- hard.

                          zaphod
                     (wincing)
                  i don't know. i was headed for magrathea,
                  i ended up here.

        push in on humma -- who raises his hi-tech sun glasses.

                          humma kavula
                  how very, very...
                     (knowingly)
                  ...improbable.

        he pulls the nose off his body guard, turns a key.    a
        secret safe door slides open from the mans' chest.

                          humma kavula (cont'd)
                  i kept a few souvenirs from my former
                  life. ah, the heady days of space
                  piracy... so young, so foolish..,

        another, smaller box rises from the chest cabinet. inside
        we see glowing jewels, a skeleton hand, etc. humma
        removes a pink cube (like zaphod's blue cube.)

                          humma kavula (cont'd)
                  i'll gladly give you the coordinates to
                  magrathea...

        he holds up the pink cube revealing a series of
        coordinate numbers on each side. zaphod reaches for it.
        humma takes it back...

                          humma kavula (cont'd)
                  ...provided you bring me something in
                  return.

                             zaphod
                   what?

                             humma kavula
                   a gun.

                             zaphod
                   a gun?

                           humma kavula
                   a very special gun. designed by the
                   greatest computer ever invented, now
                   buried in the bowels of magrathea.

                           zaphod
                   fine. i'll get your gun.    just give me
                   the coordinates.

        zaphod reaches out.    humma pulls it back.

                           humma kavula
                   and what will you give me to insure your
                   return?

                           zaphod
                   my word as president.

                           humma kavula
                   ha! i'd be better off with the dung of a
                   bethusian mega donkey.

                           zaphod
                   okay, then i'll get you that.

                           humma kavula
                   i need a hostage, something you hold dear.
                   only what does zaphod beeblebrox treasure?

        on zaphod's second head -- peeping out of the collar
        looking terrified.

        humma smiles. bingo. he signals the guards. they grab
        zaphod who looks back to trillian, offers a weak smile.

                                                      smash cut to:
