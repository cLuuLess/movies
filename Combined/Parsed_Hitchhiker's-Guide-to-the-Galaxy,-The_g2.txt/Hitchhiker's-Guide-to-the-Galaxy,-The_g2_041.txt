                     the infinite improbability drive is a new
                     method of crossing vast interstellar
                     distances without all that tedious mucking
                     about in hyperspace. as soon as the drive
                     reaches infinite improbability, it passes
                     through every conceivable point in every
                     conceivable universe almost simultaneously,
                     then selects the appropriate re-entry
                     point. the principle of generating small
                     amounts of finite improbability by hooking
                     the logic circuits of a bambleweeny 57 sub-
                     meson brain to an atomic vector plotter
                     suspended in a strong brownian motion
                     producer, say a nice hot cup of tea, were
                     of course well understood.

        seconds later, the vogon destroyer comes out of
        hyperspace and slows to cruising speed.
