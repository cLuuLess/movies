        ford stands outside a stone doorway at the end of a
        cobblestone street. zaphod's body falls to the ground
        next to him, untwists, unbends and snaps bolt upright
        beside them.

        trillian is already heading down the street toward the
        temple. ford and zaphod hurry to catch up to her.
