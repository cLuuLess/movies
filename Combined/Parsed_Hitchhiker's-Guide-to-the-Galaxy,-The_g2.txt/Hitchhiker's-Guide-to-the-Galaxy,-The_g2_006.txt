10   ext. back ik the pub - continuous                              10

     arthur stares into his beer, plagued by this loss.

                          arthur
                  "would you like to see my spaceship?"
                  really, what sort of chat up line is that?

                          ford
                  more popular than you'd think.

                          arthur
                  i've left messages, sent letters... it's
                  like she's vanished off the face of the
                  earth.

                            ford
                   hey, it happens. speaking of...
                      (pulling a blinking electronic
                       device from his satchel)
                   we've got two minutes. so drink up.

      there's a roar of engines and a loud crash outside.
      arthur and everyone else in the pub look up.

                           arthur
                   my house!

      he runs out. ford rises, grabs two handfuls of peanuts from
      the bowl, tosses the barman all the money in his pocket.

                           ford
                   a round for everyone, on me.

                           barman
                   you really think the world's going to end?
                      (ford nods)
                   shouldn't we lie down or put a bag over
                   our heads or something?

                           ford
                   if you want.

                           barman
                   will it help?

                           ford
                   not really.

      he gives everyone in the bar a friendly salute, exits.

                           barman
                   last orders, then?
