         several patrons watch the wall of tv's, all projecting a
         snowy, distorted image. jeltz's voice blares through the
         speakers.

                      ...and, unfortunately, your planet is one
                      of those scheduled for demolition. the
                      process will take slightly less than two
                      of your earth minutes. thank you.

         stampede down oxford street, screaming.
