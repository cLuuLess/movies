    2   int. hold of vogon constructor ship - night                        22

        arthur, in total shock, holds up the guide.

                             arthur
                     so you're not from guilford, which would
                     explain the accent -- which i've always
                     wondered about...and you're not an out of
                     work actor -- but rather a writer for
                     this...this...book thing.

        ford nods.    arthur rubs his weary brow.

                             arthur (cont'd)
                     i don't feel well. i need a cup of tea.

        ford hands him a fistful of peanuts.

                             ford
                     here. eat these. if you've never been
                     through a transmat beam before you've
                     probably lost some salt and protein.

        arthur eats some peanuts, sits up, squints. ford feels
        his way around the room, looking for something.

                             arthur
                     if i asked where we were would i regret

                             ford
                     we're safe. for now.

                             arthur
                     good.

                             ford
                     we're in a storage hold in one of               the
                     ships of the vogon constructor fleet ...

                             arthur
                     obviously some strange usage of the word
                     safe i wasn't previously aware of.

                             ford
                        (not getting the sarcasm)
                     is it?

                             arthur
                     tell me you're joking.

                             ford
                     okay. i'm joking.

                             arthur
                     and do a reassuring little laugh.

        ford does a reassuring little laugh.

                             arthur (cont'd)
                     now tell me where we really are.

                          ford
                  in the storage hold of a vogon constructor
                  ship.

        ford continues his search.   arthur's breathing quickens.

                          arthur
                  get me home. ford.

                          ford
                  home? arthur...your home... is...

                          arthur
                  oh god - it was demolished! i've got to
                  reach my lawyer! he must be back from
                  lunch by now...

        he pulls out his cell phone. desperately punches numbers.
        ford flips on a light switch, revealing a messy chamber
        full of alien junk and old mattresses.

                           ford
                   you don't remember, do you?
                       (taking his cell phone)
                   okay. i've got something to tell you. it
                   ain't gonna be easy, but you're gonna have
                   to just deal, okay?

                           arthur
                   good god. is this really the interior of a
                   flying saucer?

                           ford
                   yeah. why?

                           arthur (v.o.)
                   well, it's a bit squalid isn't it?

                           ford (v.o.)
                   hey man, you're in denial.
