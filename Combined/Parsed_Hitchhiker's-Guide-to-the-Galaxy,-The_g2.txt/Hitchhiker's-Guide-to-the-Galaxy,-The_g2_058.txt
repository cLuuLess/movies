         their p.o.v. -- there are rows and rows of dull, gray,
         rectangular buildings as far as the eye can see.

                    this will all end in tears, i just know
                    it.

         marvin moves out, a few paces behind.

                            ford
                    i checked the guide for ways to rescue a
                    prisoner from vogsphere. it said "don't."
                    i'm assuming your plan is better.

                             arthur
                     well, i sort of had this idea we could...

        a telescopic rod with a paddle at the top shoots out of
        the ground, smacks arthur on the face, then retracts.

        arthur is stunned. none of the others have noticed.

                             arthur (cont'd)
                     did anyone see that?

                             zaphod
                     see what?

        they look at arthur. it suddenly seems ridiculous.

                             arthur
                     nothing.

        they all walk along - arthur at the back, perplexed.

                             ford
                     what was it?

                             arthur
                     nothing. just my imagination.

        another paddle springs up, double smack in the face.
        arthur leaps back. looks down. nothing. nothing at all.

                             arthur (cont'd)
                     alright, stop. everyone stop and watch
                     me. something's happening.

        they watch.    arthur walks. and walks.

                                ford
                     okay.     i think we...

        a paddle springs up and smacks ford's face.

                               ford (cont'd)
                     ah!

        he leaps back, clutching his cheeks.      arthur spins around.

                             arthur
                     you, too?

                               ford
                     yes.    what was that?

        arthur lifts his feet very carefully.

                               ford (cont'd)
                     i th...

        he stops himself and looks round.

                  what do you think, zaphod?

        zaphod pulls his thinking cap down, thinks hard.

                          zaphod
                  i think we should keep going.

        a paddle shoots up, smacks zaphod's face.    they all saw.

                           zaphod (cont'd)
                  aaah!!

                          arthur
                  what the blazes is that?

                          ford
                     (very deliberately)
                  i have... an idea.

        a paddle shoots up. ford ducks. it misses. he grabs its
        telescopic stalk. it thrashes in his hands. he breaks it.

                         ford (cont'd)
                  okay, don't think of anything.     don't have
                  ideas or theories -- nothing.

        a beat. they all strain to think of nothing.     several
        paddles shoot up. smacking them.

                         arthur
                  i can't, help it!    trillian is in there
                  somewhere and we need an idea to save her.

                          zaphod
                  i have an idea. (smack!) run!

                          ford
                  ever the politician.

        they take off running. a forest of paddle stalks erupts
        out of the ground around them, smacking violently.

        they come to rest at the side of a vogon building.

                          arthur
                  okay, so...
                     (thinking)
                  ...not thinking, not thinking, no ideas
                  coming...
                     (looking to marvin)
                  ...this is by no means an idea that has
                  any merit, but marvin -- can you give me a
                  hand?
