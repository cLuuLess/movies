int. principal kelly's office - moments later

mr. kelly makes a note in jamie's file.

                         mr. kelly
               finding the real world to your
               liking, mr. carter?

                         landon
               i want to come back.

                         mr. kelly

                    (looking up,
                    surprised)
               back? were you ever really here?

they both know kelly has the upper hand. kelly leans back
in his chair, relishing it.

                         landon
                    (mumbling)
               i want to graduate.

kelly studies landon, the boy who can't get out of his own
way.

                         mr. kelly
                    (thinking aloud)
               you could grace our hallowed halls
               again, if, while you're here, you
               make a sincere effort to be part
               of our little school community --

                         landon
                    (relieved)
               i'd do that --

                         mr. kelly
               how would you do that, mr. carter?

landon shrugs, clueless.

                         mr. kelly
                    (smiling)
               shall i give you a few ideas?

                         landon
                    (smiling, too)
               please.

                         mr. kelly
               besides attending all your regular
               classes, i'd like you to help our
               janitorial staff after school --

                         landon
               for pay?

                         mr. kelly
               for the inner satisfaction it will
               bring.
                    (beat)
               saturday mornings, i'd like you to
               tutor disadvantaged students at
               our sister school --

                         landon
                    (joking)
               i'm as underprivileged as they
               are --

                         mr. kelly

               the fact that you attend this
               school makes you privileged.

his tone quiets landon.

                         mr. kelly
               finally, i'd like you to join the
               drama club. rehearsals are
               tuesday and thursday evenings.

                         landon
                    (grumbling)
               i'd work backstage or something?

                         mr. kelly
               or something. they're doing a
               play for the holidays.

                         landon
               when do i get time for me?

                         mr. kelly
               you don't. that's the point.

landon's not happy, but he'll work with this. as he heads
for the door:

                         mr. kelly
                    (softer, trying to
                    reach him)
               landon, none of us faculty see you
               the way you see yourself.
                    (beat)
               some of us remember how your
               father --

                         landon
               then you remember more than i do.

close on broom

pushing gum wrappers under a radiator.
