quiet. landon, eric and clay are banged up.

                         clay
               christ, man.

                         landon

               you okay?

                         eric
               yeah.

belinda's head leans on the dash. her shoulders shake.
landon, bleeding on the forehead, reaches over. scared.

                         landon
               belinda?

she lifts her head. looks at him. she's laughing. he
kicks his door out.
