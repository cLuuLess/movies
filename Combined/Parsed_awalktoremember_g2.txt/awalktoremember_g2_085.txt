ext. jefferson high - basketball blacktop - minutes later

landon and luis face each other across the half-court.
landon's got a ball and is further from the basket.

                         landon
               you, me, and the basket. we're
               the three corners of a triangle.
               take one step in.

landon and luis both step forward.

                         landon
               am i at the same angle to you and
               the basket as before?

                         luis
               yeah.

                         landon
               are you?

                         luis

               yeah.

                         landon
               so what did we just make?

                         luis
               a similar triangle?

                         landon
               what else? what kind of triangle
               has three sides of different
               lengths.

                         luis
               scalene?

                         landon
               okay. make me an isosceles.

luis steps outward, directly opposite landon.

                         landon
               yes! two sides the same.

landon tosses him the ball. they play. jamie glances
over from a picnic table where she works with her student,
isabel. landon looks at her, she looks away, he looks
back. thoughtful. watching her. but not staring.
