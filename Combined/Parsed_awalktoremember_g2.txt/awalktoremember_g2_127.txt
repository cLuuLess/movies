int. batting cage - night

jamie's in the cage with a helmet on. a machine tosses
balls. landon coaches from outside.

                         landon
               swing! keep your bat parallel to
               the ground. follow through.
               follow through!

jamie is laughing too hard to hit anything. the balls
keep coming. she ducks out of the way and grasps the
fence and leans in. landon leans in on his side. they'd
be embracing if the fence weren't there.

in the b.g., kids from their school. giggling,
whispering.

landon looks over at them.

                         landon
                    (to jamie)
               let's go.
