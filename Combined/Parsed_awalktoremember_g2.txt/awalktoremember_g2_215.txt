int. church - reverend's office - next morning

landon stands in the doorway. the reverend is wiping his
glasses, his face, maybe of tears. he sees landon.

                         rev. sullivan

               you finish?

                         landon
               a few minutes ago. i have to ask
               you something.

long pause.

                         rev. sullivan
               when i was seventeen, i was sent
               up for a year for stealing a car.
                    (beat)
               sometimes i still feel that boy
               inside me and i don't like him.
                    (beat)
               but i like you.

the reverend stands, offers landon his hand. landon takes
it. the two men shake. allies now.
