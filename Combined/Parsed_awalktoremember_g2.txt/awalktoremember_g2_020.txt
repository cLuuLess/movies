jamie (girl), hearing the laughter, gathers herself and
approaches landon's window, her sneakers crunching in the
gravel. she crosses her pilly brown sweater across her
chest.

                         jamie
                    (to landon,
                    tentative)
               hey. hi. your lights. any
               chance you could... turn them
               off --

                         belinda
                    (leaning over
                    landon)
               god give you this road?

                         jamie
               no --

                         belinda
               then we'll be keeping the lights
               on.

                         landon
                    (to jamie, seeming
                    nice)
               if you want the lights off, i'll
               turn them off.

and he does. darkness.

                         jamie
               thank you. thank you so very
               much.

she backs away from the car, grateful. from the car:

                         belinda (o.s.)

               i can't see a friggin' thing.
