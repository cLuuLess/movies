ext. parsonage porch - wider - next evening

landon gives a cheery little wave. he's very sweaty. his
bike teeters on its kickstand in the b.g.

                         landon
               hey. landon carter.

landon offers his hand. the reverend shakes reluctantly,
eyeing him closely: landon's army boots, torn jeans,
dirty t-shirt, aloof manner.

                         rev. sullivan
                    (surprised)
               you're in the play?

                         landon
               lead man.

jamie slides out the door. she looks good in jeans and a
white t-shirt. almost normal. in the b.g., landon's bike
crashes over. he bounds down the porch steps.

                         landon
                    (explaining bike)
               they took my license for 30 days.
               but nobody's pressing charges.

the reverend looks at jamie, concerned. landon tries the
kickstand, then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed
bush. not the best place.

                         jamie
               i'll get something for us to
               drink --

                         landon
               don't bother!

but she's already gone. the reverend gestures toward the
open front door.
