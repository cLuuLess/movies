jamie fits the pieces of her telescope together.

                         landon
               when did you build this?

                         jamie
               i was twelve.

landon shakes his head, amazed.

                         jamie
               it's not that complicated.

landon doubts this.

                         jamie
               it's an alt-azimuth design with
               one parabolic mirror and one
               secondary flat one.

                         landon
               where's the one you're building?

                         jamie
               in my back yard.
                    (pause, embarrassed)
               i lied before. it's hardly
               started. but when it's done, it
               will have twice the power of this
               one --

                         landon

               wait, back up. you lied?

                         jamie
               kinda. yeah.

he grins, loving her even more.

                         jamie
               so what do you want to see?

                         landon
               mars.

                         jamie
               mars doesn't rise until 2:30

               a.m. --

he opens his backpack. pulls out the contents.

                         landon
               a thermos of hot coffee. a
               blanket. socks.

                         jamie
               you planned this --

                         landon
               hoped for it.

pause.

                         jamie
               are you trying to seduce me?

                         landon
               no. why? are you seducible?

                         jamie

                    (firm, but smiling)
               no.

                         landon
               that's what i thought.

he reaches back into his backpack. pulls out a second
blanket.

                         landon
               ergo, a second blanket. one for
               me, one for you.

he hands her one. she takes it, smiling, reassured.

                         jamie
               ergo?

                         landon
                    (slightly embarrassed)
               what about your father?

                         jamie
               i'm always home by midnight and
               he's always asleep.
