		int.  elevator - day
		
		as anderton hits a button...
		
		                    voice
		          hold that, please!
		
		anderton bangs the close button and the doors start to shut,
		keeps banging it, as the doors almost get there, when a foot
		blocks them and they part, revealing danny witwer.
		
		                    witwer
		          thanks.
		
		the doors close once more and they start down.  witwer
		smiling at anderton.
		
		                    witwer
		          you're in a lot of trouble, john.
		
		anderton steps back, keeps his hand near his .45.
		
		                    anderton
		          you set me up...
		
		                    witwer
		          i'll write the paranoia off to the
		          whiff you been doping on all night.
		
		witwer reaches into his coat and anderton grabs him and
		shoves him against the wall.  anderton's pistol already out,
		jammed up under witwer's chin.  witwer keeps his eyes on
		anderton as he slowly pulls out a black inhaler.
		
		                    witwer
		          it seems i've found a flaw, john
		              (then)
		          you.
		
		                    anderton
		          you gonna tell on me?
		
		                    witwer
		          possession alone will cost you six
		          months, not to mention your badge.
		
		anderton doesn't say anything.
		
		                    witwer
		          i guess we won't be working
		          together after all.
		
		witwer shakes his head.  ding.  the elevator arrives and the
		doors open.
		
		                    witwer
		          now put the gun down, john.  i
		          don't hear a red ball.
		
		the precrime siren goes off.  witwer looks at anderton, all
		of a sudden no longer so sure of himself.  anderton smiles,
		then shoves him back into the elevator and jumps off as the
		doors close on a stunned witwer.
