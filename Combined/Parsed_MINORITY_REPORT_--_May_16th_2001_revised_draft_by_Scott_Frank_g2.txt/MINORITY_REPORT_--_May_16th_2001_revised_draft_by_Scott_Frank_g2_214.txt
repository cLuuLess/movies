		int.  burgess' house - day
		
		a sad burgess sits with a drink in his hand watching the cnn
		coverage of the crow "murder".
		
		burgess shakes his head, as his wife comes in.
		
		                    wife
		          danny witwer's on the phone.  he
		          says it's important.
		
		burgess mutes the set, watches as the attorney general,
		looking like shit right now, talks to the reporter.
		
		                    burgess
		              (into the phone)
		          what?
		
		we see the image of witwer in one corner of the tv screen.
		
		                    witwer
		          lamar, i found something.
		
		                    burgess
		          what?
		
		                    witwer
		          i don't wanna say over the phone,
		          but i think we may be chasing the
		          wrong man.
		
		                    burgess
		              (beat)
		          where are you?
