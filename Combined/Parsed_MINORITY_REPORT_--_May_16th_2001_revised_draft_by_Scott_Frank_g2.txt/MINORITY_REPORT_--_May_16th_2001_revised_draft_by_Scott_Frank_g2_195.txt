		int.  hotel - day
		
		once grand, now pretty much a flophouse.  the skinny and
		skagged-out clerk looks up from the tattoo magazine as
		anderton walks to the desk and looks around...
		
		                    clerk
		          room's are ninety-five a night plus
		          tax.
		              (regarding agatha)
		          or fifteen an hour.
		
		                    anderton
		          you mind if i take a look at your
		          register?
		
		                    clerk
		          yeah, i mind --
		
		the guy starts to get up and anderton pulls his gun, puts the
		muzzle in the guy's eye.
		
		                    anderton
		          how about now?
		
		he spins the register around so that anderton can read it.
		
		                    clerk
		          help yourself.
		
		anderton looks at the register...
		
		on the register
		
		as anderton runs the barrel of the gun down the inky list of
		names scrawled in the book.  most of them smith or jones.  he
		stops when he gets to l. crow.
		
		                    anderton
		          he's here.
		
		                    agatha
		          anderton, leave.
		
		he looks at her.
		
		                    agatha
		          you have a choice.  walk away.
		              (holds out her hand)
		          right now.
		
		he stands there a moment, torn.  he starts to close the
		register and follow her to the door.  but then he stops,
		takes his hand back.
		
		                    anderton
		          i can't.  i have to know.
		
		                    agatha
		          please --
		
		                    anderton
		          i have to find out what happened to
		          my life.
		              (then)
		          agatha.  i'm not going to kill the
		          man.  i don't even know him.
		
		she looks frightened.
		
		                    anderton
		          don't you understand, going
		          upstairs is the only way i'll ever
		          find out what's underneath all of
		          this.  who's setting me up.
		              (then)
		          i have to know.
		
		anderton turns to the clerk.
		
		                    anderton
		          what room's crow in?
		
		                    clerk
		          ten-o-six.
		
		anderton and agatha ride up.  the elevator looks out at the
		other buildings, people working in offices across the way. 
		anderton looks at his watch: counting down eleven minutes.
