		          what's the matter, lamar?  you see
		          the problem, don't you?  if you
		          don't kill me, it means the precogs
		          were wrong and precrime is over. 
		          if you do kill me, you go away,
		          but... it proves the system works. 
		          the precogs were right.
		
		burgess is now right in front of anderton, the gun inches
		from anderton's chest.
		
		                    anderton
		          so what do you do?
