		as burgess moves through the huge space looking this way and
		that for anderton...
		
		                    burgess
		          my god, john, a few hundred years
		          ago, they used to bleed the sick. 
		          twenty years ago, you had a tumor,
		          they'd cut it out of you, with a
		          knife, for christ's sake.
		
		he peers into a walk-in freezer as it's opened...
		
		                    burgess
		          since then the focus of medicine
		          has gone from cure to prevention. 
		          well, now law enforcement is going
		          the same way.
		
		as the freezer door is closed, he sees a moving reflection in
		the stainless steel, turns and sees anderton go through a
		door at the back.
		
		                    anderton (phone)
		          lamar, it's over.
