		we hear no sound as the cops burst into the room and grab
		anderton.  we see, but don't hear, lara scream as they throw
		him to the floor.
		
		he sees knott come forward, pulling the temporary halo from
		his belt.

		          john anderton, by mandate of the
		          district of columbia, precrime
		          division, i'm placing you under
		          arrest for the murders of leo crow
		          and danny witwer --
		
		lara sees the surprise in anderton's face as he now turns at
		the mention of witwer's name --
		
		                    anderton
		          witwer --
		
		but another cop pulls his head back and begins to quickly
		shave his head, his hair falling onto the picture of his dead
		son.
		
		he looks over, sees agatha in the center of it all, the only
		one moving at normal speed, going from one cop to the next,
		whispering in their ears, startling them, until fletcher
		takes her by the arm and ushers her away...
		
		she nods and that's the last thing anderton sees before his
		body racks and goes stiff with a shock, and we then...
		
		fade to black.
		
		we hear a soft cooing voice, like someone talking to a
		baby...
		
		                    voice
		          that's it... that's my girl...
