		int.  precog temple - day
		
		anderton looks at agatha... who now opens her mouth and
		speaks:
		
		                    agatha
		          can you see?
		
		she looks at anderton, her eyes imploring him.  he thinks a
		moment, then starts to unhook all of the cables.  we hear
		witwer and his team trying to get through the jammed doors. 
		we hear as they finally blow the mechanism, then...
		
		                    witwer (o.s.)
		          john -- move away from the tank!
		
		anderton looks over as the team starts to come in.
		
		                    witwer
		          move away from the tank!
		
		agatha looks past him up at an orange lever.  nods.
		
		                    witwer
		          john --
		
		anderton throws the lever.  suddenly, a rush as the milk is
		quickly flushed from the tank.  witwer and the team rush up
		the steps as...
		
		witwer freezes, watches as the two male precogs flail about
		the milk, strapped into their harnesses while anderton and
		agatha are sucked out through a large drain.
		
		                    wally
		          oh, god...
		
		wally, crying now, lifts agatha's empty restraints and stares
		at it.
		
		                    wally
		          they've never been separated
		          before.
		
		                    witwer
		          what does he want with a precog?
		
		                    wally
		          what do you think?  so he can kill
		          whoever he wants to without anyone
		          knowing about it.
		
		                    witwer
		          but there's still the other two.
		
		wally doesn't say anything, just weeps over the tank.
		
		                    witwer
		          wally, the other two can still
		          function, right?
		
		                    wally
		          you don't understand... they're a
		          hive mind.  it takes all three for
		          their predictive abilities to work.
		
		                    witwer
		              (incredulous)
		          are you telling me they can't see
		          murders anymore?
		
		                    wally
		          maybe if he'd taken one of the
		          males.  but the female, she's the
		          key.  she's the one they listen to,
		          the one with the most talent.  the
		          one who takes care of the other
		          two.
		
		                    witwer
		              (staring at the remaining
		               two)
		          jesus...
		
		                    witwer
		              (tears in his eyes)
		          please, bring her back.
