		int.  rufus' dreamweaver headspa - day
		
		customers in dark corners, wearing bladdered bodysuits and
		tiny headsets, act out various fantasies.
		
		                    rufus
		          what's your pleasure?
		
		rufus riley -- heavy, goateed, ponytail down to his waist and
		a name tag that says "hi!  i'm rufus!" -- shows a nervous
		customer around the place.
		
		                    rufus
		          we got it all here.  we got guys
		          come in, want to experience sex as
		          a woman.  we got women come in,
		          want to get laid by their favorite
		          soap star.  we got rape fantasies
		          from both sides.  we got sports
		          fantasies.  and then we got what i
		          call the "look ma, i can fly"
		          fantasies which encompass
		          everything from bungee jumping to
		          soaring like an eagle over the
		          grand canyon.
		
		the nervous customer turns as we hear a man cry out.  he
		looks in and sees a man flailing about on a cushion.
		
		                    rufus
		          near death's real popular right
		          now, which includes everything from
		          getting hit by a car, to falling
		          off a high building to plane
		          crashes.  it's a big rush, you come
		          out the other side without a heart
		          attack.
		
		                    customer
		          i wanna kill my boss.
		
		                    rufus
		              (unfazed)
		          uh-huh.  okay.  you got some images
		          i can work with?
		
		                    customer
		              (holds out a disk)
		          right here.
		
		                    rufus
		          good.  what i can do is set you up
		          down in the --
		
		                    anderton
		          rufus...
		
		rufus sees anderton come in now with agatha on his arm.  he
		turns back to the guy, says in a loud voice...
		
		                    rufus
		          uh, yeah, being concert master of
		          the philadelphia symphony orchestra
		          is one of our most popular
		          choices...
		
		                    customer
		          no, i wanna kill my boss!
		
		                    rufus
		          get the hell outta here.  you sick
		          bastard.
		
		he pushes the man away, sending him tripping for the door.
		
		                    rufus
		          detective.  nice of you to come
		          down here.
		              (lowers his voice)
		          seeing as every cop in the world is
		          looking for you right now.  jesus,
		          what's up with your eye?
		
		                    anderton
		          i need your help.
		
		                    rufus
		          well, hey, you didn't have to come
		          all the way down here.  for you,
		          chief, i make housecalls...
		
		                    anderton
		          i need help with her.
		
		                    rufus
		              (just notices her)
		          well, hello there, honey-pie.
		
		barely able to yet stand, agatha is also too stunned by the
		bizarre surroundings to even respond as rufus takes her hand
		and kisses it.
		
		                    rufus
		          i'm impressed, anderton.  you're on
		          the lam, but you still got the time
		          and energy to slice off a little
		          jerky for yourself.
		
		                    anderton
		          rufus.  she's a precog.
		
		                    rufus
		              (looks at agatha)
		          she's a precog?
		
		                    anderton
		          that's right.
		
		rufus starts to laugh.  agatha looks at anderton.  rufus
		keeps on laughing... until he looks a little closer and
		realizes --
		
		                    rufus
		          you brought a precog -- here? 
		          jesus christ...
		
		and now rufus looks at agatha, a thought dawning and then
		drops to his knees.  he genuflects, looking up at her.
		
		                    rufus
		          are you reading my mind right now?
		
		                    anderton
		          rufus, for christ's sake, get up.
		
		                    rufus
		          i'm sorry for whatever i'm gonna
		          do!  and i swear, i didn't do any
		          of the stuff i did!
		
		anderton hauls him to his feet.
		
		                    anderton
		          she's got information inside of
		          her.  i need you to get it out.
		
		                    rufus
		          no.  no way.  i wouldn't even know
		          where to begin!
		              (to agatha)
		          those thoughts about my cousin
		          elena -- they were just thoughts. 
		          i would never --
		
		                    anderton
		          c'mon, rufus, you've been busted
		          twice for felony hacking.
		
		                    rufus
		          so?
		
		                    anderton
		          so now i need you to hack into her.
		
		rufus studies her a moment, then...
		
		                    rufus
		          i tell you what.  i do this, i get
		          to keep whatever images i get from
		          her head.
		
		                    anderton
		          they don't belong to anybody.
		
		                    rufus
		              (turns to go)
		          then take her to radio shack.
		
		anderton grabs rufus and throws him against the wall.  gets
		right in rufus' face... the one blown eye looking at him...
		
		                    anderton
		          do i look like i'm leaving?
