		ext.  tenement - night
		
		as fletcher and knott exit the precrime ship.  fletcher does
		a thermal reading on the building while they talk.
		
		                    knott
		          i'm thinking you must really like
		          me, don't you, fletcher?
		
		fletcher looks at him.
		
		                    knott
		          that's why you asked to partner
		          with me on this little sortie,
		          isn't it?
		
		                    fletcher
		          i think you're swell company,
		          knott.
		
		                    knott
		          it's not at all that you don't
		          trust me to be alone with the
		          chief.  that you think i might, you
		          know, fuck with him, if i had the
		          chance...
		
		knott grins at him now.  pleased with himself.
		
		                    fletcher
		          no, i just wanna watch him use your
		          body to sandblast another building. 
		          that's all.  jeff.
		
		and the grin goes away as fletcher looks through the scan
		lens on his helmet doing the thermal reading on the building.
