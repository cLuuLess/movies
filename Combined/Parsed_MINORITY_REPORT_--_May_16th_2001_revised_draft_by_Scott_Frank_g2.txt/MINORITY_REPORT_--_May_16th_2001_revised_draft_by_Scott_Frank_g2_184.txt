		int.  rufus riley's basement - day
		
		agatha, hooked into some kind of light reader, sits in a
		chair in the center of the room, surrounded by contraptions
		of all kinds.  rufus paces around, checking connections.
		
		                    rufus
		          okay, we're all set.  i can't
		          promise you the images are gonna be
		          any good, though.
		
		suddenly, there's a flood of murder-images (similar in type
		to the ones used upstairs in the cyber-parlor) beamed from
		the projector to the center of the room.
		
		                    rufus
		          good god...
		
		dozens of murders happening all around them.  agatha begins
		twitching.  the images shake, distort, go fuzzy, then clear
		again.  it's a rapid-fire display of all the murder and
		mayhem that agatha has been privy to, including the last
		image of the steel beam crushing young nathan.
		
		                    rufus
		              (watching)
		          you know what, chief?  on second
		          thought i don't think i wanna keep
		          any of these --
		
		but now we see anderton blow leo crow through a window.
		
		                    anderton
		          stop --
		
		                    rufus
		          tell me how.
		
		rufus tries in vain to work the equipment.  the images run on
		and now we see the face wearing sunglasses.  the number 9
		turning into the number 6.
		
		                    projected crow
		          you're not going to kill me...
		
		                    projected anderton
		          good-bye, crow.
		
		                    anderton
		          rufus -- can you record this?!
		
		rufus moves to the computer as now we see crow at the window,
		the face with the sunglasses behind him as he wrestles with
		the gun that anderton holds.
		
		the real anderton walks up to his projection, amazed to see
		his likeness frozen there, doing something he can't imagine.
		
		he watches as the image jumps and once more crow is blown out
		the window.  then we see nothing.
		
		                    anderton
		          what happened?  where's the rest?
		
		                    rufus
		          i guess that's all of it.
		
		anderton looks at agatha, her expression calm.
		
		                    anderton
		          is there a minority report?
		
		she just looks at him.  a what?
		
		                    anderton
		          an alternate future.  do i have
		          one?
		
		she looks at where the images were projected a moment ago.
		
		                    agatha
		          no.
		
		anderton is about to turn away.  she takes his hand, as she
		did in the temple, and suddenly the room is full of images:
		
		                    agatha
		          can you see?
		
		every single one of the images is the same: the screaming
		face of...
		
		                    anderton
		          anne lively...
		
		anderton looks at agatha.  her face is contorted in the same
		way as the image.  suddenly, there's a rush of images, we
		glimpse only some of them, two figures struggling, a splash. 
		anne lively drowning.  then nothing...
		
		                    anderton
		          why are you showing me this?  what
		          do you want me to see?
		
		she doesn't move, a single tear rolls down her cheek.
		
		                    anderton
		          rufus, play it back...
		
		                    rufus
		          uh, i'll try...
		
		and now we see the following images all playing backwards...
		anne lively being drown, but now she comes out of the lake...
		backwards.  we see anne lively on the ground by the lake,
		struggling with a masked figure.  suddenly, the figure pops
		up and runs backwards.  she pops up a second later (a stumble
		in reverse) and runs backwards.  now we see an overcoat being
		put on, turning inside out, from dark to light.
		
		anderton looks about the room, the images all around him. 
		the dark figure is just about to take off the mask when --
		
		the images stop and agatha holds on tight to him.
		
		                    anderton
		          what?
		
		                    agatha
		          they're inside.
		
		                    anderton
		          who?
		
		suddenly, a red light flashes on the wall.  rufus scrambles
		to a security monitor.
		
		                    rufus
		          your old teammates.
		
		insert monitor: witwer leads a team through the parlor.
