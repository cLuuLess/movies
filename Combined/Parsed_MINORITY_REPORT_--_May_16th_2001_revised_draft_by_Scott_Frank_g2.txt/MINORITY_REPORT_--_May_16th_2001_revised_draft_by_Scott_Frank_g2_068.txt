		int.  television sound stage - morning
		
		a talkshow.  a woman moderator sits in front of a backdrop
		that reads "double exposure".  anderton now in a suit and tie
		sits with the moderator and a woman in a dark suit.
		
		                    moderator
		          a week from today conventions will
		          meet in every state to vote on the
		          ratification of the precrime
		          amendment.  with us to discuss this
		          historic decision are chief john
		          anderton of precrime in washington
		          d.c. and ms. dinola margis,
		          director of the american freedom
		          foundation.  both of you, thanks
		          for being here.
		
		                    anderton/margis
		          geraldine.  thanks for having me.
		
		                    moderator
		          ms. margis, let me start with you. 
		          last year, more people in this
		          country lost their lives to murder
		          than to natural causes.  doesn't
		          such unparalleled violence require
		          that we protect our citizens,
		          whatever it takes?
		
		                    margis
		          no, geraldine, not at the price of
		          giving up our most fundamental
		          rights.  for almost three centuries
		          now, every accused citizen has had
		          the right to be presumed innocent
		          until found guilty.  but, here, we
		          have the beginnings of a system
		          that punishes people for crimes
		          that haven't even been committed. 
		          i feel stuck in a nightmare.
		
		and now we see burgess standing in the wings, watching now as
		anderton smiles, revs up the charm.
		
		                    anderton
		          you forget, dinola, that the
		          supreme court has ruled that the
		          precogs predictions as foregone,
		          metaphysical conclusions.  meaning
		          what the precogs say is going to
		          happen, happens.
		              (then)
		          unless we stop it.
		
		                    margis
		          you know, the eutruscans used to
		          read sheep livers to predict the
		          future.  maybe we should try that
		          one next.
		
		                    anderton
		          that's funny.  but the truth is,
		          our constitution has always
		          recognized that in times of great
		          danger we may have to take actions
		          that... offend certain principles
		          in order to preserve the nation
		          itself.
		
		burgess looks at anderton and nods.  that's my boy.  anderton
		nods back, turns back to the table as we...
		
		                                             dissolve to:
