		anderton looks over at the precog, staring out the window at
		the unfamiliar rush of humanity all around her.  she shivers.
		
		                    anderton
		          are you cold?
		
		he moves to put his coat over her and she looks at his hand.
		
		                    anderton
		          can you understand me?
		
		she holds onto his hand, is fixated by it.
		
		                    anderton
		          it's the drugs.  they'll wear off
		          in a few hours.
		
		she looks up, stares out the window now at the world she's
		never been a part of.
		
		                    anderton
		          i'm sorry, but i need your help. 
		          you contain information.  i need to
		          know how to get it.
		              (then)
		          can you just tell me who leo crow
		          is?  can you tell me if --
		
		                    agatha
		          is it now?
		
		                    anderton
		          what?
		
		                    agatha
		          is it now?
		
		he looks outside, understands what she means.  then...
		
		                    anderton
		          yes... this is all happening right
		          now.
		
		she nods, closes her eyes.
		
		                    agatha
		          i'm tired...
		              (then)
		          i'm tired of the future.
