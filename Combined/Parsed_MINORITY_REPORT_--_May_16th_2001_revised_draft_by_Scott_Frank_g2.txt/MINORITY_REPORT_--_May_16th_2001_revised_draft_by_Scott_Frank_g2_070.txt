		the floor.  he bends down and picks up the data card with the
		image of anne lively drowning.  he looks at it when...

		sees a group of secretaries having a baby shower for the
		pregnant woman.  he notices fletcher, some of his guys down
		there...

		secretary's belly, cracking a joke they all laugh at. 
		suddenly he's the most popular guy on campus.  the guys see
		anderton who motions them to stay, it's okay.  witwer looks
		up at him curiously.  anderton pockets the data card, turns
		away and goes into...
