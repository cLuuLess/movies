		anderton sits up.  he feels one of the spyder's legs grab
		hold of his cheek and try to read his eye through the
		bandages.  it whirs and hums trying to adjust its antenna.
		
		                    anderton
		          please...
		
		it stings him.  he jumps back.  then he reaches up and
		gently, slowly, pulls down the bandages over one eye while
		the spyder moves in closer to read it.
