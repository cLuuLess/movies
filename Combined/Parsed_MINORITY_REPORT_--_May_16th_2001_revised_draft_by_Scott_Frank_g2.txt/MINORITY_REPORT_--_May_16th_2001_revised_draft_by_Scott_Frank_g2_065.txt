		int.  anderton's apartment - day
		
		dark.  we hear someone make the lock, then the door opens and
		we see danny witwer standing there looking in.  he closes the
		door, turns on the light and takes in the total disarray.
		
		he bends down, picks up a black inhaler and examines it.  he
		puts it in his pocket and starts to look around.
		
		he moves through the dark apartment to the table where
		anderton keeps his holo-computer equipment.  he looks at it a
		moment, then starts pressing buttons.  and now we hear...
		
		                    sean (o.s.)
		          hey, daddy!
		
		he pulls his weapon, wheels around and points it at the holo
		image of sean (age 4) on the beach as he wings a frisbee.
		
		                    sean
		          catch!
		
		witwer ducks as it sails by.  he looks around, notices the
		laser projectors all around the room.  and now he sees the
		images of sean... everywhere.  he slowly puts away his gun.
		
		                    witwer
		          my god...
