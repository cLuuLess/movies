		int.  precrime analytical room - morning
		
		two men act as "dressers", getting anderton into gear while
		he works.  they help him on with a jacket, the word precrime
		emblazoned on the back.
		
		                    jad
		          director.  line three.
		
		and now we see an image of lamar burgess, director of
		precrime in one corner.
		
		                    burgess
		          tell me not to worry, john.
		
		                    anderton
		          don't worry, lamar.
		
		                    burgess
		          the nation votes this week...
		
		anderton notices something on the prevision screen, brushes
		off the "dressers".
		
		                    burgess
		          which makes this the worst possible
		          time to show that we're only human.
		
		                    anderton
		              (working)
		          uh-huh...
		
		                    burgess
		          has the observer from justice shown
		          up yet?
		
		                    anderton
		          hang on, lamar --
		
		anderton mutes the director, looks at an image of the
		muscular man in the suit.  there's a child's face to the left
		of his own.
