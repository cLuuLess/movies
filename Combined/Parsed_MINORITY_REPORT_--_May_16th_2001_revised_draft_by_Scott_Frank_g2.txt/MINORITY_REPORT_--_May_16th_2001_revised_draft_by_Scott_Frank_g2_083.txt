		int.  burgess' office - day
		
		frustrated, burgess turns away, emotional now and we see
		fletcher and witwer were watching the conversation.
		
		                    fletcher
		          don't worry.  i'll bring him in
		          unharmed.
		
		                    witwer
		          actually, gordon, you're not gonna
		          do that.
		              (to burgess)
		          i'm taking control of the team.
		
		                    fletcher
		          what?!
		
		                    burgess
		              (motions to fletcher "it's
		               okay", then)
		          witwer, fletcher is second in
		          command.  it's his show to run. 
		          you want, you can observe.
		              (to fletcher)
		          do it.  find him.
		
		fletcher cuts a look at witwer and heads out.  witwer remains
		eerily calm, sticks a piece of gum in his mouth.
		
		                    witwer
		          he came to see you yesterday. 
		          right before he got tagged.  what
		          did you talk about?
		
		                    burgess
		          the mets.  john doesn't think
		          they've got a deep enough pitching
		          roster this year, and i'm inclined
		          to agree.
		
		                    witwer
		          why are you protecting him?  you
		          knew he was doping, yet you did
		          nothing about it.
		
		                    burgess
		          the man lost a child, for christ's
		          sake...
		
		                    witwer
		          six years ago.  what did you two
		          talk about yesterday afternoon?
		
		                    burgess
		              (turning away)
		          none of your damn business.
		
		                    witwer
		          oh, it's all my damn business now,
		          lamar.
		              (then)
		          investigation of a supervising
		          office for a capital crime falls
		          under federal jurisdiction... so as
		          to rule out any possibility of
		          conspiracy.  he's my suspect.
		
		                    burgess
		          he's my subordinate!
		
		burgess looks at him.  hates him, but knows he can't win.
		
		                    witwer
		          shall we call the attorney general? 
		          i'm sure he'd be happy to clarify
		          the issue for you.
		
		                    burgess
		              (beat)
		          i don't want john anderton hurt.
