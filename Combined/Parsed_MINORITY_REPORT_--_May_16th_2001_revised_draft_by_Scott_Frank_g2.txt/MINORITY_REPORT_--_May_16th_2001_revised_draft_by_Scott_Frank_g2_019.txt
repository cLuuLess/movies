		int.  marks kitchen - morning
		
		as howard sits down with his son who keeps cutting the piece
		of cardboard while reciting the address.
		
		                    son
		          ... the world will little note, nor
		          long remember what we say here...
		
		                    howard
		              (looks at sarah)
		          i was thinking, maybe i'd play
		          hooky, stay home today.
		
		her back to him, sarah pauses for just a second.
		
		                    sarah
		          what about your meeting?
		
		                    howard
		          i'll reschedule.  i've been working
		          too much anyway.
		
		the boy holds up what we now see is a lincoln mask to his
		face...
		
		                    son
		          ... that these honored dead we take
		          increased devotion to that cause
		          for which they gave us they gave
		          the last full measure of
		          devotion...
		
		he looks at the back of his wife as he pokes at his
		breakfast.
		
		                    howard
		          we could have lunch together.
		
		                    sarah
		          i'd love to, but i've got an open
		          house today at the ressler place.
		
		                    howard
		          ah.  that must be why you look so
		          nice.
		
		as sarah turns and smiles at howard.
		
		                    sarah
		          raincheck?
		
		                    howard
		          sure.  raincheck.
		
		                    son
		          ... that we here highly resolve
		          that these dead shall not have died
		          in vain...
		
		we hear a horn honk o.s.  sarah looks at her son.
		
		                    sarah
		          your ride's here.  get your stuff.
		
		the boy gets up, setting the scissors down on the table.
