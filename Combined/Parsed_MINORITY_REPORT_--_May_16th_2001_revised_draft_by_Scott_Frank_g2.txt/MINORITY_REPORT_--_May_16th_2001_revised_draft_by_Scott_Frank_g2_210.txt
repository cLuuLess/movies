		int.  crow's hotel room - day
		
		as witwer moves around the room.  he looks at the polaroids
		on the bed, spots the one of sean and freezes.  as anderton
		did, he sits down on the bed.  he notices something on the
		floor by the window and moves to it.  he slowly bends down
		and picks up anderton's .45.

		          first murder in six years.
		
		witwer looks up at fletcher standing in the doorway, looking
		around at the room.
		
		                    fletcher
		          jesus, they're never wrong, are
		          they?
		
		witwer looks at fletcher a moment.
		
		                    witwer
		          there a maid in this hotel?
		
		                    fletcher
		          i don't know, why?
		
		                    witwer
		          if you were a child killer, you
		          took these pictures, would you
		          leave them out on the bed for
		          anyone to find?
		
		                    fletcher
		          they could have been put away. 
		          anderton could have found them.
		
		                    witwer
		              (beat)
		          what kind of cop were you before
		          this?
		
		                    fletcher
		          i was a treasury agent for eight
		          years.  why?
		
		                    witwer
		          treasury... then this would be your
		          first actual murder scene.
		
		fletcher nods, watches as witwer looks around the room.
		
		                    witwer
		          i worked homicide before i went
		          federal.
		              (indicates the room)
		          this is what we would've called an
		          "orgy of evidence".
		              (then)
		          do you know how many orgies i had
		          as a homicide copy, gordon?
		
		                    fletcher
		          how many?
		
		                    witwer
		          none.
		              (looks at the room)
		          this was arranged.
		
		insert -  a photograph of a child
		
		slowly developing, floating in solution.  we hear a phone
		ring.  and...
		
		widen to reveal: a dark room
		
		lara anderton working under the red light.  she watches the
		photo develop a moment, drops it into the stop-bath and
		answers the phone...
		
		                    anderton's voice
		          crow is dead.
		
		she goes stiff.
		
		                    lara
		          john?
		
		                    anderton's voice
		          he's dead, lara.
		
		                    lara
		              (beat)
		          oh, god, what did you do?
		
		                    anderton's voice
		          nothing.  i didn't kill him.
		
		                    lara
		          then how did he --
		
		                    anderton's voice
		          lara, i don't know why this is
		          happening.  i just know they're
		          setting me up.  i can't trust
		          anybody.  i don't know who to talk
		          to or where to go...
		              (then)
		          lara?  are you there?
		
		she stands there a moment, staring at the image...
		
		                    lara
		          yes, i'm here, john.
