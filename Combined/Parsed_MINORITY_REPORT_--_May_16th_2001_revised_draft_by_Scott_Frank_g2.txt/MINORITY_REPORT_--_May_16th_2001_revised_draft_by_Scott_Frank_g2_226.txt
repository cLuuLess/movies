		int.  back bedroom - night
		
		agatha sits on the floor in the midst of a pile of toys, face
		streaked with tears.
		
		                    agatha
		          dr. hineman once said to me that
		          "the dead don't die."
		              (looks up)
		          "they look on and help."
		              (then, as a statement)
		          remember that, john.
		
		agatha looks around the room...
		
		                    agatha
		          he's on the beach now, a toe in the
		          water, asking you to come in with
		          him.  he's been racing his mother
		          up and down the sand.
		
		she looks up at anderton, smiling and crying at the same
		time.
		
		                    agatha
		          there's so much love in this house.
		
		she closes her eyes.
		
		                    agatha
		          he's ten years old.  he's
		          surrounded by animals.  he wants to
		          be a vet.  you keep a rabbit for
		          him.  a bird.  and a fox.
		
		anderton can't move, can't breath.
		
		                    agatha
		          he's in high school.  he likes to
		          run.  like his father.  he runs the
		          two mile and the long relay.
		              (then)
		          he's twenty-three, at a university. 
		          he makes love to a pretty girl
		          named claire.  he asks her to be
		          his wife.  he calls here and tells
		          lara who cries... he still runs. 
		          across the university.  and in the
		          stadium where john watches.
		
		she's shaking her head now...
		
		                    agatha
		          oh, god -- he's running so fast,
		          like his daddy.  he sees his daddy,
		          wants to run to him, but he's only
		          six years old and he can't do it. 
		          and the other man is so fast.
		
		agatha looks up at anderton, weeping, shaking...
		
		                    agatha
		          there was so much love in this
		          house.
		
		anderton turns away, see lara in the doorway now, her own
		eyes full of tears.
		
		                    anderton
		          i'm so sorry... i just want him
		          back... i want him back so bad...
		
		                    lara
		          i know... i do, too...
		
		                    agatha
		          so did she.
		
		they both look at her.  she's staring at the photograph of
		anne lively.
		
		                    agatha
		          can't you see?  she just wanted her
		          little girl back.
		
		                    anderton
		          who wanted her little girl back?
		
		                    agatha
		          the drowning woman.
		              (shows him the photograph)
		          anne... but it was too late.  her
		          little girl was already gone.
		
		                    anderton
		          she died?
		
		                    agatha
		          she grew up.
		
		                    anderton
		          she's still alive?
		
		agatha looks up at anderton now.
		
		                    agatha
		          she's not alive, but she didn't
		          die.
		
		                    anderton
		              (beat)
		          oh, jesus...
		
		                    lara
		          john?  what is it?
		
		                    anderton
		          how did i not see this?
		              (then)
		          agatha, who killed you mother?  who
		          killed anne lively?
		
		she looks at anderton, keeps her voice calm as she says:
		
		                    agatha
		          i'm sorry, john, but you have to
		          run again.
		
		                    anderton
		          what --
		
		                    agatha
		          run!
		
		suddenly the room is bathed in light --
