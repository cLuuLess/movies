		ext.  street - day
		
		leo crow, the man we saw in the prevision, walks along the
		sidewalk.  he's unsteady, and keeps bumping into people.  in
		person we can see that the man's small, with countable wisps
		of hair combed over one side of his head.  his eyes are dark,
		almost black, more insect-like than human.
