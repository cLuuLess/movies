		                    fletcher
		          find out where that pipe leads -- i

		they look to where witwer stares at the prevision screen.
		
		                    witwer
		          it doesn't matter.  he wins.
		
		                    fletcher
		          we can stop him.
		
		                    witwer
		          she's in the room with him when he

		              (then)
		          she's already a part of his future.
		
		and now everybody looks at the image, the ghost-like face of
		agatha in the mirror, watching john anderton shoot a man
		named leo crow.
		
		                    witwer
		              (as he walks out)

		              (to jad)
		          how much time have we got?
		
		insert watch
