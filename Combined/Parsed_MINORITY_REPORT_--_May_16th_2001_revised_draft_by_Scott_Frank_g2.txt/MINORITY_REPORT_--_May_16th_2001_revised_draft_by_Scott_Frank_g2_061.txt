		as anderton enters, is immediately cut off by burgess.
		
		                    burgess
		          those bastards at justice want to
		          take it all away from us.
		
		anderton stops, faces burgess who looks at his watch, then
		stares back at anderton.
		
		                    burgess
		          and this is exactly the kind of
		          behavior that will give them an
		          excuse to do it.
		
		                    anderton
		          lamar, i'm sorry.  i don't know
		          what --
		
		                    burgess
		          don't apologize, john.
		
		his tone stops anderton.
		
		                    burgess
		          you understand that a week from now
		          people are going to vote on whether
		          or not what we've been doing down
		          here has been some noble-minded
		          enterprise or a chance to change
		          the way this country fights crime.
		
		                    anderton
		          i understand.  sir.
		
		burgess stares at anderton.
		
		                    burgess
		          i need you to do two things for me. 
		          one, watch danny witwer.
		
		                    anderton
		          yes, sir.
		
		                    burgess
		          you can let him look around, answer
		          his questions, but watch him.  if
		          there's any problems, make sure we
		          know about it first.
		
		                    anderton
		          i understand.  what's the other
		          thing?
		
		                    burgess
		          tuck in your shirt.
		
		burgess gives him a look, then turns and walks away. 
		anderton looks down, tucks in his shirt, then hurries off...
