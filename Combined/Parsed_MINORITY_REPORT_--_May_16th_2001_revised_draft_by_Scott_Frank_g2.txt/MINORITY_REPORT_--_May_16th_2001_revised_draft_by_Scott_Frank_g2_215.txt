		int.  anderton's apartment - day
		
		as anne lively is drowned by an assailant in black in the
		middle of the room.  witwer sits at anderton's holo-computer
		watching the image.  it finishes just as burgess comes into
		the room.
		
		                    burgess
		          good god.  what was that?
		
		                    witwer
		          wait, just a second...
		
		witwer works the machine a moment while burgess looks around
		the apartment, takes in the mess, the open cupboards in the
		kitchen.  he kicks at the inhalers on the floor and sits
		down.  he see anderton's .45 sitting by the chair and picks
		it up and examines it.
		
		                    witwer
		          we recovered that from crow's hotel
		          room.
		
		burgess looks sadly at the gun a moment.
		
		                    burgess
		          i remember when i gave this to him. 
		          back in baltimore.  he was one of
		          those cops, still thought he could
		          make a dent in all the bad there
		          was in the world.
		
		burgess looks around the apartment now.
		
		                    burgess
		          the irony is, sometimes it's the
		          very vision that makes you want to
		          make the world a better place that
		          turns you into something you can't
		          even recognize anymore.
		
		he sighs, looks at witwer.
		
		                    burgess
		          tell me what you have.
		
		witwer nods, starts the image once more.
		
		                    witwer
		          this is the murder of a woman named
		          anne lively.
		
		burgess sits forward, watches as the man in black shoves her
		face under the water.
		
		                    burgess
		          he told me about this.  you got
		          this from containment?
		
		                    witwer
		          yes.  this is from the twins,
		          arthur and dashiel.  agatha's
		          stream was missing.  now this one
		          is from the cyberparlor.  anderton
		          downloaded it directly from agatha. 
		          watch...
		
		we see the fragments of a man donning gloves, dropping an
		overcoat and then once more we see the man in black drowning
		her...
		
		                    burgess
		          it's the same prevision.
		
		                    witwer
		          not quite.
		
		witwer gets up, moves to the image...
		
		                    witwer
		          look at the surface wind across the
		          water.  watch the ripples... moving
		          away from shore.
		
		we see they're all moving right to left.  we watch the silent
		murder of anne lively.  the image finishes.  a blank.  we see
		the fragmented images of the gloves.  and now we see the
		second image of anne lively being murdered...
		
		                    witwer
		          now the second image.  watch the
		          water.  the wind's changed.  the
		          ripples are going the other way.
		
		                    burgess
		          i don't understand --
		
		                    witwer
		          this murder is happening at two
		          different times.
		
		burgess stares at the image.  watches again as it repeats. 
		witwer hits the remote and the image of anne lively freezes.
		
		                    witwer
		          according to the sentry, anderton
		          was watching this at containment
		          right before he was tagged.
		
		                    burgess
		          i know.  he came to me, told me
		          about the missing data stream.
		              (then)
		          he was concerned that you might
		          find it.
		
		                    witwer
		          i did find it.  it was inside of
		          agatha all this time.  so the
		          question is, why would someone want
		          this erased from the data file?
		
		                    burgess
		              (intrigued)
		          danny, tell me what you're
		          thinking.
		
		                    witwer
		          i'm thinking someone got away with
		          murder.
		
		                    burgess
		          how?
		
		witwer moves around the frozen image of anne lively.
		
		                    witwer
		          by fooling the system.  all someone
		          would have to do is wait for
		          precrime to stop the murder from
		          taking place, then, a few minutes
		          later, commit the crime in exactly
		          the same way.
		
		                    burgess
		              (nods)
		          yes... it's called an echo.  the
		          act of murder is such a violent
		          disturbance in the future continuum
		          that it sometimes repeats to the
		          precogs.
		
		                    witwer
		              (beat, remembering)
		          precog deja vu...
		
		                    burgess
		          we teach the tech's to identify
		          them and disregard...
		
		witwer looks at him.
		
		                    witwer
		          so there is a way to fool the
		          system?
		
		                    burgess
		          yes.
		
		witwer looks at the image.
		
		                    witwer
		          of course, it would have to be
		          someone with access to the
		          prevision in the first place,
		          someone fairly high up --
		
		                    burgess
		              (finger to his lips)
		          shhh.  you know what i hear?
		
		                    witwer
		          what?
		
		                    burgess
		          nothing.  no footsteps coming up
		          the stairs.  no hovercraft out the
		          window.  no clickity click of
		          little spyders.  no one crashing
		          through that door.  and do you know
		          why i don't hear any of those
		          things, danny?  because right now,
		          the precogs can't see.
		
		witwer suddenly understands.  see anderton's .45 in burgess'
		hand and knows it's already too late as the gun goes off
		loud, burgess shooting witwer right through the holo-image of
		anne lively.
		
		burgess stands up as witwer drops to his knees.  he looks up
		at burgess -- gasping, clutching his chest with both hands as
		if in prayer -- and can do nothing but watch as the man
		shoots him once more, knocking him down to the floor.
		
		burgess steps over him, crouches down and takes something
		from witwer's pocket.  a stick of gum.  he puts it into his
		mouth, then starts to wipe the .45 down with a handkerchief.
		
		his phone rings.  burgess answers it.
		
		                    burgess
		          burgess.
