		as wally gently lowers agatha into the tank and begins the
		process of reconnecting her to her "brothers".  her eyes are
		sunken and dark.
		
		                    wally
		          i was so worried about you.  did he
		          hurt you?
		
		he stops and looks at her a moment, then takes out a needle
		and injects her with the drug...
		
		                    wally
		          god, i missed you so much...
		
		she says nothing as he kisses her on the mouth...
