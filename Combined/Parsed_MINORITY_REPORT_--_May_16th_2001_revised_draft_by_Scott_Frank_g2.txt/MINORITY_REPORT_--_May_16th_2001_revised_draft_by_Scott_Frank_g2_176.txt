		int.  the gap - day
		
		as anderton walks in the door, gets his new eyes scanned, and
		we hear a voice say:
		
		                    store voice
		          hello, mr. yakamoto!  welcome back
		          to the gap.
		
		anderton stops cold as a holographic image of a huge asian
		man now appears standing in front of him.
		
		                    store voice
		          how'd those assorted tank tops work
		          out for you?
		
		anderton stops and stares at the thug-like previous owner of
		his eyes who's now shown wearing a sweater that changes from
		color to color.
		
		                    store voice
		          come on in and see how good you
		          look in one of our new winter
		          sweaters.
