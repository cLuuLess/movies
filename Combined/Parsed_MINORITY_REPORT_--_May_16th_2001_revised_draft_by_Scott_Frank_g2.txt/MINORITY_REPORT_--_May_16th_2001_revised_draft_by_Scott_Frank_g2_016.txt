		int.  precrime ready room - morning
		
		like a firehouse, everybody slipping into uniform, riding up
		poles on chairs.  a flurry of activity as weapons, helmets,
		and other newfangled gear are pulled from wall racks.
		
		knott, a big redhead, thick of neck and thicker of head,
		hands out the gear.  he takes what looks like a billy club
		and points it at a heavyset cop who wolfs down the last of a
		danish...
		
		                    knott
		          hey, steadman, wanna lose those ten
		          ugly pounds like right now?
		
		the cop reacts, pushes the stick away...

		          touch me with that puke-pole,
		          asshole, you're gonna wear the
		          fuckin' risoto i had for dinner
		          last night along with the two
		          chilidogs i had for breakfast.
