		int.  dr. eddie's "operating" room - day
		
		a shitty little room with a single stained overstuffed chair
		in the corner, a foul kitchen piled high with dirty dishes
		and a grime-smeared window looking out onto another wall.
		
		in the center of all this is a make-shift medical set-up: a
		gleaming operating table, an array of lasers, scalpels and
		other surgical and anesthesia equipment.
		
		anderton sits in a chair facing dr. solomon eddie -- a skinny
		man with a shock of hair on top, like an upended broom.  dr.
		eddie sneezes, blows his nose hard into a handkerchief.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          damn cold won't go away.
		
		anderton glances about uneasily as the man sneezes again. 
		dr. eddie sees he's anxious and smiles.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          don't worry.  i could cut open your
		          chest, sew a dead cat in there and
		          you'd never get an infection.  not
		          with the spectrum of antibios i'll
		          be shooting into you.
		
		                    anderton
		          that's comforting.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          you do understand i can't just give
		          you new irises.  the scanners will
		          read the scar tissue.  alarms will
		          go off.  large men with guns will
		          appear...
		
		                    anderton
		          right.  i know --
		
		anderton stiffens as dr. eddie injects him...
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          anesthesia.  try to relax, john.
		              (injecting)
		          i'm saying i'll have to remove your
		          eyes.  completely.
		
		                    anderton
		          yeah --
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          and replace them with new ones.
		
		                    anderton
		          i know that, but i wanna keep the
		          old ones.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          why?
		
		                    anderton
		          because my mother gave them to me. 
		          what do you care?  they're no good
		          to you on the secondary market
		          anyway.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          whatever you say, john.
		
		dr. eddie holds out his hand and anderton hands him a tiny
		opalescent card.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          greta!
		
		dr. eddie yells something in swedish and now into the room
		walks a large woman in a white coat.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          this is miss van eyck, my gorgeous
		          assistant.
		
		she turns and giggles at anderton and we see a mole on her
		cheek the size of bermuda.
		
		                    anderton
		          nice to meet you.
		
		miss van eyck slides the card into a small console, watches
		the numbers flash up.  she says something to dr. eddie who
		looks at the numbers then frowns at anderton.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          that's not much.
		
		                    anderton
		          it's all i could safely move.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          tell you what, since you and i go
		          way back, i'll give you my old pal
		          discount.  how's that sound?
		
		anderton looks at him.  "go way back?"
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          you don't remember me, do you?
		
		                    anderton
		          we know each other?
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          oh, yes.
		
		miss van eyck picks up a laser scalpel, blows on the end to
		clean it off, then hands it to dr. eddie who tests it on a
		piece of metal.  anderton watching as it cuts right through.
		
		                    anderton
		          from where?  d.c.?
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          baltimore.  eastside.
		              (then)
		          solomon p. eddie m.d.  i was a
		          plastic surgeon.
		
		anderton thinks a moment.  the name rings a bell.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          i specialized in burn victims.
		              (then)
		          women mostly.
		
		boom.  anderton looks at him.
		
		                    anderton
		          i put you away --
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          yes, you did.
		
		                    anderton
		          you made those tapes...
		
		                    dr. eddie
		              (defensive)
		          they were performance pieces.
		
		                    anderton
		          you set your patients on fire!
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          and put them out.  some not as
		          quickly as others, but let's change
		          the subject, shall we?  the future
		          is much more interesting than the
		          past.  don't you think?
		
		dr. eddie walks over to a large medical cabinet and opens the
		door.  it's full of eyes and parts of eyes -- all in cryo
		jars.  anderton turns away.  it's the last thing he wants to
		see.  dr. eddie studies them a moment, then...
		
		anderton watches as he and miss van eyck confer in swedish
		and she starts giggling at whatever it is he said.  the doc
		himself has a smile on his face as he turns back around.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          lie down, john.
		
		anderton hesitates, finally complies.  next thing he knows
		miss van eyck is smiling down on him, her big face hovering
		above his like a planet.  she smiles, then...
		
		                    miss van eyck
		              (the only english she
		               knows)
		          hello.
		
		                    anderton
		          uh, hi --
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          try to relax, chief.
		
		anderton counts to himself, listens to dr. eddie preparing
		instrument trays, sharing another joke in swedish with his
		assistant.  more giggling o.s.  anderton looks over...
		
		                    anderton
		          so uh, if you were a plastic
		          surgeon before...
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          how can i do what i do now?  let's
		          just say i spent a lot of time in
		          the prison library.
		
		anderton turns and casts a groggy eye at dr. eddie to see if
		he's serious, but the good doctor has his back to him as he
		does his prep work.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          it was a great way to avoid some of
		          the more unpleasant aspects of
		          prison life.
		              (then)
		          yes, confinement was a real
		          education, a real eye opener if you
		          will.
		
		anderton tries to get up, but miss van eyck gently pushes him
		down again.
		
		                    miss van eyck
		          no no no...
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          i mean, for true enlightenment,
		          john, there's nothing quite like
		          the experience of, say, taking a
		          shower while a large felon with a
		          hard-on you can't knock down with a
		          hammer whispers in your --
		
		                    anderton
		              (tries to sit up)
		          uh, okay, you know what?  i think
		          maybe i'll just --
		
		but anderton can't raise himself up: the drug is starting to
		take effect.  dr. eddie approaches with the laser scalpel...
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          yes, it was a lot of fun.  thank
		          you so much, john, for putting me
		          there.  for giving me the
		          opportunity to get to know myself
		          better.  and now...
		
		he clicks on the laser, right in front of one of anderton's
		eyes...
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          to return the favor...
		
		and just as the light-blade is about to touch the eye, we go
		to...
