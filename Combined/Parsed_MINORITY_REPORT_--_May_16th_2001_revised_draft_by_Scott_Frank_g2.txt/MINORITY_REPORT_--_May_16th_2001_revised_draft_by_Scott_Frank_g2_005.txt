		int.  precrime analytical room - morning
		
		as anderton pulls a small disc from his pocket.
		
		                    anderton
		          stand by...
		
		the men all share knowing glances as he inserts the disc into
		a player and we now hear a strauss symphony over...
		
		anderton slips on an eyepiece and special finger gloves, then
		moves his hands over the huge prevision screen, "conducting"
		the array of images we saw during the opening.  the screen
		responds to wherever he looks, or whatever he touches...
		
		                    anderton
		          alright, howard, where are you...
