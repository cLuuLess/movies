		witwer watches as jad works the display, watching the
		movement of blue dots that represent eyescanned citizens.  a
		beep and jad sits up.

		          i got him on the metro!
		              (indicates the map)
		          the train makes two stops, at 20th
		          and then 33rd.
		
		                    witwer
		          split the units, go to both.
		
		                    fletcher
		          we'll never make 20th.
		
		witwer looks at fletcher.  gives him an odd smile.
		
		                    witwer
		          have faith.
