		int.  cottage - day
		
		simple, comfortable with an endless view of the sea.  dozens
		of black & white photographs line the floor, hang from the
		walls.  lara pours witwer and herself a cup of coffee.
		
		                    witwer
		          this your work?
		
		                    lara
		          yes.
		
		we see that the photographs are all reportage shots of
		children.
		
		                    witwer
		          i like it.
		
		                    lara
		          thanks.  you take anything in your
		          coffee?
		
		                    witwer
		          cream and sugar.
		
		                    lara
		          i don't have any cream.  sorry.
		
		                    witwer
		          just sugar then.  you and john ever
		          come here?
		
		                    lara
		          we used to, every summer.
		
		                    witwer
		          he's not here now, is he?
		
		she looks at him.
		
		                    witwer
		          i had to ask.
		
		she hands him his coffee.
		
		                    lara
		          i don't have any sugar either.
		
		                    witwer
		              (smiles)
		          thank you.
		              (then)
		          he hasn't tried to contact you?
		
		                    lara
		          no.
		
		                    witwer
		          you ever heard him mention the name
		          leo crow?
		
		                    lara
		          no, but then i don't talk to john
		          that much anymore.
		
		                    witwer
		          so you haven't seen his apartment?
		
		                    lara
		          that was our apartment.
		
		                    witwer
		          have you been there recently?
		
		he takes a black inhaler from his pocket...
		
		                    witwer
		          it's full of these.
		
		she stares at it.
		
		                    witwer
		          how long's he been doping?
		
		she turns away, takes a moment, then...
		
		                    lara
		          since right after we lost our son.
		
		                    witwer
		          you mean after he lost your son.
		
		                    lara
		          it was nobody's fault.
		
		                    witwer
		          but john was with him at the pool?
		
		                    lara
		          yes.
		
		witwer watches her a moment, then...
		
		                    witwer
		          you said in your divorce papers
		          that he tried to kill himself.
		
		                    lara
		          it wasn't a suicide attempt.  i
		          regret ever saying that.
		
		                    witwer
		          what was it then?
		
		                    lara
		          the fbi found something that
		          belonged to my son.
		              (hard for her)
		          a sandal... anyway, john was upset. 
		          he... he...
		
		                    witwer
		          he took out his gun and sat down to
		          watch his home movies.  this is all
		          in your statement, lara...
		
		                    lara
		          he shot a hole in the damn ceiling. 
		          so what?  you lose your son, let's
		          see how well you handle it.
		
		                    witwer
		          not very well, i'm sure.  i'd
		          probably start doping myself.  or
		          maybe i'd...
		
		he looks at her photographs of children, but doesn't finish
		his thought.  she turns and looks at him.  he meets her gaze.
		
		                    witwer
		          lamar burgess thinks that you left
		          john because he lost himself in
		          precrime instead of you.
		
		                    lara
		          i left him because every time i
		          looked at him, i saw my son.  every
		          time i got close to him, i smelled
		          my little boy.  that's why i left
		          him.
		              (then)
		          and now you can leave.
		
		he puts down his coffee and looks at her.
		
		                    witwer
		          you know i need to use you.
		
		                    lara
		          to what?  trap him?
		
		                    witwer
		          to prevent a murder.  sooner or
		          later, he's going to contact you.
		
		                    lara
		          i haven't seen him in two years.
		
		                    witwer
		          but i've seen the three hundred
		          hours of your image he's got stored
		          away.
		
		she reacts to his as he moves up close to her.
		
		                    witwer
		          he's still living with you.
		              (then)
		          and your son.
		              (then)
		          you have to choose, lara.  you have
		          to choose sides now.
