		int.  burgess' living room - day
		
		burgess sits on the couch, a blanket covering his legs,
		nursing a cold.  he looks at the moving image of anne lively
		on the small card.
		
		                    burgess
		          and you say the third prevision
		          was, what, a little fuzzy or
		          something?
		
		                    anderton
		          i'm saying the third prevision
		          wasn't there.  and that's not all. 
		          i spent a few hours down there and
		          it turns out there's a dozen more
		          cases with missing previsions.
		
		burgess sneezes, takes out his handkerchief.
		
		                    burgess
		          you'd think we'd have found a cure
		          for the common cold by now.
		
		                    wife (o.s.)
		          it's stress.
		
		his wife walks in who hands him a steaming mug.  he looks at
		it.
		
		                    burgess
		          what's this?
		
		                    wife
		          herbal tea with honey.
		
		                    burgess
		          yeah, well i hate herbal tea...
		          almost as much as i hate honey.
		
		                    wife
		          just drink it before i pour it in
		          your lap.
		
		he reluctantly takes it.  she smiles at anderton on her way
		out.
		
		                    anderton
		          danny witwer is scheduled for a
		          tour of containment tomorrow --
		
		                    burgess
		          so give him a tour.  he doesn't
		          know enough to ask the right
		          questions.
		
		                    anderton
		          if he's looking for a flaw in the
		          system --
		
		                    burgess
		          he's not.  he's looking for a flaw
		          in us, john.
		
		anderton notices the change in burgess' tone.  burgess tosses
		the card onto the coffee table in front of him, and considers
		anderton a moment.
		
		                    burgess
		          lara called me.
		
		                    anderton
		          what?
		
		                    burgess
		          she's worried about you.  and,
		          quite frankly, so am i.
		
		                    anderton
		          i'm fine.
		
		                    burgess
		          i hear you've been spending a lot
		          of time in the sprawl.
		
		                    anderton
		              (beat)
		          i go running down there.
		
		                    burgess
		          in the middle of the night?
		
		anderton doesn't have an answer for that one.
		
		                    burgess
		          what if danny witwer came to you
		          right now and insisted on a full
		          chem run?
		
		                    anderton
		          i'm fine, lamar.
		
		burgess gets up and sits down next to anderton, puts a hand
		on his shoulder.
		
		                    burgess
		              (beat)
		          you understand, john, that the
		          minute precrime goes national,
		          they're going to take it away from
		          us.
		
		                    anderton
		          we won't let them.
		
		                    burgess
		          no?  how's an old man and a cop on
		          the whiff ever going to stop them?
		
		this stings anderton.  burgess softens.
		
		                    burgess
		          my father once said to me that you
		          don't choose the things you believe
		          in, they choose you.
		              (then)
		          there's a reason you're here, john. 
		          had precrime been in place just six
		          months earlier, the loss you and
		          lara suffered would have been
		          prevented.
		
		anderton turns away.
		
		                    burgess
		          remember the eyes, john --
		
		burgess coughs, motions for a second while he gets his breath
		back, then...
		
		                    burgess
		          remember, the eyes of the nation
		          are on us right now.  we both know
		          i'm not the generation anyone
		          listens to.
		              (then)
		          people trust you, john.  when you
		          speak of your absolute belief in
		          precrime, they know it's a belief
		          born of pain and not politics. 
		          i've always understood that.  and
		          in some ways, i may have even
		          encouraged it, to help with the
		          cause.  but now... your pain is
		          hurting both of us.
		
		anderton nods, finally gets up, puts his hand on burgess'
		shoulder, looks the old man in the eye.
		
		                    anderton
		          they're not going to take it away
		          from us, lamar.
		              (beat)
		          i won't let them.
