		int.  anderton's apartment - morning
		
		as anderton opens an eye, looks off at a clock tv that shows
		the image of l. vincent nash, u.s. attorney general as he
		addresses a press conference at precrime...
		
		                    nash
		          ... it's the responsibility of the
		          justice department to fully review
		          and inspect the precrime system.
		
		anderton sits up, looks at the screen.  to his horror, he
		sees witwer sitting at a long table beside nash with lamar
		burgess sitting on the other side.  the chair next to burgess
		empty...
		
		                    anderton
		          shit --
		
		anderton jumps to his feet, begins ripping off his sweats and
		getting dressed as fast as he can.  he grabs his shirt off
		the answering machine...
		
		                    synth voice
		          you have twelve messages.
		
		                    burgess' voice
		          john?  where the hell are you?
		
		anderton sits on the bed and starts pulling on his boots.
		
		                    burgess
		          speaking on behalf of precrime, i'd
		          just like to say that we welcome
		          any review by attorney general nash
		          and his team, although i must say
		          i'm somewhat baffled by their
		          timing.
		
		anderton grabs his coat, pulls his .45 out from under the
		pillow and tucks it away behind his back.
		
		                    burgess
		          in the six years we've been
		          conducting our little experiment
		          there hasn't been a single murder
		          in the district.
		
		anderton opens the door and gets right into his vehicle. 
		it's there in the wall.  he sits down, closes the door and
		the vehicle drops from sight.
