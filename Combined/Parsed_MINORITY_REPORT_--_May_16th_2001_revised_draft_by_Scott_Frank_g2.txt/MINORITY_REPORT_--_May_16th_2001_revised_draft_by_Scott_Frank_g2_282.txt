		ext.  hotel terrace - night
		
		anderton waits for burgess to pull the trigger.
		
		                    anderton
		          what's it worth?  just one more
		          murder...
		
		and now the hovership rises up over the terrace...
		
		                    anderton
		          you'll rot in hell with a halo, but
		          people will still believe in
		          precrime.
		
		burgess looks at the ship...
		
		                    anderton
		          all you have to do now is pull the
		          trigger like they said you would.
		
		burgess turns back, raises the gun: his hand shakes.
		
		                    anderton
		          except...
		              (a step closer)
		          you've seen your own future.  which
		          means...
		
		a wind blows as the hovership now comes down on the terrace,
		the precops descending from inside.
		
		                    anderton
		          you can change it if you want to.
		
		burgess looks off as the precops run across the terrace.
		
		                    anderton
		          you still have a choice, lamar...
		
		suddenly, all at once, the precops' watches begin to beep as
		the time runs out.
		
		anderton, his eyes on burgess, raises his hand, and motions
		for the precops to all stop where they are.  the sound of the
		ship is loud, anderton speaks into burgess' ear.
		
		                    burgess
		              (finally)
		          yes, i have a choice... and i've
		          made it.
		
		he lowers the gun, the precops stand there, waiting for him. 
		anderton takes burgess by the arm, but the man is unsteady,
		and anderton holds onto him.  burgess looks him in the eye...
		
		                    burgess
		          forgive me, john.
		
		we hear a gunshot and everybody freezes.  anderton falls to
		his knees.  looks up at burgess.  a red stain now spreading
		around burgess' heart...
		
		                    burgess
		          forgive me...
		
		and as anderton and now the rest of the precops all move to a
		dying burgess, we hear the sound of rain over and...
		
		                                             dissolve to:
