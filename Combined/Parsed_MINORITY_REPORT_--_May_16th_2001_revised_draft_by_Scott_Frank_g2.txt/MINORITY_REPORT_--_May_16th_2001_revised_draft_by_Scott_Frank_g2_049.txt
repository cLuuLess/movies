		int.  precrime analytical room - morning
		
		as witwer watches the prevision screen.
		
		                    witwer
		          i thought they stopped the murder --
		
		jad looks over as witwer indicates an image of howard marks
		stabbing his wife, now from a slightly different angle.
		
		                    jad
		          that's just an echo.
		              (smiles)
		          precog deja vu.
		              (looks at the screen)
		          some of the really bad ones, the
		          precogs see over and over again.
		
		the stabbing happens again and jad moves his hand across the
		screen and it goes blank.  witwer looks at the precog screen,
		watches as the female rolls over and sinks under the milk.
