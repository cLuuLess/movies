		int.  hallway - day
		
		as people stick their heads out of their doors and whisper as
		agatha leads a stunned anderton down the hall.
		
		a woman watches them go, then moves to the doorway, and peers
		into the room, sees the broken window through the doorway...
		
		                    woman
		          murder!
