		int.  anderton's apartment - day
		
		anderton stands alone, watching the rain fall, looking out at
		the city.  a figure walks up to him.  but this time it's not
		digital -- it's lara.  she's flesh and blood.  and she's
		pregnant.  she stands beside him, watching the rain as we...
		
		                                             dissolve to:
		
		the image of anne lively
		
		on the plastic card anderton had downloaded from containment. 
		it's cracked, but the image still moves: anne lively
		drowning, her hand beckoning us in death.  a finger caresses
		the image as we now pull back to reveal...
		
		agatha.  sitting in a rocking chair, bundled up, wind blowing
		her hair.  she stares at the photograph.  we hear laughter
		o.s. as we continue pulling back to reveal...
		
		a small cabin.  she sits in front of it, rocking back and
		forth.  she looks off as we pull back farther to reveal...
		
		the other two precogs, dressed in warm clothing, working in a
		crude garden, one of them pulling rocks from the flower bed. 
		we now begin to crane up so that we see they're...
		
		by the shore.  the ocean, murky and fierce, with huge waves
		crashing on the rocky beach.  we crane all the way up and
		back so that now we see that the three of them are...
		
		on a small island.  in the middle of the north atlantic
		somewhere.  with no other people... no civilization...
		
		and no murder.  and then we...
		
		fade out.
