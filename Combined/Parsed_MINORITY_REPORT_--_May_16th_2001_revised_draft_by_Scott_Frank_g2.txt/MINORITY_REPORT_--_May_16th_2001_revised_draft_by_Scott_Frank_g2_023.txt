		ext.  park across from the marks brownstone - morning
		
		the handsome man in the suit watches the house.  behind him,
		we see a kid on a push merry-go-round, as he goes by we see
		him facing one way, then the other...
		
		the man glances about, then crosses the street.  he climbs
		the steps to the front door.  doesn't even get to knock
		before sarah opens it.
		
		                    sarah
		          come on...
		
		the man follows her inside.  a beat later, howard steps into
		frame.  he never really left for work.
