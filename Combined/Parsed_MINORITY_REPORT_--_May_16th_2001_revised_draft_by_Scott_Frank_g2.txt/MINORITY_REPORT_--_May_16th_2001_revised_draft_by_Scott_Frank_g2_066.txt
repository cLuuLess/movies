		int.  department of containment - day
		
		as anderton rides the platform with gideon looking at all of
		the "prisoners".
		
		                    gideon
		          they get to spend twenty years
		          asleep, somewhere between life and
		          death, all the while getting their
		          bodies pumped up with nutrients
		          they'd never get if they were out
		          on the street.
		              (stops the platform)
		          okee pokee, here we go...
		
		a video screen comes into view, we see it's showing the
		drowning woman anderton saw inside the temple.
		
		                    gideon
		          john doe drug addict was gonna put
		          down a woman named anne lively at
		          roland lake.
		
		they move upward, once more gliding up to a video screen as
		it comes into view, we see it's showing the drowning woman
		anderton saw inside the temple.
		
		                    anderton
		          that's her --
		
		anderton looks at the screen.  the prevision plays out:
		daytime.  a lake.  the redheaded woman is shoved under water
		by two black-gloved hands, her mouth open to scream.
		
		anderton looks at the man lying there -- tall, shaved head,
		nearly skeletal.
		
		                    anderton
		          why's he still a john doe?  why
		          wasn't he ever id's from an
		          eyescan?
		
		                    gideon
		          on account of those are not his
		          eyes.  he had 'em swapped out to
		          fool the scanners.
		
		anderton sees the dark red scar-lines around his eyes.
		
		                    gideon
		          you get it done on the street for a
		          few hundred bucks these days.
		
		anderton looks at the screen as the screaming woman appears
		again, stares at her face.
		
		                    gideon
		          okay, so you want just the female's
		          prevision.
		
		gideon hits a button on his remote and the video screen
		divides into three sections.  in the first section, we see
		various angles of the woman being drowned by john doe.  a
		similar series of shots on the second screen.
		
		but the third screen is blank.
		
		                    gideon
		          huh, we don't seem to have her
		          data.
		
		                    anderton
		          try again.
		
		                    gideon
		              (works the computer)
		          no... we have the two previsions
		          from the twins right here, but...
		              (indicates the blank
		               screen)
		          ... i can't pull up any data from
		          the female.  probably just a
		          glitch.
		
		anderton stares thoughtfully at the first two images of anne
		lively being drowned.
		
		                    gideon
		          hey, you wanna know where the word
		          came from, "glitch?"
		
		                    anderton
		              (looks at the face)
		          just tell me about the intended
		          victim.  this anne lively...
		
		gideon works the computer.
		
		                    gideon
		          looks like she was a neuroin addict
		          like john doe here, but i show an
		          address history that includes the
		          beaton clinic.
		
		                    anderton
		          so she cleaned up.  where is she
		          now?
		
		gideon again works the computer, then sits back.
		
		                    gideon
		          huh.  how ironic...
		
		he spins the screen so that anderton can see one word there:
		"missing"
		
		                    gideon
		          you finally crawl your way out of
		          one hole, only to fall into
		          another.
		
		anderton takes a small plastic card from his wallet and
		slides it into a slot on the computer.  instantly the moving
		image of anne lively downloads onto the card.
		
		                    gideon
		          careful, chief...
		
		anderton looks at him.
		
		                    gideon
		          you dig up the past, all you get is
		          dirty.
		
		                                             dissolve to:
		
		the white liquid
		
		the face of the female precog emerges from the milk, her blue
		eyes suddenly blink open.  something has begun...
