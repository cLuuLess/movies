		ext.  inner city - night
		
		as anderton runs along the wall, the projections continue:
		the images are of different people on the street now.  we
		begin pulling back...
		
		                    various people
		          i was going to be killed in my
		          apartment... he was going to rape
		          me and then stab me... it was going
		          to happen in a parking lot... we
		          were having marital problems, i had
		          no idea he would try and...
		
		so that now we see we're looking at some sort of screen on
		the side of the buildings.  on it, we see a shot of the
		precrime building, a statue of the precogs out front.
		
		                    the deep voice
		          and now, precrime is coming to your
		          state, allowing you to sleep as
		          well as we do in the district of
		          columbia.
		
		anderton, runs past the huge projection...
		
		                    the deep voice
		          on april 30, vote yes on the
		          national precrime referendum and
		          make murder a thing of the past.
		
		on the screen we see a schoolyard full of kids...
		
		                    children
		          precrime: it works!
		
		above anderton, in the middle of the projection, some mental
		case sticks his head out a window and screams at the night.
