		as agatha looks at the house, watching as lara now comes out
		the front door and hugs anderton.  she looks at agatha...
		
		                    anderton
		          it's all right.  lara, i want you
		          to meet agatha.
		
		lara smiles at her.  agatha turns and looks at the rusted
		tricycle lying in the weeds near the door and shivers...
		
		                    agatha
		          i'm cold --
		
		as lara opens the door...
		
		                    lara
		          come inside.
