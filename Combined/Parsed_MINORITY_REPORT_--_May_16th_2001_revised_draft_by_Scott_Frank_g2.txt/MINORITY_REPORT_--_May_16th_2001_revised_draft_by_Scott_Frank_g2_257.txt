		int.  hotel ballroom - screen - night
		
		the crowd is silent as they watch a series of fast images:
		anne lively stumbles.  burgess grabbing her... anne's face
		hitting the water... burgess shoving her head under and
		holding it down...
		
		on burgess
		
		through the glass window, watching himself murder this woman.
