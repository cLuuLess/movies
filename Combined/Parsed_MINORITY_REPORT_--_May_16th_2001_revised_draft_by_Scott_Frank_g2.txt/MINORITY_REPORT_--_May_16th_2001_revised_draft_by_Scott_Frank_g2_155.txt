		          the precrime program began with a
		          federal grant in 2036, and today,
		          six years later, the district of
		          columbia is now the safest city in
		          america.  why?  because precrime
		          works.
		
		we move off the tour guide to a shady spot beneath a tree
		where we see anderton hidden in a shadow, wearing an
		overcoat.

		          precrime has eliminated the need
		          for traditional detectives, so that
		          most of the work done here is about
		          the verification of motive and the
		          protection of the future victim...
		
		anderton pulls out the air syringe that dr. eddie gave him
		and stares at it.  he touches it to the underside of his chin
		and takes a deep breath...
		
		                    anderton
		          okay, one... two -- shit.
		
		he lowers the syringe.  can't do it.  he looks around.
