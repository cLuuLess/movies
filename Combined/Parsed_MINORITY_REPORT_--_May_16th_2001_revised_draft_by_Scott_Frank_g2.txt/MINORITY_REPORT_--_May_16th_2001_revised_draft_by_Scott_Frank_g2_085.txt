		int.  briefing room - day
		
		witwer addresses the precrime crew.  behind him is the frozen
		video image of anderton shooting leo crow.  evanna stares up
		at it in disbelief.
		
		                    witwer
		          you may consider him a friend.
		
		he walks up the line now, looking into the eyes of each and
		every one of them.
		
		                    witwer
		          but we know that john anderton is
		          going to kill leo crow this friday
		          at three-o-six p.m., unless we stop
		          him.
		
		he looks into fletcher's eyes, moves on...
		
		                    witwer
		          don't think for a minute that if
		          the situation was reversed he
		          wouldn't go after you.  he would be
		          a cop doing his job, as i'm doing
		          mine.
		
		he stops at evanna and looks her in the eye now.
		
		                    witwer
		          so if you're not ready and willing
		          to put the halo on him, leave now.
		
		a few looks around the room, but nobody gets up.  not even
		fletcher.  witwer stares another moment at evanna, smiles,
		offers her a piece of gum...
		
		                    evanna
		          no, thank you.
		
		he sticks it in his own mouth, then turns to the officer
		beside her.
		
		                    witwer
		          you can go.
		
		                    officer
		          excuse me?
		
		                    witwer
		          go.  you're dismissed.
		              (points to another)
		          you, too.
		              (another)
		          and you.
		
		everybody watches as the men witwer dismissed walk out.
		
		                    fletcher
		          sir, the team's gonna be light
		          without those men.
		
		                    witwer
		          yes, i know.
		
		and now the pressure door opens and four large men in dark
		suits enter the room.  knott smiles at the sight of them.
		
		                    witwer
		          these gentlemen are federal agents
		          jucket, paymen, price and foley. 
		          like you, i feel more comfortable
		          with people i trust.
