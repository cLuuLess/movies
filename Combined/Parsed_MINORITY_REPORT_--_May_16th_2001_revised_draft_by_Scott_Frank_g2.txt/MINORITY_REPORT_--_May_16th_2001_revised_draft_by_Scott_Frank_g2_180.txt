		int.  anderton's office - day
		
		as witwer sits there staring at the image, the rest of the
		team gathers in the office.
		
		                    jad
		          what's he want with a precog?
		
		                    fletcher
		          he knows we can't operate without
		          her.  he's gonna ransom her.
		
		                    jad
		          where's the note?
		
		witwer gets up and turns on the holo-computer.  an image of
		sean (age 6) appears.
		
		                    jad
		          if he's ransoming her, where's the
		          damn note?
		
		                    sean
		              (jumping between ages)
		          he, dad!  how's... your... day? 
		          hey, look what i built!  thanks...
		          for... helping... me... i... love
		          you... daddy.
		
		witwer stares at it.
		
		                    witwer
		          it has nothing to do with ransom. 
		          it has to do with the information
		          that's inside of her.
		
		they all look at him.
		
		                    witwer
		          he's trying to prove his innocence.
		
		                    fletcher
		          he can't download her without a lot
		          of technical help.
		
		                    witwer
		              (staring at the image)
		          no.  he can't...
		
		suddenly, witwer begins to tear apart the computer.  he pulls
		off the cover, looks at the components inside, rips one out,
		then tosses it aside.  he rips out another, sees a name
		printed on the bottom: patent pending - rufus t. riley.
		
		                    witwer
		          who's rufus t. riley?
