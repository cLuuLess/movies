60      int. parking garage - night

        sarah is a small figure in the shadowed echoing garage of
        her building.

        converging dolly, pacing her, as she passes the stalls with
        their inky shadows.
        the light near her moped is out.
        she fumbles in the dark to unlock the chain.
        she looks up.
        did she hear something...masked by the rattle of the chain?

        pov - sarah, there is no movement for the length of the
        garage.

        on sarah - c.u., inexplicably nervous.
        she stows the chain and starts the bike.  it whines
        reassuringly.
        sarah jumps on and whirs out of the garage.
