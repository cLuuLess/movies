7       ext. fire escape - night                               7

        camera moves with reese as he leaps to the fire escape and
        clambers up to the first landing to crouch beside another
        naked man who appears to be entangled in the ironwork.  the
        man is contorted with pain as his screams die to a shivering
        gasp.  closer angle reveals that he has been skewered through
        the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the
        shoulder by a railing.  he has materialized in the same
        space occupied by the fire escape structure.  the figure
        slumps, motionless.

        reese quickly checks for signs of life.  the man is dead.

        reese descend to the alley floor and crosses to the drunk
        huddled in the doorway.

        a pair of flamboyantly dressed women, obviously working
        girls, passes by the alley mouth.  they do a double take
        when they see reese, but walk on without breaking stride,
        completely jaded.  he's certainly not a potential customer.

        reese crouches down as if to speak to the drunk.

                      say, buddy...did you see a
                      real bright light?
