71      ext. street/sidewalk - night                           71

        sarah exits the pizza place into the sparse crowd on the
        sidewalk.  as she passes a figure leaning against the wall
        just outside, the man turns his head to watch her.
        it is reese, his gaze impassive.
        streetlight catches the burn scar on his cheek.
        he is motionless, sinister in his long coat.
        sarah shudders.
        she walks on.

        pov - sarah, on crowd, moving toward and through approaching
        groups of pedestrians.  they seem to be glancing at her.
        was it always like that and she just never noticed?

        c.u. - sarah as she look over her shoulder.

        pov - sarah, on pizza parlor doorway.  reese is gone.
        she resists the urge to run.
        on the opposite side of the street an  lapd cruiser glides
        slowly by.  sarah is about to call out but a bus blocks
        her view and when it had passed, the car is turning away
        down a side street.

        she passes a large window with stoker's written on it, and
        ducks quickly through the door.
