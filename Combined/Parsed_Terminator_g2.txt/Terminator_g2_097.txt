104     ext. alley behind stoker's - night                     104

        dollying with reese and sarah as they run through the
        dark alley.  sarah stumbles over trashcans.
        reese pulls her along mercilessly.

        whip-panning as they clear a corner.
        the b.g. is a blur.
        the night-maze is a blur in all of these shots.
        no static angles.
        relentless forward motion.

        behind them terminator is moving with inhuman speed,
        bounding like a panther, leaping trash cans and other
        obstacles.

        tracking c.u. - terminator, catching the faintest glimpse
        of a red glow in the pupils of his eyes as he passes through
        total shadow.

106/fx  ext. alley/pov - terminator (handheld) - night         106/fx

        we know this is terminator's pov because sarah and reese
        are just ahead of us.  but the image is bizarre, alien.
        bright and hyper-real.  there is a hint of digitization,
        and the fleeing figures ahead are more luminous than the
        background, suggesting infra-red.
        the margins of the frame are crammed with columns of crt-
        type characters: columns of numbers and acronyms.  the
        data changes more rapidly than any human eye could follow.
        there is no doubt that we are seeing as a machine would see.
        the sound effects are bright and clear, as if they are
        digitized and enhanced as well.
