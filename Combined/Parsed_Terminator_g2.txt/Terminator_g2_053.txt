59      int. living room

        sarah walks around the room, searching for something.

                                sarah
                           (calling)
                      ginger, have you seen pugsley?

        ginger enters, stopping beside their phone answering machine.

                                ginger
                      not lately.  did you check
                      messages?

                                sarah
                           (still looking)
                      i thought you did.

        she checks under the couch, then behind the drapes.  she
        bends down.

                                sarah
                           (from beside cur-
                           tains)
                      come here young man.  mind
                      your mother.

        c.u. - pugsley, as the green iguana cocks its head, blinking
        vapidly.

        resume wide, sarah lifts the three foot long lizard from his
        perch on the windowsill.  she gives the complacent reptile
        a kiss on its blunt snout.

                                ginger
                           (groaning)
                      totally nauseating.

        sarah drapes the lizard across her shoulders where it sits
        contentedly as she looks for her purse.  ginger has been
        rewinding the message tape.  she punches play and a male
        voice is heard.

                                voice
                           (recorded)

                      hi, sarah...stan morsky.
                      uh, something's come up and
                      it looks like i won't be able
                      to make it tonight.  i'm really
                      sorry.  call you in a day or so.
                      sorry.  'bye.

        sarah stands still, crestfallen.

                                ginger
                      that bum.  so what if he has
                      a porsche, he can't treat you
                      like that...it's friday night
                      for crissakes.

                                sarah
                           (slumping)

                      i'll live.

                                ginger
                      i'll break his kneecaps.

        sarah resignedly slips pugsley off her shoulders.

                                sarah
                      you still love me, don't
                      you, pugsley?

        she places pugsley in a large terrarium with a 'beware of
        dog' sign taped on the side.

                                sarah
                           (continuing)
                      i'm going to a movie, kiddo.
                      see ya'.  you and matt have
                      a good time.

                                ginger
                           (as sarah exits)
                      we will, kiddo.

                                               cut to:
