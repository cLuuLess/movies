28      int. yellow maverick - day                             28

        with a blow from the heel of his hand terminator smashes loose
        the ignition assembly and strips the wires with a brutal
        twist of his fingers.  touching the proper wires he starts
        the car.

28a     ext. pawn shop - day                                   28a

        terminator walks past the long display window of an
        enormous pawnshop emporium.  signs declare, among other
        things, guns and ammo is red block letters.
        terminator passes the appliance section, and the pictures
        on a row of tv sets distort and break-up sequentially as
        he walks by, returning to normal behind him.

        he enters the store.
