        sarah catches up to him just as he is about to try and
        stop an approaching car.  she pulls his gun hand down with
        both of hers.

                                sarah
                      put that away.  i'll get one.

        she hold out her thumb to passing traffic.
        reese watches this incomprehensible ceremony skeptically.

                                sarah
                           (continuing)
                      this works...really.

189a    ext. highway/pickup - day                              189a

        reese and sarah are crammed into the cab of a beat-to-hell
        pickup truck with the driver, obviously a surfer.  laid-
        back, long-haired and well-tanned.
        reese glowers and watches the scenery through slitted eyes.

                                driver
                      ...and when it breaks right
                      off the point they get some
                      pretty rad tubes up there.
                      not awesome, but i mean, worth
                      the drive, if you're hardcore
                      like me.

                                reese
                           (to sarah)
                      rad tubes?

                                sarah
                           (to reese)
                      he's a surfer.

                                driver
                      you from back east of
                      something?

                                sarah
                      no, he's from the future.

                                driver
                      whoah.  i hear that.
                           (pause)
                      listen, i had a rough
                      night.  i gotta stop and
                      bag some z's.

        they pull off the highway toward a gas station/rest area.
