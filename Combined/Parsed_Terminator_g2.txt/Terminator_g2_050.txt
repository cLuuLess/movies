56      ext. venice street - night

        an unmarked car with a clamp-on light and siren blaring
        screeches to the curb behind two marked black-and-whites
        in front of a funky venice apartment building.  a small
        crowd  is gathered around the front steps.  lieutenant
        ed vukovich, homicide division, gets out of the car and
        strides through the crowd.  he's fiftyish, short, but
        square and solid, a human bulldog gone a little to paunch.
        he chews juicy fruit gum like a maniac: a chain-chewer.
        he's homely as an old boot.  and he's not a smart cop, he's
        a wise one; rarer still.  the onlookers, gathered patiently
        for their ten second glimpse of something under a sheet,
        separate for him to pass.
