151     int. vukovich's office - night                         151

        sarah, huddles in a blanket, is siting on a bench opposite
        vukovich's desk.  motionless.  her eyes are fixed on the
        middle distance.  she's been crying.  now she's emptied out.

        the door opens.
        at the sound of the latch sarah jerks as if struck, and cringes
        involuntarily.  vukovich enters with traxler and dr. peter
        silberman, a criminal psychologist.  silberman is smooth
        of skin and manner, young, ambitious and...fat.  he is
        enthusiastic about the workings of the human psyche, as
        emotionally involved as someone pulling the wings off a fly.

        vukovich sits beside sarah and hands her a cup of coffee.
        he puts a paternal arm around her shoulders.

                                vukovich
                     here, drink some of this...

                                sarah
                           (voice flat,
                           desperate)
                     lieutenant, are you sure it's
                     them?  maybe i should see the
                     ...bodies.

                                vukovich
                     they've already been identi-
                     fied.  there's no doubt.

        sarah  begins to cry again, slowly and very quickly.

                                sarah
                           (to herself)
                     of, god...ginger...kiddo,
                     i'm so sorry.

        vukovich takes the coffee cup from her as her arms sag and
        it starts to spill.

                                vukovich
                           (gently)
                     sarah.
                           (pause)
                     sarah, this is dr. silber-
                     man.  i'd like you to tell
                     him everything reese said
                     to you.  do you feel up to it?

                                sarah
                           (almost in-
                           audible)
                     i guess so.
                           (to silberman)
                     you're a doctor?

                                silberman
                     a criminal psychologist.

                                sarah
                     is reese crazy?

                                silberman
                     that's what we're going to
                     find out.
