193     ext. woods/clearing - day                              193

        only a few yards from the picnic area, the woods take over
        completely.

        panning with sarah

        as she runs down the path.
        reese tackles her from behind and they fall together in
        the long spring grass.
        she struggles violently to get away.

                                sarah
                      let...go...bastard...

        she gets one arm free and whacks him hard in the face.
        reese reacts instinctively, leaping back in a defensive
        crouch.  sarah freezes when she sees the .357 in his
        hand.

                                sarah
                           (continuing,
                           scared, but
                           angry)
                      oh, that's real smart.
                      go on, shoot me. that's
                      brilliant.

        reese is trembling as he lowers the gun.
        sarah too is shaking with emotion.  tears roll down her
        cheeks and her voice cracks.

                                sarah
                           (continuing)
                      jesus christ, reese.  can't
                      you see i'm scared?

        he straightens up and his arms go limp at his sides.
        he turns away.

                                sarah
                           (continuing)
                      i can't spend my life waiting
                      for that thing to catch up
                      with me...always looking over
                      my shoulder, wondering if i
                      left some tiny clue behind...

        reese doesn't respond.
        the gun slips from his fingers.
        his will seems to drain from him and he sags to his knees.
        the moment stretches.
        there is only the sunlight moving in shafts through the
        leaves, the sound of a small stream nearby, birds chirping.

                                sarah
                      reese?

        she crawls over to him.

        c.u. - reese

        in profile, with sarah in b.g.
        his eyes are closed.
        a tear meanders down his cheek.

                                sarah
                           (continuing,
                           quietly)
                      kyle?

                                reese
                           (a whisper)
                      i'm wrong here.  i wasn't
                      meant to see this...

        he gestures at their surroundings.

                                reese
                           (continuing)
                      it's...like some dream.
                      this...this...

        he touches the grass, the trunk of a tree.

                                reese
                           (continuing)
                      ...and you...all so...beauti-
                      ful.  it hurts, sarah.  more
                      than death.

        he looks are her beseechingly.

                                reese
                           (continuing)
                      don't you understand...it's
                      all gone!

        sarah puts her arm around him.
        she sniffs and wipes at her nose with the back of her hand.

                                sarah
                      we can change it, kyle.  we
                      have to try.

        she takes his shoulder in her hands.

                                sarah
                           (continuing)
                      there's no fate but what we
                      make for ourselves. right?
                      come on.  let's go, kiddo.
                      whaddya say?

        he picks up her sign and they look at each other for a
        second, then get up.

                                               cut to:
