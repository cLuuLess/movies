        sarah hits level freeway with a quarter-mile lead on the
        tanker, distant b.g., but the little bike is overloaded

        the gears.

        close on sarah and kyle, his head lolling on her shoulder.
        he starts to fall sideways.

                                sarah

        with her, closing, its trailer whiplashing violently.
