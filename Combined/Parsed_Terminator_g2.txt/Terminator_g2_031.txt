35      ext. street - day                                      35

        reese emerges from a stairwell behind a service station,
        his overcoat done up to the top button.
        he walks through the sparse morning crowd on the cluttered,
        overbuilt commercial street.
        he is out of sync.
        a stranger in a strange land.
        he holds himself tightly reined, cautious and feral as he
        moves among the unconcerned pedestrians.
        his eyes flick rapidly about.
        he is seeing this babylon for the first time.

        reese stops at a hole-in-the-wall take-out stand.  he
        watches people walk away with food.  moves closer.
        scrutinizes the next man as he orders.

                                take-out customer
                      gimme a falafel with yogurt
                      dressing and, uh, baco-bits.

        the counterman hands him his food and change wordlessly
        as reese steps up.

                                reese
                      gimme a falafel with, uh,
                      yogurt and baco-bits.

        the counterman barely looks up as he passes the mess
        through the window.

                                counterman
                      that'll be one-sixty.

        he glances up and reese is gone.  he leans half out the
        window.

                                counterman
                           (continuing)
                      hey!  son-of-a-bitch.

                                               cut to:
