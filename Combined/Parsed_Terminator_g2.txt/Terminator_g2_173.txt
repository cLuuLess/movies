187     int. culvert - dawn                                    187

        c.u. - sarah, brightly lit by daylight.  asleep.  she grimaces
        and groans.
        in the distance a dog is barking.

        reese, still holding her, lightly lifts her hair from her
        face.  an uncharacteristically tender gesture.  he gently
        caresses her cheek with the backs of his fingers.  when
        she awakens suddenly he snaps his hand away.

        sarah looks around, momentarily disoriented.  looks up at
        reese.

                                sarah
                      i was dreaming about dogs.

        reese extricates himself from her and steps out of the
        culvert.

                                reese
                      we used them to spot terminators.

        sarah groans as she straightens her legs.

                                sarah
                      your world...it's pretty
                      terrifying.
