        sarah rounds the corner, staggering, searching.
        she sees kyle crumpled face-down near the dumpster, sheltered
        from the heat by its mass.

        she drags his away.  rolls him over.

        c.u. - reese, his head lolls.  he opens his eyes

                                reese
                           (weakly)
                     sarah.

                                sarah
                     we did it, kyle.  we got it.

        she hugs him.

        they hold the embrace, silhouetted by the diminishing flames.
        it would be a wonderful final image.
        except...terminator staggers out of the blaze behind them.

        m.c.u. - terminator, the last flakes of flesh are falling
        from him like burning leaves.  his gleaming structure is
        revealed in all its intricacy.  no longer a 'he', but an 'it'.
        it looks like death rendered in steel.
        a chrome skeleton with hydraulic muscles and tendons of
        flexible cable.  in the sockets of the metal skull, the
        eyeball swivels with a whir of tiny servos, both glowing
        red now.

        it turns slowly and fixes its gaze directly into camera.
