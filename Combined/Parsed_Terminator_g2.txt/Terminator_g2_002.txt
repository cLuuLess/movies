2       ext. schoolyard - night                                2

        slow pan as the sound of stray electrical crackling subsides.
        frame comes to rest on the figure of a naked man kneeling,
        faced away, in the previously empty yard.
        he stands, slowly.
        the man is in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built,
        moving with graceful precision.

        c.u. - man, his facial features reiterate the power of his
        body and are dominated by the eyes, which are intense, blue
        and depthless.  his hair is military short.

        this man is the terminator.

        he glances down, taking calm inventory of himself, and
        notices that a fine white ash covers his skin.  he brushes
        at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence, scanning
        his surroundings.

        camera moves up as terminator approaches the schoolyard fence
        beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the
        cityscape below.  the school is perched at the edge of a pro-
        montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem-
        ing and glistening under a sullen sky.  the night clouds are
        shot through with occasional flashes of lightning, presaging
        a thunderstorm.

        terminator stands, hands on hips in prefect symmetry, gazing
        down at the city as the camera reaches full height.
