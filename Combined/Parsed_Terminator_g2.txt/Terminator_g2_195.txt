212     int. motel room/later - night                          212

        tight on sarah and reese in each other's arms.  lying
        across his chest, she surveys his face as his eyes close
        drowsily.

                                sarah
                      i bet you're ticklish.

                                reese
                           (uncompre-
                           hending)
                      ticklish?

        sarah's hand moves out of frame.  after a moment reese
        looks down, puzzled.

                                reese
                      what are you doing?

                                sarah
                           (continuing
                           doggedly)
                      you'll beg for mercy in
                      a second.

        reese seems unperturbed.  finally he begins to squirm.

                                reese
                      i don't think i like this.

                                sarah
                      you're not supposed to.

        now reese is becoming desperate.  a grimace spreads across
        his face.  it becomes a grin.  then he's laughing, trying
        to escape but she won't let him, and they collapse, laughing
        together.
        sarah gazes at his grin, a glimpse of the reese that might
        have been, in another life.

        a moment later the grin vanishes at the sound of dogs barking
        outside.
        reese is off the bed in an instant, crouched tense, eyes
        alert.  feral as ever.

                                reese
                           (whispering)
                      listen to the dogs.

                                               cut to:
