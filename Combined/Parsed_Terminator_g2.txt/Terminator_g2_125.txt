134     int./ext. brown buick/parking lot - night              134

        reese uses the butt of the shotgun to smash loose the
        ignition assembly.  he begins working on the wires.  a
        police cruiser appears, moving slowly between the rows of
        cars.

        reese grabs sarah and pulls her down to huddle below dash
        level.  a moment later a spotlight flashes across the seats
        above them.  they hear the helicopter circling closer.

                                sarah
                      reese...why me?  why does
                      it want me?

        they are lying very close, a forced intimacy.  reese's voice
        is an urgent whisper, almost in her ear.  a cruiser passes
        so close they can hear its radio clearly.

                                reese
                      there's so much...

                                sarah
                      tell me.  just start at the
                      beginning.

        reese musters his thoughts.  and starts.

                                reese
                      there was a war.  a few years
                      from now.  nuclear war.  the
                      whole thing.  all this--

        his gesture includes the car, the city, the world.

                                reese
                           (continuing)
                      --everythingis gone.  just
                      gone.  there were survivors.
                      here.  there.  nobody knew who
                      started it.
                           (pause)
                      it was the machines.

                                sarah
                      i don't understand...

                                reese
                      defense network computer. new.
                      powerful.  hooked into everything.
                      trusted to run it all.  they say it
                      got smart...a new order of intelli-
                      gence.  then it saw all people as
                      a threat, not just the ones on the
                      other side.  decided out fate in a
                      microsecond...extermination.

        reese pauses, and when he continues it's less like a military
        briefing, quieter.

                                reese
                           (continuing)
                      didn't see the war.  i was born
                      after, in the ruins.  grew up
                      there.  starving.  hiding from
                      the h-k's.

                                sarah
                      the what?

                                reese
                      hunter killers.  patrol machines.
                      build in automated factories.
                      most of us were rounded up, put in
                      camps...for orderly disposal.

        he pushes up the sleeve of his jacket and shows
        her a ten digit number etches on the skin of his forearm.
        beneath the numbers is a pattern of lines like the auto-
        matic-pricing marks on product packages.

                                reese
                           (continuing)
                      burned in by laser scan.
                           (pause)
                      some of us were kept alive...
                      to work.  loading bodies.  the
                      disposal units ran night and day.
                      we were that close to going out
                      forever...

        the helicopter moves overhead.  its searchlight illum-
        inates the car interior, moves on.  before the rotor
        sound fads, reese starts the car.

                                               cut to:
