210     int. motel room - night                                210

        a heartwarming domestic scene.
        sarah and kyle have pulled the dresser out to use as a
        worktable.  pans, packages and bottles clutter the kitchen,
        b.g.  on the table between them are eight ten-inch lengths
        of plumber's pipe, threaded each end.  kyle is showing
        sarah how to tamp the high-explosive putty into the pipe
        bombs and seal them shut.

                                reese
                      make sure there's none on the
                      threads, like this.  now screw
                      the end-cap on...very gently.


                                sarah
                      you must have had a fun child-
                      hood.

                                reese
                      that's good.  now, seven more
                      like that while i make fuses.

                                sarah
                      i was thinking, there's so
                      much i've got to show you
                      when we get through this.
                      it's mind boggling, the pos-
                      sibilities...disneyland, the
                      beach, movies...matinees with
                      popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...

                                reese
                      hot dogs?

                                sarah
                      i want to buy you a hot dog so
                      bad,kyle...all the things you've
                      never seen and done.  you're here,
                      but wherever you go, and whatever
                      you touch, you bring the war with
                      you.

                                reese
                      my whole life has been combat.

                                sarah
                      i want it to be over for you.

                                reese
                      not possible.

                                sarah
                      i want it to be over for me too.
                      i feel like i slipped over some
                      invisible line, that i'm in your
                      world now.  everything's the same,
                      but i see it differently.
                      it's like, there's you and me,
                      and him...but nobody else can
                      understand or help or even touch
                      us.

        reese looks up and finally catches her gaze.  he reaches
        out for her hand and it seems he may be taking it to
        comfort her.
        but he turns her wrist to read her watch.

                                reese
                      we'll head out at 0200.
                      that gives you four hours
                      to sleep if you want.  i'll
                      finish.
