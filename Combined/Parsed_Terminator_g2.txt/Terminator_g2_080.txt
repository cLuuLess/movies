                      alright, ms. connor.  listen
                      carefully.  you're in a public
                      place, you'll be safe 'til we
                      get there.  stay visible.
                      don't go outside or in the
                      restroom.  i'll be there in
                      a few minutes.

        he hangs up and grabs his coat, motioning to traxler.
