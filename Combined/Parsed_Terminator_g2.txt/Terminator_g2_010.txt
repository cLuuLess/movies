11      ext. alley/nearby - night                              11

        low panaglide with reese, running full tilt, displaying
        incredible agility.

        reese's pov, the alley walls blur by.  the view of a hot-
        wired rat in an urban maze.

        c.u. - reese, camera hugging him as he sprints and turns,
        alternately front-lit, side-lit and silhouetted as the
        electric glare of the city wheels about him.

        angle - alley mouth, reese flashes though intermittent
        cross-lighting in the b.g.

        another unit arrives out front and reese melts back into
        the alley, only to see a cop round the corner behind him.
        sandwiched.  reese crashes into a steel door, rending the
        lock, and vanishes into the darkness within.

        the newly arrived cops are a k-9 unit.  they open the back
        door of the squad car to release a large black doberman.
