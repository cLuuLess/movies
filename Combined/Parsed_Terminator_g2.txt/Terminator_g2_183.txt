200     ext. motel - day

        the two fugitives walk toward an economy motel of the
        two-story park-by-the-door variety.
        sarah turns to wave as a tractor-trailer pulls away noisily,
        heading back to the interstate.  the driver answers her wave
        out the side window.  reese stops for a moment outside the
        motel office to pet a german shepherd sitting on the porch.
        the dog wags its tail and licks his hand.

        reese opens the door and they go in.

                                               cut to:
