        terminator steps over the bodies of the two cops without
        breaking stride.

        over his shoulder, moving with him as he walks down the
        hall.  comes to a door.  tries it.  locked.
        kicks it in.
        a desk cop, drawing his gun, sprints for cover.

        in computer-enhanced vision we see the cop dash around a
        corner in slow motion.  as he disappears behind the wall
        an animated outline of him is still visible...a probabilistic
        extrapolation of his motion.  there is a target cross-
        hair following the figure.
