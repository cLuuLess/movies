        sarah rounds the corner, walking fast as she undoes her
        apron.  she calls out to the walls without looking up.

                                sarah
                      i'm on break, chuck.  carla's
                      got my station.

        as she approaches the locker room where the girls take
        their coffee breaks, the door bursts open and nancy
        beckons to sarah.

                                nancy
                           (excitedly)
