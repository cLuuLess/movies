        reese crouches in an alley, out of sight of passersby,
        wolfing his food.  the sauce runs down his sleeve but he
        doesn't notice.

35a     int. big bob's/dining area - day                       35a

        an old man with a shrunken, ungenerous face scowls at
        the menu as sarah wipes the tabletop in front of him.

                                sarah
                      i haven't seen you in here
                      lately, mr. miller.

                                mr. miller
                      what's it to ya?

                                sarah
                      you must have a girlfriend.

                                mr. miller
                      that's none of your business.

                                sarah
                      aha!  is she young?

        mr. miller lowers his menu and glares at her.

                                mr. miller
                      compared to me she is.  how

                      come you're not at the cash
                      anymore?  they catch ya steal-
                      ing?

                                sarah
                           (smiling)
                      what's it to ya?

        when she leaves, the old man is grinning, behind the menu,
        where no one can see him.
