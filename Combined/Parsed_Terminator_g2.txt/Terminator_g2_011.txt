12      int. department store - night                          12

        reese finds himself among the display racks of a discount
        department store.  a searchlight stabs in the front
        window as he dashes into the maze of aisles.

        three cops enter behind him through the shattered door.

        fast panaglide with reese, as he crab-runs low among the
        moving shadows where flashlights quarter the darkness.  he
        bolts the open space behind a display window.  sees the
        outside searchlight sweep toward him.  freezes.

        angle - reese, his feral face frozen among the smooth-
        featured, smiling mannequins.  as the light passes, reese
        silently moves on.

        angle - cop, passing the end of a long aisle b.g. while in
        the f.g. a hand enters frame, removing a knit shirt from a
        hanger.  reese slips the shirt on quietly and does a fast
        crab-walk across the aisles to melt into the other racks
        and shadows, camera moving low with him.
