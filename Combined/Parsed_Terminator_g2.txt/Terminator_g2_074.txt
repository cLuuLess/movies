81      int. hallway/bedroom                                   81

        close on phone machine, as the telephone rings loudly in the
        ensuing silence.
        terminator spins, drawing an instantaneous bead on the source
        of the sound, but doesn't fire.

                                ginger's voice
                           (recorded)
                      hi there.
                           (pause)
                      ha ha ha, fooled you.  you're
                      talking to a machine...

        c.u. - terminator, motionless, listening.

                                ginger's voice
                           (recorded, continuing)
                      ...but don't be shy, it's okay.
                      machines need love too...

        terminator turns abruptly back to ginger's body.  he turns
        it over, assuring himself that she is dead.

                                ginger's voice
                           (continuing, recorded)
                      ...so talk to it and ginger, that's
                      me, or sarah will get back to you.
                      wait for the beep.

        there is a loud tone and the incoming call is heard.

                                sarah's voice
                           (on machine)
                      ginger, this is sarah...

        terminator's head snaps back and he freezes, listening.
        he rises slowly as sarah's voice continues.

        tight on his unblinking eyes.

                                sarah's voice
                           (on machine, contin-
                           uing)
                      ...i'm in this sleazy bar called
                      stoker's on pico but i'm too
                      scared to leave.  i'm really
                      scared, kiddo...
