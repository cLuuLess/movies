107     ext. adjoining alley - night                           107

        reese and sarah turn a corner by caroming off the wall
        without slowing and pelt down a narrower alley.  this
        one is lined with a row of parked cars and connects to
        the street.  there is little room to run.
        reese is reloading on the run, dropping shells.

        behind them terminator enters the alley, gaining.

        low angle, fast panaglide ahead of the fleeing pair.
        as they breast the last car reese shoves sarah hard,
        pitching her on her face to the pavement.
        he flings open the car door...a shield.
        drops to the ground.
        fires into the gas tank of a car further back in the row
        just before terminator reaches it.

        the car explodes, filling the alley with fire.  an inferno
        funneled between the enclosing walls.

        angle on reese and sarah behind the car door as flames
        roar over the hood.

        on terminator, as he slides to a stop, cut off by the
        wall of flame.

        reese doesn't waste any time stuffing sarah into the car.
        climbing in after and over her he twists two wires together
        and we recognize it as his stolen grey sedan.
        the engine catches.

        a silhouette rockets out of the flames.
        terminator, leaping from the roof of the blazing car ahead,
        impacts on the hood of reese's car.  his hair and coat are
        burning.

                                               cut to:
