        e.c.u. - terminator, in profile, showing his lacerated eye.
        he is close to a mirror, practically touching it, staring
        intently.

        macro - x-acto knife lying on the dresser.  terminator's
        fingers lift it.  camera tilts to follow as it rises to
        his face, holds tight on left eye.
        with a smooth motion the knife point enters the eyeball
        and cuts away the ruins sclera and cornea, as well as part
        of the damaged eyelids.

        he wipes with a rag to clear the electronic eye's vision.
        revealing the faintly glowing lens mechanism, suspended in
        a chrome socket by tiny servos.
        the eye whirs quietly as it tracks.

        sequence of shots, showing various repairs.
        terminator's right hand, its wrist sutured crudely, holds
        a needle and sewing thread and starts to work on abdominal
        wound out of frame below.
        he slips a glove over the damaged hand.
        a motoring cap over the blistered scalp.

        a fresh shirt to hide his body wounds.
        this is followed by a new overcoat.

        c.u. - terminator, contemplating his reflection in the
        mirror.  with the hat pulled down, the collar pulled up,
        and favoring his right profile he looks unhurt...though
        a bit gaunt and pale.

        a turn of his head brings the balefully glowing left eye
        in its metal socket into view.
        he slips on a pair of tight, wrap-around sunglasses.

        full shot as he goes to the bed and flips up the stained
        mattress.  he picks up the remington 12 gauge, the ar-180
        and the .38 off the springs and leaves by the fire escape.
