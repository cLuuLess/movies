20      ext. big bob's restraunt - day                         20

        sarah buzzes into the parking lot of big bob's family
        restaurant and chains the moped to the icon of big bob
        himself.  the fiberglass cherub holds up his mammoth
        hamburger in perpetual homage to whatever deity watches
        out for fat kids.
        sarah removes a stack of college textbooks from the luggage
        carrier and tuns to go into the restaurant.

                                sarah
                           (to big bob)
                      watch this for me, big buns.
