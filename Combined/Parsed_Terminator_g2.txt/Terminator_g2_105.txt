114     int. gray sedan - night                                114

        reese drives with total, nerveless absorption.  his eyes
        flick to the mirror, to the road, over his shoulder, back
        ...and the world spins outside.
        with occasional glances to sarah, he speaks to her in a
        clipped, military voice.

                                reese
                     are you injured?  are you
                     shot?

        no response.
        he reaches over and runs his hands over her arms, legs,
        chest.  sarah flinches.
        she feels the blind panic boiling up within her.
        she pushes his hand away and opens the door.
        reese slams her back in the seat and slaps her.  hard.

                                reese
                           (continuing)
                     do exactly what i say.
                     exactly.  don't move un-
                     less i say.  don't make a
                     sound unless i say.  do
                     you understand?

        as he speaks he is locking the door and fastening sarah's
        seatbelt over her, cinching it very tightly, like you would
        for a child.  she doesn't answer.

                                reese
                           (continuing/
                           shouting)
                     do you understand?

                                sarah
                           (a whisper)
                     yes.  don't hurt me.

                                reese
                     i'm here to help you.  reese,
                     sergeant/tech-com, dn38416...

        sarah stares numbly at his outstretched hand.  with zero
        strength she automatically returns his handshake.

                                reese
                           (continuing)
                     assigned to protect you.
                     you've been targetted for
                     termination.

                                               cut to:
