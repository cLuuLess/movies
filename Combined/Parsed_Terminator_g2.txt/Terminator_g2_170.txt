182     int./ext. drainage culvert - night                     182

        angle looking out from the mouth of an enclosed concrete
        storm drain that passes under the road.  reese, followed
        by sarah, trudges down the slope and ducks inside.
        the floor is wet but he doesn't seem to mind.
        they both hunker down with their backs to the concrete,
        facing each other.
        they look beaten, grimy, exhausted.
        she huddles under the blanket, waif-like.

                                reese
                      you cold?

                                sarah
                      freezing.

                                reese
                      come here.

        she sits beside him and they wrap their arms around each
        other with the blanket covering both of them.

                                sarah
                      reese...you got a first name?

                                reese
                      kyle.

                                sarah
                      kyle, what's it like when you
                      go through time?

                                reese
                      white light.  pain.  like
                      being ripped inside out...
                      slowly.  like being born,
                      maybe.

        sarah scowls and draws her hand out from under his jacket.

                                sarah
                      you're wet.  oh my god.

        in the beam of the flashlight her hand is glistening
        with blood.

                                reese
                      i caught one, back there.

                                sarah
                           (incredulous)
                      caught one?  you mean you
                      got shot?

        reese shrugs.

                                reese
                      it's not bad.

        sarah sits up and turns toward him.

                                sarah
                      we gotta get you to a doctor.

                                reese
                      it's okay.  forget it.

                                sarah
                      forget it?  are you crazy?
                      let me see it.

        sarah opens his jacket and the flashlight beam shows his
        shirt bloodsoaked at the shoulder.

                                sarah
                           (continuing)
                      jeez.  you idiot.  take
                      this off.

        she cradles the flashlight between her knees and opens
        the first aid kit as he removes his jacket.

                                reese
                           (looking at the
                           wound)
                      see.  missed everything.
                      passed through the meat.

        sarah starts swabbing the flesh wound.

                                sarah
                      this is gonna make me puke.
                      talk about something.

                                reese
                      what?

                                sarah
                      just talk.  tell me about
                      my son.  is he tall?

        she places a gauze pad in place and starts to wrap it.

                                reese
                      about my height.  he
                      has your--
                           (winces)
                      ...damn...he has your
                      eyes.

        sarah glances at his face for a second and then goes back
        to work.

                                sarah
                      what's he like?

                                reese
                           (thoughtful)
                      you trust him.  he's got that
                      strength.  you'd die in a
                      second for john.

                                sarah
                      well, at least i know what
                      to name him.  i don't suppose
                      you'd know who the father is?
                      so i don't tell him to get
                      lost when i meet him.

                                reese
                      john never said much about
                      him.  he dies.  even before
                      the war...

                                sarah
                           (interrupting)
                      stop!  i don't want to know.
                      hold still.  so...it was john
                      that ordered you here?

                                reese
                      i volunteered.

                                sarah
                      you volunteered?

                                reese
                      it was an honor.  a chance
                      to meet the legend.  sarah
                      connor.  who taught her son
                      to fight...organize, prepare.
                      from when he was a kid.  when
                      you were in hiding, before
                      the war.

        she stops taping.  she seems lost, her bravado dissipated.

                                sarah
                      you talk about things i haven't
                      done yet in the past tense.  it's
                      making me crazy.  i can't think.
                           (pause)
                      are you sure you've got the
                      right person?

        reese appraises her coldly.

                                reese
                      i'm sure.

                                sarah
                      come on, me? the mother
                      of the future?  am i tough?
                      organized?  i can't even balance
                      my checkbook.  i cry when i see
                      a cat that's been run over...
                      and i don't even like cats.

        she pulls the bandage tight with a knot.

                                reese
                      ow!  no, it's okay.  it's
                      better tight.

                                sarah
                      and anyway, what do i know
                      about guerrilla warfare?

                                reese
                      you'll learn.

                                sarah
                           (angry)
                      look, reese, i didn't ask for
                      this honor and i don't want it.
                      any of it.

                                reese
                      john gave me a message for
                      you.  made me memorize it.
                      'sarah"...this is the message...
                      'sarah, thank you.  for your
                      courage through the dark years.
                      i can't help you with what you
                      must soon face, except to tell
                      you that the future is not set...
                      there is no such thing as fate,
                      but what we make for ourselves
                      by our own will.  you must be
                      stronger than you imagine you
                      can be.  you must survive, or i
                      will never exist.'  that's all.

        sarah stares at him as the enormity of it all becomes real
        to her.  reese moves his arm, testing the bandage.

                                reese
                           (continuing)
                      good field-dressing.

                                sarah
                           (brightening)
                      you like it?  it's my first.

        he rebuttons his shirt and they return to the warmth-
        conserving embrace.  sarah gazes out the entrance, into
        the night.

                                reese
                      sleep.  it'll be light soon.

                                sarah
                           (closing her
                           eyes)
                      okay.  talk some more.

                                reese
                      about what?

                                sarah
                           (murmuring)
                      about where you're from.

        kyle watches the helicopter circling far in the distance.

                                reese
                      alright.
                           (pause)
                      you stay down by day, but at
                      night you can move around.
                      the h-k's use infra-red so you
                      still have to watch out.
                      but they're not too bright.
                      john taught us ways to dust them
                      them.  that's when the infiltra-
                      tors started to appear.  the
                      terminators were the newest,
                      the worst...

        during his monologue we have panned into the darkness outside
        and to the helicopter, which flies out of frame, leaving
        black.  a rotor roar fades up.

                                               cut in black to:


183/fx  ext. city ruins, 2029 - night                          183/fx

        black sky.  stars.
        with a roar an aerial patrol craft enters close overhead.
        it has flashing red and blue lights and powerful search-
        lights which stab down.

        tilt down

        to a vista of moonlit devastation.
        white ash blows in drifts among fire-gutted ruins.
        blackened bones lie everywhere in heaps.
        searchlights sweep the night.
        another aerial unit hovers several blocks away, firing
        tracers into the ruins.

                                               cut to:


184/fx  ext. ruins/street - night                              184/fx

        low angle

        as a gleaming chrome h-k grinds through the debris of the
        shattered street on its tank-like tracks, crushing burnt
        skulls.
        its head turns slowly, playing high-intensity lights over the
        buildings.
        its hydraulic arms are folded, mantis-like, against its
        'torso'.  after it passes a number of human figures dart
        from shadow to shadow, b.g.

                                               cut to:
