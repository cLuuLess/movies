194     int. terminator's hotel room - day                     194

        terminator sits in his room with the blinds drawn tight.
        murky.  claustrophobic.  with knife-slits of hot sunlight.

        medium on terminator

        sitting on the edge of the bed.
        his appearance isn't improving.

        a patch of scalp is blown away, revealing chrome underneath.
        a flap of skin dangles from his cheek, which exposes some
        of the drive cables which move the lips.
        he is scanning sarah's address book, turning a page every
        two seconds.

        c.u. - terminator

        his eyes tracking rapidly.  his skin is waxy, white, bruised,
        gangrenous in places.  he ignores the few flies crawling
        on his face.

        in microseconds the handwritten entries are translated
        into crt-type characters and displayed to one side of the
        screen.  this updates instantly as the page is turned.
