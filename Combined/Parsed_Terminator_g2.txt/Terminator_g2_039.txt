        sarah lurches away from the curb on her moped, almost
        spilling ginger who is attempting to ride double.  they
        swing out onto a main thoroughfare and careen through
        the bumper-to-bumper traffic.
        sarah maneuvers deftly though overloaded and unstable.

        near-misses.
