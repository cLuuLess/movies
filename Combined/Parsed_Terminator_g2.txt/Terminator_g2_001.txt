        silence.  gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes
        audible.  a low angle bounded on one side by a chain-link
        fence and on the other by the one-story public school build-
        ings.  spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha-
        dows.  this is a los angeles public school in a blue collar
        neighborhood.

        angle between school buildings, where a trash dumpster looms
        in a low angle, part of the clutter behind the gymnasium.
        a cat enters frame.  camera dollies forward, prowling with
        him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows.

        close on cat, which freezes, alert, sensing something just
        beyond human perception.

        a sourceless wind rises, and with it a keening whine.
        papers blow across the pavement.
        the cat yowls and hides under the dumpster.
        windows rattle in their frames.
        the whine intensifies, accompanied now by a wash of frigid
        purple light.  a concussion like a thunderclap right over-
        head blows in all the windows facing the yard.

        c.u. - cat, its eyes are wide as the glare dies.

        electrical discharges arc from the dumpster to a water
        faucet and climb a drain pipe like a jacob's ladder.
