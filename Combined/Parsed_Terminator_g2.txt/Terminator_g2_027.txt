30      ext. gas station/phone booth - day                     30

        the yellow maverick pulls to a stop beside a single phone
        booth.

        moving with terminator, as he gets out, walks to the booth
        and rapidly pulls its occupant out by his greasy t-shirt,
        flinging him backward into the parking lot.  the guy is
        bear-like, slab-handed, but terminator doesn't even glance
        back as he steps in to take the man's place.

                                man
                           (outraged)
                      hey, man...

31      phone booth

        a woman's voice, a faint reedy monologue, issues from the
        dangling receiver.
        terminator leafs rapidly through the directory.

        beside a now-familiar listing:
