5       ext. downtown street/alley - night                     5

        another part of the city.  seedy apartments and storefronts.
        the streets glisten, hissing with sporadic late night traffic.
        slow pan and dolly into the mouth of a narrow alley lined
        with trash containers and fire escapes.  from a recessed
        doorway, two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement.
        an angry, inarticulate drunkard's monologue rises occasionally
        above the rain sounds.

        angle - doorway,  the derelict rouses from his bitter stupor
        as a brilliant purple glare lights up the wet brickwork
        around him.  a shockwave hurls trash into the air.
        painted over windows shatter.
        rat scurry, blinded.

        a figure drops into frame as if out of the sky and smacks
        the pavement with a muddy splash.

        c.u. - derelict, as he blinks at the fading glare, amazed.

        a naked man, compact and muscular, rises in a defensive
        crouch.  kyle reese is 22, but his face has been aged by
        ordeal, the mouth hard, eyes grim.  a crinkled burn scar
        traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead.  other
        scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body.

        the rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin
        as electrical arcs lace back and forth between the fire
        escapes behind him, hissing and sputtering.  the sound
        fades, then stops altogether, to be replaced by a rising
        scream of animal agony.

        reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley.
