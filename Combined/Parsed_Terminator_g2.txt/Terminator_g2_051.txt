        camera panaglides ahead of vukovich, as he climbs the switch-
        back staircase two steps at a time.  he passes two uniformed
        cops at the doorway of a second-floor apartment, and enters
        to find a quiet flurry of activity.  several detectives and
        a photographer prowl around, taking evidence, taking pictures.

        in the center of the living room floor is the body of a
        young woman, crumpled face down in a small lake of blood.
        two bags of groceries lie split open on the floor in front
        of her.

        vukovich glances up as he is joined by detective sgt.
        traxler.  traxler is black, lean and very jaded.

                                vukovich
                      give me the short version.

                                traxler
                      six shots at less than ten
                      feet.  weapon was a large
                      caliber--

        vukovich is looking at the body.

                                vukovich
                      no shit.

        traxler turns to a passing detective.

                                traxler
                      come on. man.  don't track
                      it all over.  it's un-
                      professional.

        he turn back to vukovich, gesturing at the body.

                                traxler
                           (continuing)
                      okay, let's see...got a pos-
                      itive on her.  she's sarah
                      connor, works as a legal--


                                vukovich
                           (interrupting)
                      that can't be right.  that's
                      the name of the one valley
                      division mopped up this after-
                      noon.

        traxler slips something off his clipboard and hands
        it to the lieutenant.

                                traxler
                      here's her driver's license.

                                vukovich
                           (pondering)
                      you gotta be kidding me.  the
                      new guys'll be short-stroking
                      it over this one.  a one-day
                      pattern killer.

                                traxler
                      i hate the weird ones.
