64      int. sarah's apartment - night                         64

        close on phone, connected to the answering machine.  the
        outgoing message trigger after the second ring.

                                ginger's voice
                           (machine v.o.)
                      hi there.
                           (long pause)
                      ha ha ha, fooled you. you're
                      talking to a machine, but don't
                      by shy, it's okay.  machines need
                      love too, so talk to it and ginger,
                      that's me, or sarah will get back
                      to you.  wait for the beep.

        as the message plays, camera dollies off the phone machine
        and down the corridor of the dark apartment.  as the bedroom
        door draws near, ginger's recorded voice fades and is super-
        ceded by cries and moans.
