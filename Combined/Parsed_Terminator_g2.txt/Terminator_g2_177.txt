192     ext. service station/picnic table - day                192

        sarah is sitting at a table under a tree, lettering
        something with a lipstick on a cardboard box-flap.

        e.c.u. - sign, as the last letters are finished.
        it reads:
        silicon valley

        full on sarah as she retracts the lipstick and leans
        across to hand it to a girl at the next table.

                                sarah
                      thanks a lot.

                                reese (v.o.)
                      what's that?

        sarah looks up, startled to see him standing beside her.

                                sarah
                      that's where we're going.

                                reese
                      why?

        sarah point to the directory page lying on the table.

        macro - page

        sarah's finger points to a listing which reads:

        cyber dynamics corporation
        18144 el camino real, s'vale

        angle on sarah and reese

        she looks smug.

                                sarah
                      look.  i found it.  isn't
                      that it?  cyber dynamics
                      corporation?

                                reese
                      what about it?

                                sarah
                      didn't you say that they're
                      going to develop this
                      revolutionary new thing...

                                reese
                      molecular-memory.

                                sarah
                      whatever...they become the
                      hotshot computer guys so they
                      get the job to build el computer
                      grande...skynet...for the
                      government.  right?

                                reese
                           (uneasy)
                      that's the way it was told
                      to me.

        sarah's fear has been replaced by excitement.

                                sarah
                      well, we're gonna uninvent the
                      bastard.  eighty-six it.  we'll
                      blow up the place...burn it
                      down.  something.

                                reese
                           (very cold)
                      tactically dangerous.  we
                      lay low.

                                sarah
                      reese.  think it through.
                      we can prevent the war.
                      nobody else is gonna do it.
                      if we go to anybody official
                      we wind up back in jail and
                      then that walking cuisinart
                      has got us again.  we have to
                      so it ourselves.

                                reese
                      that's not my mission.

                                sarah
                           (upset, mocking
                           his manner)
                      listen.  understand.  i'm
                      not a military objective,
                      reese.  i'm a person...
                      you don't own me.

        reese takes her arm and pulls her to her feet.

                                reese
                      let's go.  time to move out.

                                sarah
                      fuck you!  let go of me!

        she jerks her arm free.  he reaches for her again but
        she outdistances him, running.

                                reese
                           (warning tone)
                      sarah!

        she dashes down a footpath among the trees, clutching her
        sign.  reese follows her into the woods.

                                               cut to:
