        shots are echoing in the hallway as vukovich whips open
        the door, startling the hell out of sarah.

                                vukovich
                      stay here.

        he turns the locking knob and slams the door.
        leaving her alone.
        she flinches as more shots sound.  closer.

        terminator rips the cover off the station's main electrical
        panel.  he pulls loose the hose-like 440 volt
        incoming line and feeds it directly into the lighting
        circuit.

        all down the corridor the overhead fluorescent units
        explode, showering sparks and glass.

        the building is plunged into darkness.

        arcs sputter and flare, lighting the corridors strobo-
        scopically.

        sarah's terror skyrockets when the ceiling lamp explodes
        and the office goes black.
