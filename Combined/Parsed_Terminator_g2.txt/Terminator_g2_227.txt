        reese crouches in a trash-dumpster which is sandwiched
        between the wall and the tanker.  there are only inches
        of clearance as the trailers pass by.

        he lights a pipe charge, jumps up and wedges it under the
        tank-cylinder of the second trailer.
        he ducks as it rolls on.

        sarah is stumbling in the glare of the truck's lights.

        the rear trailer explodes.  an unbelievable fireball erupts
        skyward, silhouetting sarah's running figure f.g.
        the dumpster is enveloped by fire and hurled, rolling, down
        the alley.

        sarah makes it around a corner as the forward trailer
        explodes and an ocean of flame rolls forward, blasting by her.

        the dumpster topples and kyle rolls out, surrounded by fire.


248/fx  sequence - terminator                                  248/fx

        in the center of the inferno terminator struggles violently.
        his flesh fires and sizzles.  he tears loose from the
        twisted wreckage and collapses to the ground.  sinks into
        a charred mass.  stops moving.

        c.u. - terminator, mouth open, skull-like, motionless
        in the flames.
