159     int. vukovich's office - night                         159

        tight on video monitor showing reese in the interrogation
        room.

                                reese
                           (recorded)
                      ...it's just him and me.

        cut wide revealing sarah, silberman, vukovich and traxler
        watching a monitor sitting amid incredible paperwork clutter
        on a desk top.

                                silberman
                           (recorded)
                      why didn't you bring any
                      weapons?  something more
                      advanced.  don't you have
                      ray guns?

        traxler, standing in the back, grins and nudges silberman,
        who nods appreciatively.

        tight on reese's recorded image - he glares at silberman.

        on sarah, as silberman's voice is heard.

                                silberman
                           (recorded)
                      show me a piece of future
                      technology.

                                reese
                           (recorded/con-
                           trolling his
                           hostility)
                      you go naked.  something about
                      the field generated by a living
                      organism.  nothing dead will go.

                                silberman
                           (recorded)
                      why?

                                reese
                           (recorded)
                      i didn't build the fucking
                      thing.

                                silberman
                           (recorded)
                      okay.  okay.  but this...
                           (consults his
                           notes)
                      cyborg...if it's metal...

                                reese
                           (recorded)
                      surrounded by living tissue.

                                silberman
                           (recorded)
                      of course.

        the real silberman put the tape on "pause".

                                silberman
                           (excited)
                      this is great stuff.  i could
                      make a career out of this guy.
                      you see how clever this part
                      is...how it doesn't require a
                      shred of proof.  most paranoid
                      delusions are intricate...but
                      this is brilliant.

        he starts the tape again.

                                silberman
                           (recorded)
                      why were the other two women
                      killed?

                                reese
                           (recorded)
                      most official records were
                      lost in the war.  the computer
                      knew almost nothing about
                      connor's mother.  her name.
                      where she lived, just the city.
                      no scanner pictures.  the
                      terminator was just being
                      systematic.

        c.u. - reese, on screen, as he goes on.

                                reese
                           (recorded, con-
                           tinuing)
                      you've heard enough.  decide.
                      are you going to release me?

                                silberman
                           (recorded)
                      i'm afraid that's not up
                      to me.

                                reese
                           (recorded/voice
                           rising)
                      then why am i talking to you?
                      get out.

        on sarah, dollying slowly in to c.u. as we hear reese
        begin to shout.

                                silberman
                           (recorded)
                      i can help you...

                                reese
                      who is in authority here?

        c.u. reese, on screen, as he looks straight at the camera.

                                reese
                           (recorded)
                      you still don't get it.
                      he'll find her.  that's
                      what he does.  all he does...

        medium on vukovich, gesturing to silberman, who is near the
        machine, to kill it.

                                reese
                           (recorded, con-
                           tinuing)
                      you can't stop him. he'll
                      wade through you...

        c.u. - reese, on screen, rising partway out of his chair,
        yelling.

                                reese
                           (recorded, continuing)
                      ...reach down her throat, and
                      pull her fucking heart out...

        the screen goes black.
        vukovich has cut off the tape.

                                silberman
                           (glancing around)
                      sorry.

        c.u. - sarah staring at the empty screen.

                                sarah
                           (turning)
                      so reese is crazy.

                                silberman
                      in technical terminology,
                      he's a loon.

                                sarah
                      but...

        vukovich hands her something that looks like umpire's
        padding.

                                vukovich
                      sarah, this is body armor.
                      out tac guys wear it.  it'll
                      stop a 12 gauge round.  this
                      other individual must've had
                      one under his coat.

        sarah want to believe him.  god help her if he's wrong.

                                sarah
                      but what about him punching
                      through the windshield?

                                traxler
                           (shrugs)
                      probably on pcp, broke every
                      bone in his hand and won't feel
                      it for hours.  there was this
                      guy once that...

        vukovich cuts him off with a gesture and sits beside sarah
        on the bench.

                                vukovich
                      why don't you just stretch out
                      here and get some sleep.  it'll
                      take your mom a good hour to get
                      here from redlands.

                                sarah
                      i can't sleep.

                                vukovich
                      go ahead.  you're safe.  there're
                      thirty cops in this building.

                                sarah
                      okay.

        she lays her head on a wadded up blanket as everyone
        leaves the office.

159a    int. corridor

        vukovich pauses outside the door, lost in thought.  traxler
        studies him for a second.

                                traxler
                      what?
                           (pause)
                      ed, come on...the guy's a
                      wacko.

        vukovich glances up.

                                vukovich
                           (quietly)
                      he'd better be.
