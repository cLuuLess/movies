128     int. grey sedan - night                                128

                                reese
                           (continuing)
                      but outside, it's living
                      human tissue.  flesh, skin,
                      hair...blood.  grown for the
                      cyborgs.

                                sarah
                      look, reese, i know you want
                      to help, but...

                                reese
                           (cutting her off)
                      pay attention.  the 600
                      series had rubber skin.
                      we spotted them easy.  but
                      these are new.  they look
                      human.  sweat, bad breath,
                      everything.  very hard to
                      spot.  i had to wait 'til
                      he moved on you before i
                      could zero him.

                                sarah
                      hey, i'm not stupid, y'know.
                      they can't build anything like
                      that yet.

                                reese
                      no.  not yet.  not for about
                      forty years.

        reese is driving sedately for a low profile, but his eyes
        rove constantly, searching for a place to ditch the car.
        sarah's eyes are alert as well, and her tone becomes a bit
        too cool.

                                sarah
                      so, it's from the future, is
                      that right?

                                reese
                      one possible future.  four your
                      point of view.  i don't know the
                      tech stuff.

                                sarah
                      and you're from the future too?

                                reese
                      right.

        they come to a red light and reese stops.

                                sarah
                           (patronizingly)
                      right...

        like a shot she unlatches the seatbelt, pulls the door lock
        and has the door half open before reese can react.  he catches
        her arm and hauls her struggling back into the car.

        sarah sinks her teeth into his hand with all her strength.
        his grip doesn't slacken.
        slowly, without releasing her, he reaches across with his
        other hand and shuts the door.  his face shows no reaction.

        sarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his
        arm from the bite, that at his grim, scarred face.  the
        light turns green and reese drives on.
        sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth.

                                reese
                           (coldly)
                      cyborgs don't feel pain.  i
                      do.  don't...do that...again.

        he wipes his hand on his pants.

                                sarah
                           (weakly, plead-
                           ing)
                      just let me go.

                                reese
                           (slow, but intense)
                      listen.  understand.  that
                      terminator is out there.  it
                      can't be reasoned with, it can't
                      be bargained with...it doesn't
                      feel pity of remorse or fear...
                      and it absolutely will not stop.
                      ever.  until you are dead.

        sarah slump in utter resignation.

                                sarah
                           (quietly)
                      can you stop it?

        reese doesn't look at her.

                                reese
                      maybe.  with these weapons...
                      i don't know.

                                               cut to:
