        close on the side rail of an ambulance gurney snapping up
        into position.  sarah's eyes are closed and she is moved
        out of frame.

        wide shot, showing the gurney being rolled by two attendants
        past the site of the last explosion.
        several police officers are picking through the debris.

        panning with the gurney as it is wheeled out, holding on
        two factory employees, f.g.
        one, the plant manager, bends to examine a piece of the
        cyborg lying at the base of the hydraulic press.
        a cop, b.g., notices this.

                                cop
                      look, i told you not to
                      touch anything until we're
                      done.  you got that?

                                manager
                      sure thing, officer.

        he stands and palms a small object to his assistant.  they
        step around the corner.

                                assistant
                      what is it?

                                manager
                      microcomputer chassis.  but
                      i've never seen stuff like
                      this anywhere.

                                assistant
                      weird.  jap stuff, maybe?

                                manager
                      keep it out of sight and
                      get it down to r and d
                      monday, first thing.

                                assistant
                      good idea.
