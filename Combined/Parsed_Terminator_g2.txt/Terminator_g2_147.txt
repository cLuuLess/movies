                      ...it had no choice.
                      the defensive grid was
                      smashed. we'd taken the
                      mainframes...
                      we'd won.  taking out
                      connor then would make no
                      difference.  skynet had to
                      wipe out his entire exist-
                      ence.  we captured the lab
                      complex.  found the...what-
                      ever it was called...the
                      time-displacement equipment.
                      the terminator had already
                      gone through.  they sent two
                      of us to intercept, then
                      zeroed the whole place.
                      sumner didn't make it.

                      then how are you supposed to
                      get back?

                                reese
                      can't.  nobody goes home.
                      nobody else comes through.
                      it's just him and me.
