        sarah is on the phone, her hair still wet from a shower.
        she sits on the bed with a towel wrapped around her.

                                sarah
                      ...no, mom, i can't tell you
                      where i am.  i was told not
                      to say.

                                sarah's mom (v.o.)

                      but honey, i need to know where
                      i can reach you or i'll be
                      worried sick.  it turns out i
                      can't stay up here...the
                      electricity's off...and i don't
                      know just where i'll be.

        sarah hesitates, then:

                                sarah
                      okay, here's the number.  are

                      go ahead.
