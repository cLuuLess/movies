62      int. division headquarters - night                     62

        dollying with vukovich and traxler, as they pass through a
        group of reporters.  mostly newspaper stringers but there
        is also one bored local tv minicam crew.

                                reporter
                      ...lieutenant, are you aware
                      that these two killings occurred
                      in the same order as their listings
                      in the phone book?

                                vukovich
                      no comment.

        he and traxler enter their office and shut the door.

63      vukovich's office                                      63

        vukovich drops his gun in the wastebasket, picks up a cup
        of coffee from his desk and uses it to wash down a handful
        of aspirins.  traxler grimaces.

                                traxler
                      that stuff's two hours cold.

                                vukovich
                           (nodding ab-
                           sently)
                      i know.

                                traxler
                           (eyeing him)
                      i put a cigarette out in it.

        vukovich, lost in thought, turns on him suddenly.

                                vukovich
                      did you reach the next girl
                      yet?

                                traxler
                      no.  keep getting an answer-
                      ing machine.

                                vukovich
                      send a unit.

                                traxler
                      i already did.  no answer at
                      the door and the apartment
                      manager's out.  i'm keeping
                      them there.

                                vukovich
                      call her.

                                traxler
                      i just called.

                                vukovich
                      call her again.

        traxler picks up the phone and begins to dial her number
        as vukovich sets down his coffee cup, unwraps a stick of
        gum and pops it in his mouth.

                                vukovich
                           (continuing)
