        tight on a tv screen, a news cast in progress.

                                anchorman (v.o.)
                      ...police had no further comment
                      on the apparent similarity between
                      the shooting death of an encino
                      woman earlier today...

        cut wide to show sarah watching the tv which is suspended
        over the bar.  the place is a crowded, post-movie hangout,
        raucous with laughter and videogames.  the newscast
        continues, ignored by all except sarah.

                           (continuing)
                      ...and this almost identical
                      killing two hours ago of a
                      venice resident with virtually
                      the same name.  sarah ann connor,
                      a 24 year old legal secretary, was
                      pronounced dead at the scene in
                      her beachfront apartment...

        a customer gestures for the bartender's attention.

                                customer
                      hey, can we change this and
                      catch the ball scores.

                                bartender
                           (reaching for the
                           knob)
                      sure.

        sarah leaps half over the bar, startling everyone.

                                sarah
                           (shouting)
                      leave it where it is!

                                anchorman (v.o.)
                      ...no other connections between
                      the two victims has been estab-
                      lished.
                           (pause)
                      on a lighter note, these was
                      cause for celebration at the
                      l.a. zoo today, as...

        sarah leaves her half-finished pizza and beer, getting up
        in a daze.  followed by puzzles glances, she makes her way
        through the crowd.
