259     int./ext. landrover - late afternoon                   259

        macro on cassette recorder, the center capstans of a
        tape turning.

                                sarah (v.o.)
                      ...and the hardest thing is
                      deciding what i should tell
                      you and what not to.  well,
                      anyway, i've got a while yet
                      before you're old enough to
                      understand the tapes.  they're
                      more for me at this point...
                      to help get it all straight.

        cover shot reveals sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrover
        parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station.  all of
        its signs are in hand-lettered spanish.  beyond lies an
        expanse of scrub desert.  the sky scowls with an impending
        storm.

        sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark-
        complected attendant laconically fills her tank.  she
        cradles the cassette recorder in her lap, in the lee of
        her swollen belly.
        she looks to be about six months along.
        under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster
        and the butt of a .357 revolver presses against her
        breast.  she tugs the vest closed as the attendant glances
        her way.  a german shepherd sits in the back among taped
        boxes and suitcases.

                                sarah
                           (continuing)
                      should i tell you about your
                      father?  that's a tough one.
                      will it change your decision
                      to send him here...knowing?
                      but if you don't send kyle,
                      you could never be.  god,
                      you can go crazy thinking
                      about all this...i suppose
                      i'll tell you...i owe him that.
                      and maybe it'll be enough if
                      you know that in the few hours
                      we had together we loved a
                      lifetime's worth...

        click.  whir.  sarah jumps at a sound nearby, breaking
        her reverie.  a small mexican boy has snapped her picture
        with a beat-up polaroid camera.  he holds it out to her,
        speaking rapid spanish.

                                attendant
                      he says you are very beautiful,
                      senora, and he is ashamed to ask
                      five american dollars for this
                      picture, but if he does not,
                      his father will beat him.

                                sarah
                      that's a pretty good hustle,
                      kid.  four.  quatro.

        the boy takes her four dollars and she watches the
        snapshot develop.  it is a good photograph of her,
        the wind lightly ruffling her hair, expression thought-
        ful, slightly sad.

        we recognize it as the one reese carried in 2029.
        she slips it into her short pocket.

                                attendant
                      mil trescientos...fifteen dollars
                      american.

        as she pays him, distant thunder rolls.
        the boy yells something in spanish as he runs off.

                                sarah
                      what did he say?

                                attendant
                           (accented)
                      there is a storm coming in.

        sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the
        desert.  heat lightning pulses in their depths.

                                sarah
                           (quietly)
                      i know.

        camera cranes up as she pulls away, driving across the
        flat desert on a ribbon of highway.  a brilliant flash
        crescendos from horizon to horizon out at the rim of the
        world.
