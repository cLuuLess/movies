29      int. pawn shop - day                                   29

        tight on glass countertop as an ar-180 assault rifle with
        scope is laid beside a number of other guns: a colt k-
        model .45 acp, a smith and wesson .38 four-inch, a beretta
        .225 acp.

                                terminator (v.o.)
                      ...the remington 1100 autoloader...

        wide as the clerk, who looks like a sick lizard, pallid
        and paunchy, takes the rifle from a wall rack.  he lays it
        beside the arsenal of perfectly legal anti-human artillery
        already on the glass counter.
        terminator scans expressionlessly for additional selec-
        tions.

                                clerk
                      anything else?

                                terminator
                      a phased plasma pulse-laser in
                      the forty watt range...

                                clerk
                           (annoyed)
                      just what you see, pal.

        he indicates the display case and wall racks with a
        minimal gesture.

                                terminator
                      the uzi 9 millimeter.

                                clerk
                           (setting  it out)
                      you know your weapons, buddy.

        terminator examines each in turn, working the actions with
        curt, precise movements.

                                clerk
                           (continuing)
                      any one of them's ideal for
                      home defense. which'll it be?

                                terminator
                      all.

        the clerk digs deep and finds a scrap of a smile.

                                clerk
                      maybe i'll close early.
                      cash or charge?

        instead of replying, terminator takes a box of shotgun shells
        from a stack on the display case.

                                clerk
                      sorry, i can't sell the ammo
                      with the guns.  you'll have
                      to---hey!

        terminator has calmly begun feeding the shells into the
        shotgun.

                                clerk
                           (continuing)
                      you can't to that...

                                terminator
                           (evenly)
                      wrong.

        he raises the barrel and pulls the trigger.  the gun thunders.

                                               cut to:
