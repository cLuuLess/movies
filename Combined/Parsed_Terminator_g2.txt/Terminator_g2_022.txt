        sarah glances up as breen's voice rasps from a ceiling speaker.

                                breen (v.o.)
                      sarah?

        she answers the empty hallway.

                                sarah
                      yes, chuck?

                                breen
                      come to the office, please.

        she turns back toward the office door at the end of the
        corridor.

        sarah opens the door to breen's closet control center.

                                sarah
                      mission control to chuck,
                      come in...

                                breen
                           (without looking
                           up)
                      you're late.

        sarah is undaunted.

                                sarah
                      aren't i worth waiting for?

                                breen
                      not really.  do you think you
                      can get here on time if i put
                      you on the floor as a waitress?

                                sarah
                           (grinning)
                      i don't know.  i kinda had
                      my heart set on being a
                      cashier the rest of my life.

                                breen
                      the pay's the same but you'll
                      make more in tips.

                                sarah
                      thanks, chuck.  i need the

                      money.  can i still work the
                      hours around my classes?

        breen turns to punch up a display on the restaurant's
        small accounting computer.  sarah looks over his shoulder
        as he modifies the week's schedule.

                                breen
                      mmm.  same schedule's okay.

                                sarah
                      alright!

                                breen
                           (gravely)
                      can you handle it?

                                sarah
                      it's not brain surgery,
                      chuck.

        breen hands her an apron ceremoniously.

                                breen
                      here you go.  you're a
                      bob's girl now.  nancy
                      will check you out.

                                sarah
                      i won't let the fat kid down.
