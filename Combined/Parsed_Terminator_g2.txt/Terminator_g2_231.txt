252     int. corridors - night                                 252

        sarah and kyle run down a corridor.
        through a door, which they close and lock.
        they move off down a cross-corridor.
        the terminator blasts the door off its hinges, f.g., and
        staggers through.  it starts after their receding figures
        as they round the corner at the end of the hall.
