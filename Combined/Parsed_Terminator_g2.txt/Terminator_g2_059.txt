                      be the goddamned 'phone book
                      killer'.

                                traxler
                      i hate the press cases.
                      especially the weird press
                      cases.  where you going?


                                vukovich
                           (heading for
                           the door)
                      to make a statement. i'm gonna
                      give them the name.  maybe the
                      jackals can help us out for
                      once.

                      if they can get this on the
                      tube by eleven, she may just
                      call us.
                           (pause)
