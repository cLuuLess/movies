        tracking with reese as he rounds a corner on the run, still
        shrugging into his long coat.
        running smack at him is another cop, gun aimed.

        without slowing, reese leaps toward him, twisting in mid-air
        like a cat.  the cop fires. misses.  goes down under reese's
        tackle and they slide together on the polished floor.

        reese's head.  he vaults the escalator rail, leaving the
        amazed cop lying on the floor.

        reese bounds up the frozen steps, pocketing the .38 police
        special in his coat.

        cops dash through the maze of aisles, converging at the
        escalators.
