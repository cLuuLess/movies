53      int. sarah's apartment/bathroom/living room - night    53

        sarah and ginger are crammed into the tiny bathroom,
        becoming inextricably tangled in each other's cords as
        they blow-dry, curl hair, and apply make-up.  ginger
        has her headphones inverted under her chin but in place,
        and is bouncing to music as she dries her hair.  she is
        wearing a short terry-cloth bathrobe that reveals the
        greater part of her legs.  sarah is in a skirt and bra.

        the phone rings and sarah goes out into the living room
        to get it.

                                sarah
                           (answering the
                           phone)
                      hello?

                                voice (v.o.)
                           (on phone, deep
                           and breathy)
                      first i'm going to rip the
                      buttons off your blouse, one
                      by one...then run my tongue
                      along your neck, down to your
                      bare, gleaming breasts...

        sarah cups her hand over the mouthpiece and calls out
        matter-of-factly:

                                sarah
                      ginger!  it's matt.

        she resumes listening.

                                matt (v.o.)
                      ...and then slowly pull your
                      jeans off inch by inch and
                      lick your belly in circles,
                      further and further down...
                      then i'll pull off your panties
                      with my teeth...

        sarah is repressing laughter.

                                sarah
                           (crossly)
                      who is this?

        silence.  then matt realizes to his horror who he's been
        talking to.

                                matt (v.o.)
                      oh my god!  sarah!  oh, shit.
                      jesus, i'm sorry.  i thought
                      you were...can i talk to ginger?

                                sarah
                      sure, bunky.

        as ginger approaches, sarah hands her the receiver and
        goes into the bedroom.

                                ginger
                      hello?

                                matt (v.o.)
                      first i'm gonna rip the buttons
                      off your blouse...

54      bedroom

        sarah picks up four blouses on hanger lying on the bed
        and goes back into the hallway.
