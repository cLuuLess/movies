        ginger is still listening to matt, nodding, as sarah enters
        and starts holding the blouses against herself one by one
        for ginger's inspection.

                                sarah
                      what do you think?

                                ginger
                           (covering mouth-
                           piece)
                      great.

        sarah hold up another one.

                                sarah
                      how about this?

                                ginger
                      great.

                                sarah
                      you're a big help.

                                ginger
                           (advisory tone)
                      alright, the beige one.

                                sarah
                      i hate the beige one.

                                ginger
                           (same advisory
                           tone)
                      don't wear the beige one.

        sarah gathers up the blouses and walks out.

                                sarah (v.o.)
                      this guy's probably a schmuck
                      and i don't care what i wear.

        a couple of beats, and she's back in the doorway with
        a concerned expression.

                                sarah
                           (continuing)
                      you think the beige?
