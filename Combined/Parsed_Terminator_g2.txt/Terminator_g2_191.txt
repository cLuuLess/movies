208     int. motel room - night                                208

        tight on several grocery bags

        covering the counter beside the hot-plate in the tiny
        apartment.

        reese's hands split one open and its contents spill out.

        full shot

        sarah looks through reese's haul.

                                sarah
                      let's see.  corn syrup.
                      ammonia.  moth balls...
                      mmm.  what's for dinner?

                                reese
                           (preoccupied)
                      plastique.

        there are also boxes of shotgun shells, road flares, tape,
        scissors, pans, a strainer and many other odd utensils,
        substances, chemicals.

                                sarah
                      what's that?

                                reese
                      nitroglycerin, basically.
                      bit more stable.  i learned
                      howto make it when i was a
                      kid.

        sarah looks a bit stricken as she contemplates the evening
        ahead.

                                               cut to:
