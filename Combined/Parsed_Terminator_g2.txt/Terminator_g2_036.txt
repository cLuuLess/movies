        music booms and masses of leotarded cellulite sway in close
        f.g. as camera dollies along a row of panting, stretching
        women.  in deep b.g. sarah slips in through the door and
        waits against the wall while the human dynamo, ginger ventura,
        leads the class energetically.  ginger, sarah's roommate,
        is a party-stopper.  red-haired, athletic, sensuous.  she's
        pretty enough when still, but stunning in motion.  and she's
        in motion.

        ginger yells commands and cheerfully dives into contortions
        to the beat of a motown favorite.
        marco, a handsome, well-defined guy wearing a tight staff
        t-shirt, strolls up for a drink at the water fountain next
        to sarah.

                                marco
                      hi. i've seen you around.
                      you're cute.  cute i remember.

                                sarah
                      i'm sarah.  ginger's roommate.

                                marco
                      yeah, right.  i'm marco.

        the dance tape ends.

                                ginger
                      ...and three aaand four!  and
                      that's it ladies!  now, didn't
                      that feel good?

        the group collapses ensemble.  a chorus of groans.

                                ginger
                      let's think positive or next
                      time i'll play the fm version.

        ginger walks over to sarah as the class disperses.  marco
        is leaning on the wall next to sarah, who is enjoying the
        attention.

                                sarah
                      ...yeah, really?  say some-
                      thing in italian.

        before marco can reply, ginger pulls the front of his gym
        shorts out and peers down.  she shakes her head.

                                ginger
                      you're wasting your time, kiddo.
                      let's go.

        she grabs sarah by the arm and pulls her out the door.
        sarah catches a glimpse of marco's expression over her
        shoulder as the door closes.

                                               cut to:
