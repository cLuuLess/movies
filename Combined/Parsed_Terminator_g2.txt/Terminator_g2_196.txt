213     ext. motel office - night                              213

        the german shepherd, barking furiously, lunges toward
        camera repeatedly, at the end of a chain.

        a dark figure moves by in the f.g., out of the dog's reach.

        the digitized view is image-intensified, bright and stark
        as a lunar landscape.  pan off the lunging dog to the row
        of rooms facing the parking lot.

        handheld as we approach the doors.
        it is wide angle and the barrel of the ar-180 is visible at
        the bottom of frame.
        the nearest vehicle parked in front is a large pickup truck
        with two dirt bikes lashed in the bed, seen prominently as
        we pass.

        the pov approaches a door.  number 14.

        the door is kicked open.
        moving inside.
        the assault rifle sprays the room, exploding the indistinct
        forms on the bed.  staccato glare.  approaching the bed.
        nothing there put the shredded remain of sheets and pillows.

        the pov shifts to the back door, which is ajar, and moves
        toward it.  through the door.  revealing an empty yard.
