        with a shocking growl the police dog hurtles out of the
        shadows, leaping right at camera.

        angle - reese and dog, a dark blur with teeth, extremely
        doberman, flies toward reese.  he spins.  catches it by
        the throat in mid-air. arcs it to the floor with unflinching
        precision.

        c.u. - doberman, suddenly on its back and held by the throat,
        the dog yelps and stares at reese, who leans very close.
        inches from its eyes he fixes it with a gaze of uncompromis-
        ing dominance.  some ancient communication seems to pass
        between the two.

        reese releases the animal and turns his back on it, selecting
        a long overcoat from a rack.  the dog backs away from him,
        stiff-legged and confused.
