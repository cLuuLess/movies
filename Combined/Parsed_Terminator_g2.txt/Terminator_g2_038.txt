        several angles, on glistening arms, legs, torsos merging
        into bio-mechanical kinetic sculptures with the chrome-steel
        levers and tubes.  the crash and squeal of metal against
        metal.

        in f.g., two conan-esque arms thrust upward, glistening.
        ginger's boyfriend, matt mccallister, the assistant manager
        of the club, strains out his last reps, bench-pressing
        enormous weight on the nautilus machine.
        despite his imposing appearance, matt is one of the warmest
        people you'd ever want to meet.
        his face is contorted, muscles knotted for the last push.
        he heaves it up with a guttural cry.
        lowering his weights with a clang, matt lies panting, arms
        dangling at his side, eyes closed.
        a pair of female legs appear.

                                ginger (v.o.)
                           what's this? sleep therapy?

        matt opens his eyes.

                                ginger
                           (continuing)
                      you think somebody's gonna
                      do this for you?  look at
                      those shriveled bi's.  and
                      you haven't worked lat's or
                      ab's since wednesday.

                                matt
                           (smiling)
                      hello, sweetheart.  had a
                      rough day?

                                ginger
                           (softening)
                      come here, wimp.

        she leans down as he sits up and they meet in a kiss that's
        bad for the other guys' discipline.

        sarah waits until they break the clinch to speak.

                                sarah
                      hi, matt.

        matt look backwards over the bench, and replies, upside-down.

                                matt
                           (grinning broadly)
                      heeey!  it's my favorite
                      sarah.  hi, babe.

        ginger pulls the pin on mat's weights and re-inserts it
        beneath the entire stack, the maximum weight.

                                ginger
                      alright, warm-ups are over.
                      back to work, bunky.

        ginger readadjusts her headphones as the two girls walk away.

                                matt
                      'bye beautiful.  you too,
                      ginger.

        two weightlifters nearby look at each other, than at matt.

                                weightlifter
                      bunky?

                                               cut to:
