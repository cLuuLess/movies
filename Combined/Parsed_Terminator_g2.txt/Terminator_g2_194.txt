211     int. motel room - night                                211

        angle on table - the bombs are neatly ranked, finished.
        a nylon satchel lies nearby.  the mess is cleaned up.

        wide shot reveals reese sitting in silent vigil at the
        window.  the room is dark, lit only by a streetlight
        outside.
        sarah is asleep on the bed.

        reese sits cross-legged, shirtless, his body held rigid.
        the image of discipline.  the .357 is held loosely in one
        hand on his lap.  there is a fresh bandage on his shoulder.

        sarah wakes up and goes to him in the darkness.  he looks
        at her for a moment as she sits beside him, then back outside.

                                sarah
                      he'll find us, won't he?

                                reese
                      probably.  sarah, if i get
                      zeroed...

                                sarah
                      don't say that.

                                reese
                      if i do, you have to get away,
                      disappear without a trace.
                      different country, different
                      name, everything.  in case they
                      send another one.

                                sarah
                      it'll never be over, will it?
                      look at me, i'm shaking.
                      some legend, huh?  you must
                      be pretty disappointed.

                                reese
                      no.  i'm not.

        several beats before sarah speaks again.  her eyes seem
        luminous in the dark.

                                sarah
                           (softly)
                      kyle, the women in your
                      time...what were they like?

                                reese
                      good fighters.

                                sarah
                      that's not what i meant.
                      was there someone special?

                                reese
                      someone?

                                sarah
                      a girl.  you know.

                                reese
                           (mechanically)
                      no.
                           (pause)
                      never.

        he looks away, outside the window

                                sarah
                           (softly)
                      i'm sorry.

        sarah studies him for a moment.
        she's sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands
        on his shoulders and back, tracing the lines of his scars
        with her fingertips.

                                sarah
                      so much pain.

                                reese
                      pain can be controlled.
                      you disconnect it.

                                sarah
                      and so you feel nothing.

                                reese
                      it's better that way.

                                sarah
                           (with great
                           sympathy)
                      oh, kyle.

        reese takes a long, slow breath before he answers, and when
        he does his voice has a new quality, an unfamiliar tenderness.

                                reese
                      john connor gave me a picture
                      of you once.  i never knew
                      why.  it was very old. torn.
                      faded.  you were young, like
                      you are now.  you weren't
                      smiling...just a little sad...
                      i always wondered what you
                      were thinking at that second.

        he closes his eyes, reaches toward her.  his fingertips
        trace the contour of her nose, chin, cheeks.

                                reese
                           (continuing)
                      i memorized every line, every
                      curve...

        he opens his eyes, looking right at hers.

                                reese
                           (continuing)
                      sarah, i came across time
                      for you.  i love you.
                      i always have.

        sarah is quietly overwhelmed.
        reese looks away.

                                reese
                           (continuing)
                      i'm sorry.  i shouldn't
                      have said...

                                sarah
                      kyle...


        she leans forward and kisses him.
        his face is frozen.  a mask.
        she continues, tenderly.
        he begins to respond.
        the dam breaks and he holds her in a tight, trembling
        embrace, clinging to her like life itself.

        kyle picks her up and carries her to the bed.
        she kisses his neck and chest, tracing his scars with
        her lips.

        he unbuttons her blouse very slowly.
        sarah guides his powerful hands over her.

        a sequence of cuts.  details.  impressions.

        sarah, a very close angle, as she grimaces in divine agony.
        reese, his face rapt.
        his hand, clutching the pillow as if to kill it.
        it is explosive, torrential.  a confluence of fate and will.

                                               cut to:
