        vukovich and traxler are seated in the dark room, watching
        reese, b.g., through the two-way mirror.  just behind the
        glass is a video camera on a tripod, aimed at reese, and
        a cart holding a small monitor and videocassette recorder.

                                reese
                           (through speaker)
                     that's right.

                           (quietly, to
                           vukovich)
                     this is fucking great.
