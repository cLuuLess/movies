        sarah is bustling about, trying to service the start of
        the dinner rush.  in waitress parlance, she's 'in it'.
        she runs the gauntlet between tables, precariously balancing
        two full dinner plates on one arm and hand-carrying a
        third.  a customer tugs on her apron for attention and she
        barely averts contributing the chili size to his wardrobe.

                                customer
                      honey, can i get that coffee
                      now?

                                sarah
                      yes sir, just a second.

        she reaches her table after near collisions with a mexican
        busboy and two teenage girls doing cheerleading routines
        in lock-step.

                                sarah
                      who gets the burly burger?

                                customer two
                      i ordered barbecue beef.

                                customer three
                      does mine come with fires?

                                customer four
                      he's got the barbecue beef,
                      i've got a chili-beef deluxe.

                                sarah
                      okay, who gets the burly beef?

                                customer at next table
                      miss, we're ready to order.


        in the process of setting down all the plates sarah knocks
        over someone's water glass.

                                sarah
                           (mopping fran-
                           tically)
                      oh, sorry.  that's not real
                      leather, is it?

        as she cleans up the spill, a kid at the next booth reaches
        over and dumps a scoop of ice cream into the top pouch of
        sarah's apron

        she stares down at the mess melting over her hard-earned
        and sags with defeat.  nancy, a plump, gum-chewing waitress,
        stops beside her to whisper.

                                nancy
                      look at it this way: in a
                      hundred years, who's gonna
                      care?

                                               cut to:
