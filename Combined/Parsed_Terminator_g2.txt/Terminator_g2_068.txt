        medium on matt, as rustling curtains play patterns of street-
        light over his sleeping face.
        the sound of a faint breeze.
        in the b.g. is the balcony, empty.  the sliding door is open.

        tight on matt, as his eyes open at the sound of a quiet,
        repeated clicking.

        up angle - past matt, as the five-inch blade of an industrial
        razor-knife reaches full extension in terminator's hand,
        right above him.
        it slashes viciously downward.
        matt rolls and the pillow is slit open where his throat had
        been.

                                matt
                      whoah!

        terminator catches him by the hair and slashed down again.
        matt grabs the wrist in both hands.
        the enormous muscles of his arms, which seem capable of bench
        pressing a chrysler, strain and knot against the pressure of
        the killer's single arm...
        and still the blade moves closer to his throat.

        with a final heave matt deflects the down-pressure sideways
        and the blade snaps with a clink against the headboard.

        handheld with matt as he rolls off the bed, spins and slams
        his fists together into terminator's temple.  he picks up a
        brass deco lamp and brings it down with piledriver force.

        unperturbed, terminator knocks the lamp away and hurls matt
        over the bed.

                                               cut to:
