44      ext. street/construction sight - dusk

        on a side street the girls pass an excavation site  between
        high-rises.  they pass out of frame as camera holds on the
        construction area and ginger's shrieks fade.

        in the f.g., under an overpass, reese sits is a car watching
        the powerful machines moving earth.
        he's in a late-model non-descript grey sedan, one of a row
        of cars gathering dirt beside the construction site.
        crab-armed back-hoes and massive caterpillars roar through
        a curtain of dust, under intense floodlights.  a power-shovel
        moves its great arm, lighting its own way with an arc-light.

                                               cut to:
