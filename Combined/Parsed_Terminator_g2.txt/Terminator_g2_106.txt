115     ext. side street/alley - night                         115

        the walls of a narrow alley, inky black, frame a police
        cruiser parked on the street beyond.  firelight from the
        back of stoker's lights the street garishly.
        a young cop  stands beside the car talking via radio with
        the mike cord pulled through the side window.  he speaks
        with a distinctive twang--a displaced southerner.

                                cop
                      ...i don't know, it looks
                      like it might spread to this
                      furniture warehouse across
                      the alley, the paint on the
                      wall's starting to blister
                      up...

        the sweeping headlights of a turning car momentarily illuminate
        the face of terminator, motionless in the dark right in
        front of us.
        eyes open.  listening.

                                cop
                           (continuing)
                      better get another truck
                      round to this side.

        terminator's silhouette emerges from the blackness and
        strides purposefully toward the cop, camera following.

        the officer whirls and reaches for his gun but terminator
        flings him brutally into the side of the car, steps over
        him and opens the door.
        before getting in he notes the unit number on the roof: 143.
        then he slides behind the wheel, slips the squad car into
        gear, and pulls out.

        camera preceding car, hide wide angle, as it accelerates
        rapidly, until the lines across the street are flashing
        under it in a staccato rhythm.

                                               cut to:
