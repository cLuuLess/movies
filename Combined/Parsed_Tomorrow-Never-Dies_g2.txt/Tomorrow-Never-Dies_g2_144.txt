      ext. the press room observation balcony - twilight -

      bond and sidney jerk to a halt. they're swinging about five feet
      from the balcony. there's a pause...

                              sidney
                 is this - like - a normal day for you?

                              bond
                 it's a lousy job, but -
                       (reaching for the balcony)
                 the only reason i stay is for the
                 health benefits.

      bond pulls them over to the balcony.
