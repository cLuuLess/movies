      int. elegant hallway - another part of the building -

      harmsway is striding towards the security center, radio in hand:

                              harmsway
                 stamper! they're not to leave this
                 building alive!

      bond and sidney - (int. hallway) -

      moving cautiously toward a corner of another hallway.

                              sidney
                 this has got to be a mistake.

                              bond
                 the only mistake is that they didn't
                 kill us in the elevator.

      at the corner, bond stops, seeing a guard, farther down the hall (his
      back to them) checking doors.

                              bond
                 wait here.

                              sidney
                 no. i'm going with you.

      bond frowns, but doesn't have the time to argue. they start doing a
      "duck and cover" in and out of doorways to sneak up on him.
