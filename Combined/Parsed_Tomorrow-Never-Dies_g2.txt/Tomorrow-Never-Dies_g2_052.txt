      int. bridge - night

      the room is bathed in blue light as the crew monitors the indomita-
      ble's command and control systems.

      at the vertical glass map, the ship's course has been charted from
      hong kong, south, down around singapore, then north, where the yellow
      blinking dot indicates it's currently in the strait of malacca.

      standing in front of the map, however, the navigation officer seems
      perplexed. he's comparing what's on the screen to a piece of paper
      in his hand. something is wrong.

                              navigation officer
                 ... this doesn't make sense. what's
                 our heading now?

      the helmsman looks down at his compass/auto-pilot.

      insert compass/auto-pilot - moving from west to north - then holding
      on a north position.

                              helmsman
                 zero one three. due north.

      the two officers share a look. something is odd, but -

                              helmsman
                 we're on course again.

      just then, the first officer enters from the exterior bridge.

                              first officer
                 can't see a damn thing in this fog.
                       (calling out)
                 rating: what have we got?

      he joins the rating and communication's officers at their scopes.

                              rating
                 a passenger ferry and two freighters
                 broadcasting on low-band -

                              communications
                 and two small fishing boats about 30k
                 north. no radar, but we've
                 identified their engine signatures.

      as the first officer takes this in:

                              helmsman (o.s.)
                 damn. it's doing it again.

                              first officer
                       (joining him)
                 what's wrong?

                              helmsman
                 about every ninety seconds, the auto-
                 pilot jogs us to the west.

      he points down to the compass/auto-pilot, swinging west...

                              helmsman
                 then re-sets us to the north.

      the compass reaches dead west - then starts to swing back north.

                              helmsman (cont'd)
                 the captain wants us on the east side
                 of the channel. ...cross current?

                              first officer
                 not in the strait.
                       (to the navigator)
                 how's our position?

                              navigating officer
                 according to the satellite, we're
                 exactly on course.

                              first officer
                 did you check the auto-pilot?

                              helmsman
                 the back-up does the same thing.

                              first officer
                 check it again. what about the global
                 positioning satellite? could there be
                 something wrong with the signal?

                              gps officer
                 two words: im-possible.
