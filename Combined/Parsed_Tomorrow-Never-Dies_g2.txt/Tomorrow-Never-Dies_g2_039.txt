      ext. grand canal - bond's pov

      paris harmsway is dead, floating in the water.

      return on bond -

      crushed. devastated. and to make matters worse:

                              digiacomo's voice
                 signore bond?

      bond turns. a flashbulb goes off, capturing bond and digiacomo.

                              digiacomo
                 you're under arrest.

                                                                   cut to:

      the south china sea - dusk

      the hms indomitable - a 3,300 ton british frigate, surges through the
      water, heading toward the setting sun.

      closer -

      battle-dressed royal marines patrol the deck; gunnery crews man the
      weapons. whatever is going on here, it's not business as usual.'
