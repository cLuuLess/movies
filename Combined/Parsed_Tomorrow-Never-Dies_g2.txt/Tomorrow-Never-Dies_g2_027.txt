      ext. venice harbor/grand canal - night

      a gleaming white yacht - with two on-board helicopters, and a huge
      tarped hold - dominates the harbor. (harmsway's sea dolphin ii.)

      tonight, however, we find a gondola, gliding through the water...

      arriving at a festively-lit dock, crowded with gaily costumed
      partygoers and musicians in medieval garb.

      wearing the mask from m's office, (and a bright blue cape,) bond
      alights the gondola, and plunges into the crowd.
