      int. 70th floor -- day

      sidney comes out onto a floor still under construction. the elevator
      doors close behind her. to the right, she sees stamper and a
      harmsway-blazered guard, with machine pistols.

                              sidney
                 thank god! he's crazy!

                              stamper
                 does he have a gun?

                              sidney
                 no.

      on stamper's reply -

                              stamper
                 good -

      he lunges for her, grabs her, spins her around, overwhelming her.
      she struggles, yelling:

                              sidney
                 this is a mistake!

                              stamper
                       (gun against her skull)
                 shut up!

      using sidney as a human shield, stamper marches her in front of the
      closed elevator doors. the guard follows. they position themselves
      for a massacre. reaching around sidney, stamper pulls out his radio:

                              stamper (into radio)
                 open 14.

      a beat. it opens. the men unleash a hail of bullets, then realize -

      new angle - (int. elevator) -

      the car is empty. stamper perplexed. pushing sidney in front of
      him, he enters the elevator, cautiously... when, suddenly:

      bond swings down out of the escape panel (like an athlete on a high-
      bar) feet first - barely clearing sidney's head as he kicks stamper
      and the guard in their faces. they go flying backwards.

      bond jumps down, grabs sidney -

                              bond
                 need a lift?

      and boosts her into the escape panel, following her up.
