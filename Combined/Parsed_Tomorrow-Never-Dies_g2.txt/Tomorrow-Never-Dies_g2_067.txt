      the worm moves into position to grind through the hatch. a protective
      cover slides over the lens, and the grinder whorls into life.

      closer on the worm - the grinder stalls for an instant as it
      encounters the titanium bars.

      still closer - one of the uranium grinding teeth snaps off as it hits
      the titanium, and starts to grind through.

      new angle

      once past the bars, the grinder cuts easily through the steel door.
      trapped air bursts out from inside the compartment. the divers push
      the worm to one side; two of them enter the hold with lights. the
      worm follows. the two other divers remain behind to feed the worm's
      flexible tubing through the door.
