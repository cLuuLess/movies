      int. elegant hallway ("rogues gallery") - late afternoon

      a short hallway lined with oil portraits of harmsway's ancestors.
      double doors at both ends. (people passing through.) as they walk -

                              harmsway
                 i call this the rogue's gallery.

                              bond

                 my third great uncle - the earl of
                 aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of
                 hong kong from the chinese.
                       (moving to)

                 made the first family fortune,
                 running opium into shanghai...
                       (moving to)
                 his son, thomas, who lost it, smoking
                 the opium...
                 and my grandfather henry, who opened the
                 first telegraph station, and published

                 because it's a dying city. since the
                 chinese take-over, who knows what can
                 happen tomorrow?
                       (moving to the last two portraits)

                 royal bastard who started the first radio
