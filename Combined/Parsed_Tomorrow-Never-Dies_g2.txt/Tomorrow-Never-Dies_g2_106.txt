      int. harmsway's outer office -

      harmsway is perched on a desk. in the background, through his open
      office door, we can see harmsway's executive secretary serving
      someone coffee from a silver tray - but we can't see who it is.

                              harmsway
                 elliot harmsway! i heard you were in
                 k.l. and thought we might get
                 together for a chat...

      return on bond - (int. bond's car - moving) -

                              harmsway (cont'd, o.s.)
                 we seemed to get off on the wrong
                 foot back there in venice.

                              bond
                 how did you get this number?

      intercut as necessary:

                              harmsway
                 oh, please, mr. bond. we live in the
                 information age! information is
                 currency - and with the right currency,
                 you can have any piece of information.
                       (bond reacts, sourly)
                 besides i own the phone company. what
                 do you say? twenty minutes?

                              bond
                 i'm on my way.

      bond hangs up, and drives with renewed determination.
