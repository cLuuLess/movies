      int. m's anteroom (moneypenny's area) - continuous

                              bond
                 what - no lust for adventure?

                              moneypenny
                 no, 007. it's just that i've learned
                 from personal experience - that when
                 we get what we want -
                       (beat)
                 somehow the reality is never as...
                 satisfying as the fantasy.

      bond scowls. moneypenny smiles wryly, points to the inner door:

                              moneypenny
                 don't keep m waiting.
