      int. m's office - day

      m is behind her desk; minister peter johnstone sits across - a high-
      handed teflon-coated politician, with the survival instincts of
      plutonium. they've been arguing.

                              m
                 come in, 007. you know the minister?

                              bond
                 of course.
                       (nods to)
                 minister johnstone.

                              minister johnstone
                 007.

      bond sits in an armchair. m presses a button, and a video/bio of
      eliot harmsway appears on the wall behind her. mid-50's, regal.

                              m
                 tell me, 007, what do you know about
                 elliot harmsway?

                              bond
                       (quipping)
                 only what i read in the newspapers.

                              minister johnstone
                       (disdainfully)
                 his newspapers?

                              bond
                       (glancing sideways)
                 occasionally, yes.
                       (directly to m)
                 british media mogul. born in hong kong;
                 controls newspapers, tv, radio, cable,
                 satellites; books, magazines, movies,
                 computer software. theme parks.

                              m
                       (holding up a copy of:)
                 - along with tomorrow - the first
                 world-wide newspaper. circulation 27
                 million. daily. -

                              bond
                 'able to topple governments with a single
                 story' - as he says in his press.

                              johnstone
                       (hurrumph)
                 exactly.

      bond looks at johnstone quizzically. then a very tight-lipped m. he
      senses he's about to enter a minefield:

                              bond
                 ... what's harmsway done?

                              m
                 it seems, 007, we've received a tip

                              minister johnstone
                 a rumor - from an anonymous source -

                              m
                 - that sir elliot may be involved
                 with stamper and yung, and the
                 missing uranium.

                              minister johnstone
                 hearsay. idle chatter from a source
                 you can't identify - who insists on
                 talking only to 007. nothing but
                 loose talk and innuendo.

                              m
                 that may be the case at present,
                 minister johnstone... but our own
                 sources suspect that mr. harmsway
                 used his considerable russian media
                 - holdings to elect valentin zukofsky
                 president of the ukraine - in trade
                 for the uranium.

      (m has punched a button, and valentin's video bio has appeared.)

                              minister johnstone
                 more scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.

                              bond
                 perhaps. but it does explain how an
                 ex-kgb agent turned illegal-arms
                 dealer is suddenly portrayed as a
                 long-time friend of the people.
                       (beat)
                 if you believe what you read in the papers.

                              minister johnstone
                       (annoyed)
                 need i remind the two of you that
                 elliot harmsway - sir elliot harmsway
                 - is directly descended from the earl
                 of aberdeen? that his scottish
                 ancestors practically invented hong
                 kong - and out of sheer gratitude,
                 queen victoria herself named the port
                 "aberdeen harbor" in their honor?

                              m
                       (long pause, then:)
                 ... no more than i need remind you,
                 minister, that merely being a member
                 of the lucky sperm club - does not
                 preclude one from a life of criminal
                 activity.

      johnstone is reeling. m continues, to bond, with aplomb:

                              m
                 the reason i invited the minister
                 here, 007, was to reassure him that
                 this investigation will be handled
                 with the utmost discretion.

                              bond
                 of course.

                              m
                 which is also why i've withheld this
                 information from nato and our allies.

                              bond
                       (nods, then, recalling)
                 ... didn't we once investigate harmsway?

                              m
                 yes. 1988. he was furious at the
                 british plan to return hong kong, and
                 supposedly started his own negotiations
                 with the chinese government. the inquiry
                 went nowhere - but it did earn mi-6 a
                 rather powerful enemy -

                              minister johnstone
                 not to mention the chaos it caused at
                 whitehall when his newspapers began
                 screaming for the recall of the
                 sitting government.

                              m
                       (a beat, then:)
                 i'm sending you to venice, 007.
                 you're to check out the source,
                 determine whether elliot harmsway is
                 involved with the enriched uranium,
                 and, if so, stop him.

                              bond
                 how will i meet the informant?

      she hands bond a carnival mask:

                              m
                 you're to wear this mask at the venice
                 carnival, and wait to be contacted.

                              bond
                 i understand.

                              minister johnstone
                       (standing, to leave)
                 there is one last thing, 007: elliot
                 harmsway is vital to the economic
                 interests of this nation. he's also
                 a major contributor to the party. i
                 expect him to be given every consideration.

                              bond
                 political considerations?

                              minister johnstone
                 to the best of my recollection, mr.
                 bond, i suggested no such thing.
                       (beat, at the door)
                 in fact, i was never here.

      and he exits. m, frowning, hits a button on her intercom:

                              m
                 would you send in the new man from
                 equipment branch?

                              moneypenny (o.s.)
                 right away.

                              bond
                 .... i hate to ask, but... did you
                 ever think you'd miss communism?

                              m
                 we serve the interests of the british
                 people, 007. no matter who we may be
                 foolish enough to elect.

      bond is silent, chastised. m looks away, then looks back:

                              m
                 but if elliot harmsway is involved
                 with that uranium, i want him
                 prosecuted to the ends of the earth.

                              bond
                 hopefully, it won't get that far.

      m looks up: malcolm saunders, q's successor, limps in, looking like a
      mummy - plaster casts on his left leg, left arm; neck-brace, crutch.

                              m
                 come in, saunders.

                              saunders
                 m. 007.

                              bond
                 okay, saunders. what is it this
                 time? rocket in the leg? machine
                 pistol in the arm?

                              saunders
                 q's retirement party. i'd just put
                 the knife into the cake, and -

                              bond
                 come on. i know better than that -

      bond thwacks the crutch against the leg. saunders grimaces in pain.

                              bond
                 it must do something.

                              saunders
                 well... if you insist.

      saunders flexes his broken arm; armored spikes pop out of the it.

                              bond
                 the die is cast.

      saunders exchanges a beleaguered glance with m. he takes off the cast
      and neck-brace, and places a briefcase on m's desk.

                              saunders
                 now pay attention, 007. we haven't much
                 time to demonstrate your new q toys.

                              bond
                 how is old q?

                              saunders
                 gone fishing.

                              bond
                 fishing?

                              saunders
                 big game fishing.
                       (beat)
                 sonar torpedoes. retirement gift
                 from his friends at the cia.

      saunders has opened the briefcase. bond tries to look inside, but
      saunders repositions it. saunders continues:

                              saunders
                 in the meantime, perhaps this will
                 spark your interest.
                       (takes out a disposable lighter)
                 cigarette lighter. thumb here, press here -

      a small flame appears. bond, unimpressed, reaches for it -

                              bond
                 saunders, i've lit cigarettes -

                              saunders
                 not from forty feet.

      saunders flips the lighter sideways and - whoosh! a burst of flame
      shoots across the room.

                              saunders
                 the disposable lighter also contains
                 a small self-detonation charge
                       (beat)
                 depending on who - or what - you
                 wish to dispose of.

      bond takes the lighter, begins to play with it...

                              saunders
                 stop fidgeting, 007. next -

      he takes out a pair of shoelaces.

                              bond
                 ... shoelaces?

                              saunders
                 plastique explosive shoelaces.
                       (holding them out at length)
                 cut them to regulate the size of the
                 blast; totally harmless until you
                 attach the detonator hidden in the
                 heel of your shoe.

                              bond
                       (examining them curiously)
                 perfect way to tie up a... 'knotty'
                 problem?

                              saunders
                       (frowns)
                 moving along -
                       (he produces:)
                 a typical plastic security card.
                 name here, magnetic information
                 stripe here -
                       (pointing to)
                 and a code breaking microprocessor
                 here. swipe it through any card
                 reader - anywhere - you're in.

                              bond
                 does it work on cash machines?

      saunders is suddenly stricken. flustered. he blurts out:

                              saunders
                 it was an authorized test. i returned the money.

                              bond
                       (amused)
                 i see...

                              saunders
                       (ignoring this)
                 finally, your new watch: blue laser
                 here for signaling or burning
                 through locks; press this button, the
                 sweep hand becomes a geiger counter.

                              bond
                       (needling him)
                 if you can't do the time, don't do
                 the crime?

                              saunders
                       (smirks at bond, pauses, then)
                 oh. i almost forgot. there is one last
                 thing: before q retired, he asked that
                 i give you one other protective device.

      he hands bond a wedding band.

                              bond
                 a wedding band??? what am i supposed
                 to be able to do with this?

                              saunders
                 i believe q's exact words were:
                       (imitating q, emphatically:)
                 "hopefully, nothing."

      bond turns from saunder's devious grin to an amused m. smiles:
