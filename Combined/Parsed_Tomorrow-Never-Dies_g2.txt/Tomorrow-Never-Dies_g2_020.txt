      int. office - (intercut as necessary)

      (jenny has a leg on the bed, pulling on a full victoria's secret
      outfit: nylons, garter/suspenders, bustier, etc.)

                              bond
                 not at all, moneypenny. i was just
                 brushing up on a little chinese.

      (in the background, jenny insists "i am not little.")

                              moneypenny
                 i'm sure she is, james. but i'm
                 afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the
                 rest of your lessons this afternoon.

                              bond
                       (mock chagrin)
                 moneypenny... here i was, finally
                 getting a feel for a new tongue -

                              moneypenny
                 four o'clock. m will meet you in the
                 conference room.

      bond watches with amusement as jenny wu slips a graduation-type gown
      over the lingerie. no dress.

                              bond
                 4:30. it may take me a little longer
                 to wrap things up here.

                              moneypenny
                 four o'clock. don't be late.

                              bond
                       (hanging up:)
                 tsi tien, chien-penny.

      on moneypenny:

                              moneypenny
                 ah, james. you always were a cunning
                 linguist... au revoir, mon cher.

      moneypenny hangs up, looks up, and blanches: m is standing there.

                              moneypenny
                 don't ask.

                              m
                 don't tell.
                       (walking away)
                 i don't want to know.
