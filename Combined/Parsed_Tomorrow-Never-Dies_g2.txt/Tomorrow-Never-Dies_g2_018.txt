      int. book lined office -

      afterglow: empty champagne bottle. rumpled sheets on a sleeper sofa.
      bond is in bed with a smart, ironic, (and, yes, stunning,) 30-ish
      chinese woman, jenny wu. (note: the chinese here is mandarin, spelled
      phonetically.)

                              bond
                       (running a finger across her lips)
                 ... and what do you call these?

                              jenny wu
                 ja-shwa tsway. these are lips.

                              bond
                 indeed they are.
                       (kisses them, lightly)
                 deadly little things.

      she laughs. his hand goes beneath the sheets.

                              bond
                 and what do you call these? the gang
                 of two?

                              jenny wu
                       (smacking his hand, laughing:)
                 stop it!

                              bond
                 i was just getting to the interesting part!

                              jenny wu
                 we've already done the interesting
                 part. do you forget?

                              bond
                 remind me.

      he moves to roll on top of her, but she pushes him off, teasing:

                              jenny wu
                 sakwa!

                              bond
                 is that mandarin, or cantonese?

                              jenny wu
                 mandarin. you jerk.
                       (tousling his hair)
                 i'm late. i have to get dressed.

      she hops off the bed, leaving frame. bond settles back on the
      headboard, ready to enjoy the view... when his cell phone rings.

                              bond
                       (lightly)
                 hello -
                       (catching himself)
                 hello.
