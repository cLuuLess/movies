      int. hallway outside of conference room - continuous

      where bond encounters moneypenny, also walking to m's office.

                              bond
                 moneypenny! we've got to stop meeting
                 like this. they may be on to us.

                              moneypenny

                              bond
                 in the darkest moments, it's what i
                 live for. especially since i've
                 heard how much you like to watch...
                 on the hidden camera.

      moneypenny cuts bond a look - and, in the background, sees dominique
      leave the conference room, and walk down the hall, away from them.

                 that colonel once stranded on a raft
                 for two weeks in the sargasso sea?

                              bond
                 moneypenny! how indiscreet! have
                 you ever known me to kiss and tell?

      they've come to a security door. she punches in a code -

                              moneypenny
                 actually, i've never known you to do
                 either... but -

                              bond
                 - we all want what we can't have?
