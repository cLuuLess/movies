      int. bridge -

                              the captain
                       (on a phone)
                 i don't know sir -

      the helicopter suddenly appears in front of him. shooting from the
      pilot's window, bond shatters the glass windows -

      and the captain slumps forward on the wheel, spinning it as he slides
      to the deck.
