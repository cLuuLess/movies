      ext. space -

      as the earth turns below, a tiny silver dot appears in the distance:
      a communications satellite, spinning slowly on its axis.

      it comes closer and closer to camera, until it fills the screen, and
      the logo on its body rotates into view:

      hnn. the harmsway news network.

      return on bridge - int. h.m.s. indomitable - night

      the helmsman finishes fiddling with the auto-pilot.

                              first officer
                 how is it now?

                              helmsman
                 seems to be back to normal, sir.

      the first officer nods... then hears a shrill warning beep.

                              sonar operator
                 i have something off the port bow!

      the first officer rushes to join him at the screen.

                              sonar operator (cont'd)
                 100 meters out, just below the surface.
                       (adjusts the controls)
                 a meter in diameter; ten - twelve
                 meters long. ...floating vertically?

                              first officer
                 a dead head.
                       (off the others' quizzical looks)
                 water logged timber. floats straight
                 up. you sometimes see them on the east
                 side of the channel - from the logging
                 camps on sumatra - but they don't
                 usually float this far west.
                       (calling out)
                 muncy! engines to half!

                              helmsman
                 aye-aye sir. engines to half.

                              first officer
                       (explaining)
                 chew up a log like that in the
                 propeller, you end up with enough paperwork
                 to go from here to london. twice.
