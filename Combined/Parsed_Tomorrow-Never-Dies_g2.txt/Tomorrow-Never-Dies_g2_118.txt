      int. hnn news center - late afternoon -

      a cavernous three story room bristling with activity. at the center
      is the main hnn anchor desk, (where a news broadcast is in progress,)
      surrounded by scores of reporter's desks a la cnn.

      around the perimeter of the room are various tv studios looking out
      on kuala lumpur. all are broadcasting: a larry king-type chat show;
      mtv; sports; a kitchen where a chef is preparing something flambeed.

      with its walls of monitors, equipment, and control rooms, the effect
      is overwhelming. harmsway will walk bond around the perimeter:

                              harmsway
                 welcome to the new world order, mr. bond.
                       (starting to walk)
                 churchill had his armies; caesar had his
                 legions; i have my divisions:
                       (pointing)
                 news, sports, business, entertainment.
                 and these are my foot soldiers:
                       (a wave of his hand)
                 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed
                 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87
                 magazines, and 29 different cable tv
                 channels - in 35 languages.

                              bond
                 and still not a thing to watch.

      he glances at the satellite control room, with a nasa-type world map.

                              bond
                 ...although it must be fun to have
                 all those satellites.

                              harmsway
                 they're merely tools to disseminate
                 information.

                              bond
                       (wryly)
                 or disinformation... if you wanted to,
                 say, beam down a signal to send a ship
                 off course? maybe one degree a minute?

                              harmsway
                       (guffaws)
                 fantastic idea mr. bond! perhaps i
                 should buy it for a book! it's
                 totally preposterous, but -
                       (off bond's reaction)
                 you amuse me. ...and now perhaps i
                 can amuse you.

      he stops at a video terminal. begins to type.

                              harmsway
                 let's see... first we have this
                 james bond... i believe he's a field
                 adjuster for lloyd's of london...

      insert video screen - bond's mi-6 cover -

                              harmsway
                 then we have this james bond.

      insert video screen - bond's kgb file -

                              harmsway
                       (reading from the screen)
                 ... licensed to kill...
                       (aside)
                 not a bad title for that book...
                       (then)
                 or perhaps you'd prefer this james bond -

      insert video screen - bond's chinese file -

                              harmsway
                 who i believe they call "007."

      bond is not amused. harmsway is enjoying himself:

                              harmsway
                 you see, mr. bond, you and i are both
                 men of action. but your era is passing.
                 words are the new weapons; satellites the
                 new artillery. and make no mistake about
                 it: in the right hands, they can be as
                 deadly as your walther ppk.

                              bond
                 ...words to live by?

                              harmsway
                 your choice.
                       (glancing at his watch)
                 look at the time! come. there's
                 someone i want you meet - about a
                 story i'm thinking of publishing.

      as they leave, bond is frustrated by harmsway's "i don't care what
      you think you know - i can crush you" attitude... and now, harmsway
      plans (and the operative word here is plans,) to use bond, to tie off
      the one other loose thread in his perfect crime:
