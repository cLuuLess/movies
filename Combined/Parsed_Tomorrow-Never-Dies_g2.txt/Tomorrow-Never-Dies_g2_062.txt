      int. restaurant bibendum -

      a young woman is yammering away at bond; he's trying to put a good
      face on what is obviously a dreadful fix-up first date.

                              woman
                 i can't believe it took us so long to
                 finally get together! what exactly
                 do you do for the government?

                              bond
                       (after a beat)
                 you might say... 'public relations.'

                              woman
                 how fascinating! i bet you meet all
                 the most fabulous people.

      before bond can answer, the maitre d' interrupts.

                              maitre d'
                 excuse me - mr. bond? you have a call.

      bond excuses himself.

      new angle - bond at phone -

      007 picks up the receiver, without saying hello:

                              bond
                 moneypenny! you're early. you
                 weren't supposed to call until -
                       (he stiffens)
                 yes. i understand. twenty minutes.
