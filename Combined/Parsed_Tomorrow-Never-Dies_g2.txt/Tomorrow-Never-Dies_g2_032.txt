      int. sea dolphin ii - below decks -

      bond moves cautiously down a staircase...

      and peers along a corridor. he sees a guard, checking doors, making
      sure they're locked. bond withdraws for a moment, looks back: the
      guard is at the far end of the hall. he lifts a walkie-talkie:

                              guard
                 level one, secure.

      the guard exits, down another staircase. bond moves stealthily down
      the corridor, glancing at signs on various doors: fish hatchery,
      weather station, crew's mess, etc... until he comes to:

      metallurgy lab. there's a card reader by the door. bond slips out
      his q-toy, swipes it. click. he goes inside.
