      ext. the top of the water fall -

      exhausted, bond reaches up, over the edge. he drives a pick down -
      through the ice, into the hard, flat, ground beneath the waterbed.

      as he pulls himself up, (his full weight on the first ice-pick,) he
      smashes a second pick through the ice, into the waterbed, and -

      the entire ice fall gives way -

      breaking off with a groan, tumbling onto the rocks below.

      in the waterbed -

      a torrent of water crashes over 007. fighting the oncoming deluge,
      he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland.

      new angle - (top of the water fall, inland)

      bond stands, walks out of the riverbed. he looks back at the cliff:

      bond's pov - the water fall -

      on either side of the water, there are two small radar dishes, angled
      down, scanning every inch of the area, save for the waterfall itself.
      in other words: this was the only way in.

      return on bond -

      007 shrugs. from his backpack, he takes out two cigar-sized black
      canisters, and an elongated black box. he presses a button on the
      side of the box, and - fwap, fwap, fwap - snow skis unfold.

      he presses buttons on the canisters: telescopic ski poles. bond
      slaps on the skis, and takes off, through the snow.
