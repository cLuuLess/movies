      int. sea king helicopter - airborne - day

      bond holds a map of the channel. he's standing over several crewman
      seated at radar, sonar, and navigation consoles.

                              crewman 1
                 sounding: bottom is thirty fathoms.

                              crewman 2
                 nothing. negative bounce.

                              bond
                 we should be right over it.

      they hear a sharp dinging sound -

                              operator 2
                 wait - i'm getting something.

                              bond
                 where? what is it?

      the man points at one of the screens, where bond sees a computer
      generated map of the sea floor, with the faint outline of a warship.

                              operator 2
                 not sure yet -

      he types in some commands on a keyboard, and a 3-d rendering of a
      boat appears on another computer screen. lots of data:

                              operator 2
                 the shinjuku. japanese troop
                 carrier. world war ii.

                              bond
                 let's make another pass.

                              co-pilot
                       (calling out)
                 we have traffic on the deck -

      they look down and see an hnn (harmsway news network) boat.

                              bond
                 get rid of them.

      new angle - ext. sea ring chopper & hnn boat -

      the chopper hovers above the hnn boat -

                              pilot (on pa speaker)
