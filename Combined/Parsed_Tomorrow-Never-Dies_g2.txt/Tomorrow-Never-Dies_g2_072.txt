      ext. sea dolphin ii - night

      harmsway walks along the side of the ship, observing the operation:

      the worm's dredging pump sucks up the ground-up gold and water slur-
      ry, (through the tube hanging over the side,) and dumps it into a
      series of sluices. at each stage the gold nuggets fall to the bottom
      of the sluice, and excess water flows off the side of the ship.

      at the stern hold -

      where all the water has been drained off, leaving a cascade of gold
      nuggets pouring into the ship's hold -

      harmsway reaches into the shimmering cascade, and takes a hand-full
      of gold. he sees stamper approaching.

                              harmsway
                 remember the golden rule, mr.
                 stamper: he who has the gold, rules.

      he drops the gold back in the hold.

                              harmsway
                 is the helicopter ready?

                              stamper
                 fueled and waiting.

                              harmsway
                 good. we have an appointment in hong kong.
