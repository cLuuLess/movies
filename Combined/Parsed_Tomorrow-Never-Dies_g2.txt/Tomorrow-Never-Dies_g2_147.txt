      int. garage - harmsway towers.

      bond and sidney come out near a trolley stacked with newspapers.

      hearts pounding - having left the pressroom's deafening noise -
      they're ready for almost anything, except what they hear:

      the sound of one man applauding. a polite, almost bored clapping.

                              harmsway (o.s.)
                 vert, very, good mr. bond. outstanding
                 performance.

      harmsway is standing with ten guards, shoulder to shoulder, in a
      straight line, all holding weapons on sidney and bond.

                              harmsway (continuing)
                 i'm the certain the british taxpayers
                 would be impressed by your efforts.
                 don't you agree?

                              bond
                 i think they'd rather know who stole
                 their gold.

      harmsway can't help his ego:

                              harmsway
                       (chuckles)
                 why, i did, of course. it's on the
                 sea dolphin ii, twenty miles outside
                 of hong kong... not that it will do
                 either of you any good to know.
                       (beat)
                 now both of you: stand up. and toss
                 the gun out, mr. bond.

      bond slides the gun several feet in front of him... and throws a look
      to his car, noting the guards are lined up directly in its path.
      bond begins to scheme.

                              sidney
                 uncle elliot: how could you do this
                 to me?

      bond sneaks his hand in his pocket.

                              harmsway
                 oh, please, sidney. there's a
                 hundred billion dollars at stake.
                       (beat)
                 besides, i never really liked your
                 father that much. he cheated at cards.

      bond has removed the car remote control. he palms it.

                              bond
                 are your guards really going to kill
                 a helpless girl?

                              harmsway
                 my guards are from south africa, mr.
                 bond. this is their chance to get even
                 with the formerly 'great' britain.
                       (beat)
                 now both of you. put your hands on
                 your heads, and step forward.

      holding the remote control, bond puts his hands on his head. he's
      manipulating the control into the right position to use it.

                              bond
                       (trying to buy time)
                 what did you do, harmsway? make some
                 deal with the chinese government for
                 the gold?.. was the radioactive
                 uranium i found in venice part of it?

      he finally has the remote control in the right position.

                              harmsway
                 questions, questions, mr. bond...
                 which i'm afraid i've neither the
                 time, nor the inclination to answer.
                       (to the guards)
                 take them out to the jungle and -

      suddenly, bond's car engine starts with a roar. the guards turn, in
      shock towards the car, as:

      bond retrieves the gun he slid out, and pulls sidney behind the
      newspaper trolley, while -

      the car begins to move, sending the guards scrambling.

      bond takes his position with sidney.

                              bond
                 i forgot to mention: the job comes
                 with a car.

      007 begins shooting, as -

                              harmsway
                 kill it! shoot the damn thing -

      the guards start blasting the empty moving car. they manage to shoot
      out the headlights, while -

      bond is having trouble coordinating driving and shooting at the same
      time. as bullets rip up the newspapers in front of them -

                              bond
                 here. you shoot. i'll drive.

                              sidney
                 ...you know, that's another reason
                 you're probably not in a successful
                 relationship.

                              bond
                 another reason??? did i miss something???

                              sidney
                       (taking the gun)
                 you insist on calling all the shots.
                       (beat)
                 and by the way: i am not a helpless girl.

      bond eyes her for one split second. points at the guards:

                              bond
                 aim that way.

      sidney starts to shoot as -

      the guards continue to blast away at the car... but:

      the windows don't shatter.

      the armor-plated side-panels only dent with bullet hits...

      the tires don't go flat.

      there's chaos; a cacophony of voices and wild gunfire as bond steers
      the car to their position, where the door opens automatically.

                              bond
                 ready? now!

      the two of them make a break for the car, diving inside.
