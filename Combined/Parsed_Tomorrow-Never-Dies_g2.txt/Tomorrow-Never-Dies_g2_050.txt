      ext. small airport - scotland -

      stamper's limousine parks near a gulfstream jet. he opens the back
      door for number three. at last, the man believes he is safe.

                              number three
                 thank you! thank you so much. you
                 must thank sir elliot for me.

                              stamper
                       (producing a newspaper)
                 here. something to read on the plane.

      stamper tucks the paper firmly under #3's arm - and gives him a
      friendly pat on the back, sending him up the stairs.

      at the doorway, number three looks back. stamper smiles, waving:

                              stamper
                 bye-bye.
