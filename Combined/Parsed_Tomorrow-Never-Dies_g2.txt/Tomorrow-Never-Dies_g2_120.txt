      int. elevator hallway - day -

      as the executive secretary escorts them to the elevator, bond glances
      out the picture window, with its view of the other tower.

                              executive secretary
                 thank you both for coming in...

      bond's pov - ext. harmsway towers -

      five floors directly down is the glass-enclosed sky bridge; just
      above him, he sees two window washers being pulled up on a two man
      scaffold.

      back to scene -

      a chime sounds; the elevator doors open. bond and sidney ad-lib
      good-byes to the secretary and get in.
