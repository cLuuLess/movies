      int. harmsway's inner sanctum - scottish manor house - day

      we're in a room that looks as if it could only exist in, well, a
      james bond movie: slick, stark, sterile. steel, glass, chrome.

      the six men are seated around a giant conference table, looking
      absurdly out of place in their formal mourning attire.

      elliot harmsway enters, (passing what appears to be the liechtenstein
      that hangs in the lobby of caa,) walks to the head of the table,
      takes off his gray mourning gloves, slaps them down, and:

                              harmsway
                 good morning, gentlemen. i'm sorry
                 to bring you here under these
                 circumstances, but
                       (beat)
                 considering our meeting was already
                 scheduled, this was a happy coincidence.

      the men nod. harmsway sits, dims the lights from a control panel.

                              harmsway (cont'd)
                 number one, your report?

      a gap-toothed californian with bland features stands.

                              number one
                 sir elliot: the entertainment division
                 is releasing three new animated
                 children's movies this year.
                       (pause)
                 by the time we're finished promoting
                 them on our tv, radio, cable, newspaper,
                 and magazine outlets -
                       (pause)
                 there won't be a parent in the universe
                 who won't feel guilty if they don't take
                 their children to our stores and theme
                 parks to buy the toys, books, video-
                 games and clothing featuring our
                 'lovable little creatures.'
                       (pause)
                 we anticipate revenues of 3.1 billion
                 dollars.

                              harmsway
                 excellent, number one. build a better
                 rat-trap, and the world truly will beat
                 a path to your theme park.
                       (turns to)
                 number two?

      a young guy with glasses gets up, looking remarkably like bill gates.

                              number two
                 as you're aware, sir elliot, our
                 software division has introduced a new
                 computer operating system, gates '99.
                       (beat)
                 it's deliberately filled with bugs -
                 so people will be forced to buy our
                 upgrades over the next five years.
                       (beat)
                 the window on revenues is 2.8 billion.

                              harmsway
                 outstanding, number two.
                       (beat, remembering:)
                 by the way - number five - ?
                       (a man looks up)
                 who's ahead in the american elections?

                              number five
                 the democrat, sir. by nine points.

                              harmsway
                 maybe it's time to publish that story
                 about his sex life. even things up.
                 a close race is always better for our
                 tv ratings.

                              number five
                 consider him slimed, sir.

                              harmsway
                 splendid. next...
                       (with noticeable reserve)
                 number three. your report?

      a short middle-eastern man stands. nervous.

                              number three
                 i regret to inform you, sir, that
                 saddam hussein is still demanding a
                 bonus for his role in the gulf war.

                              harmsway
                 ...haven't we already paid him for his services?

                              number three
                 yes, sir. but he still feels his
                 people should share in the increased
                 profits of our news division. he has
                 proposed an additional 500 million
                 dollar payment.

      a pause. the other men in the room shift uncomfortably.

                              harmsway
                 ... and there's no truth that 10% of
                 that money will go into your swiss
                 bank account?

                              number three
                 no sir! i swear! this is not true!!

                              harmsway
                 you disappoint me, number three.

      harmsway presses a button. stamper enters. number three assumes
      this means death. he begs for his life:

                              number three
                 please sir. please -

                              harmsway
                 ...but because i am a just man, i've
                 decided to give mr. hussein what he
                 deserves.

      number three is confused. does this mean he's going to live?

                              harmsway
                 mr. stamper will escort you to the plane.

                              number three
                       (overwhelmed with gratitude)
                 thank you sir! thank you!

      harmsway nods, watching him leave:

                              harmsway
                 good-bye, mr. azziz.

      and the man is gone. harmsway turns his attention back to the room:

                              harmsway
                 let's proceed with new business.

      harmsway presses another button. the room darkens. the center of
      the table opens, and a 3-d map of malaysia rises into view.

                              harmsway
                 gentlemen: in exactly 36 hours, we
                 are going to initiate phase one of
                 the word's most perfect crime: the
                 biggest theft in the history of mankind.
                       (beat, pointing with a laser)
                 right here. in the strait of malacca.
