      int. hallway - (elevator bank) - 71st floor.

      squeezing out from between the elevator doors, (which immediately
      close behind them,) bond and sidney encounter a group of stunned
      office workers, waiting for the elevator.

                              bond
                       (to the office workers)
                 ... i'd try the stairs.

      as bond and sidney scamper off -

      return on stamper - in the elevator -

                              stamper
                       (rushing out)
                 the stairs!
                       (barking into his radio)
                 attention all units! they're on the
                 71st floor!
