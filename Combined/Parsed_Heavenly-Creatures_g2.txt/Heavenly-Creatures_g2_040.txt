ext. cottage - dayhilda sits on a deck chair in front of the cottage, brushing pauline's hair. henry is seated at a table, writing a letter.

juliet is lying on a towel, making notes in an exercise book.

juliet
mummy . . . pauline and i have decided the charles and deborah are going to have a baby. an heir to the throne of borovnia.

hilda what a splendid idea!

juliet
we're calling him diello.

hilda that's a good, dramatic name!

juliet
paul thought it up.

pauline beams.

hilda aren't you clever! there, all done.

pauline stands. juliet touches pauline's hair. hilda laughs.

henry is rifling through his briefcase.

henry hilda! i can't find that letter from the high commission. they want our passport numbers.

juliet
(surprised) are you going abroad, daddy?

hilda scowls at henry.

hilda your father's attending a university conference in england, darling.

henry we'll only be away for a few weeks.

juliet looks at hilda, a trace of panic across her face.

juliet
(worried) you're not going, are you, mummy?

hilda hesitates.

hilda well . . . i thought i might. it's a long time for your father and i to be apart.

juliet
but i should go, too!

hilda darling, you've got school. you've only just settled in.

juliet
but- hilda suddenly stands.

hilda who's coming to the shops? i need some cigarettes.

jonathon barrels out of the cottage.

jonathon me! i'm coming.

hilda (o.s.) put on your shoes, jonathon!

camera moves in . . . to juliet's distraught face.
