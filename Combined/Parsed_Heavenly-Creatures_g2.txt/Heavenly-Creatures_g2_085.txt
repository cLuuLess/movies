pauline
(poem v.o.) hatred burning bright in the brown eyes with enemies for fuel,

close-up . . . juliet's face, staring intently ahead.

pauline
(poem v.o.) icy scorn glitters in the gray eyes, contemptuous and cruel, why are men such fools they will not realise,

pull out . . . to show pauline and juliet lying in opposite ends of a hot, steaming bath, staring at each other.

pauline
(poem v.o.) the wisdom that is hidden behind those strange eyes.
