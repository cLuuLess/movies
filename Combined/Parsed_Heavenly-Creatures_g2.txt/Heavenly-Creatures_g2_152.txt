honora 
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. both girls look at honora 
silently.

honora 
turns around and juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.

honora

honora 
picks up the satchel. pauline and juliet tense up . . . as honora 
puts the satchel on a chair.

pauline
let's go upstairs, deborah. i wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.

juliet
(vacantly) all right, then.

juliet follows pauline out of the room. pauline has to nip back and grab the satchel.
