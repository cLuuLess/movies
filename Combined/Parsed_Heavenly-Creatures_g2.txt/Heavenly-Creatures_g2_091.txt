honora 
looks horrified.

dr. bennett i agree, mrs. rieper, it's not a pleasant word. but let us not panic unduly. this condition is often a passing phase with girls of yvonne's age.

honora 
but she's always been such a normal, happy child.

dr. bennett it can strike at any time, and adolescent are particularly vulnerable.

honora 
but what about the vomiting? she's lost a lot of weight . . .

dr. bennett shrugs.

dr. bennett physically, i can find nothing wrong. i've checked for tb and she's clear. i can only attribute her weight loss to her mental disorder.

honora 
(shocked) oh . . .

dr. bennett look, mrs. rieper . . . try not to worry too much. yvonne's young and strong, and she's got a loving family behind her. chances are she'll grow out of it. if not . . . well, medical science is progressing in leaps and bounds. there could be a breakthrough at any time!
