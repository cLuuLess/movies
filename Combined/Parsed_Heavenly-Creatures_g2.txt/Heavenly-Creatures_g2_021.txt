ext. ilam/driveway - daylow angle . . . a tree-lined driveway.

pauline rides her bicycle up the drive. she pauses, wide-eyed.

pan to . . . ilam - a large stately house, set amongst beautiful gardens . . .

pauline puts her bike on its stand. she pulls the mario lanza album out of her bicycle bag.

pauline is about to approach the house when she glances across the garden, and is transfixed by an enchanting sight:

juliet on a sunlit bridge that spans the ilam stream. she is wearing a shredded chiffon dress, with a christmas tinsel crown and a necklace made from tinfoil. sunlight filters through the trees, lending juliet a magical quality. she's casting flowers onto the water. pauline stands transfixed. juliet sees her and smiles.

juliet
hi, paul!

suddenly! . . . an 8-year-old boy - jonathon hulme - comes charging out of the bushes and lays into juliet with a wooden sword. he is dressed in a "prince's" costume.

juliet
0www!

jonathon runs away. juliet gives chase, yelling to pauline.

juliet
the evil prince runnymeade is escaping! get him, paul!

pauline joins in the chase after jonathon, careening through garden and bushes.

juliet and pauline lose sight of jonathon. they pause in a clearing, catching their breath.

juliet
the blighter's gone to ground!

jonathon yaaaa!

jonathon drops from a tree, onto pauline, sending, her sprawling. he whacks her on the bottom with his wooden sword.

juliet
god! jonty! jonty-stop it! go away! we're not playing anymore . . . go on, bugger off!

jonathon pokes his tongue at juliet, turns and runs away.

juliet offers her hand and pulls pauline up. she pauses, a look of shock on her face . . .

the mario lanza record lies broken on the ground. pauline looks distraught.

juliet
0h, god . . . i'm so sorry!

pauline
(upset) it doesn't matter.

juliet
of course it matters! it's mario!

i nt. ilam/lounge - dayclose on . . . henry hulme - a 44-year-old bespectacled academic. he is sniffing, with a disdainful look on his face. he pulls a packet of mouldy sandwiches his jacket pocket.

henry what on earth are these?

hilda hulme, elegant, 36 years old, is setting down a tray of tea on a small table.

hilda they're egg and salmon sandwiches . . . i gave them to you several days ago.

henry i thought i could smell sulphur.

hilda god, henry! you're hopeless! you can't be trusted with something as simple as lunch.

juliet
(o.s.) mother!

hilda looks up as juliet bursts into the room from the garden, followed by pauline. hilda smiles at pauline.

hilda hello . . .

juliet
jonty broke paul's record!

hilda oh, dear!

juliet
we must buy her another one!

juliet drops to the floor, hauling records out of the radiogram cabinet.

pauline looks around, taking in the sumptuousness of her surroundings: ornate fireplace, paintings, antique furniture.

hilda would you like a cup of tea . . . paul?

pauline
no, thank you.

hilda well, juliet's told us all about you. i hear you're fond of opera.

before pauline can reply, juliet fans mario lanza albums across the floor.

juliet
which one shall we play?

pauline shrugs awkwardly. henry looks up from his papers, rather annoyed at this intrusion. pauline notices a row of beautifully sculpted plasticine horses adorning the mantelpiece.

juliet puts a record on the turntable.

hilda juliet . . . your father's trying to study.

juliet
daddy can study while we're playing records!

henry why don't you go back outside, mmm? i'll be finished soon.

the record drops on the turntable. the arm swings across.

henry and hilda glance at each other. henry silently gathers up his papers and leaves the room.

the needle drops and mario lanza's rendition of "the donkey serenade" booms into the room.

swirling camera as juliet takes pauline's hand and whirls her around, leading her into . . .
