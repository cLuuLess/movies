int. riepers' house/kitchen - eveningclose-up . . . a newspaper is unwrapped, revealing couple of fresh fish.

honora rieper is standing at her sink bench. she is 43 years old. dark hair, going gray. a middle-aged woman with a kind face.

her husband, herbert, has just arrived home and is taking off his coat, looking at the mail, etc. he is nearly 60 . . . 15 years older than honora.

the riepers' house is clean and tidy. they are a low middle-class family on a modest income.

honora 
oh! . . . mackerel. we'll have them for lunch tomorrow.

herbert comes up behind honora, gives her a peck on cheek and puts his hand on her bum.

herbert 
let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, nora?

honora 
playfully shoves his hand away.

honora 
i'll think you'll find our mr. bayliss is not keen on seafood. i've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.

herbert 
sighs as honora puts the frying pan on the stove.

young student boarder, steve bayliss, appears in doorway, nervously clutching a record.

steve 
excuse me . . . would you mind if i put my long-playing record on?

herbert 
you're partial to a nice bit of mackerel, aren't you, steve?

steve 
 well . . . actually, i'm not much of a fish man, mr. rieper.

honora 
glances at his album.

honora 
you have been splashing out!

steve 
 oh! . . . i've got my board money . . .

steve 
 starts fishing in his pockets.

at this moment . . . pauline comes into the kitchen, through back door. she strides past honora, herbert and steve 
.

pauline
(brightly) hello!

honora 
well? tell us! how'd it go?

pauline disappears into the lounge.

pauline
(o.s.) (calling) got an a, mum!

honora 
glows with pride. steve is emptying his pockets on the bench. honora pats steve's hand.

honora 
don't worry about it now. we'll sort it out after dinner. you go put your record on.

herbert 
doris day!

steve 
 i think she's very talented!
