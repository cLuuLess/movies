int. school art class - day
the teacher, mrs. collins, comes in, carrying a pile of paper and a box of paints. she starts to distribute them around the tables.

mrs. collins 
right, i thought we'd do some life drawing today. pair off into twos and decide who wants to model and who wants to draw.

the girls around juliet turn to each other, seemingly eager not to be partnered with her. they pair off and juliet is left alone.

mrs. collins 
oh, juliet. . . you haven't got a partner.

juliet
that s all right, mrs. collins. i'm sure i can manage without one.

mrs. collins scans the class.

mrs. collins 
pauline . . . are you with anybody?

pauline shakes her head.

mrs. collins 
good! you can come here and pair up with juliet.

pauline reluctantly comes up to juliet's table.

series of shots showing various girls sketching their partners. most of the posing girls are seated in contrived positions with rigid grins on their faces. mrs. collins patrols the class, commenting to different girls.

mrs. collins 
you might want to change the colour- make it a bit darker . . . that's very nice, joan.

pull back. . . to reveal pauline's "pose" . . . slumped in the chair, arms crossed, a sullen look on her face. she stares intently at juliet, who is drawing furiously . . . but doesn't refer to pauline at all.

mrs. collins 
good heavens, juliet! what on earth is this???

mrs. collins picks up juliet's drawing. it features an armoured knight on horseback, fighting a dragon.

juliet
st. george and the dragon.

mrs. collins studies the detail in the drawing.

mrs. collins 
where's pauline?

juliet
oh, i haven't gotten around to drawing her yet. i was going to pop her on a rock, but i seem to have run out room.

juliet glances at pauline.

juliet
sorry! i don't know if you've noticed, mrs. collin but i've actually drawn st. george in the likeness of world's greatest tenor-mario lanza!

mrs. collins 
yes, i know it's very clever, juliet, but when i set you a topic, i expect you to follow it. now put that down and start again!

mrs. collins moves on. juliet looks up at pauline rather grumpily. pauline leans forward, an intense look on face . . .

pauline
(whispers) i think your drawing's fantastic!
