three candles illuminate a little shrine, nestled flower bed in a remote corner of the ilam garden.

bricks have been stacked to form a miniature temple, decorated with flowers and tinsel.

pauline and juliet are kneeling on the ground, clipping pictures from film magazines. clipped-out photos lie scattered about.

pauline holds james mason's photo.

pauline
(enraptured) i wish james would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as jesus!

juliet
daddy says the bible's a load of bunkum!

pauline reacts with a degree of shock.

pauline
but, we're all going to heaven!

juliet
i'm not! i'm going to the fourth world! it's like heaven, only better because there aren't any christians.

pauline giggles.

juliet
it's an absolute paradise of music, art and enjoyment.

pauline is entranced. juliet plucks up some photos.

juliet

juliet screws her face up and throws the photo into the stream.

juliet

juliet dramatically sweeps her hand over the photos in the shrine and bows her head.

juliet
we give praise to . . . the saints!

candlelight flickers on pauline s enraptured face.

the crumpled photo of orson welles floats down the stream. with a sudden violent burst of sound, it is sucked into the weir.
