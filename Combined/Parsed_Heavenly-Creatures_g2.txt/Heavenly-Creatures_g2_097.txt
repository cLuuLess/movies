walks in, waving a letter.

honora

pauline looks at her mother with distaste.

pauline

honora 
it's a letter from the school . . . from miss stewart.

pauline
what does old stew want?

honora 
she says the standard of your work is slipping. at this rate she doesn't think you'll get school certificate.

pauline

honora

pauline
i'm educating myself!

honora

i'm doing my own writing!

honora 
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.

honora 
these stories are not going to get you school certificate! you don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?

pauline
(scornful) what do you know? you wouldn't know the first thing about writing. you're the most ignorant person i've ever met!

honora 
is very angry.

honora 
you're rude . . . rude and insolent! i don't see why i should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.

pauline
(shouting) i don't wanna be in bloody school!

honora 
(shouting) all right! you go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!

storms out of the room and slams the door.
