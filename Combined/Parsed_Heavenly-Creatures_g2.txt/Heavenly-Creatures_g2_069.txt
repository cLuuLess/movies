int. riepers' house/dining room - morning breakfast . . .a plate of weetbix bangs down on the table in front of pauline. milk sloshes over the side of the bowl. honora 
looks thunderous and stomps off.

pauline
(diary v.o.) when i got up i found father had told mother . . .

camera pulls back to reveal steve 
, ross, a new boarder, laurie, and herbert 
seated around the table. the boarders are clearly oblivious to the tense family vibes.

laurie coming to lancaster park on saturday, mr. rieper?

herbert 
shakes his head, sullenly.

wendy hurries into the room, grabs a piece of toast, pulling on a coat.

wendy where's john? he said he'd walk with me.

honora 
stands in the doorway.

honora 
john's no longer staying here.

wendy looks surprised.

laurie shot through, this morning . . . said his old mum had taken sick.
