int. ilam/lounge - day . . .. . . the lounge.

pauline's drab clothes transform into a ballgown as she passes through the doorway.

the song soars as they waltz into the middle of the ballroom . . . pauline spins . . . in a blur she sees decorations and faces all around.

pauline gasps as diello takes her by the waist and waltzes around the room. characters from borovnia fill the room. juliet dances with charles.

a man in a dark suit turns around . . . mario! he launches into the second verse!

pauline laughs happily as she is swept around and around.

pauline
(diary v.o.) we realised why deborah and i have such extraordinary telepathy and why people treat us and look at us the way they do. it is because we are mad. we are both stark raving mad!

they are no longer in the lounge - at some point the waltz has dissolved into . . .
