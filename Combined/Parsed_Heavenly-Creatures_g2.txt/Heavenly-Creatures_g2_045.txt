pauline
push! . . . breathe! . . . it's coming! . . . oh, god!

pull out . . . to reveal juliet lying on her bed, in childbirth pose. her pregnant stomach is pushing at the seams of her school dress.

juliet wails . . . pauline pulls out a pillow from between juliet's legs, her face a mixture of surprise and elation.

pauline
it's a boy! deborah . . . we've got a son and heir!

pauline hands juliet the pillow. she cradles it in her arms.

juliet
