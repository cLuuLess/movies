int. riepers' house/dining room - day (cont.)

herbert 
what's that?

juliet
i'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!

honora 
and herbert 
exchange a glance.

ding dong! . . . doorbell rings. honora 
gets up.

honora 
eat up, yvonne.

she leaves the room. juliet raises her eyebrows at pauline, who looks embarrassed.

pauline
(quietly) it's my middle name.

herbert 
smiles at juliet.

herbert 
yvonne tells us you're good at making models.

juliet
i adore anything to do with the arts.

herbert 
we're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?

pauline looks down, cheeks burning.

herbert 
i've never cottoned on to plasticine like you girls, but i enjoy making things out of wood.

juliet
are you a carpenter, mr. rieper? herbert 
shakes his head.

herbert 
i work at dennis brothers fish supply.

muffled voices from the hallway.

pauline
he's the manager!

honora 
leads a young man-john-into the dining room.

honora 
(o.s.) this is the dining room . . .

she smiles at juliet.

honora 
do excuse us.

she leads john into the hallway.

honora 
(o.s.) breakfast is between seven and nine . . . the bedroom's small, but it's very clean and comfortable.

pauline scowls.

herbert 
this story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.

juliet
actually, mr. rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to new york. that's where all the big publishing houses are based.

herbert 
(laughs) is that a fact! you'd better put me name down for an advance copy!

herbert 
chuckles. pauline and juliet look at each with knowing smiles.

pauline
(diary v.o.) we have decided how sad it is for other people that they cannot appreciate our genius . . .
