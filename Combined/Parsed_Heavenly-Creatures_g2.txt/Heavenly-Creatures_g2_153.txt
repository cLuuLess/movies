int. riepers' house/pauline's bedroom - dayclose-up . . . the newspaper is unwrapped to reveal the half-brick.

pauline is sitting on her bed looking at the brick.

juliet stands beside her. she tugs at her collar.

juliet
do you feel sweaty? i feel sweaty.

pauline opens a draw and pulls out a stocking.

pauline
it's a three-act story with a tragic end.

juliet
your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?

pauline
i thought for hours about whether carmelita should accept bernard's marriage proposal . . .

juliet
i think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!

pauline puts the brick in the stocking and ties a knot in the foot.

pauline
. . . but in the end i decided against it. i thought it would spoil all their fun.

pauline puts the brick in her shoulder bag.

juliet
(bitterly) affairs are much more exciting than marriages . . . as mummy can testify!

they both laugh.
