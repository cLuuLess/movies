juliet
(letter v.o.) oh, charles . . . i am despair enough to put diello in the hands of the cardinal, in hope that a good dose of religion will set the young chap on the right path.

reverend norris hello again . . .

juliet peers up at a dog-collared vicar. she eyes him coldly.

reverend norris how are you getting along? it must be awfully hard being away from your school chums . . . i've got something here you might just like to have a look at.

he hands juliet a leaflet featuring a thin, withered figure in a great deal of pain. "jesus loves you" is printed across the top.

juliet's face hardens.

reverend norris unfortunately, modern medicine can only go so far in combatting an illness like tb. and that's why i'm here . . . because with the power of god, miracles can happen. the lord has said that those who have faith will be saved! reach out, juliet! reach out for jesus!

during reverend norris's speech . . . camera closes in to big close-up of juliet's face. reverend norris's voice fades away. . .

suddenly!!!

a silhouetted figure rises up behind reverend norris . . . a lumpy hand closes around his throat!

reverend norris aaaaarghhh!!!

diello - the plasticine figurine, now life-size - drags reverend norris off his feet and across the room.

reverend norris kicks and struggles as diello hauls him through the doorway onto . . .
