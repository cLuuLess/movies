int. sanatorium/juliet's room - dayjuliet is sitting by her bed, fully clothed. her suitcases are packed and lie on the bed.

pauline runs into the room. juliet stands and they embrace hugging each other tightly.

henry enters the room and frowns at the sight of the girls hugging. juliet reaches out for henry and pulls him into the embrace. he looks decidedly ill at ease as pauline's black hair nuzzles against his neck.
