ext. country road - dayfast track - close-up . . . bicycle wheel spinning.

pauline and juliet are pedalling their bicycles like mad down a narrow, tree-lined lane.

the "donkey serenade" continues . . .

they have a near-miss with an angrily tooting car.

pauline wobbles out of control! . . . she goes flying into a bush.

the donkey serenade finishes abruptly in mid-verse.

pauline is lying on her back.

pauline's pov . . . looking straight up into treetops and blue sky. juliet's face looms over, looking concerned.

juliet
(worried) paul? oh, god! paul . . . are you all right?

pauline's eyes are shut. she speaks with great effort.

pauline
(gasping) i think i'm dying . . .

juliet
(upset) don't . . . please! please, don't!

dying breath escapes from pauline's mouth . . . she goes limp.

juliet shrieks!

juliet
(crying) paul!!!

juliet collapses over pauline's body, crying.

pauline's eyes flick open! she sniffs and pulls a face.

pauline
urrrgh! you've been eating onions.

before juliet has time to react, pauline pushes her off, giggling maniacally. she leaps to her feet and attempts to run. juliet grabs pauline's cardigan, pulling her backwards.

juliet
you toad!

pauline sheds the cardigan and runs through the bushes, with juliet in hot pursuit!

rrrrip! . . . juliet tugs at pauline's blouse and the buttons pop off. pauline is laughing too hard to run anymore. she pulls off her skirt and waves it around her head as she dances around the bushes, singing "the donkey serenade."

pauline
(singing) "there's a light in her eye, though she may try to hide it, she cannot deny, there's a light in her eye."

now juliet is cracking up at the sight of pauline spinning around in her underwear, shoes and socks.

pauline circles around and around juliet, singing. juliet hurriedly starts undressing down to her underwear.

juliet giggles and starts jumping up and down.

pauline suddenly breaks into a run and races through the bushes. juliet follows.

both girls are screaming and hooting loudly. pauline and juliet burst out of the bushes and . . .

pauline
& juliet
(singing) "her face is a dream, like an angel i saw . . .
