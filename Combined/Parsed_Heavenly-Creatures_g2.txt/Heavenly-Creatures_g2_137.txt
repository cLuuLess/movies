int. ilam/juliet's bedroom - nightpauline and juliet tumble into the bedroom, only to find orson lurking behind the door! they scream and flee along the balcony only to be greeted by orson at the other end! they run back into the bedroom and collapse onto the bed, screaming and giggling.

push in . . . to pauline's exalted face.

pauline
(diary v.o.) we talked for some time about it, getting ourselves more and more excited.

a huge shadow of a figure, dressed in hat and cape, rises on the bedroom wall behind the girls, threatening to engulf them.

music swells up . . .

pauline comes down on top of juliet, kissing her on the lips . . . pauline's hands slipping juliet's blouse off her shoulders.

pauline
(diary v.o.) we enacted how each saint would make love in bed.

juliet heaves on the bed, pauline leans over and . . . morphs into orson welles!

cut to int. borovnia castle - nightdiello thrusts and grunts, as if making love. he steps back holding a bloody sword. a slain peasant drops at his feet.

close-up . . . pauline moaning and thrashing.

close-up . . . diello swinging from side to side as he hacks a peasant to pieces.

intercut with shots of pauline and juliet intertwined with orson and diello. pauline and juliet sometimes change into their plasticine counterparts, deborah and gina.

pauline
(diary v.o.) we spent a hectic night going through the saints. it was wonderful! heavenly! beautiful! and ours! we felt satisfied indeed. we have now learned the peace of the thing called bliss, the joy of the thing called sin.
