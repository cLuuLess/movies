int. riepers' house/lounge - dayhonora 
and herbert 
are sitting with hilda in the lounge.

hilda she's uncontrollable. i've told her that pauline is not going to south africa, but she refuses to accept it.

herbert 
and honora 
exchange a glance.

hilda i expect you've heard the same from your own daughter.

honora 
shakes her head.

honora 
(upset) yvonne hasn't spoken to me for nearly two weeks.

hilda yes . . . well, it hasn't been an easy time for any of us, mrs. rieper.

herbert 
she's cut us out of her life . . . it's been causing her mother and i a lot of worry.

hilda what i'm suggesting is that we let the girls spend these last three weeks together. we'd like pauline to come and stay with juliet, until she leaves.

herbert 
is that a good idea?

herbert 
looks at honora 
. . . tears are running down her cheeks. he stands and ushers hilda toward the door.

herbert 
why don't i telephone you tonight, mrs. hulme?

hilda yes, of course.

herbert 
accompanies hilda into the hallway.

honora 
breaks down into heavy sobs.
