int. riepers' house/pauline's sleepout - nightpauline is lying in bed. the lights are off.

pauline
(theatrical voice) "now, gels . . . it isn't ooo, it's eee," and she goes . . . "eeeeee" as if someone is jabbing a pin into her! silly old trout!

pull out during pauline's v.o.... to reveal john lying in bed beside her. he cuddles up to her.

john i love you, yvonne.

pauline continues, oblivious to his attentions.

pauline
and then in history, we've got this senile old bat, who goes . . . (squawky voice) "and charles the second met nell gwynn aboard a boat and he was a prince and she was a pretty young thing and these thing do happen . . ." (normal voice) god! it's no wonder i don't excel in history!

john do you love me as much as i love you?

pauline
0f course, my darling nicholas.

john can't contain himself . . . he starts pressing himself against her body.

john (panting) my . . . my name's john.

pauline lies on her back, not responding to his caresses.

pauline
i like nicholas much better!

john climbs on top of pauline.

john you can call me anything you like . . .

john fumbles around beneath the sheets.

pauline
what are you doing?

john nothing . . .

suddenly!

the outside light flicks on. sound of footsteps stomping down the path.

the door opens!

pauline
bloody hell!

john desperately tries to conceal himself beneath the bedcovers as . . .

the light flicks on . . . herbert 
stands in the doorway. he surveys the situation with a grim expression.

john rolls out of bed and staggers toward the door fumbling with his pyjama cord.

herbert 
go to the house.

john scuttles out of the sleepout. pauline lies still in bed, peering at her father.

herbert 
(upset) you have broken my heart, yvonne.

herbert 
turns and leaves the room. pauline stares at the ceiling.

pauline
(diary v.o.) i lay there mesmerised. it was just too frightful to believe . . .
