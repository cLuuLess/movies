int. riepers' house/lounge - nighthenry and honora 
are sitting in the lounge. henry looking rather uncomfortable on the edge of a shabby armchair. herbert 
is at a drinks cabinet unscrewing the top off a bottle.

henry your daughter's . . . an imaginative and a spirited girl- honora 
if she's spending too much time at your house, you only need to say. all those nights she spends over-she's assured us that you don't mind . . .

henry it's rather more complicated than that. since mrs. hulme and i have returned home, juliet has been behaving in a rather disturbed manner . . . surliness, short temper . . . general irritability-most uncharacteristic.

herbert 
is pouring a drink.

herbert 
sure i can't tempt you to a nice sherry, dr. hulme?

henry no, thank you. the thing is . . .

honora 
yvonne hasn't been herself, either. locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.

herbert 
sits down next to honora, glass of sherry in hand.

henry my wife and i feel the friendship is . . . unhealthy.

herbert 
no arguments there, dr. hulme! all that time inside working on those novels of theirs. they don't get fresh air or exercise!

honora 
frowns at henry.

honora 
(concerned) i'm not sure what you mean, dr. hulme.

henry pauses for a moment.

henry your daughter appears to have formed a rather . . . unwholesome attachment to juliet.

honora 
(worried) what's she done???

henry she hasn't done anything . . . it's the intensity of the friendship that concerns me. i think we should avert trouble before it starts.

henry hands a business card to honora.

henry dr. bennett is a very good friend. he's a general physician, but has some expertise in child psychology. if pauline is indeed developing in a rather . . . er . . . wayward fashion, dr. bennett is the ideal man to set her back on track.
