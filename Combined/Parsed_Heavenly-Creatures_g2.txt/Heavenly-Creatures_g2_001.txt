ext. victoria park/bushy track - late afternoon camera crashes out of bush and races up a dark bushy track.

close on . . . two pairs of feet running up the track, slipping in the mud . . . desperate.

wide shot . . . reveals two girls running up the track, distraught.

juliet hulme: nearly 16 - tall, blond and willowy,

and

pauline rieper: 16 - dark-haired, shorter and stockier than juliet.

it is 1954. both girls are dressed in overcoats on a chilly winter day. they slip and stumble on the dirt track that winds up the steep victoria park hillside. thick vegetation and overhanging trees give the path a tunnel-like feeling.
