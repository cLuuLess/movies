int. riepers' house/hallway - daypauline looks very upset.

pauline
(upset) it's no bloody good . . . i went to the passport office today. they won't give me one till i'm 20.

cut between pauline and juliet . . .

juliet
but that's not true! i've got one.

pauline
(choked up) i need my sodding parents' consent.

tears well in juliet's eyes.

juliet
(sobbing) don't cry, gina . . . we're not going to be separated. they can't make us . . . they can't!

hilda quietly looms up behind juliet. she gently takes the phone out of juliet's hand and puts it back on the receiver. juliet struggles in hilda's arms, pushing her mother away, screaming.

pauline stands holding the dead phone.

honora 
yvonne.

pauline turns and faces her mother.

honora 
please don't be like this, love.

pauline gives honora 
a cursory glance and walks past her, up the stairs. honora 
looks after her, a hurt expression on her face.

pauline
(diary v.o.) i did not tell deborah of my plans for removing mother. i have made no decision yet as the last fate i wish to meet is one in a borstal. i am trying to think of some way.
