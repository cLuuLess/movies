int. riepers' house/pauline's sleepout - nightpauline is lying in bed asleep. her door opens and john stands tentatively in the door way. he is wearing stripey pyjamas.

john (loud whisper) yvonne!

pauline sits up, groggily flicking on a bedside light.

pauline
whaddya want?

john puts his fingers to his lips to shush her.

john (whispers) l can't sleep . . . can l borrow a book?

pauline
(whispers) shut the door.

john tiptoes across to the bookshelf he pulls a book out . . . "girls' own annual 1951."

john this looks interesting.

pauline gives him a dubious look from her bed.

john stands shivering, flicking through the annual.

john these knitting patterns look damn complicated. have you tried the tea cosy?

pauline shakes her head and looks on as john continues to thumb awkwardly through the book, his shivers increasing.

he glances at pauline nervously.

john it's damn cold, isn't it? do you think i could hop into bed for a moment . . . just to warm up? my feet are like iceblocks.

pauline
you should have worn your slippers.

john come on, yvonne, i'll catch me death!

pauline rolls to one side.

pauline
just for a minute.

john climbs into bed beside pauline and pulls the blankets up around his chin.
