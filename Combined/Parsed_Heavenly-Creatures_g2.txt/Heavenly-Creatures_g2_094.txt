int. riepers' house/lounge - christmas day 1953close-up . . . a christmas present is torn open . . . followed by several more, in quick cuts. typical 1953 presents.

honora, herbert, wendy and pauline are sitting on the floor, amidst presents and discarded wrapping paper. grandma parker is sitting in a chair.

herbert 
waves a pair of new socks around. the family laughing and talking. pauline is not participating. she is leaning back, looking morose. honora 
looks at her with concern.

honora 
(concerned) is it hurting, dear?

pauline looks blank.

honora 
your leg . . . have you got pain?

pauline shakes her head. she rips open a present . . . a new diary.
