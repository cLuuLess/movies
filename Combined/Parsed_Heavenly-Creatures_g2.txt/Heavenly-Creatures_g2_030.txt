without missing a beat, they continue singing . . .

pauline
& juliet
(singing) "but all that my darling can scream . . ."

. . . then break down into convulsive laughter. they turn and flee back into the bushes.

on the soundtrack . . . mario lanza picks up "the donkey serenade" at the point that pauline and juliet stopped. the song builds to a rousing final chorus as . . .

as mario sings the last exhilarating notes . . .

camera rises up vertically . . . up through the foliage . . . past the branches of a tree which abruptly block camera.
