int. riepers'house/lounge - eveningclose-up. . . gramophone needle drops onto a record.

fast pull-back . . . from the speaker as the opening notes of "be my love" by mario lanza burst out. records from the cabinet lie scattered on the floor. pauline is clutching a mario lanza album.

steve backs toward the hallway door, holding his doris day album forlornly.

herbert chuckles at him through the kitchen doorway.

herbert 
(laughing) ya gotta be quick in this house, mate!

pauline stares misty-eyed at the album cover. herbert 
calls out.

herbert 
(o.s.) (tongue in cheek) hey! isn't it that irish singer . . . murray o' lanza?

pauline
(annoyed) he's italian, dad! the world's greatest tenor!

mario lanza starts singing . . . herbert comes into the lounge, miming the song with a limp fish. he gesticulates a grand operatic fashion.

pauline
stop it! you're spoiling it! go away!

she pushes herbert out of the room, into the kitchen.
