ext. fourth world - daypauline and juliet are amazed! . . . they stand, holding each other's hand tightly. the world around them take on a new form.

the grass beneath their feet has become a well-kept lawn. they are surrounded by fountains and waterfalls. unicorns graze on the hillside . . . gigantic butterflies hover in the air.

pauline and juliet walk about in wonderment.

pauline
(diary v.o.) today juliet and i discovered the key to the fourth world. we have had it in our possession for about six months, but we only realised it on the day of the death of christ. we saw a gateway through the clouds. everything was full of peace and bliss. we then realised we had the key . . .
