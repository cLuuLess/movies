ext. ilam grounds - nightclose-up . . . james mason's photo lands in a roaring fire and is immediately consumed by the flames. photos of mel ferrer, michael rennie and orson welles follow.

pauline and juliet are standing by a roaring fire in the ilam grounds. they throw mario records onto the flames. the black vinyl curls and melts. their plasticine figures are next. globs of melted plasticine drip amidst the burning debris.

it is clearly a strange, ritualistic burning. pauline and juliet watch the fire, enraptured.

juliet
only the best people fight against all obstacles . . .

juliet squeezes pauline's hand.

juliet
. . . in pursuit of happiness.

wide shot of the fire.

pauline
(diary v.o.) we both spent last night having a simply wonderful time in every possible way.
