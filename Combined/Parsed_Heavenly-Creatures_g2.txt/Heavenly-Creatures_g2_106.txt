(v.o.) there's something desperately exciting about bodies on stretchers . . . (regretfully) but it wasn't like that at all!

same scene - but:no ambulance or stretchers . . . walter hops out of a cab, looking fit and healthy. hilda steps out of the house, followed by juliet.

hilda bill! i hope the trip didn't tire you.

walter not in the least! (to juliet) hello! (looks at house) what a splendid place!
