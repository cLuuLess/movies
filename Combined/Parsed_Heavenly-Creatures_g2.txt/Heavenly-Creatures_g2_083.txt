ext. street - daypauline and juliet sitting in a tram as it crawls along slowly.

john is running alongside, waving and calling, trying to get pauline's attention. he is clearly pleading with her, but to no avail.

john yvonne! stop! i still love you!

pauline
(poem v.o.) compared with these two, every man is a fool,/the world is most honoured that they should deign to rule,/and i worship the power of these lovely two,/ with that adoring love known to so few . . .

pauline looks knowingly at juliet, then down to john, hurrying along the street.
