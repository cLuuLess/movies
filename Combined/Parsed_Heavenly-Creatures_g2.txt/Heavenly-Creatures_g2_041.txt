ext. port levy hillside - early eveningclouds swirling about the sky.

a grassy hillside overlooking port levy bay. an island sits in the bay, bathed in the last rays of sunlight.

juliet is a tiny figure against the vast landscape. she runs blindly toward the edge of the hill.

pauline appears over the brow . . . the hillside is empty! she panics, running, calling out.

pauline
(worried) julie! julie!

pauline finds juliet curled up in a little ball. she is motionless. pauline gently takes juliet in her arms. juliet is breathing heavily . . . she squeezes her eyes shut, concentrating hard-a look of desperation on her face.

juliet
look, paul!

pauline looks about, but can see nothing but a scrubby hillside. she looks mystified.

pauline
what?

juliet
it's so beautiful!

pauline
what???

golden light streams on pauline and juliet. pauline look up as the clouds above them open. juliet stands as if in trance. she offers her hand to pauline.

juliet
come with me.

juliet pulls pauline up and hugs her as they walk forward. the barren landscape around pauline and juliet morphs into a beautiful garden . . . the fourth world!
