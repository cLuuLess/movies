ext. sanatorium/garden - daypauline is sitting cross-legged at the foot of juliet's bed.

pauline
(whispers) you'll never guess what's happened!!

juliet
what??

pauline
john has fallen in love with me!

juliet
that idiot boarder?

pauline beams.

juliet
how do you know? did he tell you?

pauline
well . . . no. but it's so obvious.

pauline giggles. juliet turns away.

juliet
(sullen) is that why you haven't replied to my last letter?

pauline's smile disappears.

pauline
no, silly. i'm just teasing. he's only a stupid boy!
