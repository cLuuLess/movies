hilda it's not too late to cancel our travel arrangements . . . if that's what you want?

juliet tearfully shakes her head. henry is standing at the foot of the bed, hands behind his back.

henry i'm sure you'll like it here . . . it's very tranquil.

hilda i've spoken to the matron, and she promises to take special care of you.

henry and you can carry on with your studies while you convalesce.

hilda touches juliet's hand, and leans forward . . . a concerned look on her face.

hilda it's for the good of your health, darling.

juliet looks at her mother, eyes filling with tears. henry pats her feet.

henry cheer up, old thing . . . four months will fly by in no time.
