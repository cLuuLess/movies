int. sanatorium - dayjuliet lies on her bed, writing to pauline.

pauline
(diary v.o.) she has entered into the spirit of the thing greatly!

as we listen to juliet's v.o., we see scenes of tb hospital life . . . the meals brought around . . . the dayroom . . . the doctors.

juliet
(letter v.o.) my dear charles, i miss you and adore you in equal amounts and long for the day we will be reunited, but as i languish here, in this house of disease and decrepitude, my mind turns-with increasing frequency- to the problem of our son . . .
