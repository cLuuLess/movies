school french class - morningclass 3a are in the midst of a french lesson. all the class have name cards hanging around their necks denoting their chosen "french name." miss waller gestures at a screed of subjugated verbs scrawled on the blackboard.

miss waller the imperfect subjunctive, like the imperfect indicative, indicates action in the past. "ii voulait qu'elle lui donnat de l'argent." translate, somebody . . . quickly!

a schoolgirl - laura - blurts out from the front of the class.

laura 
"he wanted her to give him some money."

miss waller 
(angry) put your hand up! i will not have girls talking out of turn in my class!

the door opens and miss stewart brings juliet into the room.

the presence of the headmistress causes the class to stand up.

miss stewart
good morning, gels.

class (in unison) good morning, miss stewart.

the class sit.

miss stewart
miss waller . . . class . . . this is juliet hulme. juliet is joining us from st. margaret's, and prior to that she spent some time at queenswood in the hawkes bay.

juliet looks at miss stewart haughtily.

juliet
i am actually from england, miss stewart.

miss stewart
of course . . . juliet's father is dr. hulme, the rector of the university.

miss waller looks impressed. pauline is quietly drawing horses at the back of the class.

miss stewart
juliet's travelled all over the world, and i'm sure she'll be very eager to share her impressions of exotic lands across the seas with the gels of 3a. i'll leave you to it, miss waller. juliet.

miss stewart leaves. miss waller smiles at juliet.

miss waller 
you can sit over here, juliet.

miss waller gestures to a desk at the front. she gives juliet a cardboard name card.

miss waller 
we use french names in this class. you can choose your own.

miss waller returns to the blackboard and starts writing.

miss waller 
now, irregular verbs in the present subjunctive. . . "qu'il vienne". . .

juliet
excuse me, miss waller . . . you've made a mistake.

miss waller turns to juliet-who now has the name "antoinette" hanging around her neck.

juliet
"je doutais qu'il vienne" is in fact the spoken subjunctive.

miss waller 
it is customary to stand when addressing a teacher . . . "antoinette."

juliet stands.

juliet
you should have written "vint."

miss waller frowns, glances at the board, and hastily rubs out the offending word.

miss waller 
(embarrassed mumble) oh! i must have copied it incorrectly from my notes.

juliet stands again.

juliet
you don't have to apologise, miss waller. i found it frightfully difficult myself . . . until i got the hang of it.

miss waller turns to juliet, her face clouded with anger. the class looks terrified.

miss waller 
(icily) thank you, juliet. open your text-book to page 17.

pauline is smirking.
