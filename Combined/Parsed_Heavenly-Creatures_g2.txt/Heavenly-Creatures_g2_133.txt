ext. borovnia castle courtyard - night. . . the courtyard in borovnia castle.

the crowds continue dancing to "the loveliest night of the year."

a doorway in the courtyard . . . henry hulme is lurking in the shadows, peering out. he is dressed like a jester with cap and bells. the camera pushes in . . . to a distorted fisheye shot of henry.

pauline's v.o. continues, building in intensity . . .

pauline
(diary v.o.) dr. hulme is mad, as mad as a march hare!

at the conclusion of the song . . . two burly borovnian executioners swing their axes down, chopping a couple of ropes. a huge banner unfurls down the side of the castle tower. in embroidered letters three stories tall is the word . . .

mad!
