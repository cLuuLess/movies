is bustling about the house, working. every time she bends down, or leans over, pauline is revealed behind her. she is helping, but the mood is one of a hunter closing in on its prey.

(diary v.o.) i rose late and helped mother vigorously this morning. deborah rang and we decided to use a rock in a stocking rather than a sandbag. we discussed the moider fully. i feel very keyed up as though i were planning a surprise party. mother has fallen in with everything beautifully and the happy event is to take place tomorrow afternoon. so next time i write in this diary mother will be dead. how odd-yet how pleasing.
