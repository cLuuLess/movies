int. riepers' house/pauline's sleepout - eveningclose-up . . . plasticine figure of nicholas. john's hand comes into shot and picks the model up. pauline looks on anxiously . . . the face of nicholas bears more than a passing resemblance to john, but he doesn't seem to notice.

john this is quite something . . . you're damn clever.

pauline beams.

john so . . . deborah is married to charles, and this chap nicholas . . . is her tennis instructor?

pauline
yes, but there's nothing between them. deborah would never go for a commoner. nicholas has got his eye on gina, an amazingly beautiful gypsy.

she gestures to a plasticine gina figure that is sitting or the shelf.

john looks like you, yvonne.

pauline beams.

pauline
juliet made it!

john smiles.

john this is really quite incredible. l bet you girls know the entire royal lineage for the last five centuries.

pauline
oh, yes! it's all worked out!

john returns nicholas to the shelf, placing him amidst whole family of beautifully sculpted plasticine figures. pauline self-consciously returns to her sculpting, aware that john is watching her keenly.
