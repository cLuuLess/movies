a series of cards explains what happened subsequently:

in the hours following honora's murder, a police search of the rieper house unearthed pauline's dairies. this resulted in her immediate arrest for the murder her mother.

juliet was arrested and charged with murder the following day.

after pauline's arrest it was discovered that honor, herbert 
rieper had never married. pauline was therefore charged under her mother's maiden name of parker.

in august 1954, a plea of insanity was rejected by the jury in the christchurch supreme court trial and pauline parker and juliet hulme were found guilty of murder.

too young for the death penalty, they were sent to separate prisons to be 'detained at her majesty's pleasure.'

juliet was released in november 1959 and immediately left new zealand to join her mother overseas.

pauline was released two weeks later, but remain new zealand on parole until 1965.

it was a condition of their release that they never again.
