int. riepers' house/pauline's bedroom - nightpauline is crouched on her bed, hugging her knees. she stares intensely ahead.

pauline
(intense) the hulmes will look after me. they want me to live with them!

honora 
don't be so ridiculous. you're our daughter, you belong here with us.

pauline
i belong with deborah! we're going to south africa!

honora 
you're not going anywhere. you're 15 years old!!

pauline
(intense) you have to let me go!

honora 
stands and walks toward the door.

honora 
we'll talk about this when you've calmed down.

honora 
pauses at the door. pauline is slowly rocking on the bed, staring at the wall.

close-up . . . pauline's face as we hear her diary v.o.:

pauline
(diary v.o.) i felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.

honora 
love, you can still write to each other.

honora 
softly touches pauline's cheek. pauline winces, averting her face.

move in . . . to extreme close-up of pauline's eyes.

pauline
(diary v.o.) anger against mother boiled up inside me as it is she who is one of the main obstacle in my path. suddenly a means of ridding myself of this obstacle occurred to me. if she were to die . . .
