low angle . . . tracking in toward the castle gateway.

juliet
charles clutches his wounded shoulder as he gallops into the courtyard.

angle . . . from inside tower as pauline looks in through the window.

pauline
deborah awaits his return in their private boudoir at the very top of the tower.

tracking from sand castle courtyard, up steps into tower.

juliet
he smells her scent from 50 paces and urges his steed onward!

camera rushes into . . . tower bedroom . . . pans from pauline's to juliet's face, peering in through windows.

pauline
he flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!

juliet
god, yes!

juliet starts to giggle at a private thought.

juliet
(giggling) i bet she gets up the duff on their first night together!

pauline guffaws with delight. jonathon is sitting nearby, digging a hole in the sand.

jonathon what's "up the duff"?

juliet
something you wouldn't understand.

jonathon launches himself at juliet, and they roll on the sand, grappling.

jonathon tell me! i'm almost 10!

juliet
you're eight and a half and incredibly stupid!

pauline is laughing happily.
