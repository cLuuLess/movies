ext. borovnia castle courtyard - day. . . the courtyard. a f√©te is in progress. the courtyard is full of plasticine people, laughing and singing amidst stalls and sideshows.

pauline pushes her way through the crowd. a plasticine finger taps her shoulder . . . she spins around and gasps!

pauline
charles!

the plasticine king smiles.

charles (james mason voice) hello, gina . . . great to see you here!

he turns away. pauline scans the crowd. she gets a fleeting glimpse of the back of a robed woman.

pauline
(calling) deborah!

deborah does not hear, and pauline desperately pushes between plasticine people to try and reach her.

a blur of plasticine faces slide past . . .
