int. riepfrs' house/kitchen - morningpauline is washing dishes, up to her elbows in soapy water. behind her honora 
tidies up, glowering at her daughter.

pauline
(diary v.o.) i had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now i realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.

honora 
(angry) from now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.

pauline bangs a dish into the rack.

honora 
(angry) if you think for one minute that your father and i will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! you're only 14!!! you're a child! what on earth's the matter with you, yvonne? you know what can happen with boys . . . don't you have any self-respect?

honora 
sighs.

pauline
can i go now?

honora 
grabs pauline by the shoulders.

honora 
you think you're such a clever little madam! you had your father in tears last night!

pauline flinches.

honora 
my god, what a disgrace you are! you shame me, you shame the family. you're nothing but a cheap little tart!

pauline
well, i guess i take after you then!

honora 
whirls around and slaps pauline on the cheek.

pauline
you ran off with dad when you were only 17! nana parker told me!

honora 
steps back.

honora 
(softly) you're going to be late.

pauline triumphantly walks past her mother. honora 
barely reacts as pauline hurries out.

cut to: ext. riepers' house - nightmidnight at 31 gloucester st. all lights are off.

pauline
(diary v.o.) i am terribly cut up. i miss nicholas terrifically. mother thinks i will have nothing more to do with him, but little she knows . . .

the front door quietly opens and pauline sneaks out.

pauline pedals her bicycle furiously along dark streets.
