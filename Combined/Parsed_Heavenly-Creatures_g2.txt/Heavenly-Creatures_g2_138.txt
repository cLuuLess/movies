int. ilam/bathroom - nightbathwater

pauline and juliet are soaking in opposite ends of a steaming bathtub.

a few moments silence. juliet looks blankly at pauline. a tear rolls down her cheek.

pauline
i'm coming with you.

juliet
yes . . .

pauline
i know what to do about mother.

juliet's eyes narrow.

pauline
we don't want to go to too much trouble . . . some sort of accident.

a moment of silence.

pauline
people die every day.

close on . . . juliet's face.

silence.
