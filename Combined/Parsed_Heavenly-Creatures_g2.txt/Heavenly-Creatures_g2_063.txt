int.juliet's room - dayhonora 
is looking at some mail on a small table. pauline is sitting at juliet's bedside.

honora 
goodness me! what a lot of letters. are your parents enjoying their trip? oh . . . there's a couple of unopened ones, dear.

juliet
(sarcastically) i'm saving them for a rainy day.

honora 
gives her a sympathetic look.

honora 
i know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.

juliet
(bitterly) they sent me off to the bahamas "for the good of my health." they sent me to the bay of bloody islands "for the good of my health."

honora 
looks startled at the outburst.

juliet
i'm sorry, mrs. rieper. i'm feeling quite fatigued.

honora 
we don't want to tire you out, dear.

honora 
stands and picks up her handbag. pauline stands and juliet grabs her hand.

juliet
can't you stay a bit longer, paul?

pauline looks at honora.

honora 
we've got a tram to catch, yvonne.

pauline hugs juliet and reluctantly takes her leave.

cutto:
