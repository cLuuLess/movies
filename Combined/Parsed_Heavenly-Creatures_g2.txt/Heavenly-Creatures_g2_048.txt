int. riepers' house/pauline's sleepout - morningpauline is lying in her bed looking depressed. she writes her diary.

pauline
(diary v.o.) i spent a wretched night. it would be wonderful if i could get tuberculosis, too.

honora 
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.

honora 
come on, sit up.

pauline
i'm not hungry.

honora 
you've got to eat, yvonne. you hardly touched our dinner. i'm not having you falling ill.

pauline
i just want to be on my own for a while.

honora 
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to pauline.

honora 
you may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but i haven't!

honora 
holds up a loaded fork. pauline reluctantly takes it.

pauline
do you think juliet could stay here while her parents are away?

honora 
juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.

pauline
but she'll have no one to look after her!

honora 
her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. don't worry about juliet.
