	ext. bridge wing - u.s.s. pierce - day

	-- between the destroyer, u.s.s. pierce and the soviet
	freighters gagarin and kimovsk.  the pierce's bridge wings
	are crammed with helmeted officers and lookouts.  they peer
	through binoculars at the distant ships, plowing ahead,
	straight for them.  the captain lowers his binoculars,
	determined.
