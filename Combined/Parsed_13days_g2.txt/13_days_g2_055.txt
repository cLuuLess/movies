	int. hallway - sheraton-blackstone hotel - night

	super: friday, october 19th.  day 4

	then super: chicago

	kenny threads his way through the host of secret service
	agents and advance man cramming the hallway on the floor of
	the hotel they've taken over.  from one of the rooms emerges
	salinger.

				salinger
		kenny, all right.  what's going on here? 
		there's rumors going around an exercise
		in the southeast is related to cuba. 
		i'm the press secretary.  i can't do my
		job if i don't know what's going on.  so
		what's going on?

				kenny
		what are you telling them?

				salinger
		the truth: i don't know.

				kenny
			(deadly serious)
		tell 'em you've looked into it, and all
		it is is an exercise.  and pierre --
			(beat, loaded)
		the president may have a cold tomorrow.

	kenny stares at him, and the light dawns on pierre. 
	something big is going on and he's been cut out of it.  he
	stalks off.

				salinger
		damn it, kenny.  goddamn it!
