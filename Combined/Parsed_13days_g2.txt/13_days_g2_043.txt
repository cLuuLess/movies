	int. west wing halls - night

	acheson strides down the hall, taylor, sweeney, carter and
	bundy swept along behind him.  bundy is on the defensive, the
	others grim.

				general taylor
		if mcnamara'd get off the fence...

				bundy
		we have time.

				general carter
		goddamn it, it's obvious.  it's the only
		option.  that asshole, stevenson.  we
		can't let this drag out or we lose our
		shot.

				bundy
		bombing them...

				acheson
		remember that the kennedys' father was
		one of the architects of munich.  the
		general is right.  there is only one
		responsible choice here.

	bundy just nods.  taylor grabs a door ahead for acheson.

				acheson (cont'd)
		let's pray appeasement doesn't run in
		families.  i fear weakness does.

	and the men head into a stairwell going down.
