	int. situation room - day

	the president reacts.  kenny and bobby react.

				general taylor
		it's protecting the freighters.

	consternation.  the president picks up the phone.

				the president
		bob, is there any way we can avoid
		stopping a submarine first?

				mcnamara (o.s.)
		i'm afraid not, mr. president.  the sub
		has positioned itself between the pierce
		and the soviet ships.  admiral anderson
		insists it's too much of a risk to
		proceed with stopping the freighters. 
		the pierce would be a sitting duck for
		the sub.

	all around the room frustration.  bobby shakes his head. 
	kenny sinks back in his chair.  the president hesitates.

				the president
		put me through to the pierce.
