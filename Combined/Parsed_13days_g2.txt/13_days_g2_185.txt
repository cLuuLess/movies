		the united states has no facts in hand. 
		falsity is what america has in its hands
		- false evidence.

	zorin leans back in his chair.  adlai finally looks up.  he
	meets zorin's icy bravura.  he notes the cameras around the
	room.  this is the grandest stage of all.

				zorin (cont'd)
		the chair recognizes the representative
		from the united states.

	and in that moment, adlai becomes the spokesman for america.

				adlai
		well, let me say something to you, mr.
		ambassador, we do have the evidence.  we
		have it, and it is clear and
		incontrovertible.

	adlai's tone is definitive.  a tremor of interest passes
	through the various delegations.

				adlai (cont'd)
		and let me say something else.  those
		weapons must be taken out of cuba.  you,
		the soviet union, have created this new
		danger, not the united states.
