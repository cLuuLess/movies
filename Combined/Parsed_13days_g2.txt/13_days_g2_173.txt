	int. president's bedroom - day

	kenny throws himself on a chair in the bedroom's sitting
	area, newspaper in hand.  the president, buttoning his shirt
	in a full-length mirror, sees him.  there's a tv on.  the
	president selects a tie from a nearby rack, eyes the paper.

				the president
		what's that?

				kenny
		oh, just a bunch of crap about
		withdrawing our jupiter missiles in
		turkey if the soviets'll do the same in
		cuba.

	the president's eyes flick over to him in the mirror.

				the president
		i don't want to listen to this again.

				kenny
		if we made a trade, we'd be giving in to
		extortion, and nato would never trust us
		again.  we'll get clobbered in world
		opinion.

				the president
		it's a goddman trial balloon.  trial is
		the operative word, here.

				kenny
		then somebody'd better deny it publicly.

	the president turns around, heads over to the t.v.  kenny
	folds his arms, disgusted.

				the president
		jesus christ, o'donnell, you're the one
		saying we need to move forward on a
		political solution.

				kenny
		yeah, a good political solution.

	on the t.v.

	live coverage of the united nations security council
	meetings.  holding forth in russian is valerian zorin, 50s,
	tough, likeable, the soviet ambassador to the u.n. and
	chairman of the security council.  a translator relays the
	meaning.

				translator for zorin (o.s.)
		we call on the world to condemn the
		piratical actions of america...

	resume

	the president's jaw tightens.  he turns to kenny.

				the president
		you want to turn up the heat?  you call
		adlai.  tell him to stick it to zorin.
