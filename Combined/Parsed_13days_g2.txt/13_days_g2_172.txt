	ext. west wing driveway - day

	super: thursday, october 25th.  day 10.

	the west wing looms behind kenny and bundy.  kenny, poker
	faced, takes a drag on his cigarette.  bundy nervously flicks
	his, looks away from kenny a beat.

				bundy
		what did you think of lippman's column
		this morning?

				kenny
		i think it's a bad idea.

	bundy turns back to him.

				bundy
		thank god.  look, everyone is furious
		about it.  we trade away our missiles in
		turkey and we're fucked politically.

	kenny grinds his jaw, but doesn't say anything.  he agrees. 
	bundy steps up to him, confiding.

				bundy (cont'd)
		you gotta stop 'em.  we know it's jack
		and bobby's idea - they leaked it to
		lippman.  the military guys are going
		ape, and they're not alone.

				kenny
		then they should speak up.

				bundy
		christ, ken, you know it's not that
		easy.

				kenny
		yes it is.

				bundy
		no it isn't.  they don't trust the
		people that feel this way.  but these
		people are right.  and the kennedys are
		wrong.
			(beat)
		we need you to tell 'em, kenny.  they'll
		listen to you.

	kenny prickles, intense, but bundy presses on, too wrapped up
	in his own thinking to notice.

				bundy (cont'd)
		jack and bobby are good men.  but it
		takes a certain character, moral
		toughness to stand up to --

				kenny
		-- you listen to me.  nobody, nobody,
		talks about my friends that way.  you're
		fucking here right now because of the
		kennedys.  they may be wrong.  they make
		mistakes.  but they're not weak. 
		the weak ones are these 'people' who
		can't speak their own minds.

				bundy
		you know i don't mean they're weak.

	kenny gets in his face, intimidating.

				kenny
		no, they just lack 'moral toughness.' 
		and you think i'll play your judas.  you
		wasps and blue-bloods never understood
		us, thinking we want into your club. 
		well we got our own club now.
			(beat)
		and you guys don't realize fighting with
		each other is our way.  nobody plays us
		off each other.  and nobody ever gets
		between us...
