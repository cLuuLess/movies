	ext. news stand - night

	a cluster of college students talk at a news stand.  they're
	waiting for the newsie to cut the bands of the next day's
	washington post, the bundles just being thrown to the
	sidewalk from the delivery truck.  kenny approaches.

	in their thing beards, counter-culture clothes, the kids seem
	so young, kenny so old.  kenny buys a newspaper, its dire
	headlines, every story about the crisis.
