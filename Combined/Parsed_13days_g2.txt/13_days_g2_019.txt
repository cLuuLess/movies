	ext. hotel - day

	kenny heads down the steps with new york times washington
	bureau chief, scotty reston. anonymous, they weave their way
	through the crowd for a police car on a side street.

				reston
		how's my favorite president?

				kenny
		busy.  but you've got his heart.

				reston
		i want an hour with him.

				kenny
		i said his heart, not his attention.

				reston
		three weeks before midterm elections? 
		you need me.

				kenny
		well.  there is a new civil rights
		initiative he wants to talk about.

				reston
		i'm doing a piece on skybolt.  i hear
		macmillan's meeting with him in nassau.

	kenny just sighs as they make their way up to the police car. 
	a secret service agent opens the door for him, another is
	behind the wheel.

				kenny
		we're giving the brits polaris instead. 
		but a story'll just aggravate things.

	scotty stares at kenny, determined.  kenny looks away.  and
	his eye catches a tall, willowy beautiful woman.  she is
	talking, excited, embarrassed, to two more secret service
	agents.  what they're saying is lost in the noise.

	scotty follows kenny's gaze.  then the two men share a look,
	a silent understanding.  kenny glances at the secret service
	guy holding the car door, tilts his head at the woman.

				kenny (cont'd)
		not today.  he's got tight schedule.

	the agent nods, heads for the other agents and the beautiful
	woman.  scotty acts like nothing has happened.

				reston
		pretending there isn't a problem won't
		fix it.  he can clear the air on anglo
		american relations.

				kenny
		forget it, scotty.

				reston
		let him talk to me, he makes macmillan
		look good, i print it, the british
		public likes it, macmillan owes you.

	the formula's exactly what kenny wants to hear.  he pretends
	to consider, pretends to cave as he gets in the car.

				kenny
		all right, you're in.  half hour.

	reston's won.  but so has kenny, and he's made scotty feel
	tough in the bargain.  people like kenny.
