	int. ecker's crusader - day

	cuba, green and hazy, looms in the window.  ecker throws a
	series of switches.

				ecker
		start your camera checks.

	a mechanical whine accompanies the switch-throwing.  ecker
	pulls the trigger on his joystick and a thump thump thump
	hammers away.  there are green lights across his boards.

	one of the other pilots cuts in on the radio:

				pilot #3 (o.s.)
		failure.  all cameras.  sonofabitch. 
		film must not have fed.

				pilot #4 (o.s.)
		jesus!  shit!  oh shit!  i just shot it
		all, boss.  activator jammed open, its
		exposing everything now.

				wilhemy (o.s.)
		that's alright, lenny, it happens to
		most men at some time --

	ecker grimaces, but his voice stays cool.

				ecker
		-- scrub, you two.  get out of here. 
		still with me, bruce?

				wilhemy (o.s.)
		that's affirm.

	the two crusaders who've failed their camera checks break
	off.  and now cuba's hills, the havana sky line are right in
	front of them.
