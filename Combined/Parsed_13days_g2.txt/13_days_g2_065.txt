	ext. truman balcony - day

	kenny, bobby, and the president lean on the railing of the
	truman balcony, stare out at the city.

				bobby
		goddman stevenson.  jesus.  peace at any
		price.  you'd think nobody learned
		anything from world war two.

				the president
		somebody had to say it.  i respect adlai
		for having the guts to risk looking like
		an appeaser.

				bobby
		we have to pull him.  he's not going to
		be able to handle the soviets in front
		of the u.n.  zorin will eat him alive.

				the president
		we've got bigger problems right now.

				kenny
		we have to try the blockades.  it
		probably won't work.  it may just be
		delaying the inevitable.  but we can't
		just go to war without trying not to.

				the president
		i don't know.  i don't know.

	he stares out at the ellipse where a little-league football
	game sweeps across the grass, the shouts and screams of the
	children, so alive, floating to them on the wind.
