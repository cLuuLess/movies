	int. cabinet room - continuous

	the president, in shirtsleeves, no tie, glances up at kenny
	as he and bobby enter.  kenny can only bear his look for a
	second: he blew the call on fomin.  but the president is
	clearly relieved to see him, gives him a faint smile. 
	half of excom, including mcnamara, mccone, rusk, and taylor
	barely notice them as they're already there arguing.

	kenny sits down hurriedly, shucks off his coat as he joins
	the conversation in mid-stream.

				mccone
		my specialists are in agreement: this
		morning's letter is not khruschev.  last
		night's letter was.
			(beat)
		the evidence supports only one
		conclusion: there has been a coup, and
		khruschev was replaced overnight.

				kenny
		jesus christ...

	bobby gives him a look: told you things got worse.

				the president
		dean?

				rusk
		it doesn't necessarily mean there's been
		a coup.  khruschev's name is signed to
		the letter.

				mcnamara
		aw, come on, dean!

				rusk
		but at the very least... it does suggest
		he's been co-opted by hard line
		elements.

				mcnamara
		which at the end of the day is the same
		thing as a coup.  a puppet khruschev,
		and a hard-line soviet government
		pulling the strings.  no deal.  and the
		missiles are almost operational.

	bitter silence.  they all look to the president.  imminent
	victory has turned to ashes.  the president studies his own
	folded hands.  ball and thompson enter, take seats.  one by
	one, throughout the scene, other excom members join the
	group.

				the president
		you know, the problem we have is that
		this is latest offer of theirs will seem
		reasonable to everyone.  we remove our
		missiles, they remove theirs. 
		our jupiters were scheduled for removal
		anyway.  they're obsolete, after all.

	kenny shakes his head in mute anger.  mcnamara and rusk seem
	to sense the president's feelings, too.

				rusk
		mr. president, agreeing to such a trade
		would be tantamount to paying ransom. 
		they'll put a gun to our head again, and
		expect us to pay again.

	kenny looks the president in the eye.

				kenny
		we can't sell out one of our friends for
		our own safety.  nato wouldn't trust us
		anymore, and they'd be right not to.

	the president sighs in the face of the stern advice.  he
	nods, expecting as much.  bobby still can't look at anyone.

				the president
		so which one of you geniuses can tell me
		how to explain ourselves to the world? 
		how do we work with them if there's been
		a hard-line coup?

				general taylor
		mr. president, there is another
		possibility we haven't considered.  this
		may not be a coup at all.

	everyone of kenny's instincts jumps.  his head snaps up to
	listen to taylor.  taylor pauses.

				general taylor (cont'd)
		it's possible that the back-channel
		overture, last night's letter, and this
		letter today, along with everything the
		soviets have said all along, is nothing
		more than a lie -- disinformation.

				mcnamara
		designed to keep us from taking action.

	kenny hears the fatalism in mcnamara's voice.  a long beat. 
	everyone stares at mcnamara.

				mcnamara (cont'd)
		i hate to say it, but if i had to bet,
		i'd bet max is right.  what if they have
		no intention of honoring this deal,
		either? 
		then tomorrow they add another
		condition.  meanwhile, the quarantine
		isn't working and they're continuing to
		work on the missile sites.
			(beat)
		i think we have to consider issuing
		warning orders for our forces.

	they were so close last night... and suddenly lundahl and
	lemay enter the room with the day's briefing boards.

				lundahl
		mr. president...

	lundahl stands there at the end of the table, gray.  he
	almost can't say it, can't look the president in the face.

				lundahl (cont'd)
		this morning's photography is in.  it
		appears the soviets have commenced a
		crash program to ready the missiles.
