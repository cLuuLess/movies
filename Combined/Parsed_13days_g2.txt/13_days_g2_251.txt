	ext. soviet embassy - night

	the camera lifts away from the limo, turning toward the
	embassy, past the guards, past the brass plate which reads
	embassy of the united soviet socialist republics, up and up
	to the roof where black, reeking smoke billows from all of
	the embassy's several chimneys.

	the camera races into it.  it engulfs us all.
