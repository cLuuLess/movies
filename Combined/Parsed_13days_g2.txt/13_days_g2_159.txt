		even if they force it up, that sub will
		be inspected over the crews' dead
		bodies.  they'd be executed for allowing
		it when they got home.

	all eyes are on the president.  his eyes are closed tight,
	face gray, hand over his mouth.  the time of decision is at
	hand.  he lifts the phone once again.

				the president
		captain, force the sub to the surface
		for inspection.

				mcnamara (o.s.)
		mr. president!  we're receiving reports
		that the ships are stopping!

				the president
			(to phone)
		captain, belay that order!
			(to mcnamara)
		bob, where's that coming from!

				mcnamara (o.s.)
		just a second, mr. president.

				the president
		will somebody find out what's going on?!

	mccone jumps up, leaves the room.  the president looks at
	kenny, tense.  everyone holds their breath.

				rusk

	the hiss of static on the open line fills the room.  silence.
