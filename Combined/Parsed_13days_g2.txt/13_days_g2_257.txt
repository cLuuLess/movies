	int. bobby's office - continuous

	dobrynin listens impassively, as is his professional duty.

				bobby
		my brother, my friends, my countrymen
		and i cannot and will not permit those
		missiles to become operational.
			(beat)
		i promise you that.

	dobrynin looks out the window.  and then, pained, looks back
	at bobby.

				dobrynin
		then i fear our two nations will go to
		war.  and i fear where war will lead us.

	bobby acknowledges him with a nod.

				bobby
		if the missiles do not become
		operational, if you remove the missiles,
		then there will be no war.
			(beat)
		at this moment, the president is
		accepting the terms of secretary
		khruschev's letter of friday night.  if
		the soviet union halts construction
		immediately, removes the missiles, and
		submits to u.n. inspection, the united
		states will pledge to never invade cuba
		or aid others in that enterprise.

	dobrynin stares at bobby.  stares hard.

				dobrynin
		if your jupiter missiles in turkey were
		removed also, such an accommodation
		could be reached.

	the two men move their argument forward with the deliberation
	and formality of chess masters.

				bobby
			(tired sounding)
		the united states cannot agree to such
		terms under threat.  any belief to the
		contrary --
			(beat)
		-- was in error.

	dobrynin reels internally.  the only sign on his face is a
	slight tremor.  bobby looks up, registers the calculated
	effect.  and to dobrynin's horror, the russian believes:

				dobrynin
		you want war...

	but not so fast.  bobby folds his hands.  and he smoothly
	goes from hard-ass brinksman to sensitive deal-maker.

				bobby
		however, while there can be no quid pro
		quo on this issue, the united states can
		offer a private assurance.

	dobrynin holds his breath.

				bobby (cont'd)
		our jupiter missiles in turkey are
		obsolete, and have been scheduled for
		withdrawal for some time.  this
		withdrawal should be completed within,
		say, six months.

	dobrynin lets out his breath.

				bobby (cont'd)
		of course, any public disclosure of this
		assurance would negate the deal and
		produce the most stringent denials from
		our government.

	dobrynin grasps the move immediately, understanding the
	ramifications.  still he hesitates a moment.

				dobrynin
		this private assurance represents the
		word of the highest authority?

				bobby
		yes.

				dobrynin
		and it can be relayed beyond comrade
		khruschev's ears to the top circles of
		my government

				bobby
		of course.  our pledge can be relayed to
		any government official secretary
		khruschev sees fit to satisfy.

	meaning this is the bone he can show the hard line.  dobrynin
	struggles internally, knowing what bobby has done, wanting to
	hug him.  it comes across as agitation.

				bobby (cont'd)
		with the caveat that it is not made
		public in any way, shape or form.
			(beat)
		and we must have an answer tomorrow at
		the latest.  i cannot stress this point
		enough.

				dobrynin
		tomorrow...

				bobby
		tomorrow...

	dobrynin rises from his chair.  bobby rises with him.

				dobrynin
		then you must excuse me and permit me to
		relay the substance of our discussion to
		my superiors.

	dobrynin heads for the door.  half way there he turns back to
	bobby, deeply moved.  deeply grateful.

				dobrynin (cont'd)
		we have heard stories that some among
		your military men wish for war.
			(beat)
		you are a good man.  your brother is a
		good man.  i assure you there are other
		good men.  let us hope the will of good
		men is enough to counter the terrible
		strength of this thing which has been
		put in motion.
