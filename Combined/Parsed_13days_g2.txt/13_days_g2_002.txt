	a simple camera, snapping away furiously in the hands of a
	giggling mark o'donnell, 4.  he's straddling and in the face
	of his dad, kenny o'donnell, 30's, tough, boston-irish, with
	a prodigious case of morning hair.  kenny awakens, red-eyed.

		mark, get off your father!

	kenny sits up to the morning bedlam of the o'donnell house.

	kids screech, doors bang all over.  kenny pushes mark over,
	rolls out of bed, snatches up the corners of the blanket and
	hoists mark over his shoulder in a screaming, kicking bundle.
