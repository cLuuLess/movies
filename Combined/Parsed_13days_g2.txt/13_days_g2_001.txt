	ext. stratosphere - day

	the glory of stratospheric dawn.  the engines of a silver
	lockheed u-2f rasp upon the trace oxygen here at 72,500 feet. 
	scattered cloud formations hang over the blue brilliance of
	sea far, far below.  in the haze, the looming edge of land.

	super: flight g-3101. october 14th, 1962. over cuba.

	the spy plane's camera doors whine open.  the glassy eye of
	the 36-inch camera focuses.  and then with a
	bangbangbangbang, its high-speed motor kicks in, shutter
	flying.
