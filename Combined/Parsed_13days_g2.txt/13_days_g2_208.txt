	int. cabinet room - night

	kenny slams a page of khruschev's letter on the table.  he
	jabs his finger at it.  excom listens, intent.

				kenny
		it's ten pages of sentimental fluff, but
		he's saying right here.  he'll remove
		the missiles in return for a no-invasion
		pledge.  it looks like fomin's overture
		was genuine.

	the president turns to mccone.

				mccone
		our early analysis says this was
		probably written by khruschev himself. 
		it's a first draft, and shows no signs
		of being polished by the foreign
		ministry.  in fact, it probably hasn't
		been approved by the politburo.  they
		wouldn't have let the emotionalism go
		by.  the analysts say it was written by
		someone under considerable stress.

	excom chuckles.

				the president
		glad to hear we're not alone.

	the president eyes the excom members one by one, an incipient
	smile on his face.

				the president (cont'd)
		well, gentlemen, i wasn't planning on
		invading cuba anyway.  i think we can
		live with the terms of this deal.

	there are mostly nods of assent, big smiles around the table. 
	except from  mccone and taylor.  the president takes his copy
	of the letter, flips through it.  he shakes his head, almost
	unable to believe that khruschev has given in.  a long beat.

				the president (cont'd)
		ted, i want you to draft our acceptance.
