	int. oval office - night

	the camera picks up the darkened windows: the meeting has
	gone long.  the camera moves past kenny and sorensen standing
	in the doorway to kenny's office, finds the president in his
	chair across from gromyko on the sofa.  rusk, ambassador
	anatoly dobrinyn, and two interpreters around them.

				the president
		so that there should be no
		misunderstanding, the position of the
		united states, which has been made clear
		by the attorney general to ambassador
		dobrynin here, i shall read a sentence
		from my own statement to the press dated
		september 13th.
			(beat, reading)
		should missiles or offensive weapons be
		placed in cuba, it would present the
		gravest threat to u.s. national
		security.

	the president stares at gromyko as the translator finishes
	translating.  gromyko sits there, enigmatic, cold,
	unreadable.  the translator finishes, and gromyko stops him
	with a gesture so he can answer in his own accented english.

				gromyko
		mr. president, this will never be done. 
		you need not be concerned.

	the president hides his fury masterfully, and gazing over his
	glasses, asks:

				the president
		so i do not misunderstand you: there are
		no offensive weapons in cuba.

	a beat.  and gromyko's response is flat, sure, steady:

				gromyko
		no, mr. president.  we have sent
		defensive weapons only to cuba.

	kenny's blazing eyes could drill holes in the back of
	gromyko's head.  his gaze swings to the president's desk.

	beneath the desk sit the briefing boards with the evidence.
