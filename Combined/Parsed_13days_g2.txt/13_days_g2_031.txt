	ext. missile site - los palacios, cuba - day

	the sweltering cuban countryside.  shouting soviet rocket
	troops, stripped to the waist, glistening with sweat, machete
	a clearing under scattered, limp palm trees.

		our analysis at npic indicates the
		soviet union has followed its
		conventional weapons build-up in cuba
		with the introduction of surface-to
		surface medium-range ballistic missiles,
		or mrbms.  our official estimate at this
		time is that this missile system is the
		ss-4 sandal.  we do not believe these
		missiles are as yet operational.

	a bulldozer tears through the undergrowth.  filling the
	screen.  a 70-foot long missile transporter creeps along in
	the bulldozer's wake like a vast hearse with its shrouded
	cargo.
