	int. kenny's office - day

	kenny, phone to his ear, suffers as bobby harangues him.

				bobby
		adlai's too weak!  we have to convince
		jack to pull him, get mccloy in there.

				kenny
		you can't take him out this late in the
		game.

				bobby
		zorin will eat him alive!

				kenny
		then talk to your brother, goddamn it. 
		the two of you don't need any advice to
		get into trouble.

				bobby
		what's gotten into you?

	kenny throws the lippman article at him.

				bobby (cont'd)
		oh, still sore about this.

				kenny
		something your father would've come up
		with.

	silence.  terrible silence.  that paralyzes bobby.  kenny
	stares at him.  he means it, but regrets it, too.

				bobby
		my father --

				kenny
		-- i'm just trying to make a point. 
		this idea is that fucking bad.

	but bobby gets it.  kenny shifts gears, lets it go.

				kenny (cont'd)
		adlai can handle zorin.  he knows the
		inning and the score.

				bobby
		he better.  because nobody thinks he's
		up to this.  nobody.
