	int. bobby's waiting room - night

	and a door shuts oc like a threshold of history.  hold on
	bobby's waiting room.  silent.  cavernous.  dim.  plush
	carpet.  heavy drapes framing dark windows.  and abandoned
	secretary's desk.  a row of sofas and chairs on either side
	of the room.  two doorways, one at either end of the room.

	a woman sits in one of the chairs for visitors.  dressed in
	gray.  prim.  but beautiful.  a secretary of some sort.

	one of the double doors to the hall swings silently open. 
	kenny glides in.  he sees the other door shut at the far end
	of the room.  kenny crashes in one of the chairs to wait.

	hold on the scene, motionless, silent.

	kenny whistles two notes.  stops.  and then he begins to
	whistle the irish tune, o'donnell aboo.  he gets a bar into
	it -- and there's a polite, soft cough.

	kenny stops.  then notices the woman in gray across the room. 
	he didn't see her.  it's dim over there.  she looks at him,
	expressionless.

	the camera finds: a pin on her lapel.  a red hammer and
	sickle.

	kenny reacts.  dobrynin's assistant?  his opposite number?  a
	friend?  or more than a friend?

	here is the face of the enemy.  not a smile between them. 
	kenny resumes his ease.  and begins to whistle again.

	the haunting irish song echoes in the vaulted ceiling,
	filling the dim room.  strange, sad, beautiful.  the woman
	listens.  and her face begins to soften.  

	kenny stares at the dark, lonely windows, his song striving
	to fill the empty room.

	kenny sinks deeper in the chair, his tune all-consuming...
	and the woman's voice breaks in.  kenny stops, looks over. 
	her voice is tremulous and beautiful.  just a snatch of some
	song in russian.  she stops, awkward.

	kenny stares.  the woman stares back.  no smiles.  but in
	their eyes, they each see the other's fear, the other's
	beauty, the other's humanity.

	so this is the enemy.

				the woman
		who are you?

	kenny glances to the door.  he considers for a long moment.

				kenny
		the friend.

	kenny breaks the gaze.  he begins to whistle again.  the
	camera drifts away, finding the far door to the inner office,
	kenny's tune stronger, carrying with it hope...
