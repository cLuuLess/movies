	int. oval office - day

	kenny, bobby, mcnamara, rusk, bundy and half of excom stand
	to the side of the room.  general sweeney and lemay stand in
	front of the president's desk.

	the president, bowed in the window, is care-worn, a thousand
	years old.  the shadow, the composition of the shot tells us
	all.  it's down to what's in the heart of one man.  kenny is
	deeply moved at his friend's gethsemane.

				the president
		cam, can you guarantee me you'll get all
		the missiles?

	sweeney glances at lemay.  lemay's stern, frozen look wills
	him to say, very simply, "yes."

	but then the president turns around, looks sweeney in the
	eye.  it would make machiavelli himself tell the truth.

				general sweeney
		sir, i can guarantee we'll get all the
		missiles we know about.

	the president holds sweeney in his gaze.  thank you.

				lemay
		mr. president, we can get better than
		ninety percent of them.

	the president doesn't respond to lemay's last-ditch appeal. 
	ninety-percent isn't good enough with nuclear weapons.  he
	moves to his desk, signs a paper, hands it to general
	sweeney.

				the president
		as of seven o'clock monday night, all
		united states armed forces world wide
		will stand up to defcon 3.
