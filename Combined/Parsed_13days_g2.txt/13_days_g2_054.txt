	int. west wing hallway - night

	kenny emerges from his office.  the soviet delegation
	disappears down the hallway with rusk.  kenny turns as bobby,
	haggard, comes up from the other direction.

	bobby gestures to the vanishing delegation, now being
	harangued oc by the press.

				bobby
		what happened?

	the president comes out of the next door down the hall, the
	oval office.  he turns and sees kenny and bobby.  he's livid.

				the president
		lying bastard.  lied to my face.

				bobby
		we're split down the middle.  if i held
		a vote i think airstrike would beat
		blockade by a vote or two.

				the president
		i want a consensus, bobby.  consensus. 
		either air strike or blockade. 
		something everyone'll stand by even if
		they don't like it.  i need it by
		saturday.  make it happen.

				bobby
		what if i can't?

				kenny
		we go into this split, the russians will
		know it.  and they'll use it against us.

	the prospect disturbs the three men.

				the president
		have you cancelled chicago and the rest
		of the weekend yet?

				kenny
		you don't show for chicago, everyone'll
		know there's something going on.

				the president
		i don't care.  cancel it.

				kenny
		no way.

	the president spins on him, unsure he heard correctly.

				kenny (cont'd)
		i'm not calling and cancelling on daly. 
		you call and cancel on daly.

				the president
		you're scared to cancel on daly.

				kenny
		damn right i'm scared.

	the president pauses, looks at bobby.  bobby shakes his head:
	don't look at me.

				the president
		well, i'm not.

				bobby
		then you'll call, right?
