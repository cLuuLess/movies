	int. oval office - night

	kenny enters from his office, finding bobby, rusk and
	sorensen talking with the president.  the president gives him
	a brief, meaningful look.

				rusk
		whatever response we send, it will take
		several hours for the wire to be
		received by our embassy and delivered to
		the kremlin.  so we're looking at early
		tomorrow morning at the earliest before
		khruschev could respond.

	as rusk talks, kenny passes close by bobby.  bobby whispers:

				bobby
		he gets it, but he's pissed.

				the president
		that's all well and good, but what do we
		say to 'em?

				sorensen
		it depends on if we really believe
		there's been a coup.

	that strikes a cord with kenny.

				kenny
		i agree.  if there has been a coup, and
		there's a hard-line government in power
		now, then it doesn't matter what we say. 
		the end of the day we'll either agree to
		their terms, they'll agree to ours, or
		we'll go to war.  but what if there
		hasn't been a coup?  what if... what if
		what is happening is a series of
		accidents?

				sorensen
		the second letter is an accident?

				kenny
		no.  the letter is an intentional, but
		it's having an effect far greater than
		its authors intended.
			(beat)
		what if our jupiter missiles are just a
		last minute haggle to salvage something? 
		maybe a bone khruschev is throwing to
		the hard line, not really caring if we
		reject it or not?
			(beat)
		and then these accidents have happened.

				bobby
		making the second letter and the overall
		picture look worse than it really is.

				sorensen
		the guns of august.

				kenny
		exactly.
			(beat)
		if they're sane and human like we are,
		then maybe we just refuse, and they'll
		let it slide, like we've been letting
		things slide.

				sorensen
		so we reject the second letter.

	and kenny looks at bobby.  the world stops.

				kenny
		no.  we don't reject it...

	it hits bobby like a lightning bolt.

				bobby
		... we accept the first letter and
		pretend the second doesn't exist.

	the president, rusk and sorensen stare at him, mute.
