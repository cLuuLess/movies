	int. white house - situation room - day

	kenny's watch reads one minute til ten o'clock.  pull back to
	reveal:

	kenny, standing just inside the open doors to the white house
	situation room, a state-of-the-art conference room.  a long,
	central table surrounded by leather chairs with phones and
	screens built in.  t.v. monitors hang from the ceilings in
	the corners.  there are no windows, just oppressive bunker
	like walls.  it's far underground.

	across the room the president paces, phone in hand.  half of
	excom is in their seats.  the other half, along with a steady
	stream of duty officers, are coming and going.  kenny steps
	aside for a duty officer, listens to the president.

				the president
		okay, bob, i'm putting you on intercom.

	suddenly, mcnamara's voice fills the room.

				mcnamara (o.s.)
		hey, guys, can you hear me?
