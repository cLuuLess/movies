	int. u.n. security council chambers - continuous

	adlai presses on.

				adlai
		and i'm prepared to present the evidence
		in this room, proving that the soviet
		union has lied to the world.

	and zorin cracks.  he looks uneasily to his delegation.  they
	bend forward to consult.  adlai sits back in his chair,
	draping his arms over its wings with the confidence of
	someone who knows he's kicked ass.

	adlai looks around the room while he's waiting for his
	answer, managing not to smile.  the diplomatic world is
	scandalized.  at last zorin regroups, lifts his head from his
	huddle.

				zorin
		if you do not choose to continue your
		statement, the chair recognizes the
		representative from chile.

	the chilean delegate stands.

				chilean delegate
		i yield my time and the floor to the
		representative to the united states.

	the room explodes in laughter.  not just nervous any more,
	not just polite.  they're laughing at zorin's parliamentary
	ploy blowing up in his face. 
	zorin's smile is gone, his smooth facade destroyed.  and he
	looks like the biggest fool in the world.

	adlai stares at the beet-faced man with disdain.  at last,
	adlai stands, gestures to the door to the hall behind him.

	the photo interpreters come racing in with their briefing
	boards.

				adlai
		well then, ladies and gentlemen, since
		it appears we might be here for a while,
		shall we have a look at what the soviets
		are doing in cuba?

	the delegates rumble in interest, rise from their seats to
	approach adlai.
