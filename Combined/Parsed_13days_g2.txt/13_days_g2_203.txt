	int. oval office - day

	off their reactions, the camera finds an under-strength, ad
	hoc excom - kenny, bobby, taylor, bundy, sorensen, mccone,
	ball and the president.  guarded hope all around.  the short,
	balding, pugnacious scali looks discomfited.

				scali
		i have lunch with him maybe once a
		month.  way he talks, he acts like he
		knows khruschev personally, but he's
		never elaborated.  i've used him as a
		source in a couple of stories.

	kenny paces behind the gathered men around the president's
	desk, listening, mind going a million miles an hour.

				rusk
		the fbi has identified this alexander
		fomin as the soviet resident, the kgb
		equivalent of one of our station chiefs. 
		he's their highest ranking spy in this
		country.  and he knows john's a friend
		of mine.

				bundy
		all the trademarks of a back-channel
		overture.

	kenny eyes bundy, makes him uncomfortable.  the president
	sizes scali up.

				the president
		so they'll remove the missiles, and
		we'll pledge not to invade cuba,
		destabilize castro or assist anyone who
		plans in doing so...

	nobody dares speak.  it's as if the possibility of a
	settlement will vanish into thin air if anyone moves.

				bobby
		i think... this may be our first real
		message from khruschev.

				mccone
		the alternative, mr. president, is that
		this could be a trap.

				kenny
		dangle a settlement, tie us down in
		negotiations, we come up short...

				mccone
		why else would they approach us in this
		way?  it's deniable.  the soviets have
		done nothing but lie to us.  this could
		be more of the same.

				kenny
		that may be why khruschev's introducing
		this guy.  we've been burned by his
		usual players in the formal channels, so
		he brings in an honest broker.

				mccone
		that may be what they want us to think.

				rusk
		the truth is, mr. president, we don't
		even really know whom fomin speaks for. 
		it could be khruschev. it could be some
		faction in the politburo or the kgb
		itself.  we just don't know.

				bobby
		by the way, scali, your activities now
		fall under the secrecy codicils of the
		national security act.  sorry, no
		pulitzer.

	the gathered men chuckle, only scali a bit dour but being a
	good sport about it.  scali checks his watch.

				scali
		mr. president, we don't have much time. 
		i'm supposed to meet with him again in
		three and a half hours.

				the president
		well, it seems the question of the day
		is -- is the offer legitimate?

	he moves away from his desk.  the men watch him.

				the president (cont'd)
		if it is... if it is, then we can't
		afford to ignore it.
			(beat, to scali)
		john, we'll have instructions for you in
		a couple of hours.

	scali nods.  rusk escorts him out.  they wait until the door
	closes.  taylor looks over at mccone who nods.

				general taylor
		mr. president, i'm afraid we have some
		bad news.  we're getting gmaic estimates
		from our latest low-level overflights. 
		it appears the missiles are two to three
		days away from operational status.

				mccone
		so we don't have much time to play out
		back-channel communiques.

	kenny gives bobby a hard look.  the president appears
	unfazed.

				general taylor
		the quarantine, sir, is not producing
		results.  the chiefs feel it's time you
		take another look at our options.

	the president considers taylor, then looks over to kenny.

				the president
		kenny, get over to your old stomping
		grounds.  go through everything the fbi
		has on fomin.  i need your best call: is
		this guy legit and is he speaking for
		khruschev?  and i need you to tell me by
		the time i call you, because right after
		i call you, i'm calling scali with his
		instructions.
