		...i regard with respect and trust the
		statement you made in your message of 27
		october 1962 that there would be no
		attack, no invasion of cuba, and not
		only the part of the united states, but
		also on the part of the western
		hemisphere, as you said in your same
		message.  then the motives which induced
		us to render assistance of such a kind
		to cuba disappear...

	kennedy, greeting well-wishers, a brilliant smile on his
	face, is carried through the crowd toward kenny and the doors

		...it is for this reason that we have
		instructed our officers - these
		missiles, as i already informed you are
		in the hands of soviet officers to take
		appropriate measures to discontinue
		construction, dismantle them, and return
		them to the soviet union.
