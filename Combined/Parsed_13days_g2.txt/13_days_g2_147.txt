	ext. catholic church - night

	kenny, newspaper under his arm, continues down the street. 
	up ahead, the lights are on in a catholic church.  lines of
	churchgoers are at the door.  kenny stops, surprised at the
	sight this late.  and then he sees the hand-painted banner:
	confessions 24 hours.  pray for peace.

	kenny is moved.  he glances over his shoulder, and then...
	joins the line himself.
