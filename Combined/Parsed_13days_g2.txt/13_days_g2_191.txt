	int. u.n. security council chambers - continuous

	zorin shoots adlai a testy look.

				zorin
		i am not in an american courtroom, sir,
		and therefore i do not wish to answer a
		question that is put to me in the
		fashion in which a prosecutor puts
		questions.  in due course, sir, you will
		have your answer.

	there's laughter at zorin's refusal to be bullied: but it's
	nervous laughter, not the polite stuff of diplomatic tete-a
	tete.  the rumble in the room grows louder.

				adlai
		you are in the courtroom of world
		opinion right now, and you can answer
		yes or no.  you have denied they exist,
		and i want to know if i have understood
		you correctly.
