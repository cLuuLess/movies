	int. flag plot - the pentagon - continuous

	anderson gets in mcnamara's face. 

				admiral anderson
		that ship was firing starshells. 
		starshells.  flares, mr. secretary.

	everyone's eyes are on the two men.  only the chatter of
	teletype breaks the paralyzing silence.  mcnamara blinks,
	looks down at the plot on the floor.  anderson's voice drops
	to a deadly sotto.

				admiral anderson (cont'd)
		goddammitt, i've got a job to do. 
		you've been camped out up there since
		monday night.  you're exhausted and
		you're making mistakes.  interfere with
		me, you will get some of killed.  i will
		not allow that.

	mcnamara looks away at the faces of the men in the room.

				mcnamara
		starshells.

				admiral anderson
		get out of our way, mr. secretary.  the
		navy has been running blockades since
		the days of john paul jones.

	mcnamara turns back.  and all trepidation, embarrassment,
	hesitation are gone.  he coldly appraises anderson.

				mcnamara
		i believe the president made it clear
		that there would be no firing on ships
		without his express permission.  

				admiral anderson
		with all due respect, mr. secretary, we
		were not firing on the ship.  firing on
		a ship means attacking the ship.  we
		were not attacking the ship.  we were
		firing over it.

				mcnamara
		this was not the president's intention
		when he gave that order.  what if the
		soviets don't see the distention?  what
		if they make the same mistake i just
		did?
			(beat)
		there will be no firing anything near
		any soviet ships without my express
		permission, is that understood, admiral?

				admiral anderson
		yes, sir.

				mcnamara
		and i will only issue such instructions
		when ordered to by the president.
			(beat)
		john paul jones... you don't understand
		a thing, do you, admiral?

	he passes his hand over the enormous plot below.

				mcnamara (cont'd)
		this isn't a blockade.

	mcnamara, trembling with anger, awe, whirls to anderson.  and
	his burgeoning insight is born - clear, hard and cold.

				mcnamara (cont'd)
		this, all this, is language, a new
		vocabulary the likes of which the world
		has never seen. 
		this is president kennedy communicating
		with secretary khruschev.

	mcnamara jabs his finger out at the plot, and --

	-- the camera races down, tracking over it, across the vast
	ebb and flow of information, the delicate ballet of symbols
	and numerology, this language of steel and human life.
