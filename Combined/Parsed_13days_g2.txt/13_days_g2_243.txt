	he reaches the edge of the open field.  and then he spots the
	name on the jersey: o'donnell.  it's kevin. the players
	relinquish the ball and the offense comes off the field. 
	kevin sees his dad.

				kevin
		hey!  dad!

	kenny manages a smile as kevin trots over.  kevin pulls his
	helmet off.  they stand there a long beat, kenny desperate to
	take him up, abandon his post... but he doesn't.

				kenny
		hey, sport.  you winning?

				kevin
		yeah.

	but kevin sees the turmoil in his father's face.

				kevin (cont'd)
		is everything going to be okay, dad?

	kenny's forced smile is answer enough.

				kenny
		yeah, kev.  everything's gonna be fine.

	but kevin knows.  together they know.  the end of the world
	is at hand.

				kevin
		i guess you won't be coming home
		tonight.

				kenny
		i, uh...

	suddenly a car honks.  kenny turns around.  bobby is leaning
	out the rear passenger window of his limo.  and he sees what
	kenny is doing.  he doesn't want to cut in, but has to.

				bobby
		kenny!  we need to talk.

	kenny looks back at his son.

				kenny
		get back out there, kid.  remember to
		hit 'em hard.

				kevin
		what about you?  where are you going?

				kenny
		back to work.

	kevin puts his helmet back on his head.  kenny watches as
	kevin jogs off to rejoin his team.  kenny turns his back on
	his son, and strides for bobby's limo, dying inside.
