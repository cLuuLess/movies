	int. u.n. security council chambers - continuous

	adlai fixes zorin in his seat, his voice rising.

				adlai
		mr. zorin, i remind you that the other
		day you did not deny the existence of
		these weapons.  but today, again, if i
		heard you correctly, you now say they do
		not exist.

	zorin, headphones on, listens to his own translation, but
	doesn't respond, acts bored.  it gets adlai's goat, and he
	begins to lose his cool.  a rumble from the u.n.  the camera
	finds adlai's hand shaking, gripping his pen.
