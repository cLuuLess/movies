	int. kenny's office - continuous

	kenny's office is a raging beehive of activity.  kenny works
	the phone as assistants come and go with files.

				kenny
			(to phone, scary calm)
		listen to me, you worthless piece of
		disloyal shit.  you will pull daly's man
		on the circuit.  you owe your goddamn
		job to this administration.
			(beat, listening)
		there is a word you need to learn.  it
		is the only word in politics.  loyalty. 
		loyalty you motherfucking piece of shit!

	as kenny throws the phone down at the receiver, and the
	private door to the oval office suddenly opens.  kenny
	glances up.  president kennedy stands there in the doorway. 
	kenny thinks he's reacting to the tirade.

				kenny (cont'd)
		what're you looking at?  this isn't the
		blessed order of st. mary the meek.

	kenny stops.

				kenny (cont'd)
		excuse us.

	the assistants leave, shutting the door after them.  kenny
	rises.

				the president
		i think you should come in here.

	kenny starts for the door.

				the president (cont'd)
		still think cuba isn't important?

				kenny
		not as far as the election goes.

	the president lets kenny by into...
