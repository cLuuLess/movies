	int. cabinet room - day

	excom laughing, celebrating, half-drunk already this sunday
	morning.  the president shushes the group.

				the president
		hey!  hey.  okay, that's enough.

	the group quiets down.  the presidents stares at them, calm,
	firm.  they sober up quickly.  kenny listens, expectant.

				the president (cont'd)
		i don't want any gloating.  this is not
		a victory over the soviets.  it's a
		victory with the soviets.
			(beat)
		i want everyone to remember that.
