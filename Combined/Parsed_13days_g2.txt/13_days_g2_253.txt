	int. hall outside bobby's office - night

	bobby's staffers greet them as they stride down the hall,
	staffer #1 taking bobby's coat.

				staffer #1
		sir, ambassador dobrynin is already
		here.  we have him waiting in your
		office.

	they reach the double oak doors to bobby's suite and stop. 
	bobby faces kenny.

				kenny
		i'll whistle up some luck for you.

	and before kenny's eyes, all of bobby's doubt vanishes.  in
	its place, a severe confidence.  a grandeur kenny has never
	seen.

	it makes kenny pause.  he beholds his best friend become a
	man of the ages.  and then bobby smoothly opens the door.
