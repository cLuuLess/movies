	int. oval office - later

	the oval office has emptied out.  only kenny, bobby, sorensen
	and the president remain.  the president looks out the
	window, sorensen sits in a chair in front of the desk.  bobby
	and kenny sit on the edge of the desk.

				the president
		last summer i read a book.  the guns of
		august.  i wish every man on that
		blockade line had read that book.

	the president moves over to the globe by his desk, spins it,
	stopping in on europe.

				the president (cont'd)
		world war one.  thirteen million killed
		all because the militaries of both
		alliances were so highly attuned to each
		other's movements and dispositions,
		afraid of letting the other guy have a
		theoretical advantage.  and your man in
		the field, his family at home, couldn't
		even tell you the reasons why their
		lives were being sacrificed.
			(beat)
		why couldn't they stop it?

	can we?  the president's fingers turn the globe.  it stops on
	north america.  kenny and bobby listen.

				the president (cont'd)
		and here we are, fifty years later.  one
		of their ships resists the inspection. 
		we shoot out its rudder and board.  they
		shoot down our planes in response.  we
		bomb their anti-aircraft sites in
		response to that.  they attack berlin. 
		we invade cuba.  they fire their
		missiles.  we fire ours.

	the president sets the globe gently spinning and walks away.
