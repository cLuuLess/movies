		i don't think you understand me
		correctly.  you are not to get shot down
		under any circumstances.  whatever
		happens up there, you were not shot at. 
		mechanical failures are fine; crashing
		into mountains, fine.  but you and your
		men are not to be shot at, fired at,
		launched upon.
