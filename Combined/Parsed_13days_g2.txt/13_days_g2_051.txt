	int. west wing hall - day

	kenny comes out of the bathroom, and is buttonholed by the
	crewcut, bullet-headed press secretary, pierre salinger, in
	the crowded, busy hallway.

				salinger
		kenny, i'm getting funny questions from
		the guys in the press office.  as press
		secretary, i need to know.  what's going
		on?

	kenny wheels back into his office.  it's filled with people. 
	but he bends confidentially to pierre's ear.

				kenny
		they're planning to shave you bald next
		time you fall asleep on the bus.
			(off pierre's get-serious look)
		sorry, pierre, gromyko just arrived.
