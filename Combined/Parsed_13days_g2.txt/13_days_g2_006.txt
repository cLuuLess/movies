	ext. steuart building - day

	a u.s. navy truck lurches to a stop in front of the run-down,
	brick-faced seven-story steuart building on 5th and k.  rear
	doors bang open, and out hop two marine guards, side arms
	drawn, film canisters in a carrying case between them.

	super:  national photographic interpretation center
	(npic), washington d.c.

	as the marines approach the building, front doors slam open.
