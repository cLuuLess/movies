	int. west wing - hall outside press office - day

	kenny moves hard and fast through the twisting warren of
	hallways and tiny offices which is the west wing.  suddenly,
	scotty reston pops out of a doorway behind kenny.

				reston
		hey, kenny!  who died?

	kenny glances over his shoulder at scotty who points to a
	window.  a beat, then kenny returns to look out the window. 
	outside, the west wing drive is filled with limousines.

	a flash of dismay, but kenny covers fast.

				kenny
		way it's going, the democratic party. 
		dnc strategy session.  if you can call
		it that.

	scotty chuckles.  kenny moves off, leading him away.  kenny's
	assistant runs up behind him, holding out a slip of paper.

				assistant
		sir?

	kenny tries to look him away.

				reston
		it's tuesday.  you said to call.  when
		do i get my 45 minutes?

				kenny
		tell you what.  we're in connecticut
		tomorrow for ribicoff.  i'll get you up
		front with him during the flight.

				reston
		deal.

				assistant
		sir.

	kenny turns, harsh

				kenny
		what is it?

	the assistant eyes scotty, holds his tongue.  kenny takes the
	slips.

				assistant
		the number you asked for.

				kenny
		i ask for a lot of 'em.  whose is it?

				assistant
		dean acheson's, sir.

	that shuts kenny up.  reston eyes the slip, then looks to
	kenny's face.  and he knows something isn't right here.

				kenny
		gotta go, scotty.  see you tomorrow.
