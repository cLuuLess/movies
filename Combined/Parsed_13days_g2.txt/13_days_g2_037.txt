	int. treasury building garage - night

	a car jolts to a stop.  the camera pans up over the sagging
	suspension, the government plates, the hood ornament
	revealing half of excom inside.  kenny stands nearby waiting
	for them.

	the doors open, and out they pile like a bunch of clowns:
	bobby, mcnamara, rusk, ball, martin, dioptric, sorensen,
	stevenson, and nitze.  they're sitting in each others' laps,
	banging their heads on the roof, joking, but tense.

				bobby
		screw secrecy.  you try having that fat
		ass sit on your lap all the way from
		foggy bottom.

				mcnamara
		you were excited.  i say no more.

	the gang falls in behind kenny, trails him out of the garage.
