	int. ecker's crusader - day

	the ocean shrieks past so close you can see the white foam. 
	ecker checks the altimeter: 150 feet.

	a small fishing boat looms ahead, its net booms reaching up
	like tree limbs.  the crusader rockets over it.

	ecker checks his instruments.  out the window, the other
	crusaders thunder over the water, past sailboats, cabin
	cruisers, the small-craft traffic outside key west.  the
	speed sucks the breath away.

				ecker
		go to military throttle on my mark. 
		three...two...one... mark.

	his airspeed indicator spins up to 400 knots.  and then his
	radio suddenly crackles:

				pilot #1 (o.s.)
		flameout flameout!

				pilot #2 (o.s.)
		shit!  me too!

				ecker
		get some altitude!

	two of the crusaders pull up, away from the water.

				pilot #1 (o.s.)
		oh, god damn.  got it restarted.

				pilot #2 (o.s.)
		yeah.  yeah.  me too.  goddamn fuel.

				pilot #1 (o.s.)
		sir, i don't think she's gonna hold up
		for the run.

				ecker
		affirmative.  you two get out of here.
