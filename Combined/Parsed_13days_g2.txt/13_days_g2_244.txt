	ext. sans souci parking lot - day

	kenny and bobby stand by their car off to one side of the
	restaurant's parking lot.  bobby's secret service agents
	maintain a discreet distance.

				kenny
		if we're going to make a deal, we're
		going to have to do it fast.  this is
		only getting out of control.  the only
		reason we're not at war this very minute
		is he's been able to stretch, bend and
		break his own rules.  he won't be able
		to keep it up forever.

	bobby jams the last bit of sandwich in his mouth.  a beat. 
	kenny looks him in the eye.

				bobby
		and?

				kenny
		and jack wants to trade the missiles in
		turkey.

				bobby
		the jupiters are obsolete.  they were
		supposed to have been dismantled last
		summer anyway --

				kenny
		-- jesus, mary and joseph.  i told you
		how stupid it was to float the lippman
		article!  but you wouldn't listen to me. 
		what if there hasn't been a coup at all? 
		what if it's you two who invited that
		second letter by raising the possibility
		of a trade?

	bobby is speechless with rage.

				kenny (cont'd)
		and if the two of you are thinking this
		trade is your ace in the hole, you're so
		wrong.  it's a deuce.

	bobby's beyond furious.  they catch their rising voices.

				kenny (cont'd)
		and it's not just me who thinks that. 
		everyone on this so-called excom is
		telling you exactly the same thing: make
		the trade, and they're going to force us
		into trade after trade until finally
		they demand something we won't trade
		like berlin, and we do end up in a war.
			(beat)
		not to mention, that long before that
		happens, this government will be
		politically dead.

	bobby simmers for a long beat, thinking.  and boy, does this
	guy hate admitting he's wrong.

				bobby
		all right, so maybe we overestimated how
		reasonable this trade would look.  okay? 
		you happy?  so now what?

				kenny
		so now you've got to talk him out of it. 
		and then we've got to figure out an
		acceptable political solution.

				bobby
		and if there has been a coup and there
		is no acceptable political solution?

	kenny stares off at the city, agonized.
