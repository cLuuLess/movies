	int. west wing hallway - day

	kenny rounds a corner.  mcnamara, bundy and mccone are
	talking, excited, hushed, standing to one side, down the
	hall.  kenny eyes them as he draws closer, and then they
	notice he's approaching.  bundy nods him over, confidential.

				bundy
		we've been talking.  we can play this
		big in '64.  it's the foreign policy
		trophy we've been waiting.

	kenny sickens.  he tries to listen, but it all begins to
	blur.

				bundy (cont'd)
		i think we can ride it all the way home
		next election.  bet you're way ahead of
		us, eh?

	bundy slaps kenny on the back.  kenny is pale.  is what
	they're saying possible?  but bundy and mccone are too
	wrapped up in their schemes to notice kenny's distress.

				mccone
		we've ordered crash reassessment of our
		major geopolitical hotspots.  we've got
		a lot of new clout, and we can run the
		table on the soviets.  middle east,
		southeast asia...

	and kenny, sad, moved beyond all pity and loathing, realizes
	it is possible.  they haven't gotten it.  he is speechless,
	helplessly shaking his head.  bundy finally sees something
	isn't right with him.

				mcnamara
		what's wrong, o'donnell?

	kenny can't speak.  can't find the words.  but tongue-tied
	finally manages:

				kenny
		don't you understand?

	mcnamara and bundy look at him funny.

				bundy
		understand what?

	kenny just looks at them, eyes filled with sorrow.  they
	begin to feel uncomfortable.

				kenny
		the sun came up today.

				bundy
		yeah.

				kenny
		it shouldn't have.  but it did.

				mccone
		we were lucky we were able to keep it
		under control.

	kenny looks away, unable to bear it.

				kenny
		every day the sun comes up... says
		something about us.

				bundy
		says what, kenny?

	kenny looks back at them.

				kenny
		something... amazing.

	they just stare at him.  and with secret smiles, superior
	smiles, they nod.

				mcnamara
		sure, ken.  i understand.  feels good to
		win, doesn't it?

	but they don't understand, and together turn away.

				bundy
		see you later, kenny.

	kenny watches them, heads bowed in discussion, disappear into
	the labyrinth of the west wing.  kenny turns his back on
	them.
