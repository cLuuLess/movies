		i have one minute til ten here --

	the camera tracks around him, revealing:

	a large, elaborate war room, like mission control.  big
	screens, plexiglass tracking boards, tiered banks of
	communications equipment.  a massive light table on the floor
	at the center of the room projects a map of the caribbean and
	atlantic.  arcing across it is a red line: the blockade.

	the map is covered with cryptic military notations; watch
	officers on a platform which swings out over it update the
	latest ship positions.

	mcnamara's in a booth overlooking the room.  it's open to the
	next tier below where admiral anderson is giving orders.
