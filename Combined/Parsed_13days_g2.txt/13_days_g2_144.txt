	ext. main gate - continuous

	a white house police officer jumps up as kenny approaches.

				police officer
		would you like me to call a car, mr.
		o'donnell.

	kenny checks his watch.

				kenny
		how long will it take to get someone up?

				police officer
		fifteen minutes, maybe.  to your house,
		sir?

	kenny considers, shakes his head.  he wants to go home,
	but...

				kenny
		no.  no, i'll let her sleep.  let 'em
		sleep.

	kenny says it with a certain finality.  the police officer
	nods, and kenny wanders out through the gates, shouldering
	the weight of the world.
