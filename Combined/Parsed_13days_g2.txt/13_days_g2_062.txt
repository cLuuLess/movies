	int. white house mansion - oval room - day

	the white house oval room: opulent, filled with priceless art
	and furniture, but cramped.  excom members crowd around the
	center coffee table and the president.  kenny stands behind
	him with bobby.  rusk rises from his seat, formal.

				rusk
		mr. president, our deliberations have
		led us to the conclusion that, for the
		moment, a blockade of offensive weapons
		to cuba is our best option.  but we'll
		still need a strong showing of support
		from the organization of american states
		to give us an umbrella of legitimacy.

	at long last... kenny looks at bobby, relieved.  they've
	bought time to find a settlement.  bobby smiles a small
	smile: what were you so worried about?

				mcnamara
		a blockade is technically an act of war,
		therefore we recommend calling the
		action a quarantine.
