	int. cabinet room - day

	taylor sees the grim looks all around.

				general taylor
		i have to stress that there may be more
		missiles that we don't know about.  we
		need more u-2 coverage.

	kenny lets out his breath.  he catches bobby's eye.  this is
	unbelievable.

				the president
		is there any indication - anything at
		all - that suggests they intend to use
		these missiles in some sort of first
		strike?

				general carter
		not at present, sir.  but i think the
		prudent answer is we don't know.

				the president
		do we have any sort of intelligence from
		cia on what khruschev is thinking?

				general carter
		no, mr. president.  we don't.  we just
		don't know what's happening inside the
		kremlin at that level.

				bobby
		they lied to us.  two weeks ago dobrynin
		told me to my face khurschev had no
		intention of putting missiles into cuba. 
		they said themselves, this is our
		backyard.

	there's angry agreement.  the president cuts it off.

				the president
		gentlemen, i want first reactions. 
		assuming for a moment khruschev has not
		gone off the deep end and intends to
		start world war three, what are we
		looking at?

	rusk glances to his team at the end of the table.  ball,
	johnson, martin, thompson and stevenson.

				rusk
		mr. president, i believe my team is in
		agreement.  if we permit the
		introduction of nuclear missiles to a
		soviet satellite nation in our
		hemisphere, the diplomatic consequences
		will be too terrible to contemplate. 
		the russians are trying to show the
		world they can do whatever they want,
		wherever they want, and we're powerless
		to stop them.  if they succeed...

				bobby
		it will be munich all over again.

				rusk
		appeasement only makes the aggressor
		more aggressive.  confidence in our
		security commitments around the world
		will falter, allies will become unsure
		in the face of soviet pressure, and the
		soviets will be emboldened to push us
		even harder.  we must remove the
		missiles one way or another.  it seems
		to me the options are either to build up
		the crisis 'til they give in, or we hit
		them.  an air strike.

	there's silence at the table.  some nods.  understanding.

				the president
		bob?

				mcnamara
		we've worked up several military
		scenarios.  before i ask general taylor
		to lead us through the various options,
		i'd like for us to adopt a rule. 
		if we are going to strike, we must agree
		now that we will do it before the
		missiles become operational.  because
		once they are, i don't think we can
		guarantee getting them all before at
		least some are launched.

	and there it is.  the clock is running.

				bundy
		sir.  we need to consider... if we
		decide to act, there's a good chance
		we'll end up in a general war.

	the room falls silent.  the president leans back in his
	chair, studying the circle of men around the table, weighing
	them.

	kenny and the others watch him in silence.  a long, dramatic
	pause.  a course that will change history is about to be
	chosen.  the president leans forward, folds his hands on the
	table.  fated.  grave.

				the president
		it's clear we cannot permit soviet
		nuclear missiles in cuba.  we must get
		those missiles out.
