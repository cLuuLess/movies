	ext. south lawn - day

	kenny, bobby and the president make their way across the
	lawn, out of earshot of the building.

				bobby
		what happened to speak when spoken to?

				kenny
		give it a rest.  you were thinking the
		same thing, just didn't have the guts to
		take the heat.

	bobby likes getting under kenny's skin.  bobby aims a punch
	at his head which kenny knocks away.  the president changes
	gear, serious.

				the president
		we can horsetrade with khruschev on
		ships.  but it doesn't get us any closer
		to removing those missiles.

				kenny
		have to hope it's a signal that he'll
		back down on the real issue too.

				bobby
		we're going to have to stop a ship
		eventually, show the quarantine's got
		teeth, or we'll prove mccone right.

				the president
		mcnamara's on his way back here now.  we
		need to pick the right ship.  no subs. 
		no armed boarding parties either.  we
		need a little more time to figure this
		one out.

				kenny
		then let's move the quarantine line.

	it's a simple suggestion.  the president considers him a
	beat, and then mcnamara emerges from the white house, heads
	for them.  the three friends assume their more reserved,
	political faces as he comes up.

				mcnamara
		mr. president.  bobby.  kenny.  the
		essex battle group has the gagarin,
		kimovsk and the sub escort under their
		thumb.  we've got a few hours now before
		we need to worry about any more
		flashpoints on the line.
			(beat)
		we could use a few more hours.  i think
		we should consider moving the quarantine
		line back to 500 miles.

	bobby and the president look at kenny like he's some kind of
	svengali.  kenny just stands there, poker faced.
