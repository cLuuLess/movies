	int. president's bedroom - continuous

	kenny enters the elegant bedroom.  the figure alone at a side
	table by the window, drinks coffee, breakfast still spread
	out before him, washington post obscuring his face.

				kenny
		top o' the morning, mr. president.

	the figure lowers the paper.

	it is president john f. kennedy.  he's wearing boxers and a
	tank top.  unshaven.  bed-head.

	kenny o'donnell, former ward-pol and long-time kennedy man,
	is his chief of staff...

				the president
		morning, kenny.  you see this goddamn
		capehart stuff?

	the president rattles the paper.  kenny collapses in the
	chair opposite the president, sprawls, comfortable.

				kenny
		bayh's going to lose, but it's good
		groundwork for us for '64.

	kenny steals a piece of buttered toast off the president's
	plate.  the president spares him a glance.

				the president
		i was eating that.

				kenny
		no you weren't.

				the president
			(scanning the paper)
		i was, you bastard.

	kenny takes a defiant bite.

				the president (cont'd)
		so what've we got today?

				kenny
		today, for your information, is pulaski
		day.  we're going to buffalo...
