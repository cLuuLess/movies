	the major sits on a bench in front of his locker, thinks.

				major anderson
		when you're up there at 72,000 feet,
		there's a million things that can go
		wrong.  is your oxygen mix right?  will
		your cameras freeze up?  are you leaving
		contrail...
			(beat)
		those million things are beyond your
		control, mostly... but you know, when
		you realize that, there's a kind of
		peace.  you don't need to be in control. 
		you never were in control in the first
		place.  if you're a good man, and your
		ground crew are good men, it's all you
		can ask for.  and with the grace of g-d,
		it'll get you through.

	the young major smiles to himself, to the phone.

				major anderson (cont'd)
		you sound like a good man.  you'll be
		all right, mr. o'donnell.  we believe in
		you guys down here.
			(beat)
		thanks for the call.
