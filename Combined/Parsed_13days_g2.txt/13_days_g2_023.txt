	int. kenny's office - continuous

	briefcase and coat in hand, kenny enters his office - and
	finds three men.  standing there.  thin-haired, bespectacled,
	academic-looking mcgeorge bundy, 43, the national security
	advisor.  the two men in the background: photo interpreters.

	kenny hangs up his coat, sees the interpreters' large black
	display cases.  and suddenly the world is slightly off
	kilter.

				kenny
		hey, mac.  you're up bright and early.

				bundy
		no, ken.  i need to see him now...
