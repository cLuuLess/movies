	ext. missile site - cuba - continuous

	the missiles site is now more than just dirt and clearing
	equipment.  it's an armed camp, with missiles, fuel trailers,
	erectors spaced every few hundred yards.  missile technicians
	service the towering ss-4s.

				lundahl (v.o.)
		the first missiles became operational
		last night.

	with a barrage of shouted orders in russian, and a whine of
	the erector's engines, the missile begins to rise.

				lundahl (v.o.) (cont'd)
		we expect they'll all be operational in
		36 hours: monday morning.

	it stops, vertical.
