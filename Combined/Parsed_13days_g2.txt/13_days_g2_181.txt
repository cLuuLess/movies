	adlai watches his staffers leave his inner office.  he hears
	kenny, and everything kenny is saying.

		i hear you.  i'm glad it's you calling. 
		i thought it would be bobby.  if they're
		still sticking to their stonewall
		strategy, i'll get 'em.

		thanks, ken.

	adlai lowers the phone to its cradle.  an anxious staffer
	sticks his head in the door, a concerned, questioning look on
	his face.

	adlai adjusts his tie.  his hand is shaking.  he notices it,
	and manages a brave smile.

		i'm an old political cat, jimmy.

		but i've got one life left.
