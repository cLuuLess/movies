	a big 100-dollar-a-plate dinner is in full swing to a dinner
	band's tunes.  the president and chicago mayor richard daly
	make the rounds among the fund raising crowd.  kenny follows
	them at a respectful distance, greeting old cronies.

	suddenly a messenger hustles over to kenny, hands him a note. 
	kenny makes eye contact with the president, nods and leaves.
