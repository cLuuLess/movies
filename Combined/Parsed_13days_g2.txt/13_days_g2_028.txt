	int. kenny's office - day

	kenny carries the phone with him as he paces hard from his
	desk to his window.

				kenny
		the principals are assembling in an
		hour.  see you then.

	kenny hangs up.  the president enters.  a beat.  and in that
	beat, there's a void.  the two men are off their emotional
	stride, trying to grope their way out of shock.

				the president
		where's bobby?

	kenny nods, acknowledging the feeling

				kenny
		should be here any minute.

				the president
		good.

	and we glimpse the chemistry of these guys by bobby's
	absence.  it's like they're missing their third wheel.

				the president (cont'd)
		good.

				bobby (o.s.)
		where the hell are you?

	the president and kenny hear him out in the hall.  and the
	tension goes out of them instantly.

				the president
		in here!

	they turn to the door as bobby kennedy, 37, the president's
	younger brother/attorney general, enters.  bobby shuts the
	door behind him, falls into kenny's chair, and clearly
	grappling with his own disbelief, is hushed.

				bobby
		jesus christ, guys.  what the hell's
		khruschev thinking?

				the president
		did you have any indication of this from
		georgi?  any possible warning or sense
		of motivation?

				bobby
			(shaking his head)
		complete snowjob.  and then we went out
		and told the country they weren't
		putting missiles into cuba.
			(beat)
		by the way, you realize we just lost the
		midterms.

				kenny
		who gives a shit about the midterms now? 
		the soviets are putting nuclear weapons
		ninety miles away from us.

				bobby
		you mean there's something more
		important than votes?  didn't think i'd
		live to see the day, ken.

	the president paces away, grim.

				kenny
		jesus.  i feel like we've caught the jap
		carriers steaming for pearl harbor.
