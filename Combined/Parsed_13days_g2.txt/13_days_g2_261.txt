	the air.  kenny enters.  he stands in the doorway.

		i saw you out there.  you want him to
		call you back, need you.

				kenny
		no.  i'm glad i'm home.

	and she knows the worst.

				helen
		how long do we have?

	kenny's voice breaks. 

				kenny
		if the sun rises in the morning, it is
		only because of men of goodwill.
			(beat)
		and that's all there is between us and
		the devil.

	they take each other in their arms, the wisdom of the atomic
	age so simple, so tenuous, every human life hanging by such a

	them, finding the open window and the darkness.
