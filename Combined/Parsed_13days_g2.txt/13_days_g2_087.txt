	ext. carribean sea - night

	-- the voice of the essex battlegroup: sparkling, alive, a
	constellation of lights scattered across the sea.  one by one
	the escort ships answer the carrier's siren with their own
	wailing cries, an alien chorus among the ships, disappearing
	and reappearing in the swells.  the communication crescendos
	to its fever pitch --

	-- and then the battlegroup goes to blackout.  like a dying
	universe, the answering sirens cut off, the life-lights wink
	out, and an appalling darkness falls across the sea...

	fade out

	blackness, like before a curtain rises.  and then a
	flickering: a fluorescent light comes on.
