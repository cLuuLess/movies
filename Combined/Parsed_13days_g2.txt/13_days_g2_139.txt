	int. kenny's office - night

	kenny rubs his eyes, listens to his phone and the woman's
	voice at the other end.  it's his wife.

				helen (o.s.)
		when are you going to be home?

				kenny
		i don't know, helen.  i want you to keep
		the kids close tomorrow.  leave the t.v.
		on, sleep with it on in the bedroom
		until i tell you you can turn it off.

				helen (o.s.)
		what's happened?

				kenny
		nothing.  nothing you don't know about. 
		tomorrow's the big day.  just have the
		car ready to go if i call or if the
		civil defense warning comes on.

				helen (o.s.)
		what happens to you?  i'm not leaving
		without you.

				kenny
		i'll be evacuated with the president.

	a long silence on the other end of the line.

				helen (o.s.)
		great.  so while you're under a rock
		somewhere with the president, what am i
		supposed to do with your five children?

	and to that, there is no answer.  a beat, and it's all kenny
	can promise:

				kenny
		i'll find you.  but we're not going to
		let it come to that.  i promise.
