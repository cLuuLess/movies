	ext. airport - bridgepoint, connecticut - day

	super: wednesday, october 17th.  day 2

	a long shot of an enormous crowd thronging a bunting-trimmed
	platform.  the president, barely recognizable at the
	distance, and a cluster of political vips wave from it,
	smiling.

	kenny steps into frame, back here at the fringes of the
	crowd.

				the president (o.s.)
		doesn't anybody in connecticut have to
		work today?

	the crowd goes nuts.  kenny paces, checks his watch,
	impatient to be done with the necessary diversion.  kenny
	gazes off to his right and spots scotty reston, along with
	half the white house press corps suckered along.  scotty
	catches kenny's look.

	kenny turns away, but scotty comes weaving over.  the
	president continues on, but all we hear is scotty and kenny.

				reston
		kenny!  what happened?  they didn't let
		me up front, said the president was on
		the phone the whole time.

				kenny
		he was.

				reston
		yeah?  who was he talking to?  acheson? 
		come on, o'donnell, everyone's wondering
		what's going on.  what's acheson doing
		in town?  and don't give me some
		bullshit about dnc think tanks. 
		acheson's mr. cold war.

				kenny
		why don't you ask him yourself?  you can
		have him on the way home.

				reston
		i'm giving you a chance here: talk to
		me.  you can influence how this thing
		unfolds.

	but kenny stands there, mute.  reston just shakes his head,
	knowing for sure something's up.  he turns and heads back for
	the press corps.
