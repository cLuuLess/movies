	int. bobby's limo - night

	bobby stares out the window at the passing city, the lights
	the lives behind those windows.  as the car drives on and on,
	the tension returns.  bobby feels the weight of all those
	lives.  on him.  a long beat.  he gazes at kenny, the only
	man he could ever admit this to:

				bobby
		i don't know if i can do this.

	kenny glances over at him.  bobby stares back.

				kenny
		there's nobody else i'd rather have
		going in there.

	bobby looks at him.

				kenny (cont'd)
		nobody else i'd trust helen and the
		kids' lives to.

	kenny means it.  he looks away.  bobby shifts, awkward.

				bobby
		take a left.

	kenny looks him.  this isn't the way to the justice
	department.  but he complies.

				bobby (cont'd)
		we gave so much to get here.  i don't
		know.  sometimes i think what the hell
		did we do it for?

				kenny
		because we knew we could do a better job
		than everyone else.

	and bobby, in the silence and closeness of the car, turns on
	kenny - anguished, knowing his life is at its climax.

				bobby
		you know... i hate being called the
		brilliant one.  the ruthless one.  they
		guy who does the dirty work.  the one
		everybody's afraid of.  

	kenny looks to him, moved, not knowing what to say.

				bobby (cont'd)
		i hate it.  i'm not smart, you know. 
		and i'm not so ruthless.

	he looks to kenny, searching his face, then away,
	embarrassed.

				kenny
		you're right about the smart part, but
		ruthless, well...

	that breaks the tension as they arrive at the scene:

	through the window

	appears the grim, square lines of the soviet embassy.  police
	cars line the streets outside it.  all the windows are dark. 
	a cordon of kgb guards in plainclothes stand by the gated
	entrance.  on the opposite side of the street lounge two
	dozen washington d.c. police.

	resume

	kenny gives bobby a look.  bobby rolls down his window.

				bobby
		slow down.  smell that?

				kenny
		smoke.

				bobby
		just wanted to see for myself.
			(beat)
		they're burning their documents.

	the final duty of an embassy before war...

				bobby (cont'd)
		they think we're going to war.  g-d help
		us, ken.
