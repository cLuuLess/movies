	int. oval office - night

	grimacing in pain.  he opens a pill bottle, takes two pills
	out.  he takes a whiskey in a shot glass from kenny.

	resume

	kenny finishes pouring him and bobby a couple of more shots,
	discreetly turning a blind eye to the president's pain.

	the president returns from his desk, shirt untucked,
	disheveled, back stiff.  he eases into his rocking chair. 
	bobby lies sprawled on the couch.  kenny sits down.  they all
	look at each other.  a beat, something like shock.

				kenny
		jesus christ almighty...

	they burst out laughing.  an absurd, tension draining moment. 
	they shoot their drinks, kenny refills.

				kenny (cont'd)
		call me irish, but i don't believe in
		cooler heads prevailing.

				the president
		acheson's scenario is unacceptable.  and
		he has more experience than anyone.

				kenny
		there is no expert on this subject, no
		wise old man.

	the president stares kenny in the face, understanding.

				the president
		the thing is, acheson's right.  talk
		alone won't accomplish anything.

	kenny considers the president, his face straight as he says:

				kenny
		then let's bomb the shit out of them.
		everyone wants to, even you, even me.
			(there's a point)
		it sure would feel good.

	the president sees what kenny's saying: it'd be an emotional
	response, not necessarily the intelligent one.

				bobby
		jack, i'm as conniving as they come, but
		a sneak attack is just wrong.

				kenny
		he's right.  and things are happening
		too fast.  it smells like the bay of
		pigs all over again.

	bobby picks up some reconnaissance photos on the coffee
	table.

				bobby
		as if dealing with the russians wasn't
		hard enough, we gotta worry about our
		own house.

				the president
		tonight, listening to taylor and
		acheson, i kept seeing burke and dulles
		telling me all i had to do was sign on
		the dotted line.  the invasion would
		succeed.  castro would be gone.  just
		like that.  easy.

	the president is rendered mute by a wave of pain.  kenny and
	bobby aver their eyes.  when it passes, the president is
	hushed, grave.

				the president (cont'd)
		there's something...immoral about
		abandoning your own judgement.

	kenny nods, moved.  the president reaches out for the
	reconnaissance photos bobby's flipping through.  bobby hands
	them to him.  the president looks them over.  and when he
	speaks, there's humility.  and resolve.

				the president (cont'd)
		we can't let things get ahead of
		themselves.  we've got to control what
		happens. 
		we're going to do what we have to make
		this come out right.  excom is our first
		weapon.
			(beat)
		we'll resort to others as we need 'em.
