	ext. o'donnell patio - night

	a screen door squeaks open.  kenny steps out into the
	darkness of the back yard.  and there, in her robe, sitting
	startled on a lawn chair, lit only by the dim glow of the
	kitchen window, is helen.  kenny stands there tired, his coat
	slung over his shoulder.

				kenny
		hi.

	helen rises, her own care-worn face turned to his.  for a
	silent moment they gaze at each other, searching in the lines
	of each others' face for the changes of a long separation. 
	they see them.  but they've been married a long time, and the
	awkwardness passes.

				helen
		hi, o'donnell.  you look old.

	kenny drops his coat on a table as helen comes up and folds
	herself into his arms.

				helen (cont'd)
		this job's going to kill you.  if i
		don't first.

	they kiss, comfortable.  but not too long, and he lets her
	go.  she looks at him again, sees he's suppressing a smile.

				helen (cont'd)
		if you're home it means either jack and
		bobby have finally figured out what a
		con man you are and fired you, or --

				kenny
		-- we got a back channel communication
		from khruschev this evening feeling us
		out about a deal.  he confirmed it just
		a little while ago in a letter to the
		president.  i think we've won.

				helen
		a thing like this... who could even
		think of winning?
