	int. oval office - continuous

	taylor continues on.

				general taylor
		technically, general lemay is correct
		that sac has the statutory authority --

	the president punches his desk.

				the president
		-- i have the authority.  i am the
		commander-in-chief of the united states,
		and i say when we go to war!

				general taylor
		we are not at war, sir, not until we're
		at defcon 1.

				the president
		general, the joint chiefs have just
		signalled our intent to escalate to the
		soviets.  you have signalled an
		escalation which i had no wish to
		signal, and which i did not approve.  

	but taylor knows this very well.  and the way he's suffering,
	it's clear he's taking the heat for his underlings.  from
	over on the couch bobby chimes in:

				bobby
		lemay... he's history.

	the president glances at kenny who stands there, speechless.

				the president
		get out of here, max.

	the general leaves.  kenny closes the door, wanders deeper
	into the office.  he looks from the president to bobby. 
	there's a long, long beat of shocked silence.

				kenny
		jesus...

				bobby
		rescind the order.  can all the chiefs. 
		put nitze, gilpatric and the
		undersecretaries in charge.

				kenny
		we can't do that, bobby.

				the president
		he's right, we can't rescind defcon 2. 
		the soviets will think we've gotten
		sweet on them.

				kenny
		and we can't purge the chiefs.  our
		invasion talk will look like a bluff. 
		or even that there's been an attempted
		coup.

	bobby is disgusted, but knows they're right.

				bobby
		mcnamara won't be able to handle them. 
		it's too much for one man...
			(knowing look to kenny)
		...with all due respect to our heroic
		fifth column.

	the president collapses in his rocking chair.  kenny leans
	over the back of the sofa next to bobby.

				kenny
		we've got khruschev's attention with the
		blockade.  if we want a political
		solution.  i think it's time to turn up
		the diplomatic heat.  cause if we let
		this go on too long, we're going to find
		ourselves in a war.

	bobby looks at the president, meaningful.  the president
	turns to kenny.

				the president
		i've been considering a variation on one
		of stevenson's ideas.  we're going to
		send up a trial balloon through lippman. 
		the jupiter missiles.
