	int. statler hotel coffee shop - night

	a few lonely business travelers hang out in the dim coffee
	shop.  faint music plays.  scali and alexander fomin sit with
	steaming cups of coffee.  scali, nervous, unfolds a note. 
	fomin, an expressionless gray spectre of a man, eyes him.  he
	is, in his boredom, a spy's spy.

				scali
		i am instructed to tell you that the
		american government would respond
		favorably to an offer along the lines
		you have discussed.  if this solution
		were raised at the u.n. by ambassador
		zorin, he would find a favorable reply
		from ambassador stevenson.

				fomin
		so i understand you correctly.  if the
		missiles in cuba were dismantled,
		returned to the soviet union, and a
		guarantee was made not to reintroduce
		them, the united states would be
		prepared to guarantee that it would
		never invade cuba?

				scali
		that is correct.

				fomin
		this is from the highest authority?

				scali
		yes.  from the highest authority.  there
		are two conditions.  the u.n.
		must be allowed to inspect the removal
		of the missiles.

				fomin
		and, of course, the u.n. must be allowed
		to observe the redeployment of forces
		from the american southeast.

	scali demurs.  he has no instructions on this count.

				fomin (cont'd)
		and the second condition?

				scali
		time is of the essence.

	scali takes a sip of coffee.  fomin stares at him, intense.

				fomin
		john.  how much time?

				scali
		48 hours.  in 48 hours there can be no
		deals.
