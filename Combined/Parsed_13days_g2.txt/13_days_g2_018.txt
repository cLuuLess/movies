	int. hotel lobby - day

	superimpose: buffalo, new york

	a luxury hotel crowded with local pols: the democratic
	machine of buffalo.  beyond the open floor-to-ceiling
	windows, a crowd.  the pulaski day parade, a glimpse of '69s
	americana.  high school bands blare sousa.  the scene is
	deafening, boisterous.  pols trail kenny as he crosses the
	room: fast, tough, on-the-go.

				pol #1
		we're putting up potowski next time. 
		will you guys come out for him?  

				kenny
		who else you got?

				pol #2
		there's richardson.  good kid.

				kenny
		got the touch?

				pol #2
		yeah.  still moldable, too.

				kenny
		everyone likes a good kid...

	and like that, a congressional candidate is made...  kenny
	accelerates, leaving the pols behind.  suddenly, outside the
	windows, the crowd swells forward with a collective roar.

				crowd
		mr. president!  president kennedy!
