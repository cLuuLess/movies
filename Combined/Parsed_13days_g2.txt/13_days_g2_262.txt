	the red dome of nuclear fire rising over washington.  it
	roils the air in its expanding, blood-red glory.

	it is the sun.  the dawn in the east.

	pull back through the open window.

	super: sunday, october 28th.  day 13

	into kenny and helen's bedroom.  and silence.  kenny and
	helen lie together on the bed.  the light burns into kenny's
	half-shut eye.  kenny is only dimly conscious of the light's
	meaning.  until the phone shrills downstairs.

	kenny is instantly up, launched out of the room.
