	ext. the rose garden - day

	kenny and bobby follow the president down a path through the
	rose garden.  the shock of the morning has worn off.  the
	president stops, looks at them.

				the president
		i don't think it's going to matter what
		khruschev's intentions are.  i tell you,
		right now... i don't see any way around
		hitting them.

	a long moment of silence as they move along again.

				kenny
		if we hit 'em, kill a lot of russians,
		they'll move against berlin.  they
		attack berlin, that's nato... and we're
		at war.

	the guys stop again.  the autumn day is bright, warm, alive. 
	the air, the distant city sounds derail the relentless train
	of logic for a beat.  and in their faces we see that all
	three men, for the first time, feel the enormity of war, its
	shadow over everything.  it's only a couple of steps away. 
	steps that they're seriously contemplating.

				bobby
		damned if we do, but if we don't, we're
		in a war for sure somewhere else in six
		months.

	pained, the president turns away.

				the president
		no choice.  this is going to cost lives
		any way we go.  do nothing, and it could
		be 80 million  of ours.  we have to get
		rid of those missiles.

				kenny
		there've got to be alternatives to just
		going out and bombing them.

				bobby
		he's right, jack.  taylor is saying we
		may have some time.  we've got to use
		it.

				the president
		so if there are alternatives that make
		sense - and i'm not saying there are -
		we need 'em.  need 'em fast.

				bobby
		what about the allies?  congress?  i
		think we may need to start letting key
		people know.  and they're all scattered
		across the country for the campaign. 
		we're going to need to get the u.n.
		staff in and warmed up.  jesus... i
		don't even know if we've got secure
		communications with half our embassies
		since that the soviets got that
		cryptographer of ours.

				the president
		we can't worry about everything right
		now.  we've got to figure out what we're
		going to do before we worry about how we
		do it.

				kenny
		the other thing is...

				bobby
		... i know.  cia and the military fucked
		us on the bay of pigs.

				kenny
		they're going to be pressing for a
		military solution soon.  we can't afford
		to let them ram their agenda down our
		throats.  we need to come with options
		other than air strikes so we have some
		sort of choice here.

				bobby
		we got a bunch of smart guys.  we lock
		'em up together in there, kick 'em in
		the ass til they come up with options.

	kenny and the president look at him.  bobby nods.

				bobby (cont'd)
		i'll do it.

				kenny
			(to the president)
		it's too politicized with you in there,
		anyway.  they need to be able to stick
		their necks out.

				bobby
		it'll be the principals, a couple of the
		key guys from each department: the
		executive committee of the national
		security council.  we'll call it excom.

	kenny snorts a laugh.  bobby shoots him a cross look.

				kenny
		excom.  has a ring to it.  like f-troop.

	the president stops.  bobby and kenny stop, too.

				the president
		okay.  kenny and i only show for the
		meetings you call us into.  impress us. 
		and do it fast.
			(to kenny)
		you're in charge of keeping this quiet. 
		if word gets out before we know what
		we're going to do, there'll be panic. 
		and it'll ruin any chance of surprise if
		we decide to hit them.

				kenny
		then we need to do a few things right
		away.  no pierre.  he knows, the press
		knows. 
		you're going to have to keep up your
		schedule - your movements are followed
		too closely.  and we need to get these
		guys out of the white house.  george
		ball's got a conference room at state.
			(to bobby)
		reconvene over there this afternoon,
		come back here tonight.

	bobby nods.

				bobby
		i think we should bring in dean acheson. 
		he was fighting soviets while we were
		still working the wards in boston.

	the president nods his approval.  looks at kenny.

				the president
		find him, kenny.  we're going to need
		all the help we can get.
