	int. west wing hall - night

	kenny joins the president and general taylor in the hallway
	as they head for the oval office.

				general taylor
		it appears our low-level flights are
		getting back okay.  some unconfirmed
		reports of small-arms fire from some of
		the missions, but that's it.

	slightly behind them, kenny looks sidelong at taylor.

				the president
		guess we can't blame khruschev for a few
		patriotic farmers.  and the ships?

				general taylor
		still heading for cuba.

				the president
		all right.  then i guess it's time.
