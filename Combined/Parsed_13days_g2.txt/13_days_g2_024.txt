	int. white house - residential floor - day

	kenny emerges from the elevator with bundy.  they head down
	the long, posh 3rd floor hall, the presidential detail
	guarding the doors at the end.  but the familiar route feels
	strange, and lasting an eternity.  kenny eyes the package
	under bundy's arm, its top secret stamp visible.

				kenny
		morning, floyd.

				secret service agent
		good morning, mr. o'donnell.  mr. bundy.

	the agent opens the door.  bundy pauses, kenny with him.

				kenny
		what's it about?

				bundy
		cuba.

	bundy is tense.  but kenny relaxes.

				kenny
		just cuba?  okay, i got work to do, see
		you guys downstairs.
