	anderson double checks his position, switches to the
	autopilot for the stability only the machine can provide,
	then hits the camera activate button on his joystick. 
	bamabmabmabma... the camera begins its photography.

	anderson watches the number on the film-remaining counter
	spool down.  he stares out the window.  the towering clouds
	below rise up magnificent, glorious... a glimpse of heaven.

	rapt,  anderson stares.  and then suddenly a blaring alarm
	goes off in the cockpit.  it shocks anderson around to the
	controls.  it's his missile warning light.

	anderson' hands flash out to the joystick, turning off the
	cameras, disabling autopilot.  he banks the u-2 hard.
