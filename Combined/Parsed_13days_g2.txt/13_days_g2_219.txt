		last night, we looked like we were going
		to cut a deal to get us all out of this
		mess.  today, the soviets are reneging. 
		we're going to try to salvage the
		situation, but a lot of things are going
		wrong today.  it's making everyone
		nervous, and it will be very hard to
		avoid going to war.  don't get shot
		down, major.  beyond that, whatever else
		you can do to help us, i'd really
		appreciate it.
