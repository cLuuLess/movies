	int. cabinet room - continuous

	the news hits the room like a thunderbolt.  kenny looks to
	bobby and the president.  the blood is gone from their faces.

				mcnamara
		then we're out of time.  we have to go
		in.

				lundahl
		that may not be as easy as we thought
		either.  we've gotten confirmation that
		the soviets have also deployed
		battlefield nuclear weapons to cuba. 

	a pall falls over the room as lemay explains.

				lemay
		frogs, we call 'em.  short range
		tactical nukes.  it's possible they've
		delegated release authority to their
		local commanders for use against our
		invasion troops.  it'd be standard
		doctrine.
			(beat)
		our capability to get all the missiles
		has eroded during our delay with the
		quarantine.  the good news is that for
		the moment we know where the frogs are,
		and we can target them, too.  but the
		longer we wait, the hard it's going to
		get.

	they all look to the president.  kenny stares, in a private
	hell, blacker and more complete than anyone should ever know.

	in that shocked silence each man grapples with failure.  the
	best and the brightest could not prevent what must come next.

				the president
		then we have no choice.
			(to  taylor)
		general, issue the warning orders to our
		forces.  they will be prepared to
		execute the air strikes monday morning
		and the follow-on invasion according to
		the schedule thereafter.  i'll need the
		official release orders on my desk
		sunday night.

				general taylor
		understood, sir.  we need to step up the
		overflights, finalize our pilots' target
		folders in order to be able to carry out
		the strikes.

	the president gives kenny a meaningful look.

				the president
		permission granted.

	taylor exits.  kenny rises, gives the president an almost
	imperceptible nod, as he prepares to leave in taylor's wake.

				the president (cont'd)
		gentlemen, if anybody's got any great
		ideas, now's the time...
