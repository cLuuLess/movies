	int. situation room - continuous

	the room explodes, victorious.  kenny and bobby break into
	big grins, grab each other.  kenny pumps the president's
	hand.  rusk and bundy slap each other on the back.

				rusk
		we were eyeball to eyeball and i think
		the other fellow just blinked.

	the ruckus goes on for a minute.  mccone comes back in.

				mccone
		mr. president.

	his voice is lost in the celebration.  mccone calls out:

				mccone (cont'd)
		mr. president!

	the hubub dies away.

				mccone (cont'd)
		sir, we have the tally from nsa.  we
		have twenty ships stopping and or
		turning around.  six, however, appear to
		be continuing for the line.  including
		the gagarin and kimovsk.

	the elation goes out of the room.  kenny looks at the
	president.  the president picks up the phone again.

				the president
		captain, have the ships you're observing
		changed course?

				captain (o.s.)
		no, mr. president.  they've just crossed
		the quarantine line.

	bobby grips the edge of the table, immediately believing.

				bobby
		it's an accident.  they must not have
		gotten their orders yet.  let 'em go.

				general taylor
		unlikely, mr. president.  we've been
		monitoring transmissions from both the
		gagarin and kimovsk.  their radios are
		working fine.

				mccone
		one ship, an accident maybe.  six: this
		is intentional.

	the president looks to bobby.  he has no answer.  kenny's
	mind races over the variables, and he leans forward, intense,
	suddenly understanding in a flash of insight:

				kenny
		they're right.  this is intentional.

	he glances around the room.  all of excom is looking at him. 
	bobby stares at kenny, too shocked to feel betrayed.

				kenny (cont'd)
		khruschev's stopped the 20 ships which
		are carrying contraband, and he's
		letting the ones which aren't go
		through, hoping for an incident.  i
		think we should let them go.

	bobby relaxes.  around the table there are nods.

				mccone
		if we do, it erodes the credibility of
		the quarantine.  he'll just send more
		through tomorrow.

	the president looks at kenny.

				kenny
		then we deal with it tomorrow.  but
		today he's stopped most of them.  he's
		done something smart here.  we gave him
		an ultimatum, and he's agreed to most of
		it, preserving just enough room to save
		face.  we need to do something just as
		smart now.

	bobby's nodding, following the argument.  kenny looks around
	the room for support.
