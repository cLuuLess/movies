		int. cabinet room - night

	hold on the exact same mute reaction from the entire
	assembled excom.  finally mccone breaks the spell.

				mccone
		it won't work --

	bobby, kenny and sorensen start to object, but mccone raises
	his voice over theirs.

				mccone (cont'd)
		-- because it's wishful thinking!  it's
		the same wishful thinking that blinded
		us all these months while the soviets
		were sneaking those missiles in under
		our noses!

	mcnamara shakes his head, intrigued but skeptical.

				mcnamara
		ignore the second letter, agree to the
		conditions of the first...

				general taylor
		there's no reason to believe the soviets
		will let it go.

				rusk
		max is right.  why will they accept it?

				mcnamara
		it can work.  if, if they believe we'll
		hit them.

	kenny, bobby and sorensen look at mcnamara, grateful.

				mcnamara (cont'd)
		we've only got time for one more round
		of diplomacy.  the first airstrikes
		start in less than 36 hours.

				rusk
		but we have to make them agree to it. 
		so how do we do that?

	the president leans forward.  sensing he's about to speak,
	all eyes turn to him.

				the president
		we give them something.  we tell them
		we'll remove the missiles from turkey
		say, six months from now so that there
		appears to be no linkage.  we also tell
		them if they go public about it, we deny
		it and the deal is off.

				kenny
		and we do it under the table so we can
		disavow any knowledge of it.

				mccone
		it's transparent.  the press'll be all
		over it.

				kenny
		six months from now, i'm not going to
		care.  are you?  we'll deal with it.

				mcnamara
		at least it will expose whether
		khruschev has been overthrown.  we'll
		know what we're dealing with.

				kenny
		and if this is a move to appease the
		hard line, then it may just be the bone
		he needs to regain control of his own
		house.

	most excom is nodding, agreeing.  mccone shakes his head in
	disgust.  taylor sits in silence.

				rusk
		whoever carries the message has to hit
		the nail on the head.  come across as
		too soft, they'll push us.  too hard,
		they'll be cornered and even more
		dangerous.

				mccone
		they could pre-empt.

	it's a terrible responsibility to bear.  the room is silent. 
	at last bobby looks up from his folded hands to his brother. 
	the president stares back.  there is nobody else who can do
	this.  only bobby. his brother.

				the president
		bobby.  you know dobrynin best.

	bobby nods, taking up the gauntlet.

				the president (cont'd)
		ted, you get working on the draft.

	sorensen and bobby rise as one, head for the doors.

				the president (cont'd)
		and make sure he knows we have to have
		an answer tomorrow.
			(beat, final)
		because on monday we begin military
		action against cuba.

	bobby and kenny exchange a look.
