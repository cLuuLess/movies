	int. kenny's office - day

	in kenny's credenza, a small black and white t.v. plays. 
	walter cronkite narrates on the television as a train laden
	with tanks on flatbeds pulls out of a station.

				walter cronkite (v.o.)
		massive military preparations are
		underway throughout the southeast in
		what pentagon officials are confirming
		is the largest mobilization since korea. 
		the railways have been nationalized to
		assist in the deployment, here
		transporting elements of the u.s. 1st
		armored division from ft. hood, texas.

	a phone rings.  kenny turns from the t.v., turns down walter
	cronkite, as he answers.

				kenny
		yeah?
