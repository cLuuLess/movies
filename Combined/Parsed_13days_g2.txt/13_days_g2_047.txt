	int. george ball's conference room - day

	excom meets in george ball's small conference room at the
	state department.  bobby, in shirtsleeves, paces at the head
	of the table, very, very alone.  all eyes are on him.

				bobby
		no.  no.  no.  there is more than one
		option here.  if one isn't occurring to
		us, it's because we haven't thought hard
		enough.

	mcnamara squirms.  the others react in frustration.  cia
	chief john mccone, sharp, tough, conservative, is harsh.

				mccone
		sometimes there is only one right
		choice, and you thank god when it's
		clear.

				bobby
		you're talking about a sneak attack! 
		how'll that make us look?  big country
		blasting a little one into the stone
		age.  we'll be real favorites around the
		world.

				acheson
		bobby, that's naive.  this is the real
		world, you know that better than
		anybody.  your argument is ridiculous.

				mccone
		you weren't so ethically particular when
		we were talking about options for
		removing castro over at cia.

	and there's nothing bobby can say to that.  he props himself
	up on the table, stares at it as if there's an answer in its
	shiny surface somewhere.  there is only the reflection of his
	own face.

				bobby
		i can't let my brother go down in
		history like a villain, like a tojo,
		ordering another pearl harbor.

	mccone, acheson, and taylor share a look.  the last
	resistance to airstrikes is crumbling.  finally, bobby looks
	up at mcnamara.

				bobby (cont'd)
		bob.  if we go ahead with these air
		strikes...
			(beat)
		there's got to be something else.  give
		it to me.  i don't care how crazy,
		inadequate or stupid it sounds.  
			(beat, pleading)
		give it to me.

	mcnamara suffers under the gaze of everyone at the table,
	weighing the situation out.  and finally he ventures.

				mcnamara
		six months ago we gamed out a scenario. 
		it's slow.  it doesn't get rid of the
		missiles.  there are a lot of drawbacks.
			(beat)
		the scenario was for a blockade of cuba.
