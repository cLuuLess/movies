	int. white house switchboard - day

	kenny opens the door to the white house switchboard room.  a
	half-dozen operators work their lines, making connections on
	the old-fashioned switchboard.  unnoticed, he sizes them up,
	their skill.  they're all courteous, pretty, professional.

	the camera pans down the line... and stops on a middle-aged
	matron at the end - the sternest, most scary of them all. 
	her name is margaret.

				margaret
		white house operator.  yes sir.
			(beat, harsh, booming)
		speaker mccormack, hold for the vice
		president.

	her voice is so severe, so smoker-gravelled, it makes the
	blood run cold.  this is the woman kenny's looking for.

				kenny
		ma'am, would you mind helping me out
		with a few special calls?
