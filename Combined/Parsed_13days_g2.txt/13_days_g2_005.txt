	a kitchen out of the late 1950's.  kenny drinks coffee, ties
	a tie, rifles through a briefcase at the kitchen table.  the

	food.  kenny grills the kids while he goes over papers.

	a phone rings as the kids cry out en masse.

				kids

	kenny glances up at the wall.  there are two phones, side by
	side.  one red, one black.  it's the black one ringing. 
	helen answers.  kenny goes back to his papers.
