	int. kenny's office - continuous

	kenny, at the other end of the line, stares out the window at
	the fall day.  it seems so mild, so unlike war.  and it takes
	him a beat before he realizes anderson's on the line.

				major anderson (o.s.)
		hello?  anyone there?

				kenny
		major, my name is kenneth o'donnell. 
		special assistant to the president.

	kenny takes a breath, ready to start the shuck-and-jive...
	but for some reason doesn't.

				kenny (cont'd)
		major, a few days ago the president
		ordered me to help him keep control of
		what's going on out there.  i've been
		browbeating pilots, navy guys left and
		right to make sure you don't get us here
		in washington into trouble.  but you
		know what?  we're pretty damn good at
		getting ourselves into trouble.  so
		instead of riding your ass, i'm just
		going to tell you what's going on, and
		let you figure out how best to help us
		out up here.
