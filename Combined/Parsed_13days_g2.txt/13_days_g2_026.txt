	int. oval office - continuous

	we enter from a different angle than we usually enter in
	movies: through the side door.  the president's ornate desk
	sits on the right, windows looking out on the rose garden
	behind it.  kenny's gaze swivels to:

	the other end of the room where the interpreters, their
	crewcut chief, arthur lundahl, 50's, and bundy stare at him. 
	they're surrounded by presentation boards propped up around
	the fireplace.  the president's rocking chair and sofas.

				the president
		you used to look down a bomb sight for a
		living, ken.  what do you see?

	in eerie silence, as all eyes follow him, kenny makes his way
	among the presentation boards with the u-2 imagery, stops in
	front of the picture of the six canvas-covered objects.  it
	unleashes a wave of memories.

				kenny
		we hit a nazi buzz bomb field in '45. 
			(beat, incredulous)
		it looks like a rocket base...

	he puts his hand out to touch the image, then turns and looks
	to the president, knowing what they must be.

				bundy
		on sunday morning, one of our u-2s took
		these pictures.  the soviets are putting
		medium range ballistic missiles into
		cuba.

	shock.  silence.  kenny glances to the other men.

				lundahl
		they appear to be the ss-4: range of a
		thousand miles, three-megaton nuclear
		warhead.

				kenny
		jesus christ in heaven...
