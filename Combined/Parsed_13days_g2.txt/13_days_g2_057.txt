	int. hotel elevators - night

	kenny waits at the elevator.  scotty saunters up behind him. 
	he sizes kenny up, clears his throat.  kenny turns around.

				reston
		there are major rail disruptions in the
		south, two airborne divisions are on
		alert.  that exercise is an invasion.

				kenny
		well, you know how bobby has it in for
		the state of mississippi.

				reston
		this is about cuba.

	kenny freezes, then explodes.

				kenny
		cuba?  you're fucking crazy.  we are not
		invading cuba.  nobody gives a rat's ass
		about cuba.  not now, not ever. 
		if you print something like that, all
		you're going to do is inflame the
		situation.  nobody talks to assholes who
		inflame situations.  assholes like that
		can find themselves cut out of the loop.

	reston is taken aback.  stung silence for a beat.  kenny's
	response is far louder than any "yes."  now kenny realizes
	it.

				reston
		you've never threatened me before.

	and kenny looks away, upset, but when he turns back to
	reston, all that's there is his poker face.  the elevator
	arrives.

				reston (cont'd)
		all right.  i'm not going to print
		anything until i have another source. 
		but i promise you, i'll get one.

	kenny boards the elevator.  the doors shut on scotty.
