	ext. o'donnell driveway - night

	a long, black car stops at the end of kenny's driveway.  the
	door opens, and kenny steps out.  he says an inaudible
	goodnight to the driver, and the car pulls off.  he turns,
	facing the white two-story house with the neat front yard,
	the lights out.  and he smiles.  home at last.
