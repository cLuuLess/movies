	int. fbi, counter-intelligence department files - night

	bang!  a stack of files slams down beside kenny on a large
	paper-covered conference table.  walter sheridan, kenny's
	investigator-buddy, wears a visitor's pass just like kenny. 
	kenny and walter rifle through the folders, super fast, super
	proficient.  a half-dozen fbi agents work around the table.

				sheridan
		okay.  so, what we've got is this guy
		alexander feklisov, aka alexander fomin,
		declared consul to the soviet embassy,
		but in reality the kgb papa spy.  an
		illustrious tour of duty during the
		great patriotic war gets him on the
		party fast track, various tours of duty
		in kgb, american postings.  he's an
		expert on us, and... that's all we've
		got on papa spy.

				kenny
		who's he talking for?  is it khruschev,
		or is this more bullshit?

	kenny stands, runs his hands through his hair, aggravated.

				kenny (cont'd)
		how do you become the kgb top spy in the
		united states?

				sheridan
		gotta know someone.

	kenny whirls on sheridan.  a frozen beat.

				kenny
		politics is politics.  walter.
			(whirling on agents)
		khruschev is the moscow party boss under
		stalin.  give me their career
		chronologies!

	walter pushes a typed dateline of khruschev's major career
	moves, and one of the agents hands kenny a list of fomin's
	postings.  he lays them side by side.  and for every step of
	khruschev's, there's a step for fomin.  not only that, but
	the dates are identical or nearly so.

				kenny (cont'd)
		every time khruschev moves up, fomin
		does within a year...
			(tracing up the list)
		khruschev was the administrator in
		charge of preparing moscow's defenses
		during the war.  and fomin... was here
		in the u.s.

	kenny's face falls.  but a young fbi agent cuts in.

				young fbi agent
		not at first.

	the young fbi agent proffers him a file.  kenny snatches it.

				young fbi agent (cont'd)
		he was an engineer stationed outside
		moscow in '42.  specialized in tank
		traps.

	kenny looks up at walter.  walter nods sagely, lights a pipe.

				kenny
		they know each other.  they're war
		buddies.

				sheridan
		it's thin.  but real life usually is.

	a phone on the table shrills, shattering the silent triumph.

				kenny
		hello?

				the president (o.s.)
		i've got to move.  what do you have,
		kenny?

				kenny
		they know each other!  khruschev and
		feklisov aka fomin were war buddies!

				the president (o.s.)
		you're sure...

				kenny
		don't take it to court, but we've got
		good circumstantial evidence...
			(off walter's nod)
		walter agrees.  my gut's telling me
		khruschev's turning to a trusted old
		friend to carry his message.

				the president (o.s.)
		okay, ken.  we're going.
