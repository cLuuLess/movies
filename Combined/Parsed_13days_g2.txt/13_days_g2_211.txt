	int. hall outside kenny's office - day

	super: saturday, october 27th.  day 12.

	kenny, in his overcoat, steps aside as a pair of duty
	officers race past him, almost bowling him over. 
	he slows as he nears the doors to his office and the oval
	office, discovering:

	total chaos.  excom guys, assistants, dart to and from the
	offices and halls.  on all their faces grim expressions. 
	kenny stands there a beat in confusion.  and then bobby
	swings out of kenny's office.  there's a desperate edge to
	bobby's voice.
