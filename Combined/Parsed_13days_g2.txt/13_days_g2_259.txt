	ext. portico - continuous

	-- onto the portico.  standing there in the dark, by the
	white neoclassical pillars of the cloister, are bobby and the
	president.  they're holding drinks.  kenny joins them.

	the president gestures out across the south lawn to the
	gleaming washington monument.

				the president
		we were just debating who had it worse,
		us or george washington and his guys.

				bobby
		he didn't have to worry about nuclear
		weapons.

				the president
		yeah, but the country didn't even exist
		as a country yet.  it was a mess, and he
		didn't have a leg to stand on.

				kenny
		all he had was his character.

	the president and bobby nod at the justice of that remark.

				bobby
		how does a guy get a rep like that?

				the president
		doesn't matter to me.  if i went down in
		history like adams, i'd die happy.  all
		they say about him today is --

				kenny
		-- he kept the peace.

	kenny looks at the president.  the president feels it, and
	gazes back to him.

	the three of them stare out at the glittering city.  the
	grandness of the world lies before them, and they are
	deciding its fate, and are humbled by the awfulness of it. 
	the silence is beyond power.

	and for a long moment, they know not to disturb it.  there is
	nothing left to say.  the president, at last, finishes his
	drink.

				the president
		you know, we never did control it.  not
		really.  not like we think.

	he looks at kenny.  kenny nods.  he knows that now too.

				the president (cont'd)
		but we did our best.  now it's up to
		them.
