	ext. stratosphere - moments later

	the twilight, in-between, world of the stratosphere.  far
	below -- clouds, shining blue day.  above, stars and the
	indigo depths of space.  we hang in utter silence.

	a silver glint appears in the center of the horizon.  it
	grows larger.  then larger still.  it is the u-2.  we barely
	have time to register the rising hiss of its engines, when it
	fills the screen and booms past, leaving us standing still.

	the camera pans to follow it, but it's already dwindled to a
	speck, and we feel how fast 600 miles an hour really is.
