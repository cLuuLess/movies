	int. kenny's office - day

	as the meeting next door disperses, the president rummages
	through kenny's jacket which hangs on kenny's chair.  kenny,
	bemused, holds out the package of cigarettes the president is
	looking for.

				kenny
		i was hoping lemay pushed you.  i
		wouldn't mind going a few rounds with
		him.

	the president glances up, takes the proffered smokes.

				the president
		we knew it was coming.  i tell you,
		kenny, these brass hats have one big
		advantage.  we do what they want us to,
		none of us will be alive to tell 'em
		they were wrong.

	bobby, rusk and sorensen enter from the hall.

				sorensen
		mr. president, gromyko should be on his
		way by now.

				rusk
		we need to go over what you're going to
		say.

				bobby
		there's still no sign they know that we
		know about the missiles.  been a lot of
		cloud cover; probably think we aren't
		getting any good product.

				the president
		we keep 'em in the dark as long as we
		can.  but i sure as hell am going to
		test him.
