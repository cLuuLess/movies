	int. kenny's office - day

	the press corps throngs kenny's tiny office, pushing and
	shoving for a vantage at the side door to the oval office,
	waiting for the gromyko photo-op.  kenny stands shoulder-to
	shoulder with reston and sorensen near the door.

				reston
		are they going to discuss the military
		exercises going on in florida?

	kenny doesn't even blink, but sorensen does a poorer job at
	hiding his reaction.

				kenny
		come on, scotty.  this meeting's been on
		the books for months.  it's just a
		friendly talk on u.s.-soviet relations.

	fortunately, the conversation is cut short as a dozen
	flashbulbs suddenly go off on a dozen cameras as the
	reporters crush in on the oval office, and reston is swept
	forward.

	kenny's pov:

	over the reporters.  the president, unsmiling, enters the
	room beside soviet foreign minister, andrei gromyko.  gromyko
	pauses for the photos: grim, dark haired, saturnine.

	resume

	kenny reacts.  at last, the face of the enemy.
