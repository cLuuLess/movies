	ecker jumps down from the cockpit ladder and turns an eye to
	his battered, pock-marked plane.  wilhemy and the ground crew
	chief come running up, the chief letting out a whistle.

				ground crew chief
		lookit what daddy done brung home.

				wilhemy
		you shoulda seen it, chief, they --

				ecker
		-- damn sparrows.  must've been
		migrating.  guess i hit a couple
		hundred.
			(to wilhemy, stern)
		how many did you hit, bruce?

	wilhemy stands there, looking at ecker, not sure what to make
	of him.  the crew chief just starts laughing as more
	impressed ground crew come up.

				wilhemy
		a few.  i guess.

				ground crew chief
		was them 20 or 40 million sparrows?

	ecker, sweat-plastered and foul, steps into the chief's face.

				ecker
		those are bird strikes.  sparrows to be
		precise.  got a problem with that?

	the chief stands there, glances at the plane one more time,
	and shakes his head, 'no.'  ecker takes the chief's
	maintenance clipboard from him, writes in big bold marker:
	bird strikes.  he thrusts it back into the chief's hands and
	walks off; the astonished wilhemy remains behind.
