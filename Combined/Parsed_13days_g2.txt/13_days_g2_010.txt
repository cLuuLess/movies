	int. npic - day

	close on the five-thousand rolls of film spewing through
	processing equipment, its streaking passage leading us
	straight through the development machinery to:

	a series of various shots:

	photo interpreters power up light tables, stereoscopic
	viewers, zip across the floor in wheeled chairs.

	flying switches, flickering lights, humming motors.  it's an
	eerie dance of technological black magic.

	another pair of interpreters loom out of the darkness, side
	by side, ghostly looking, their glasses reflecting the glare
	of the light table, like magicians staring into a crystal
	ball.

	images fill the screen

	aerial shots, flashing by.  cuban countryside from 72,500
	feet.  a magnifying glass swings down on its arm in front of
	us, magnifying the carpet of trees... and a row of six canvas
	covered objects among them.
