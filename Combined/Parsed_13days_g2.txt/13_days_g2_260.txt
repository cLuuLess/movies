	ext. o'donnell driveway - night

	kenny's limo pulls away, leaving kenny, coat in hand, at the
	bottom of his driveway.  he watches it go, silently urging it
	to return for him with some call from the president telling
	him he's desperately needed.  but it doesn't.

	he turns to his house.  the lights are all out.

	he notices he's clutching the handle of his briefcase.  his
	knuckles are white.  with conscious effort, he unfolds his
	hand, letting the briefcase drop on the driveway.

	he stands alone, stripped of his friends, his family, his
	job... and in that moment, mute, impotent in the shadow of
	armageddon, kenny is our everyman of the nuclear age.
