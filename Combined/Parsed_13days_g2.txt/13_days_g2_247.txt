	ext. west wing driveway - night

	a long shot: bobby emerges from the west wing in his
	overcoat, briefcase in hand.  he pauses, tiny, alone.  the
	west wing - and all its imposing spotlit power behind him -
	reduced to this insignificant man on his eleventh-hour
	mission.

	and then, out of the shadows, in the f.g., steps kenny in his
	own coat, his breath frosting in the late-night air.  bobby
	sees him, and knows he is not so alone anymore.

	on the driveway

	they meet in front of the limo.  bobby stops, shuffles his
	things, awkward.

				bobby
		what do you want?  a good-bye kiss?

	kenny opens the driver's side door.  the secret service limo
	driver peers out.

				limo driver
		hey, kenny.

				kenny
		hey, joe.  listen, i'll take care of
		him.  go ahead in, grab some coffee. 
		we'll be back pretty quick.

				limo driver
		you sure?

	kenny's nod and look -- there's no arguing.  the limo driver
	hops out, and kenny gets in.  bobby stands there outside for
	a beat.  he tries to hide how touched he is, but can't
	completely.

				kenny
		what's the matter with you?  forget how
		to open a car door?
