	ext. runway - key west naval air station - day

	a cart speeds down the flight line past the waiting f8u-1p
	corsairs.  one by one, the four pilots accompanying ecker and
	wilhemy jump off to mount their planes.  the cart still
	moving.

				ecker
		get that fuel assayed?

				wilhemy
		yeah.  it sucks.  ain't for high
		performance babies like ours.  shoulda
		brought some from home, but what can you
		do?  last-second deployments...

	wilhemy jumps off, then they're at ecker's plane, and he
	jumps off.  too late to worry about bad fuel now.  he hoists
	himself up and into the cockpit of the sleek navy jet.
