	int. west wing - day

	kenny and mcnamara enter the white house from the south lawn. 
	they stride down the hall, side by side.

				kenny
		moving the line.  stroke of genius.

				mcnamara
			(snappish)
		of course it is.  but the president
		needs to realize we're going to have to
		stop a ship eventually.

	they turn a corner, silence for a beat.

				kenny
		the chiefs are looking for a provocation
		out there.  the president's going to
		come under enormous pressure.  you have
		to keep 'em on a short leash, bob.

	mcnamara spares kenny a short, nasty look.

				mcnamara
		you must think i'm blind and stupid. 
		i've already gotten the birds and bees
		from bobby.  the president doesn't have
		to double-barrel me.

				kenny
		listen to me, goddamn it.  we're talking
		about a possible nuclear war.  you
		dropped the ball on bay of pigs --

				mcnamara
		-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, i didn't
		drop --

				kenny
		you were in the room.  it was your
		purview.  it was your job to make sure
		bissel wasn't fucking us over and you
		didn't do it.  you've got the most
		important job in the world right now. 
		you're the smartest guy the president
		has.
			(beat)
		besides me.

	that gets an amused snort from mcnamara, breaking the
	tension.

				mcnamara
		anybody ever tell you you're an
		egomaniac and a prick, o'donnell?

	kenny stares him in the eye, serious, hushed.  a friend.

				kenny
		you need to be the best you've ever
		been.

	mcnamara enters the elevator.  he turns, stands there facing
	kenny for a dramatic beat.  then the doors close.
