	ext. patio - jim rowe's house - night

	a crowded d.c. party spills out of jim rowe's house onto his
	patio.  kenny steps into frame.  he looks at the partygoers,
	the washington social set.  he stands out, oppressed by the
	knowledge he's unable to share.  he takes a stiff drink.

	suddenly out of the house totters adlai, highball in hand. 
	glassy-eyed, he grins at kenny and joins him.

				adlai
		just can't get away from you guys. 
		escaping for a night on the town, eh?

				kenny
		as the town's most popular playboy, the
		president felt my presence would be
		sorely missed.  so in the interests of
		national security...

	kenny shrugs.  adlai takes a long drink, closes his eyes.

				adlai
		gotta keep up appearances.  of course, i
		don't care anymore.  i'm a political
		dead man.  you ever seen a man cut his
		own throat like i did today?

	kenny has no answer to that.  he looks down, pained for
	adlai.

				adlai (cont'd)
		well, it's all right.
			(beat)
		i came to tell you, just talked to a
		friend.  reston and frankel have the
		story.  it's going to run tomorrow.
