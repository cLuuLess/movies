		all right, sir.  let me ask you one
		simple question.  do you, ambassador
		zorin, deny that the u.s.s.r. has placed
		and is placing medium and intermediate
		range missiles and sites in cuba?  yes
		or no - don't wait for the translation -
		yes or no?

	the diplomatic world gasps as adlai drops all pretense of
	civility, all statesman-like grace.
