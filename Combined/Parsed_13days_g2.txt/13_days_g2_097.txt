	int. oval office - continuous

	the president and kenny stand in front of the president's
	desk.  all the doors are shut.  weak sunlight filters into
	the hushed room as if to a confessional.

				kenny
		i don't like what's happening.

				the president
		in the morning i'm taking charge of the
		blockade from the situation room. 
		mcnamara'll set up shop in the flag plot
		at the pentagon, keep an eye on things
		there.

				kenny
		all right.  'cause you get armed
		boarders climbing into soviet ships,
		shots being fired across bows...

				the president
		i know, i know...

				kenny
		what about these low-level flights? 
		they're starting in what?  an hour?  do
		you realize what you're letting yourself
		in for?

				the president
		we need those flights.  we have to know
		when those missiles become operational,
		because when they do, we need to destroy
		them.

				kenny
		fair enough.  but castro's on alert and
		we're flying attack planes over their
		sites, on the deck.  there's no way for
		them to know they're carrying cameras,
		not bombs.  they're going to be shot at,
		plain and simple.

	kenny's right, and the president looks away in frustration.

				kenny (cont'd)
		i'm your political advisor, and i'm
		giving you political analysis here. 
		this is a setup.  the chiefs want to go
		in.  it's the only way they can redeem
		themselves for the bay of pigs.  they
		have to go in, and they have to do it
		right.  it's that simple. 

				the president
		i'm gonna protect those pilots.

	thep president stares intently at kenny.  kenny glances at
	the door, his voice hushed.  he hesitates.

				kenny
		they're boxing us in with these rules of
		engagement.  if you agree to 'em, and
		one of our planes gets knocked down or
		one of the ships won't stop for
		inspection, the chiefs will have us by
		the balls and will force us to start
		shooting.  they want a war, and they're
		arranging things to get one.  if you
		don't want one, we have to do something
		about it.

	the president understands.  he shakes his head, paces away.

				the president
		how does a man get to a place where he
		can say, 'throw those lives away,' so
		easily?

				kenny
		maybe it's harder for them to say it
		than they let on. 
		at the very least, they believe it's in
		our best interest.  and at the end of
		the day, they may end up being right.

	the president turns away, considers.  then turns back.

				the president
		triple check everything the chiefs say
		to us with the guys who actually have to
		do it.  no one's to know about this but
		bobby.  i need redundant control over
		what happens out there.  and if things
		aren't as advertised, you're going to
		make sure they come out the way i want
		them to come out, starting with this low
		level flight thing.

	jesus christ...kenny is daunted.  for a beat he just stares.

				kenny
		that's going to be tough.  you know how
		these guys are about their chains of
		command...

				the president
		any problems, you remind them those
		chains of commands end at one place. 
		me.
