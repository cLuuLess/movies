               ext. main street. a few moments later

               the sheriff walks along with terry. terry, very self-conscious 
               about smelling like pot, fumbles to light a cigarette. the 
               sheriff does not seem to notice.

                                     sheriff
                         -- sammy says she's gettin' postcards 
                         from all across the country.

                                     terry
                         yeah, i've been all over the place...

               they stop outside dawson's.

                                     sheriff
                         well, it's good to have you back 
                         here, i'll tell you that.

                                     terry
                         thanks, darryl. keep enforcing the 
                         peace.

                                     sheriff
                         well, that'll be a little harder now 
                         that you're home, but i'll do what i 
                         can.

                                     terry
                         no, man, i'm reformed.

                                     sheriff
                         oh, yeah. good to see you, kid.

                                     terry
                         thanks, darryl.

               darryl walks away. terry stands outside the restaurant looking 
               for sammy.

               behind him in the restaurant sammy is sitting at a table, 
               talking to the waitress.

               she sees terry and gets up immediately, smiling like crazy 
               as she threads her way through the tables toward the door.

               terry turns and sees her. he breaks into a big smile, tosses 
               his cigarette and goes into the restaurant. through the window 
               we see them make their way toward each other.

               sammy throws her arms around him. he hugs her back with a 
               big involuntary smile as the glass door slowly closes.
