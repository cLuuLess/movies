                         you're awfully quiet.

                                     sammy
                         i'm sorry.

                                     bob
                         um... have you thought at all about 
                         what i said?

                                     sammy
                         of course i've been thinking about 
                         it.

                                     bob
                         so... any decisions? or -- do you 
                         still want to think about it some 
                         more...?

                                     sammy
                         well -- i mean -- i don't know, bob. 
                         i mean, we haven't exactly been going 
                         steady the last few months, if you 
                         know what i mean --

                                     bob
                         yeah, no, i know --

                                     sammy
                         -- and then we see each other twice 
                         and you suddenly say you want to get 
                         married? i mean...

                                     bob
                         no, you're right, you're right --

                                     sammy
                         what are you talking about?

               pause.

                                     bob
                         i don't know... i... maybe this is... 
                         last year i sort of thought you were 
                         possibly interested in that... idea... 
                         but i was the one who, you know, 
                         wasn't "ready" at that point -- so 
                         that's why i thought things kind of 
                         slowed down with us...

                                     sammy
                         don't make me feel bad for you.

                                     bob
                              (bristling)
                         i don't want you to feel bad for me.
