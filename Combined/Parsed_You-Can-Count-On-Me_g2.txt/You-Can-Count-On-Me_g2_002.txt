               ext. the prescotts' front door. night

               the shadow of a big man looms up onto the front door. a big 
               finger rings the bell.

               a moment.

               amy, a thirteen-year-old baby-sitter with braces, opens the 
               door and looks up. in the b.g. we see two children, sammy 
               (samantha) and terry prescott, in their pajamas, lying on 
               their stomachs in the living room, watching television. sammy 
               is eleven. terry is eight.

               reverse: darryl, the sheriff, a portly fellow with glasses 
               and a mustache, looks down at amy.

                                     sheriff
                         hello, amy.

                                     amy
                              (puzzled)
                         hi, darryl.

                                     sheriff
                              (thinking)
                         amy, would you please tell the kids 
                         you'll be right back, and then shut 
                         the door and come outside to talk to 
                         us for a minute?

                                     amy
                         ok.
                              (to kids)
                         be right back, you guys!

                                     sammy
                         you're not supposed to go out, amy.

                                     terry
                         she's going to smoke a cigarette.

               amy closes the door and looks expectantly up at darryl. darryl 
               doesn't know how to start.
