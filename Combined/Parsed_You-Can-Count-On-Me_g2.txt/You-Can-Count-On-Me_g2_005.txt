               ext. scottsville cemetery. sixteen years later. day

               on the beautiful hill overlooking the beautiful windy green 
               country, sammy, twenty-seven years old now, puts flowers on 
               her parents' graves with quick, practiced movements.

               she is a nice-looking young woman of a neat appearance, saved 
               from primness by an elusive, pleasantly flustered quality. 
               an unsuccessfully neat person. she is dressed in office 
               clothes -- white blouse, dark skirt, high heels, light 
               raincoat over everything. she picks out a couple of weeds 
               and then bows her head and closes her eyes.

               credits end.
