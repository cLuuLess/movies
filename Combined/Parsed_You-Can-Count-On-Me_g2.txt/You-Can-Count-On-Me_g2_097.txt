               int. pub. night

               brian and sammy sit at a table in the corner of the dimly 
               lit pub. it's a medium noisy place with various locals 
               drinking beers and eating hamburgers and chicken dinners.

                                     sammy
                         last i heard, rudy's dad was living 
                         over in auburn. but that was last 
                         year.

                                     brian
                         must be so tough raising a kid on 
                         your own... although i'm beginning 
                         to get the idea my wife wouldn't 
                         mind a crack at it.

                                     sammy
                         oh... it's just the hormones.

                                     brian
                         well, no, it isn't. but never mind.

               the waitress brings them two boilermakers.

               sammy and brian thanks.

               she leaves. sammy and brian pick up their shots.

                                     brian
                         well, here's to improved employee-
                         management relations.

                                     sammy
                         amen.

               they click shot glasses and drink.

                                     sammy
                         you can't judge all of scottsville 
                         by the people in that bank, believe 
                         me.

                                     brian
                         well -- let's -- let's not talk about 
                         the bank.

                                     sammy
                         ok.

                                     brian
                         let's just forget about the bank for 
                         tonight.

                                     sammy
                         good idea.

               they sip their drinks, smiling. sammy looks at him 
               appraisingly.
