               int. bank -- hall. a few moments later

               sammy walks through the empty bank hall and into brian's 
               office. brian is at his desk.

                                     brian
                         you're working late.

                                     sammy
                         how did your wife like the bank?

                                     brian
                         oh, fine. she wasn't feeling so great.

                                     sammy
                         that's too bad.

                                     brian
                         no -- i don't mean -- she's not ill. 
                         she's just... i don't know...

                                     sammy
                         pregnant?

                                     brian
                         that's it. she's pregnant.

                                     sammy
                         it can make you kind of cranky.

                                     brian
                         yeah...

               pause.

                                     brian
                         listen, i'm sorry we've been stepping 
                         on each other's toes -- i -- i'm not 
                         actually that bad a guy --

                                     sammy
                         yeah, i am too... i know you're not, 
                         brian, but you're driving everybody 
                         crazy.

                                     brian
                         well, i -- i'm just trying to do my 
                         best here -- and i'm gettin' it from 
                         all sides.

                                     sammy
                         i know you are...

                                     brian
                         anyway... we'll work it out...

                                     sammy
                         well... i could use a beer.

                                     brian
                         i could use a tranquilizer.
