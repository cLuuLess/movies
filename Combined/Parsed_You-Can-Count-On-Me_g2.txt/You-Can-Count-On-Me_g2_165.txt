               ext./int. car. day

               the car stops across the street from the bus. the last kids 
               are getting in. sammy honks for the bus driver, and sammy, 
               terry and rudy all get out.

                                     terry
                         so rudy... if i write you a letter, 
                         will you write me back?

                                     rudy
                         yeah.

                                     terry
                         ok, well, that's gonna be pretty 
                         nice for you, because i write a pretty 
                         goddamn interesting letter.

                                     rudy
                         yeah, we'll see.

                                     terry
                         all right. well, say good-bye.

                                     rudy
                         bye.

               rudy hugs terry. terry hugs him back. he is suddenly overcome 
               and presses his lips to the top of rudy's head.

               rudy walks to the bus and gets on. the bus pulls away.

               alone now, sammy and terry are not that comfortable. he moves 
               to get back in the car, and she does the same.
