               int. rudy's bedroom. night

               the door opens, and terry comes in, smoking a cigarette. 
               he's plastered. he looks around the room. looks at rudy's 
               toys. picks up some superhero comics and sits on rudy's bed. 
               then he spies rudy's composition book, picks it up and starts 
               reading it.

                                     rudy (o.c.)
                         what are you doing?

               terry looks up. rudy is half-sitting up in bed.

                                     terry
                         oh -- just readin' some of your 
                         compositions.

                                     rudy
                         why are you smoking?

                                     terry
                         um... because it's bad. don't ever 
                         do it.

                                     rudy
                         i won't.

                                     terry
                         you know this used to be my room?

                                     rudy
                         yeah...
                              (pause)
                         do you want it back?

                                     terry
                         no.

               rudy is very relieved. terry keeps reading. rudy watches 
               him.

                                     rudy
                         did you fight in vietnam?

                                     terry
                         no. i wasn't even born yet.

                                     rudy
                         were you ever in the army?

                                     terry
                         no.

                                     rudy
                         my father was in the army.

                                     terry
                         i know. unfortunately he didn't fight 
                         in vietnam either.

                                     rudy
                         were you friends with him?

                                     terry
                         not really. we had some friends in 
                         common, i guess... i didn't like him 
                         very much.

                                     rudy
                         why not?

                                     terry
                         well, he wasn't very likable.

                                     rudy
                         why do you say that?

                                     terry
                         i don't know. he was always -- he 
                         always had to be better than you at 
                         everything. you know. like if you 
                         were all playing basketball or 
                         something, everybody's havin' like a 
                         friendly game and he's like ready to 
                         kill somebody if his team didn't 
                         win. or like if you told like a joke 
                         or a story, he always had to tell a 
                         better one? kinda gets annoying after 
                         a while. plus it was pretty scummy 
                         how he split on your mom and you... 
                         he was a prick. probably still a 
                         prick. fortunately for you though, 
                         your mom is like, the greatest. so 
                         you had some bad luck and you had 
                         some good luck.
                              (pause)
                         you mind if i ask you a personal 
                         question?

                                     rudy
                         i don't know.

                                     terry
                         do you like it here? i mean, in 
                         scottsville?

                                     rudy
                         yeah...?

                                     terry
                         why?

                                     rudy
                         i don't know. my friends are here... 
                         i like the scenery... i don't know.

                                     terry
                         i know, i know, but it's so... there's 
                         nothing to do here.

                                     rudy
                         yes there is.

                                     terry
                         no there isn't, man! it's narrow. 
                         it's dull. it's a dull, narrow town 
                         full of dull, narrow people who don't 
                         know anything except... what things 
                         are like right around here. they 
                         have no perspective whatsoever. no 
                         scope. they might as well be living 
                         in the nineteenth century because 
                         they have no idea what's going on, 
                         and if you try to tell 'em that, 
                         they wanna fuckin' kill you.

                                     rudy
                         what are you talking about?

                                     terry
                         i don't know...

               terry lies on his back and smokes.

                                     terry
                         you're a good kid.
