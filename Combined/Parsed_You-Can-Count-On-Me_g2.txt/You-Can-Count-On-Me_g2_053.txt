               ext. orrin's backyard. day

               terry and rudy are banging nails with ray, a young guy terry's 
               age. terry, hammering with swift, accurate blows, glances up 
               and watches rudy for a second. rudy is hammering away with 
               no great skill.

                                     terry
                         hey. look.

               he moves rudy's hand down toward the end of the handle.

                                     terry
                         you hold it further down, you're 
                         gonna get a lot more power. you should 
                         be able to put that nail down with 
                         two or three hits. look:

               with two swift strokes he drives the nail flush into the 
               wood.

                                     terry
                         try it.

                                     rudy
                         that's not the way i hold it.

                                     terry
                         well, the way you hold it is wrong.

                                     rudy
                         why can't i just do it my own way?

               terry looks at him unsympathetically for a moment.

                                     terry
                              (shrugs)
                         you can.

               he goes back to work. rudy resumes hammering. after a moment 
               he switches his grip and starts hammering terry's way. terry 
               looks up and watches him.
