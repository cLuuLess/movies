               int. sammy's car (moving). day

               the morning sunlight flickers through the windshield into 
               the car as sammy drives along toward work. she passes the 
               town hall clock and sees that it's 9:20.

               she dries her damp cheek with a forearm and rolls down her 
               window to let the morning breeze blow through.

               squaring her shoulders a little, she drives through town at 
               a slow and easy pace.
