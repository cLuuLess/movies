               int. sammy's kitchen. day

               sammy, terry and rudy sit at the kitchen table. sammy is 
               dressed for work. rudy is dressed for school. terry is also 
               fully dressed, drinking the last dregs of a mug of coffee. 
               he is tired, but listening to sammy very carefully, as if 
               receiving difficult and critical instructions.

                                     sammy
                         ok. so we'll drop rudy off at the 
                         bus, then all you have to do is drop 
                         me off at the bank, and just pick 
                         rudy up at 3:30 in front of town 
                         hall, and drive him over to carol's 
                         house. and that's it. she's on harvey 
                         lane, right past where the dewitts 
                         used to live.

                                     terry
                         ok.

                                     sammy
                         rudy knows where she lives.

               terry glances at rudy, then back at sammy.

                                     terry
                         ok.
