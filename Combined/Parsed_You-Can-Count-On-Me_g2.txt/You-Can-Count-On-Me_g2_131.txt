               int. motel. day

               brian sits on the edge of one of the beds watching some 
               daytime sunday show on the motel tv. there is a knock at the 
               door. he gets up, turns off the tv and opens the door. it's 
               sammy.

                                     sammy
                         sorry i'm so late.

                                     brian
                         yeah, i was just about to give up on 
                         you.

                                     sammy
                         well -- maybe it would've been better 
                         if you had...

               she comes into the room and starts walking around briskly 
               and nervously.

                                     sammy
                         i mean -- look, i don't mean to be 
                         unsympathetic about your domestic 
                         situation, whatever it is, but i'm 
                         just beginning to think that if people 
                         tried a little harder to stick to 
                         their commitments and started taking 
                         a little responsibility for their 
                         actions, they might end up having a 
                         lot less trouble generally. that's 
                         all.

                                     brian
                         hey, that's what i've been trying to 
                         tell you guys at the bank.

                                     sammy
                         well, i really don't think i can do 
                         this anymore.

                                     brian
                         ok.
