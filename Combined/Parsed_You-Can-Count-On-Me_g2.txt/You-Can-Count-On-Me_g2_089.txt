               the rain on the roof makes a sleepy, pleasant country sound.

               terry is lying on the sofa, smoking a joint, watching tv, in 
               a funk. o.c. we loud banging on the pipes.

               later: a young plumber, about terry's age, comes thumping 
               down the stairs and goes into the living room, carrying his 
               toolbox. terry looks up at him.

                                     plumber
                         ok, you're all set.

               terry glares at him. the plumber turns and goes out.
