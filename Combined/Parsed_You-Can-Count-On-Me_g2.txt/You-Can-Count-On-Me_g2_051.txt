               int. sammy's car (moving). day

               terry and rudy drive in silence. terry glances at rudy.

                                     terry
                         put on your seat belt.

                                     rudy
                         it pushes on my neck.

                                     terry
                         what?

                                     rudy
                         it pushes on my neck. it's 
                         uncomfortable.

                                     terry
                         well, when somebody slams into us 
                         and you go sailin' through the 
                         windshield, that's liable to be 
                         uncomfortable too. so put on your 
                         seat belt.

               rudy puts on his seat belt.

                                     rudy
                         mom's parents died in a car accident.

                                     terry
                         i know. they're my parents too.

                                     rudy
                         they are?

                                     terry
                         well, yeah. your mom is my sister.

                                     rudy
                         yeah, i know.

                                     terry
                         so that means we have the same 
                         parents.

                                     rudy
                         oh yeah.

               they drive in silence for a moment. terry glances down at 
               rudy.
