               int. motel room. night

               the room is dark. sammy and brian are asleep, half under the 
               covers. sammy wakes with a start.

                                     sammy
                         what time is it?

                                     brian
                              (startled awake)
                         what's the matter?

               sammy looks at the clock radio. 9:20.

                                     sammy
                         oh my gosh.

               a few moments later: sammy and brian are on opposite sides 
               of the bed, getting dressed.

                                     brian
                         hey, you know, nancy's gonna be gone 
                         for the rest of the week...

                                     sammy
                         you know... brian...

                                     brian
                         yeah?

                                     sammy
                         well, i don't want to... i mean, 
                         couldn't we just... i mean, could we 
                         give it a rest?

               pause.

                                     brian
                         um -- yeah. sure. if you want to.

                                     sammy
                         i mean... i just think... i don't 
                         know: we had a great little fling. 
                         you know? let's not push it.
                              (pause)
                         i mean, is that ok? i just --

                                     brian
                         yeah. sure. ok. you're right.

               pause.

                                     sammy
                         so are we still friends?

                                     brian
                              (nods tersely)
                         mm hm. sure.

                                     sammy
                         all right. good...!
