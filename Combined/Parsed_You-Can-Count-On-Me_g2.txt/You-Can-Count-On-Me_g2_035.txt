               int. dawson's -- at their table. a few moments later

               terry is studying the menu, over-intently. sammy is beaming 
               at him.

                                     terry
                         sorry about yesterday --

                                     sammy
                         i don't care --

                                     terry
                         i was studying the bus description... 
                         and i just... i got on the wrong bus -- 
                         i mean i missed my stop --

                                     sammy
                         i don't care, terry. i'm just so 
                         glad to see you...!

                                     terry
                         i'm glad to see you too, sammy. um... 
                         are you coming from work?

                                     sammy
                         um, no, it's saturday...

                                     terry
                         yeah, no, it's just... you're dressed 
                         so formally...

                                     sammy
                         oh. no. you know, i just thought i'd -- 
                         you know i thought it was a special 
                         occasion... which it is...

                                     terry
                         no, it's good. i thought i'd dress 
                         up too.

               he gestures to his shitty clothes.

                                     sammy
                         that's ok. you look fine.

                                     terry
                              (a strange, 
                              unsuccessful joke)
                         yeah, this is the haute cuisine of 
                         garments.

                                     sammy
                         what?

                                     terry
                         nothing, nothing... um... so how are 
                         you?

                                     sammy
                         i'm fine.

                                     terry
                         how's rudy?

                                     sammy
                         we're fine, terry. how are you?
                              (pause)
                         i mean --

                                     terry
                         yeah...

                                     sammy
                         -- where have you been lately, terry?

                                     terry
                         -- i know, i haven't been --

                                     sammy
                         i got a postcard from you from 
                         alaska...?

                                     terry
                         yeah, i was up there for a while...

                                     sammy
                         but that was in the fall, terry...

                                     terry
                         yeah, i know i've been out of touch...

                                     sammy
                         i was a little worried.
                              (pause)
                         i mean --

                                     terry
                         oh, i been a lotta different places... 
                         um... i went down to florida for a 
                         while... i was doing some work in 
                         orlando... i've been all over the 
                         place.

                                     sammy
                         well... i just wish you would have 
                         let me know you were ok...

                                     terry
                         yeah. i didn't realize it'd been so 
                         long...

               he looks around the restaurant.

                                     sammy
                              (beaming again)
                         are you gonna stay in town for a 
                         while?

                                     terry
                         well, i don't know... i got all these 
                         things i gotta do back in worcester...

                                     sammy
                         oh...

                                     terry
                         ...yeah, so i'm probably not gonna 
                         be able to stay more than a day or 
                         so...

                                     sammy
                         oh... well... that's all right...!

                                     terry
                         ...i'm kind of trying to keep to a 
                         schedule of sorts. it's a long and 
                         worthy story but i won't trouble you 
                         with it right now.

               he twists around and looks all over the restaurant. she 
               watches him.

                                     sammy
                         are you expecting someone?

                                     terry
                         who would i be expecting here?

                                     sammy
                         you just keep looking around, that's 
                         all.

                                     terry
                         no, i was just wondering if we could 
                         get some more refreshments, actually.

               he laughs. looks down. silence. he looks up at her.

                                     terry
                         i've actually got to confess to you, 
                         sammy... that the reason you may not 
                         have heard from me for a little while 
                         is that i've been kind of unable to 
                         write... on account of the fact that 
                         i was in jail for a little while.

                                     sammy
                         you were what?

               a couple of people in the restaurant look at them. terry 
               notices but sammy does not.

                                     terry
                         well, i did a little time, i guess, 
                         in florida. for, uh, just for 
                         bullshit...

                                     sammy
                         what?!

                                     terry
                         it was just bullshit...

                                     sammy
                         what did you do?

                                     terry
                         i didn't do anything. does it occur 
                         to you that maybe i was wronged?

                                     sammy
                         no!

                                     terry
                         well, could i please --

                                     sammy
                         oh my god! --

                                     terry
                         would you please let me --

                                     sammy
                         -- what happened?!

                                     terry
                         i got into a fight in a bar down in 
                         florida. which i was not the one who 
                         instigated it, at all. but they worked 
                         up all this bullshit against me and 
                         they threw me in the pen for three 
                         months. i didn't write you because i 
                         didn't want you to get all upset 
                         about it. i just figured you'd figure 
                         i was on the road for a little while. 
                         i know it was stupid and i'm sorry. 
                         i really didn't mean to make you 
                         worry. but you know what? i can't 
                         run around all the time doin' stuff 
                         or not doin' stuff because it's gonna 
                         make you worry! because then i come 
                         back here, and i tell you about my 
                         fuckin'... traumas, and i get this 
                         wounded little "i've let you down" 
                         bullshit, over and over again, and 
                         it really just -- cramps me! like i 
                         just want to get out from under it!... 
                         and here i am back in this fuckin' 
                         hole explaining myself to you again!

                                     sammy
                         ok -- can you please stop cursing at 
                         me?

                                     terry
                         i mean, i realize i'm in no position 
                         to, uh, basically say anything, ever -- 
                         but it's not like i'm down there in 
                         some redneck bar in florida having 
                         an argument with some stripper's 
                         boyfriend and i suddenly think, "hey! 
                         maybe this'd be a good time to really 
                         stick it to sammy and get myself 
                         locked up for a few months."

                                     sammy
                         i'm sorry.

                                     terry
                         me too, man. i mean "welcome home."

                                     sammy
                         hey -- you don't write me for six 
                         months, i have no idea where you are --

                                     terry
                         i'm sorry --

                                     sammy
                         -- i don't know if you're alive or 
                         dead --

                                     terry
                         i'm sorry --

                                     sammy
                         -- and then you show up out of nowhere 
                         and tell me you were in jail?

                                     terry
                         i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry, 
                         sammy, i'm really sorry...!

               the patrons are all either looking at them or trying not to 
               look. silence.

                                     terry
                         sammy...

                                     sammy
                         what?

                                     terry
                         um... i'm in the midst of a slight 
                         predicament...

                                     sammy
                         what do you need? money?

                                     terry
                         um... yeah... i'm broke. i gotta get 
                         back to worcester tomorrow. i got 
                         this girl there, and she's kind of 
                         in a bad situation...? i just need 
                         to borrow some money. whatever you 
                         can spare.

                         i'll pay you back... i'll pay you 
                         back, man.

                                     sammy
                         i really wish mom was here.

                                     terry
                         so do i, man.

                                     sammy
                         nobody knows what to do with you.

                                     terry
                         i know how they feel, man.

               silence, except for the sounds of the restaurant.

                                     sammy
                         terry? can i ask you something?

                                     terry
                         sure.

                                     sammy
                              (with some difficulty)
                         well -- i mean, do you ever go to 
                         church anymore?

                                     terry
                         come on, sammy, can we not talk about 
                         that shit?

                                     sammy
                         do you?

                                     terry
                         um -- no, sammy. i don't.

                                     sammy
                         can you tell me why not?

                                     terry
                         um, yeah. because i think it's 
                         ridiculous.

                                     sammy
                         well -- can you tell me without like, 
                         denigrating what i believe in?

                                     terry
                         because i think it's primitive, ok? 
                         i think it's a fairy tale.

                                     sammy
                         well -- i mean, have you ever 
                         considered that maybe that's part of 
                         what's making things so difficult 
                         for you?

                                     terry
                         no.

                                     sammy
                         -- that you've lost hold of -- well, 
                         not just your religious feeling, but 
                         lost hold of any kind of anchor, any 
                         kind of trust in anything... i mean 
                         no wonder you drift around so much. 
                         what could ever stop you? how would 
                         you ever know if you had found the 
                         right thing?

                                     terry
                         well, uh, i'm not really looking for 
                         anything, man. i'm just, like, trying 
                         to get on with it.

               the waitress approaches with their salads.

                                     waitress
                         here we go...

               she sets them down on the table.

               sammy and terry thank you.

               the waitress leaves. silence. terry picks at his salad. sammy 
               doesn't touch hers. she watches him miserably.
