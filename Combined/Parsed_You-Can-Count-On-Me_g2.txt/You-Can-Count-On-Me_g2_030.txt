               loud country-western music is blaring as sammy, wearing an 
               apron, sets a big vase of flowers on the kitchen table and 
               hurries to the oven. there are also cookies, a pie, evidence 
               of massive fancy cooking. she puts on her oven mitts and 
               takes a lasagna out of the oven, as the phone rings. she 
               picks up.
