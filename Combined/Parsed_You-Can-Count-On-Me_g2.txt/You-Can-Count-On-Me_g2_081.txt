               terry is putting a butterfly band-aid on sammy's wound. it's 
               a nasty, bloody gash, just shy of needing stitches.

                                     sammy
                         i've got a great idea. why don't you 
                         let me call the plumber?

                         do whatever you want.

                                     sammy
                         oh, does that make you mad?

                                     terry
                         no...
