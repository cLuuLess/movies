               int. bank -- brian's office. day

               the rain runs down brian's office window. brian, in a wet 
               raincoat, turns on his light.

               a moment later: brian turns on his pc. the screen lights up. 
               the colors are a garish green and orange.

                                                                    cut to:

               later: sammy and brian are both on their feet. the door is 
               closed.

                                     sammy
                         brian, get off my ass!

                                     brian
                         excuse me?

                                     sammy
                         i didn't change the colors on your 
                         stupid computer screen.

                                     brian
                         well, that's all you gotta say!

                                     sammy
                              (on "that's")
                         there is nothing wrong with the work 
                         i do here. i have been doing just 
                         fine, the whole time before you came 
                         here -- and if you think that riding 
                         people in this petty, ridiculous way 
                         is the way to improve service in 
                         this bank or anywhere else i think 
                         you're out of your mind!

               pause.

                                     brian
                         i didn't say there was. could i please -- 
                         could i please -- may i respond?

                                     sammy
                         no, that's really all i have to --

                                     brian
                         may i respond?
                              (beat)
                         first of all, i don't appreciate 
                         being spoken to with that kind of 
                         language. that's not the way i talk 
                         to you, and i'd appreciate it if you 
                         wouldn't talk that way to me --

                                     sammy
                         well --

                                     brian
                         second of all, if you say you didn't 
                         change the colors on my computer 
                         screen, then of course i accept your 
                         answer. but you and i are gonna have 
                         to find a way to work together --

                                     sammy
                         brian --

                                     brian
                         but that's not gonna happen with the 
                         attitude, it's not gonna happen with 
                         the lateness, it's not gonna happen 
                         by fighting me every step of the way -- 
                         ok, well not you, you're not late, 
                         but too much of that stuff goes on 
                         around here --

                                     sammy
                         i am not late and i do not have an 
                         attitude -- well then don't tell me 
                         i'm late if i'm not late!

                                     brian
                         i'd really like to finish!

               outside brian's office: the whole staff is listening to the 
               muffled raised voices from inside the office.

               mabel especially is listening guiltily.
