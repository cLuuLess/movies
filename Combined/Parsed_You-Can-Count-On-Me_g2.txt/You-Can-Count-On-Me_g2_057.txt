               int. dining room. night

               sammy, terry and rudy sit at dinner. the atmosphere is lively 
               and cheerful.

                                     sammy
                         ...and eddy dwyer lives in buffalo, 
                         with his wife and two sons, if you 
                         can believe it.

                                     terry
                         that is depressing.

                                     sammy
                         why?

                                     terry
                         he just never struck me as the 
                         marrying type, that's all.

                                     rudy
                         who are you talking about?

                                     terry
                         wild kids we used to know.

                                     rudy
                         were you a wild kid?

                                     terry
                         not compared to your mom.

                                     rudy
                         yeah, right.

                                     terry
                         you don't believe me?

                                     rudy
                         no.

                                     terry
                         ask her.

                                     rudy
                         mom, were you?

                                     sammy
                         no comment.

               rudy is amazed. terry looks at him like, "told you so."
