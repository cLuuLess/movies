               int. brian's office. later

               sammy sits in front of brian's desk. brian is behind the 
               desk listening.

                                     sammy
                         -- so i always just run out at 3:15 
                         to pick him up and then run him real 
                         quick over to the sitter's house. 
                         anyway, larry never minded about it 
                         and i was just hoping it would be ok 
                         with you too...

                                     brian
                         well -- samantha -- i realize that 
                         scottsville is not exactly a major 
                         banking center...

                                     sammy
                         no it's not...

                                     brian
                         no -- i know it's not... but it's 
                         kind of a personal challenge to me 
                         to see what we can do to bring local 
                         service up to the same kinds of 
                         standards we'd be trying to meet if 
                         we were the biggest branch in the 
                         state. and that means i don't want 
                         anybody running out at 3:15 or 3:30, 
                         or whenever the bus happens to come 
                         in that day. now is there anybody 
                         else who can pick your son up after 
                         school? does your husband work in 
                         the area? do you --

                                     sammy
                         oh -- no -- rudy sr. isn't "on the 
                         scene." so to speak.

                                     brian
                         well, i can give you a couple of 
                         days to make some other arrangement, 
                         but...

                                     sammy
                         well -- brian? i understand what 
                         you're saying, and i think it's great. 
                         i do. because there's a lot of things 
                         around here that could use some 
                         attention. believe me. but i've 
                         honestly been meeting that bus every 
                         day for four years now and it really 
                         does take just fifteen minutes, and 
                         if i take the time out of my lunch 
                         hour...

                                     brian
                         i'd really prefer it if you would 
                         make some other arrangement. ok?

                                     sammy
                              (brightly)
                         i'll do my best...!

               brian kicks back in his chair and puts his hands behind his 
               head.

                                     brian
                         how old's your son?

                                     sammy
                         he's eight.

                                     brian
                         that's a terrific age.
