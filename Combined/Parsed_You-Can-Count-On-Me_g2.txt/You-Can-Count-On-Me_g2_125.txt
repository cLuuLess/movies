               sammy sits by the phone in her bathrobe. she picks it up and 
               dials.

               intercut: brian's living room. nancy, watching tv on the 
               sofa with brian, picks up the ringing phone.

                                     nancy
                              (into the phone)
                         hello?

               sammy hangs up. she gets up, walks around, sits down again.

               himself, picks up the phone.

                                     bob
                              (into the phone)
                         hello?

               sammy hangs up. pause. she sweeps the telephone and answering 
               machine off the nightstand. pause. she calms down and puts 
               them back. the ancient answering machine is clicking 
               convulsively. she whacks it and it stops.
