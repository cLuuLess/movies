               ext. bench. day

               sammy and terry sit on a bench near the bus stop. terry's 
               backpack is by his side.

                                     sammy
                         do you need some cash for the bus?

                                     terry
                         no, i got a few bucks... aren't you 
                         gonna be late for work?

                                     sammy
                         oh -- yeah. that's ok.
                              (pause)
                         terry, i don't even know where you're 
                         going.

                                     terry
                         oh, well, i didn't really have a 
                         concrete plan yet. i have to go back 
                         to worcester and get my stuff...

                                     sammy
                         oh, are you gonna try to see that 
                         girl?

                                     terry
                         well... yeah... you know... thought 
                         maybe i'd try to show my face... let 
                         her brother have a crack at me...

                                     sammy
                         what?

                                     terry
                         no...

                                     sammy
                         ...i don't want anyone to have a 
                         crack at you.

                                     terry
                         i'm just kidding. i just thought... 
                         just thought i'd check up on her...
                              (pause)
                         anyway, after that, i don't really 
                         know. i've been thinking about alaska 
                         a lot. i still got some friends out 
                         there. i don't really know. anyway, 
                         i'll write you.

                                     sammy
                         you will?

                                     terry
                         sure, sammy. of course i will. you 
                         know that.

               pause.

                                     sammy
                         what is gonna happen to you?

                                     terry
                         nothing too bad... but i gotta tell 
                         you, i know things didn't work out 
                         too well this time...

                                     sammy
                         well, terry --

                                     terry
                         ...but it's always really good to 
                         know that wherever i am, whatever 
                         stupid shit i'm doing, you're back 
                         at my home, rooting for me.

                                     sammy
                         i do root for you.

               she starts crying, and looks down.

                                     terry
                         come on, sammy. everything's gonna 
                         be all right... comparatively... and 
                         i'll be back this way...

                                     sammy
                         i feel like i'm never gonna see you 
                         again...!

                                     terry
                         of course you will, sammy. you never 
                         have to worry about that.

                                     sammy
                         please don't go till you know where 
                         you're going. please...!

                                     terry
                         i do know where i'm going. i'm going 
                         to worcester and i'm gonna try to 
                         see that girl. and then depending on 
                         what happens there, i thought i'd 
                         try to see if there's any work for 
                         me out west. and if there is, i'm 
                         gonna head out there for the summer 
                         and try to make some money. and if 
                         there isn't, i'll figure something 
                         else out. maybe i'll stay around the 
                         east. i don't know... i really liked 
                         it in alaska. it was really beautiful. 
                         you just -- it made me feel good. 
                         and before things got so messed up i 
                         was doin' pretty well out there. 
                         seriously. but i couldn't stay here 
                         long, sammy: i don't want to live 
                         here. but i'm gonna stay in touch. 
                         and i'll be back. 'cause i want to 
                         see you and i want to see rudy. i'll 
                         come home for christmas. how about 
                         that? we'll have christmas together.
                              (pause)
                         come on, sammy. you can trust me...

               still looking down, sammy shakes her head, tears leaking 
               down her cheeks.

                                     terry
                         come on, sammy... look at me... look 
                         at me...

               she looks at him.

                                     terry
                         hey, sammy... remember when we were 
                         kids, remember what we always used 
                         to say to each other . . .?
                              (pause)
                         remember when we were kids?

                                     sammy
                         of course i do...!

               she throws her arms around his neck. he pats her gently.
