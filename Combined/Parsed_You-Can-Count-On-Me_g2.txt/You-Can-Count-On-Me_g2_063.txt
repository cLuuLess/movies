               int. bank -- brian's office. day

               sammy listens to brian.

                                     brian
                         yeah. this doesn't apply to you 
                         directly, sammy, but i've noticed 
                         that some of the employees have their 
                         pc monitors set with all kinds of 
                         crazy colors... purple and polka 
                         dots or what have you. and it's not 
                         a big deal, but really, this is a 
                         bank. you know? it's not really 
                         appropriate. so i'm just asking that 
                         people stick to a more quote unquote 
                         normal range of colors in future...

               sammy looks at him blankly.

                                     brian
                         like i say, it doesn't really apply 
                         to you.

                                     sammy
                         no, my computer palette's pretty 
                         conservative.
