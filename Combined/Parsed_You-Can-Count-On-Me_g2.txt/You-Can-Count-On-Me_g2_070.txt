               int. hallway. night

               bob and sammy -- cleaned up and wearing a different outfit -- 
               are bustling out the front door. terry stands by.

                                     sammy
                         now, call if there's any problem, 
                         and if i'm not there, i'm either on 
                         my way or on my way back home.

                                     terry
                         ok.

               sammy gets into her coat. bob opens the front door.

                                     sammy
                              (to terry)
                         so lights out at ten... and don't 
                         spend the whole night watching tv.

                                     terry
                         nice to meet you, bob.

                                     bob
                         you too.

                                     terry
                              (to sammy)
                         what's your idea of the whole night?

                                     sammy
                         two hours tops.

               bob holds the door for sammy and smiles at her. there is 
               some confusion about who should go out first. finally she 
               goes and bob follows. the atmosphere between them is fairly 
               awkward.
