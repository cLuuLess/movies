               sammy sits in front of brian's desk.

                                     brian
                         well... i'm sorry you're havin' all 
                         this trouble...

                                     sammy
                         thank you.

                                     brian
                         but you made a pretty good speech to 
                         me yesterday about people sticking 
                         to their commitments...

                                     sammy
                         yeah...?

                                     brian
                         well... you made a commitment to 
                         this bank, sammy. to this job.

                                     sammy
                         i know i'd --

                                     brian
                         and to working things out with this 
                         tough new son of a bitch boss of 
                         yours. and whatever might have passed 
                         between us after hours doesn't mean 
                         you just walk away from that 
                         commitment -- yeah, even when you 
                         have a legitimate family emergency.

                                     sammy
                         i'm really sorry i didn't --

                                     brian
                         which is why i think in the calm 
                         cold light of day, we should both 
                         think real hard about whether or not 
                         you really want to continue on here 
                         at merchants national trust.

                                     sammy
                         you're not serious.

                                     brian
                         ...you're not happy, i'm not happy, 
                         it's not good for you and it sure as 
                         heck isn't good for the bank.

               pause.

                                     sammy
                         you know you're the worst manager 
                         we've ever had?

                                     brian
                         come on, sammy...

                                     sammy
                         by far the worst.

                                     brian
                         ...i don't wanna trade insults with 
                         you.

                                     sammy
                         well, i don't want to be fired, brian. 
                         i've been working here for seven 
                         years.

                                     brian
                         well --

                                     sammy
                         and if i were you i'd be a little 
                         nervous about firing an employee i 
                         just had an affair with. ok?

                                     brian
                         that's -- don't threaten me, sammy: 
                         i'm not threatening you. i -- it's 
                         just an area i think we should 
                         explore.

                                     sammy
                         i'm not thr -- you explore it. i'm 
                         going back to work.

               she heads for the door, stops.

                                     sammy
                         oh, and i have to pick up rudy today 
                         because there's no one else to do 
                         it. but i'll find someone as soon as 
                         i have time.

                                     brian
                         yeah. fine. why don't you just take 
                         over the whole bank?

               sammy hesitates in the doorway. this thought has never 
               occurred to her before. she goes out.
