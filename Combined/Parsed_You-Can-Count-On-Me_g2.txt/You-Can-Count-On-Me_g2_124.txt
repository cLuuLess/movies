               int. hallway. night

               sammy and terry are in the hallway. sammy holds a stack of 
               folded sheets.

                                     sammy
                         i realize that you're mad at me --

                                     terry
                              (deadpan)
                         i'm not mad at you...

                                     sammy
                         -- but he didn't do anything to you. 
                         and you cannot promise a little boy 
                         that you're gonna --

                                     terry
                              (on "boy")
                         ...i just, you know, after all that 
                         religious conversation, i just 
                         realized it's probably not so good 
                         for him to be spending so much time 
                         with someone like me who doesn't 
                         believe his life is important in the 
                         scheme of things --

                                     sammy
                         would you please...

                                     terry
                         i'm serious.

                                     sammy
                              (practically choking)
                         listen.
                              (pause)
                         i am sure, if you put your mind to 
                         it, you can think of some other way 
                         of getting back at me besides this. 
                         so would you please just give it 
                         some thought, and take him fishing 
                         tomorrow?

                                     terry
                         i would, sammy, i just don't think 
                         it'd be good for him.

               pause.

                                     sammy
                         you suck.

               she throws the sheets at him and storms away. terry walks 
               through the living room and out the front door, slamming it 
               behind him.
