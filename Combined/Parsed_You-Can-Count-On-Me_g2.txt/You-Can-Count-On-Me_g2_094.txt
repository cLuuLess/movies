               rudy is in the car, somewhat dried off, waiting. sammy and 
               terry stand in the employee entrance doorway.

                                     sammy
                         look, i'm glad you guys are getting 
                         along so well -- like, you have no 
                         idea -- but if i can't rely on you 
                         to remember to get him once a day...

                                     terry
                         you can!

                                     sammy
                         -- and what are you doing taking him 
                         to play pool in the middle of the 
                         night, and then telling him to lie 
                         to me about it?

               pause.

                                     terry
