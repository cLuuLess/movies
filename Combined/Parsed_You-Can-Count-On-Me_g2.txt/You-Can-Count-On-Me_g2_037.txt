               int. sammy's car. day

               sammy and terry get in the car. sammy isn't saying anything.

                                     terry
                         where we going?

                                     sammy
                         to pick up rudy.

               she puts on her glasses and her seat belt. she won't look at 
               him.

                                     terry
                         well... do you not even want me to 
                         visit now? 'cause i can catch the 
                         bus at five o'clock if that's what 
                         you want.

                                     sammy
                         well, of course i want you to visit, 
                         you idiot! i've been looking forward 
                         to seeing you more than anything! 
                         i've been telling everyone i know 
                         that you were coming home! i cleaned 
                         the whole fucking house so it would 
                         look nice for you! i thought you 
                         were gonna stay for at least a few 
                         days! it didn't occur to me that you 
                         were just broke again. i wish you 
                         would have just sent me an invoice!

               she stops. terry is now totally contrite.
