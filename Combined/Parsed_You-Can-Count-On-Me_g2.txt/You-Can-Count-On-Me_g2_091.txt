               int. bank. day

               brian is showing his wife, nancy, the bank. he is very 
               solicitous of her, nervously introducing her to the employees, 
               who are not responding very warmly. nancy is not in a warm 
               mood either; she's very testy with brian.

                                     brian
                         this is chuck. chuck, this is my 
                         wife, nancy.

                                     chuck
                         hello.

                                     nancy
                         nice to meet you.

                                     brian
                         this is mabel...

                                     mabel
                         hi.

                                     nancy
                         nice to meet you.

               sammy, at her desk, watches brian and nancy make their 
               progress through the bank. nobody is being very friendly, 
               and brian suddenly seems awkward and vulnerable. brian and 
               nancy reach sammy's desk.

                                     brian
                         this is sammy, our lending officer. 
                         sammy, this is my wife, nancy.

                                     sammy
                              (friendly)
                         hi. it's nice to meet you.

                                     nancy
                         brian -- i gotta sit down.

                                     brian
                         sure -- let's go in my office.

               he glances nervously at sammy as he leads nancy away from 
               her desk and toward his office. he murmurs something to nancy, 
               who responds in a low but very testy voice:

                                     nancy
                         i'm fine...!

               she roughly pulls her arm away from his. sammy watches them 
               go into his office.
