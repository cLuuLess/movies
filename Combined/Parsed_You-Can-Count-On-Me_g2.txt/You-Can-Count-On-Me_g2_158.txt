               ext. cemetery. day

               terry walks through the little cemetery gate and makes his 
               way up the hill through the tombstones. he reaches his 
               parents' graves. he looks at the tombstones for a moment. he 
               puts his hand on top of one headstone, then the other.

               he sits down and smokes. he looks up at the sky. it's a 
               beautiful deep blue sky dotted with billowy white clouds.

               he looks out over the hilly scenery. after a moment he shakes 
               his head a few times. he doesn't even know he's doing it. he 
               sits there.
