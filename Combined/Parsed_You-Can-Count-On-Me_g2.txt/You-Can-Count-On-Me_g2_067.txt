               int. sammy's house -- downstairs hall. night

               terry is holding a broom looking up at the ceiling. sammy 
               passes by and stops.

                                     sammy
                         what's up?

               terry taps the broom handle against the ceiling.

                                     terry
                         do you know you have an enormous 
                         leak from the upstairs hall?

               he pokes again. a portion of the ceiling collapses on his 
               head in wet chunks of plaster and muck.

                                     sammy
