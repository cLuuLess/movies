               ext. church. day

               the congregation is coming out of the church and milling 
               around at the steps. sammy, with rudy at her side, is saying 
               good-bye to some neighbors. she watches pregnant nancy and 
               brian go down the steps.

               pov sammy: beyond brian and nancy, terry pulls up at the 
               curb in her car. he rummages around and produces fishing 
               rods which he waves, somewhat sheepishly.

               reverse: at top speed, rudy runs away from sammy and the 
               church, toward terry and the car. terry and sammy exchange a 
               look from the distance.
