               int. town church. day

               it's a small church and a small congregation, but it's full. 
               there's a choir of mostly senior citizens arrayed in the 
               back. two closed caskets are laid out in front of the 
               minister, a fiftyish woman with thick glasses and salt-and-
               pepper hair, who is giving a eulogy mos.

               among the mourners in the second row sit terry and sammy, 
               both redeyed, and uncomfortable in their dress-up clothes. 
               their aunt ruth, a pinch-faced woman in her forties, sits 
               next to them.

               sammy and terry are holding hands tightly. terry wipes his 
               eyes with his free hand.

               the minister addresses her remarks to the children. sammy is 
               hanging on the minister's every word; terry is shifting his 
               eyes and his seat as if it will kill him to sit still another 
               minute.

                                                               dissolve to:
