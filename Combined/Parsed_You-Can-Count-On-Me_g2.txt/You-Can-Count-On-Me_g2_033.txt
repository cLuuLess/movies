               ext. main street. a few moments later

               terry, fairly well stoned, walks along main street. a skinny 
               man emerges from his hardware store to greet terry and shake 
               hands. terry says "hi," but keeps on walking. he passes some 
               other people.

               he almost runs right into sheriff darryl, sixteen years fatter 
               and grayer.

                                     sheriff
                         whoa there!

                                     terry
                         sorry.

               the sheriff recognizes terry and breaks into a big smile.

                                     sheriff
                         god damn! terry prescott! how you 
                         doin'? gimme a cuddle!

               the sheriff gives terry a big bear hug. terry is wasted and 
               selfconscious but smiling. he pats the sheriff's back.

                                     terry
                         how you doin', darryl?

                                     sheriff

                                     terry

                                     sheriff
