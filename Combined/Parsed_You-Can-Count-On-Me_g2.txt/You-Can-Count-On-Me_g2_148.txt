                         that wasn't him. i heard him tell 
                         the cops.

                                     sammy
                         no -- rudy -- that was him. but that 
                         was him. i wish it wasn't, but it 
                         was.

                                     rudy
                              (very quiet)
                         no it wasn't.

                                     sammy
                         rudy. yes it was. your father's name
