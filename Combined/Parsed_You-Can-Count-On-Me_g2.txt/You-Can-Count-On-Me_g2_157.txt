               int. kitchen. day

               sammy is at the stove, making pancakes. she puts a last 
               pancake onto rudy's plate and brings it to him.

                                     sammy
                         well, i called where uncle terry 
                         said he was gonna stay, and there 
                         was no answer, so i don't know if 
                         he's still in town or not.

               rudy doesn't answer.

                                     sammy
                         rudy? are you not speaking to me?

               rudy doesn't answer.

                                     sammy
                         well, i'm sorry you're so mad at me, 
                         but i only did what i thought i had 
                         to do, and i hope you don't stay mad 
                         at me for the rest of your life.

               he opens the maple syrup and pours it on the pancakes.

                                     sammy
                         rudy, that's too much.

               he keeps pouring. she grabs the bottle from him and upsets 
               some of the dishes on the table.

                                     sammy
                         you gotta cut this out!

                                     rudy
                         what did i do?

                                     sammy
                         you don't know what you're talking 
                         about! there was nothing else i could 
                         do! i can't explain it better than 
                         that, but you can't go on like this 
                         because you don't know anything about 
                         it and you don't know what you're 
                         doing!

                                     rudy
                              (frightened)
                         ok, i'm sorry!

                                     sammy
                         i don't want you to be sorry, i just 
                         want you to stop it!

                                     rudy
                         i will! i will! i'm stopping, i'm 
                         sorry.

               he comes around the table to her.

                                     rudy
                         see? i'm stopping! i'm not doing it. 
                         see? i'm not.

               he's very alarmed. sammy looks at him for a long moment.
