               int. brian's office. day

               brian is at his desk, busy working between stacks of papers. 
               she knocks on the open door.

                                     brian
                         yeah!
                              (looks up)
                         hi, sammy. what can i do for you?

                                     sammy
                         um, brian? did you want us to turn 
                         this time sheet in at the end of the 
                         day, or do you want it at the end of 
                         the week...?

                                     brian
                         oh, yeah, end of the day'll be fine.

                                     sammy
                         seems like an awful lot of extra 
                         paperwork...

               brian hesitates, shrugs and smiles.

                                     brian
                         i like paperwork.

               sammy looks at him with a blank smile.
