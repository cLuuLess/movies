               int. dawson's grill. night

               sammy and bob steegerson are eating dinner at dawson's, the 
               only fancy restaurant in town. bob is in his mid-thirties, a 
               realtor, a decent, ordinary guy.

                                     sammy
                         anyway, bob, it's sort of this 
                         adventure story, and rudy's father 
                         is this secret agent or something, 
                         working for the government... and it 
                         just made me feel weird. you know? 
                         because i never really say much to 
                         him about rudy sr., because i don't 
                         know what to say. and i don't know 
                         whether i should just let him imagine 
                         whatever he wants to imagine, or 
                         whether i should sit him down sometime 
                         and tell him, you know, that his 
                         father is not such a nice person. 
                         you know?

                                     bob
                         well... i don't know, sammy. what 
                         have you told him already?

                                     sammy
                         not much. he knows i don't have the 
                         highest opinion of him. and he knows 
                         i don't want to see him or know 
                         anything about him, ever. but i tried 
                         to keep it kind of neutral. anyway... 
                         i could go into a lot more detail, 
                         believe me.

                                     bob
                         well... it's an interesting problem. 
                         but i don't really know what to tell 
                         you... it's a little outside my 
                         personal field of expertise...

                                     sammy
                         all right.

                                     bob
                         i'd be glad to give it some thought...

                                     sammy
                         ok.

               he is smiling at her.

                                     sammy
                         what?

                                     bob
                         nothing... i'm just glad to see you... 
                         i'm glad you called me.

                                     sammy
                         i bet you were surprised...!

                                     bob
                         um -- a little.

               bob drains his wineglass. sammy cuts at her steak.
