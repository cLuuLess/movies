               the house is dark. terry and rudy are walking from the car 
               to the house.

                                     rudy
                         we creamed those guys! we creamed 
                         them!

                                     terry
                              (stopping suddenly)
                         ssh...! don't move.

               they listen. a car is coming.

                                     terry
                         it's them!

               they break for the door, terry fumbling for his key. he gets 
               the door open.

                                     terry
                         go! go! go!

               he and rudy run inside the house. the lights go on. bob's 
               car pulls into the driveway.
