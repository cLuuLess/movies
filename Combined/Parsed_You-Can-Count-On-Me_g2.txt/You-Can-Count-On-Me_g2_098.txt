               int./ext. brian's car/wooded road. night

               sammy and brian are making out in the front seat of his car. 
               this goes on for a while, getting heavier and heavier.

                                     brian
                         sammy?

                                     sammy
                         yeah?

                                     brian
                         i want you to tell me who changed 
                         the colors on my computer screen.

                                     sammy
                         i'll never tell.

               they start kissing again in the cramped space. brian bangs 
               his head. they laugh.
