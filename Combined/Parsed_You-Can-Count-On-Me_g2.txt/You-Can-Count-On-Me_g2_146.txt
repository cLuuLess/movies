               ext. auburn police station. day

               on the steps of the police station, sammy, rudy and bob wait 
               as sheriff darryl shakes hands with the auburn sheriff. the 
               auburn sheriff goes inside. darryl comes over to sammy.

                                     sheriff
                         it's gonna be all right... we got on 
                         the phone and talked to rudy sr. a 
                         little bit and he's calmed down, 
                         just wants to forget about the whole 
                         thing...

                                     sammy
                         darryl, i really appreciate this...

               the sheriff nods, but he's not thrilled to be here.
