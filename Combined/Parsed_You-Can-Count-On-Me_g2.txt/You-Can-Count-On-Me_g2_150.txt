               int. living room. night

               terry is watching tv on the sofa with his feet up on the 
               coffee table. sammy comes down the stairs and into the living 
               room. he keeps watching tv. she doesn't sit. she is trembling.

                                     sammy
                         could you turn that off for a minute 
                         please?

               he turns off the tv.

                                     terry
                         you don't have to say anything, sammy.

                                     sammy
                         i want you to leave.

               terry looks at her.

                                     terry
                         what do you mean?

                                     sammy
                         i mean i don't think you should live 
                         here anymore. i don't think you know 
                         how to behave around an eight-year-
                         old and i don't know how to make you 
                         stop, so i think you shouldn't live 
                         here. i don't know what else to say.

                                     terry
                         i don't know how to behave around an 
                         eight-year-old?

                                     sammy
                         that's right --

                                     terry
                         i think you don't know how to behave 
                         around an eight-year-old.

                                     sammy
                         are you out of your mind!?!

               silence.

                                     sammy
                         now you just listen to me. i may not 
                         be the greatest mother in the world, 
                         but i'm doing the best i know how. 
                         and he doesn't need you to rub his 
                         face in shit because you think it's 
                         good for him. he's going to find out 
                         the world is a horrible place and 
                         that people suck soon enough, and 
                         without any help from you. believe 
                         me!

               sammy tries to get ahold of herself. her voice is shaking.

                                     sammy
                         i think you should get your own place. 
                         i thought, if you want, you could -- 
                         i'll be glad to help you out 
                         financially --

                                     terry
                         what do you mean, get my own place?

                                     sammy
                         i mean i --

                                     terry
                         you mean in scottsville?

                                     sammy
                         yes.

                                     terry
                         why would i do that? why don't i 
                         just leave, period?

                                     sammy
                              (quietly)
                         well... if that's what you want to 
                         do, that's fine. but that's not what 
                         i'm saying. you are a very important 
                         person to rudy, and you are the most 
                         important person to me. but i'm saying 
                         that i can't take any more of this --

                                     terry
                         well --

                                     sammy
                         -- i thought -- maybe you could sell 
                         your half of the house to me, and i 
                         could pay you whatever it is over a 
                         certain amount of time, and that way --

                                     terry
                         no, you know what? i'll just go.

               he turns the tv back on.

                                     sammy
                              (very quietly)
                         well -- that's not what i'm saying.

               terry shrugs and watches tv.
