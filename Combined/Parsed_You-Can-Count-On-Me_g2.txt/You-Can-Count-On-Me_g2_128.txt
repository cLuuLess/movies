               int. ron's office. later

               sammy sits with ron.

                                     sammy
                         anyway... i don't know what the 
                         church's position is on adultery and 
                         fornication these days, but i felt 
                         really hypocritical not saying 
                         anything to you about it before, 
                         so... what is the official position 
                         on that stuff these days?

                                     ron
                         well... it's a sin.

                                     sammy
                         good: i think it should be.

                                     ron
                         ...but we don't tend to focus on 
                         that aspect of it, right off the bat --

                                     sammy
                         why not?

                                     ron
                         well --

                                     sammy
                         i think you should.

                                     ron
                         well --

                                     sammy
                         maybe it was better when you came in 
                         and they screamed at you for having 
                         sex with your married boss, and were 
                         really mean to you, and told you 
                         what a terrible thing it was. maybe 
                         it'd be better if you told me how 
                         i'm endangering my immortal soul, 
                         and if i don't quit i'm going to 
                         burn in hell. don't you ever think 
                         that?

                                     ron
                         um... no.

                                     sammy
                         well, it's a lot better than all 
                         this "why do you think you're in 
                         this situation" psychological bullshit 
                         you hear all the time.

                                     ron
                         well... why do you think you're in 
                         this situation?

                                     sammy
                         with which one?

                                     ron
                         all of them.

               pause.

                                     sammy
                         i feel sorry for them.
                              (pause)
                         isn't that ridiculous?

               ron shrugs: i.e., "not necessarily."
