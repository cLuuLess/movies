               int. sammy's living room. dusk

               the phone is ringing. sammy comes in the front door, terry 
               and rudy behind her. she snaps on the lights, hurries to the 
               phone and picks up.

               behind her, rudy goes upstairs and terry plunks down on the 
               sofa and turns on the tv.

                                     sammy
                         hello?

               intercut with brian, at the bank.

                                     brian
                         yeah, it's brian.

                                     sammy
                         brian --

                                     brian
                         what the hell happened to you today, 
                         lady?

               sammy is about to answer, but she just hangs up instead.

               brian is stunned into sheer gaping fury. feverishly he hangs 
               up and dials again. it rings.

               sammy picks up.

                                     sammy
                         hello?

                                     brian
                         you're fired!

                                     sammy
                         good!

               she hangs up again.
