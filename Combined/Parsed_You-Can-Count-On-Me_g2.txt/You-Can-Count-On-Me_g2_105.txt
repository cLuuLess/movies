               int. living room. night

               sammy, terry and rudy are all watching tv. sammy and rudy 
               are in pajamas. nobody's happy and nobody's talking.

               the phone rings. sammy goes to it and picks up, surprised 
               because of the hour.

                                     sammy
                              (into phone)
                         hello?

                                     brian
                              (on phone)
                         it's brian.

               sammy turns away and lowers her voice so terry and rudy won't 
               overhear her.

                                     sammy
                         brian. where are you?
