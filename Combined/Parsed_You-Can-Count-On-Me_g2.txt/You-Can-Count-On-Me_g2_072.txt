               ext. the wild moose. night

               the wild moose is a noisy roadside bar sitting under the 
               stars. terry and rudy get out of the car. rudy looks 
               apprehensive.

                                     rudy
                         i don't think they let kids in there.

                         well, we're not allowed to watch any 
                         more tv, so it's this or nothing... 
                         but if we run into any trouble, let 
                         me do the talking.

                                     rudy
                         ok.

               terry swings the door open.
