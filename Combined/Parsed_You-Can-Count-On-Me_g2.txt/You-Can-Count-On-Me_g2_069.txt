                         are you guys sure you're gonna be 
                         ok?

                                     terry
                         yes. yes.

               sammy approaches rudy and terry. they are bent over a big 
               nasty trench in the floorboard. there are wood shavings and 
               greasy pipe segments all over, and black smeary smudges on 
               the walls nearby.

                                     sammy
                         what is happening here?

                                     terry
                         it's just -- the problem is that the 
                         pipe is corroded all the way along 
                         the length of the hall. so every 
                         time i put in a new piece it starts 
                         leaking further down.

                                     sammy
                         why don't i just call the plumber?

                                     terry
                         why? he's not gonna do anything 
                         different than what i'm doing.

                                     rudy
                              (happily)
                         yeah. we're making it worse!

                                     terry
                         no we're not. shut up.

               terry yanks the wrench and a spray of filthy water comes out 
               of the pipe and splatters the wallpaper and pictures and 
               sammy with gritty gray water. she looks at them.

                                     sammy
                         thank you. thank you both.
