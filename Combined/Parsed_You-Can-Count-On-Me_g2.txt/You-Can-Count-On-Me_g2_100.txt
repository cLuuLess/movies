               int. kitchen. night

               the kitchen is dark. sammy comes in, her hair a little wet, 
               and turns on the light. she goes to the telephone.

               there's a note in terry's handwriting:

               "bob called."

                                     terry (o.c.)
                         where were you?

               sammy jumps, startled. terry is in the kitchen doorway.

                                     sammy
                         nowhere. i had dinner with my boss.

                                     terry
                         kind of a late dinner, ain't it?

                                     sammy
                         yeah. how was rudy?

                                     terry
                         fine.

                                     sammy
                         did the plumber come?

                                     terry
                         yes, the fucking plumber came.

                                     sammy
                         terry -- give me a break!!!

               pause.

                                     terry
                         what's the matter with you?

                                     sammy
                         nothing. i'm just tired.

                                     terry
                         you want to smoke some pot?

                                     sammy
