               sammy hurries down the clean hallway in the back past mabel, 
               a pleasant-faced fellow employee.

                                     mabel
                         guess who's been asking for you?

                                     sammy
                         oh no, really?

               mabel nods and passes by.

               sammy knocks on a big door that says "manager" and has half 
               the letters of the previous branch manager's name taken off 
               it.

                                     brian
                              (inside)
                         yeah, come in!

               sammy swings open the door. brian everett, the new branch 
               manager, is unpacking a box. sammy is surprised to see he is 
               in his early thirties and very good-looking in a boyish sort 
               of way; he wears shirt-sleeves and tie, and a wedding ring.

                                     sammy
                         mr. everett?

                                     brian
                         yeah: brian.

                                     sammy
                         brian. hi. i'm samantha prescott -- 
                         i'm the lending officer?

                                     brian
                         yeah, hi, how are you? come on in. 
                         sit down.

               sammy comes into the office and sits.

                                     sammy
                         i am so sorry i was late...

                                     brian
                         yeah, we missed you before...

                                     sammy
                         i got held up. believe me, it is not 
                         something i make a habit of...

                                     brian
                         i'm sure it's not. actually -- could 
                         you just, could you close that door 
                         for me? thanks.

               sammy gets up and closes the door.
