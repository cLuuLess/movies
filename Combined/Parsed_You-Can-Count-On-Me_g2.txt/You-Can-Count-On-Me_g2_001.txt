               int./ext. a car (moving). night

               the shifting lights from the odd passing car play over the 
               faces of mr. and mrs. prescott, a pleasant-looking couple in 
               their late thirties, dressed up for a night out. mr. prescott 
               drives them along a dark hilly two-lane highway.

                                     mrs. prescott
                         why do they always put braces on 
                         teenage girls at the exact moment 
                         when they're the most self-conscious 
                         about their appearance?

               pause.

                                     mr. prescott
                         i don't know.

               up ahead, near the top of the oncoming hill, a red pickup 
               truck is poking its nose out of the short exit lane.

                                     mrs. prescott
                         tom --

                                     mr. prescott
                         i see him...

               the pickup lurches into the road, with not nearly enough 
               time to spare.

                                     mrs. prescott
                         tom!

                                     mr. prescott
                         jesus!

               mr. prescott swerves over the double solid white line and 
               clears the truck as --

               another pair of headlights from an oncoming truck rises up 
               over the hill directly in front of them --

                                     mrs. prescott
                              (screams)
                         tom!

               mr. prescott's foot stomps on the brake. we black out and 
               there is the sound of a terrible crash.

                                                                    cut to:
