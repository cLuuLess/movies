               int. sammy's house -- living room. day

               terry, sammy and ron sit in the living room. sammy and ron 
               are drinking coffee. through the window we see occasional 
               glimpses of rudy playing basketball in the backyard. there 
               is a heavy silence in the room.

                                     terry
                         well... i'm not really sure why you're 
                         here, ron. i mean, i realize i haven't 
                         exactly been a model citizen since i 
                         got here, but compared to how things 
                         have been goin' for me lately, i 
                         thought i was doing pretty well.

               he turns to sammy.

                                     terry
                         and i also find it kind of 
                         discouraging that you seem to think 
                         i need some kind of spiritual 
                         counseling or what have you, so much 
                         so that you're willing to disregard 
                         the fact that i don't believe in any 
                         of this stuff at all --

                                     sammy
                         well... i didn't mean to discourage 
                         you --

                                     terry
                         i mean it's really kind of insulting.

                                     ron
                         can i say something here?
                              (pause)
                         sammy asked me to come and talk to 
                         you, because it's her opinion that 
                         you're not gonna find what you're 
                         looking for the way you're looking 
                         for it --

                                     terry
                         how would she know?

                                     ron
                         but i'm really not here to try to 
                         get you to do anything, or to believe 
                         anything. and i'll tell you the same 
                         thing i told her, which is that as 
                         far as i'm concerned the only way 
                         she can help you is by her example -- 
                         by trying to be a model for you, by 
                         the way she lives her life...

               terry smiles.

                                     ron
                         and that doesn't mean she's supposed 
                         to be a saint, either, if that's 
                         what you're smiling about.

                                     terry
                         i didn't realize i was smiling.

               a moment.

                                     ron
                         you know, terry, a lot of people 
                         come to see me with all kinds of 
                         problems. drugs, alcohol, marital 
                         problems, sexual problems, health 
                         problems --

                                     terry
                         great job you got.

                                     ron
                         well... i like it. because even in 
                         this little town, i feel like what i 
                         do is very connected with the real 
                         center of people's lives. i'm not 
                         saying i'm always mr. effective, but 
                         i don't feel like my life is off to 
                         the side of what's important. you 
                         know? i don't feel my happiness and 
                         comfort are based on closing my eyes 
                         to trouble within myself or trouble 
                         in other people. i don't feel like a 
                         negligible little scrap, floating 
                         around in some kind of empty void, 
                         with no sense of connectedness to 
                         anything around me except by virtue 
                         of whatever little philosophies i 
                         can scrape together on my own...

                                     terry
                         well --

                                     ron
                         can i ask you, terry: do you think 
                         your life is important?

                                     terry
                         you mean -- like, me personally, my 
                         individual life?

                                     ron
                         yeah.

                                     terry
                         well... i'm not sure -- what do you 
                         mean? it's important to me. i guess. 
                         and like, to my, you know, the people 
                         who care about me...

                                     ron
                         but do you think it's important?

                                     terry
                         i --

                                     ron
                         do you think it's important in the 
                         scheme of things? not just because 
                         it's yours, or because you're 
                         somebody's brother. because i don't 
                         really get the impression that you 
                         do.

                                     terry
                         well, i don't think... i don't 
                         particularly think anybody's life 
                         has any particular importance besides 
                         whatever -- you know -- whatever we 
                         arbitrarily give it. which is fine. 
                         i mean we might as well... i think 
                         i'm as important as anybody else...

               silence.

                                     terry
                         i don't know: a lot of what you're 
                         saying has a real appeal to me, ron. 
                         a lot of the stuff they told us when 
                         we were kids... but i don't want to 
                         believe something or not believe it 
                         because i might feel bad. i want to 
                         believe it because i think it's true 
                         or not... i'd like to think that my 
                         life is important... or that it's 
                         connected to something important...

                                     ron
                         well, isn't there any way for you to 
                         believe that without calling it god, 
                         or religion, or whatever term it is 
                         you object to?

                                     terry
                         yes. i believe that.
