               int. terry's apartment -- worcester, mass. night

               a tiny apartment with a bed, chair, table, fridge, and not 
               much else. one window has a broken pane and an old sheet 
               neatly thumbtacked over it to keep the wind out.

               terry prescott comes in. he is twenty-five years old: a real 
               mess with a certain natural appeal. he wears old jeans, very 
               old hiking boots, and a lumberjack-style coat. he takes a 
               wool hat off his head. his hair is longish and dirty.

               sheila sadler is sitting at the table by the fridge. she is 
               barely eighteen, frail and damaged.

                                     sheila
                         hey, terry.

                                     terry
                         hey.

               terry looks at her and smiles encouragingly. she smiles back.

                                     sheila
                         where'd you get the hat?

                                     terry
                         oh, i got it on the street for a 
                         dollar.

                                     sheila
                         it's nice.

                                     terry
                         well, you know, it's pretty much 
                         your standard woolen hat.

                                     sheila
                         yeah, i had a very similar reaction 
                         to it.

               sheila looks away. silence.

                                     terry
                         can i get that money from you?

                                     sheila
                         yeah. sorry.

               as she opens her purse, terry takes a few vague steps toward 
               her. she takes out a tiny hippie-ish woven wallet and gives 
               terry all the money in it: a twenty and two ones.

                                     terry
                         is that all you have?

                                     sheila
                         yeah.

                                     terry
                         can you borrow some cash from your 
                         brother?

                                     sheila
                         um, yeah, but that would involve 
                         speaking to him.

                                     terry
                         well, i'm definitely gonna be gone 
                         for a couple of days at least, sheila.

                                     sheila
                         why do you have to stay so long?

                                     terry
                         because my sister is not a bank, you 
                         know? i can't just show up and ask 
                         her for --

                                     sheila
                         you seem to think my brother's a 
                         bank!

                                     terry
                         oh sheila can we just cut out the 
                         puerile crap?! i'll be back just as 
                         soon as i can. ok? i am not the kind 
                         of man that everyone says i am.

                                     sheila
                         i know you're not.

                                     terry
                         i'll call you tonight.

               pause.

                                     sheila
                         don't you wanna tell me you love me?

                                     terry
                         i love you.

                                     sheila
                         that was really convincing.

                                     terry
                         well... i think after this is over 
                         you should seriously consider moving 
                         back home.

                                     sheila
                              (short laugh)
                         oh, yeah.

                                     terry
                              (gives up)
                         all right...

                                     sheila
                         you gonna call tonight?

                                     terry
                         definitely.

               she puts her arms around him and holds on.
