               int. living room. later

               rudy is on the floor, writing in his school composition 
               notebook. sammy comes downstairs.

                                     sammy
                         rudy? would it distract you if i put 
                         on some music?

                                     rudy
                         no.

               she puts on a cd, sits down and picks up a book. she looks 
               at rudy, who is writing away.

                                     sammy
                         did you think of a story?

                                     rudy
                         uh huh.

                                     sammy
                         what's it about?

                                     rudy
                         my father.

               pause.

                                     sammy
                         what about your father?

                                     rudy
                         it's just a made-up story about him.

                                     sammy
                         can i read it when you're done?

                                     rudy
                         it's not very good.

                                     sammy
                         don't say that.

               rudy keeps writing.
