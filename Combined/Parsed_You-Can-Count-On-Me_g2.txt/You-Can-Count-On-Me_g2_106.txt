                         i'm buying milk. i just thought i'd 
                         say hello.

               we cut between them. sammy doesn't say anything.

                                     brian
                         look, i know it's probably too late, 
                         but is there any way you can come 
                         out for a little while?

                                     sammy
                         brian, i think you're going crazy.

                                     brian
                         i know i am. can you meet me?

                                     sammy
