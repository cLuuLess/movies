               ext. the house. a moment later

               terry jumps out of ray's pickup. sammy opens the front door 
               and rudy runs out toward terry.

                                     rudy
                         hi!

                                     terry
                         hey, how's it goin', man?

               rudy stops short in front of terry. terry looks at sammy, in 
               the doorway.

                                     terry
                         sorry i'm late.
