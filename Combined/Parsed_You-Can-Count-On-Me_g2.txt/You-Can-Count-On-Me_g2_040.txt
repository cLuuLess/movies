               int. terry's room. night

               terry is sitting on the bed, addressing an envelope to sheila. 
               he puts the $300 in the envelope and seals it. he sees sammy 
               standing in the doorway. he starts to unlace his boots.

                                     sammy
                         do you have everything you need?

                                     terry
                         i think so.

               sammy comes into the room and sits next to him. he is very 
               busy with his laces.

                                     sammy
                         what are you going to do?

                                     terry
                         i don't know. send the money i guess.

                                     sammy
                         maybe you should stay home for a 
                         little while, terry.

                                     terry
                         yeah, maybe that'd be a good idea.

               he starts crying. sammy pats him.
