               int. sammy's car (moving). day

               terry and rudy drive along. terry looks down at rudy and 
               smiles. rudy is tense and won't look at him.

               over terry and rudy's shoulders as terry drives slowly past 
               dilapidated little houses in a very depressed residential 
               area. terry is scanning the house numbers.

                                     rudy
                         maybe we should call first.

                                     terry
                         well -- we're right here.

               he pulls up outside a small, plain, run-down ranch-style 
               house with a lot of junk out front, and gets out of the car. 
               rudy stays in.

                                     terry
                         come on.

               rudy gets out of the car and comes around. terry waits for 
               him, and then they walk up to the front door. the buzzer 
               says "kolinski."

                                     terry
                         there he is.

                                     rudy
                         his last name is kolinski?

                                     terry
                         yeah. ring the bell.

               rudy pushes the doorbell. they wait. there's some noise inside 
               and some voices. the sound of walking.

               the door opens. janie, a tired-looking young woman around 
               terry's age, opens the door.

                                     janie
                         yes?

                                     terry
                         hi. we're looking for rudy?

                                     janie
                         who should i say is calling?

                                     terry
                         an old friend.

                                     rudy sr. (o.c.)
                         who is it?

                                     janie
                         he says an old friend!

                                     rudy sr. (o.c.)
                         how old is he?

               rudy sr. appears behind janie. he's around thirty, wiry, 
               dressed in jeans and an old shirt. he doesn't look good. he 
               recognizes terry.

                                     rudy sr.
                         hey!

                                     terry
                         hey, rudy.

               rudy sr. sees rudy, who is looking up at him. his face falls.

                                     rudy sr.
                         hey.

               rudy doesn't answer.

                                     terry
                              (to janie)
                         hi, i'm terry.

                                     janie
                         hello.

                                     terry
                         and this is rudy.

                                     janie
                         you don't say.

                                     terry
                         rudy, meet rudy.

               rudy sr. looks away, shaking his head. janie moves away from 
               the door.

                                     janie
                         i'll just be in the kitchen.

                                     terry
                         nice to meet you.

               janie goes into the kitchen. rudy sr. watches her go.

                                     terry
                         ok if we come in for a minute?

                                     rudy sr.
                         what the hell are you doin'?

                                     terry
                         what do you mean what am i doin' --

               rudy sr. starts walking toward terry to make him go back out 
               the door.

                                     rudy sr.
                         could you step away from the door 
                         please?

                                     terry
                         well we just wanna --

                                     rudy sr.
                         could you step away from the door 
                         please?

                                     terry
                         all right, all right.

               they all go outside. rudy sr. pulls the door closed behind 
               him.

                                     rudy sr.
                         what are you doin' here?

                                     terry
                         i just wanted the kid to see you --

                                     rudy sr.
                         well, now he saw me.
                              (he looks at rudy)
                         now you saw me. ok?
                              (to terry)
                         now would you mind?

                                     terry
                         man, you are really --

                                     rudy sr.
                         look: i'm tryin' to be polite. so 
                         would you just take off? it's ok: 
                         just take off.

                                     terry
                         i just wanna --

                                     rudy sr.
                         do you know what you're doin'? just 
                         get outta here!

                                     terry
                         you know what, man? you're still a 
                         fuckin' asshole.

                                     rudy sr.
                         i'm an asshole? get outta here!

               rudy sr. shoves terry. terry belts him, and suddenly they 
               are throwing wild punches at each other. rudy goes sprawling 
               in the dirt.

               terry knocks rudy sr. down and starts pummeling him brutally. 
               janie comes out of the house and jumps on his back, trying 
               to pull him off.

                                     janie
                         get your fuckin' hands off him...!

               terry throws janie off him, grabs rudy sr. again and resumes 
               beating him up. janie jumps back on top of him.

               two neighbors run toward the melee to break it up.

                                                                    cut to:

               a few moments later: the cops have arrived. the 1st cop is 
               talking to rudy and janie. the 2nd cop is talking to terry. 
               rudy sr.'s face looks puffy and beaten up. a 3rd cop stands 
               apart with rudy, who is watching the whole thing. we cut 
               rapidly and jerkily through this section:

                                     1st cop
                         and you're not the boy's legal 
                         guardian?

                                     rudy sr.
                         i don't even know if that's my kid!

                                     janie
                         they just showed up! we never seen 
                         them before...

                                     rudy sr.
                         i used to know his sister --

                                     terry
                         i just came down here to talk to the 
                         guy and all of a sudden he starts 
                         shovin' me!

                                     2nd cop
                         listen up. listen up. you're gonna 
                         have to step back and just calm down --

                                     terry
                              (to rudy sr.)
                         you're a lyin' fuckin' piece of shit.

                                     2nd cop
                              (to terry)
                         you're gonna have to step back.

                                     janie
                         we have a right to protect ourselves. 
                         what else do you need to know?

               a moment later: the 2nd cop puts handcuffs on terry. rudy 
               watches.

                                     2nd cop
                         now give me your right hand...

                                     terry
                         this is such bullshit. he started 
                         the whole thing and you're arresting 
                         me?

                                     2nd cop
                         listen up. now -- listen up! stop 
                         talkin'. terry, stop talkin'.

                                                                    cut to:

               a moment later: as the 3rd cop walks rudy to one cop car, 
               rudy watches the 2nd cop guide the handcuffed terry into the 
               other car.

               rudy gets in the back of the car and looks out at rudy sr. 
               and janie talking to the 1st cop. rudy sr. is looking at him 
               over the 1st cop's shoulder.

                                     2nd cop
                         -- idea where we might be able to 
                         contact his mother?

                                     rudy sr.
                         no, because he's not my goddamn kid.

               the cop cars' doors slam first on terry and then on rudy.
