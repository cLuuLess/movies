               sammy comes down the stairs, fully dressed, into the living 
               room, where terry and rudy are still watching tv.

                                     sammy
                         um -- i have to go out for a minute. 
                         do you want anything?

                                     terry
                         like what?

                                     sammy
                         i don't know.

                                     rudy
                         where are you going?

                                     terry
                         yeah, where are you going?

                                     sammy
                         i just have to go out for a little 
                         while.

                                     rudy
                         where?

                                     terry
                         yeah, where?

                                     sammy
                         i just have to go to mabel's house.

                                     rudy
                         why?

                                     sammy
                         you know what, rudy? it's personal. 
                         this is a personal matter that has 
                         to do with mabel. i just have to go 
                         see her for a little while.

               terry gives sammy a look like, "you've got to be kidding." 
               sammy tries to shush him with a conspiratorial look back. 
               she goes out.

               later. terry and rudy sit in front of the tv, alone.

                                     terry
                         listen. listen. i'm sorry i said you 
                         squealed on me. i was totally out of 
                         line, and i really owe you an apology.
                              (pause)
                         did you hear what i said?

                                     rudy
                              (staring at the tv)
                         i don't care.
