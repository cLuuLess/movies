                         stupid.

                                     sammy
                         why do you say that?

                                     rudy
                         we're supposed to write a story for 
                         english homework, but they didn't 
                         tell us what it's supposed to be 
                         about.

                                     sammy
                         what do you mean?

                                     rudy
                         i mean they didn't tell us what it's 
                         supposed to be about. they said do 
                         whatever you want.

                                     sammy
                         so what's wrong with that?

                                     rudy
                         nothing. i just think it's 
                         unstructured.

                         think of something. if you can't, 
                         i'll help you.
