               ext. in front of orrin's house. a moment later

               sammy pulls up, fast, and gets out of the car. hearing the 
               hammering from the backyard, she walks quickly around the 
               side of the house and stops short when she sees rudy hammering 
               happily away with terry and ray.

               she watches them working, unobserved, with mixed annoyance 
               and relief, and finally with quiet pleasure, because it's a 
               very cheerful sight.
