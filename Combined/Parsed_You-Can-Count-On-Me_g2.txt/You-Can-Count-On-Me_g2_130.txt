               int. bob's apartment. day

               bob is standing by his kitchenette, extremely nervous. sammy 
               sits on his sofa.

                                     bob
                         do you want to go for a walk, or a 
                         drive? it's really nice out.

                                     sammy
                         no. i'm not gonna stay long. bob, i 
                         don't want to get married.

               pause.

                                     bob
                         ok.

                                     sammy
                         i've really thought about it a lot, 
                         and if you had asked me last year 
                         i'm sure i would have said yes.

                                     bob
                         oh. thank you.

                                     sammy
                         but i'm not sure it would have been 
                         a good idea then either. i'm going 
                         through a really hard time right now 
                         and i just think that getting engaged 
                         to you or anyone would be just about 
                         the stupidest most self-destructive 
                         thing i could possibly do.

                                     bob
                         ok.

                                     sammy
                         and i really think you have to grow 
                         up.

                                     bob
                         well, how about we fix up my 
                         personality some other time?

                                     sammy
                         ok.
                              (pause)
                         i really hope we can still be friends.

                                     bob
                              (quietly sarcastic)
                         oh, yes, me too.

               she looks at him miserably.

                                     sammy
                         bob... this is so crazy... i mean... 
                         i don't even understand why you... i 
                         don't even get it.

                                     bob
                         what do you want me to say? everything 
                         you said about me was true, sammy. i 
                         was just a big chickenshit jerk, and 
                         now i'm payin' the price.

                                     sammy
                         bob...!

               she goes over to him. he gets up.

                                     bob
                         what?

                                     sammy
                         well -- i don't know...

                                     bob
                         i don't know. sammy, i love you. i 
                         wish i could say it in a more 
                         interesting way. i just -- i love 
                         you.

                                     sammy
                         well -- i mean -- i love you too --

               he puts his arms around her and kisses her. she responds 
               very warmly. just as things are heating up, she suddenly 
               remembers something and jolts away.

                                     sammy
                         oh shit.

                                     bob
                         what's the matter?

                                     sammy
                         i gotta go. i'm sorry --

                                     bob
                         where do you have to go?

                                     sammy
                              (off the top of her 
                              head)
                         i'm supposed to -- i gotta get mabel 
                         back her car.

                                     bob
                         well... i don't understand. how are 
                         we leaving things?

                                     sammy
                         oh god, i don't know. call me later.
