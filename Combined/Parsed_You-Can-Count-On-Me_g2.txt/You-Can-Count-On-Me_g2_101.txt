               ext. porch. night

               sammy and terry stand side by side on the porch, passing a 
               joint back and forth. it has stopped raining but the trees 
               and roof are still dripping. the crickets are chirping loudly.

                                     sammy
                         so... bob asked me to marry him.

                                     terry
                         wow.
                              (pause)
                         are you going to?

                                     sammy
                         i don't know. if he'd've asked me 
                         this time last year i would have 
                         probably said yes. but the minute he 
                         said it, i don't know, i felt like 
                         somebody was trying to strangle me.

                                     terry
                         well... bad sign.

                                     sammy
                         i know.
                              (pause)
                         plus, terry...
                              (whispers)
                         i fucked my boss...!

                                     terry
                         what?

                                     sammy
                         i know! and his wife is six months 
                         pregnant.

                                     terry
                         jesus christ, sammy...!

                                     sammy
                         i know, i know.

               he passes her the joint. she declines. he puffs away. the 
               water drips off the porch and the crickets chirp. she puts 
               her head on his shoulder. he puts one arm around her and 
               puffs away with the joint in his free hand.

                                     sammy
                         terry, i'm sorry i got so mad before. 
                         i just don't want him, you know -- 
                         terrified of "telling," if there's --

                                     terry
                         uh, well, that's not really his 
                         problem, sammy.

               sammy straightens up.

                                     sammy
                         oh really? what's his problem?

                                     terry
                         his problem is that he's like totally 
                         sheltered because you treat him like 
                         he's three, instead of eight, so 
                         that's how he behaves.

                                     sammy
                         oh yeah? and how do you think he 
                         should behave?

                                     terry
                         i think he shouldn't have to run and 
                         tell his mommy every time he does 
                         something she might not like, for 
                         one thing.

                                     sammy
                         uh huh. and what do you --

                                     terry
                              (on "and")
                         i mean i took him to play pool! it 
                         was a little clandestine thing we 
                         did for fun! it wasn't like a big 
                         secret, i mean who cares? i was 
                         actually trying to be nice to him. 
                         but he's so freaked out that he 
                         disobeyed your orders that he has to 
                         fuckin' squeal on me and i have to 
                         listen to your fuckin' shit all day 
                         when i didn't even fuckin' do 
                         anything!

                                     sammy
                         first of all, he didn't tell me 
                         anything: darryl did. ok? second of 
                         all, i don't really give a shit if 
                         you took him to play pool: i was mad 
                         at you because you left him standing 
                         at the bus stop in the rain. but no, 
                         i don't want you telling him not to 
                         squeal, because i don't want him put 
                         in that position!

                                     terry
                              (losing ground)
                         well... that... is a perfect example 
                         of what i'm talking about.

                                     sammy
                         you are in idiot.

               they stand apart now. silence.

                                     terry
                         darryl told you?

                                     sammy
                         yes!

               they stand there. the rain gutters drip.
