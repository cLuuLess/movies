                         look. i know you're upset about uncle 
                         terry leaving, and so am i. but he's 
                         just not in control of himself, and 
                         i don't want him hurting your feelings 
                         anymore -- or mine. and you may not 
                         like it, but that's how it's gotta 
                         be. ok?

                                     rudy
                         i don't care.

                                     sammy
                         you don't care. i don't care either.
