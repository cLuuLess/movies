               int. bank -- sammy's desk. day

               sammy, laden with files, plops down at her desk as mabel is 
               passing by. mabel puts a phone message down in front of her.

                                     mabel
                         um -- carol just called. she said 
                         terry and rudy never showed up at 
                         her house?

                                     sammy
                         you've got to be kidding me.

               a moment later: brian, talking to an employee, sees sammy, 
               across the bank, hurrying out the employees' exit.

                                     brian
                         hey, sammy?

               sammy doesn't hear and exits.
