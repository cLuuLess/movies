               int. bob's apartment. night

               bob and sammy sit at bob's dining room table. the little 
               bachelor apartment looks pretty good. tablecloth, candles, 
               wine, everything. bob has just dropped a huge bombshell.

                                     sammy
                         bob... are you serious?

                                     bob
                         yeah.

                                     sammy
                         i... i don't know what to say. i --

                                     bob
                         i mean, i know i haven't exactly 
                         been the most... decisive... guy. in 
                         the past... i don't know: i'm tired 
                         of foolin' around. and i love you.

                                     sammy
                         i... i'm totally... i don't know 
                         what to say.

                                     bob
                         well, you could always say "yes."
                              (pause)
                         or you could think about it first.

                                     sammy
                         that's it: i want to think about it.

                                     bob
                         ok... fair enough.
