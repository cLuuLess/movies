               int. dining room. night

               sammy and rudy are eating dinner. it's a biggish house for 
               just two people.

                                     rudy
                         whose room is he gonna stay in?

                                     sammy
                         he can stay in the little room.
                              (pause)
                         but you know what? he's not going to 
                         live here. he's only gonna stay for 
                         a little while... and it's ok if you 
                         don't remember him, because you were 
                         only six the last time he was here... 
                         but it'll be nice if you got a chance 
                         to get to know each other a little 
                         bit. don't you think?

               rudy looks worried and doesn't answer.
