               int. stairs. night

               sammy, in her bathrobe, comes down the stairs into the living 
               room. terry is on the sofa playing with rudy's game boy. he 
               barely looks up when she speaks to him.

                                     sammy
                         i'm going to bed. do you have 
                         everything you need?

                                     terry
                         yeah. thanks.

                                     sammy
                         good night.

                                     terry
                         good night.

               pause.

                                     sammy
                         terry, i'm really glad you're home.

               terry tries to smile at her.

                                     terry
                         yeah, me too, sammy.

               he goes back to his game. she hesitates, then heads back up 
               the stairs.
