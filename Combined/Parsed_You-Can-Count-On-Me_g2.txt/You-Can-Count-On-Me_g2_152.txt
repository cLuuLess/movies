               int. living room. night

               sammy is flipping channels on the tv. the doorbell rings. 
               she is surprised. she gets up. terry comes thundering down 
               the stairs, carrying his backpack.

                                     sammy
                         is that for you?

                                     terry
                         yeah, i'm just gonna stay at ray's 
                         till i take off.

                                     sammy
                         you don't have to do that.

                                     terry
                         yeah. well, that's what i wanna do, 
                         so --

                                     sammy
                         well but -- are you gonna come back 
                         to say good-bye?

                                     terry
                         no -- i'm just gonna take off. i'll 
                         see you later.

                                     sammy
                         well --

               terry opens the door. ray is there. terry closes the door 
               behind him. sammy listens to the pickup truck drive off. the 
               sound fades.
