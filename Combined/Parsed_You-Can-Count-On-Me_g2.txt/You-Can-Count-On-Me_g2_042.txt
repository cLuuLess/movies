               ext. church. day

               people are filing out of the church. we also see a couple of 
               the bank employees, including brian and his very pretty six 
               months' pregnant wife, nancy. we find sammy and rudy. sammy 
               is chatting to some neighbors. rudy is bored out of his mind, 
               waiting for her.
