               terry is packing his bag. rudy is watching.

                                     rudy
                         where are you going?

                                     terry
                         i don't know. i just want to get out 
                         of this town. and if you've got any 
                         sense when you get old enough you'll 
                         get out of here too. your mom's gonna 
                         live in this town for the rest of 
                         her life, and you know why? because 
                         she thinks she has to. don't ask me 
                         why, but that's the truth. she thinks 
                         there's all these things she has to 
                         do, but you want to know one thing 
                         about your mom? she's a bigger fuck-
                         up than i ever was. i mean, i know i 
                         messed up. you think i enjoy getting 
                         thrown in jail because i wanted you 
                         to face that prick your dad like a 
                         little man and see what kind of a 
                         guy he is? i know i got a little 
                         carried away, and i lost my temper 
                         just a little bit -- which is not 
                         the end of the world either, by the 
                         way, just for future reference --and 
                         now she's kickin' me out of my own 
                         house because -- you know, because i 
                         fucked up a little bit. which i 
                         totally admit. i was like -- totally 
                         ready to admit that.

               he is finished stuffing his clothes into his backpack.

                                     rudy
                         i could go with you.

                                     terry
                         well, thanks, man. but i, uh, i can't 
                         really take care of you.
