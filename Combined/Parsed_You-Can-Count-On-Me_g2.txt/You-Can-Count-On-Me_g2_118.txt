               sammy, terry and rudy are all putting away the groceries. 
               everybody seems to be getting along.

                         that's great, honey.

               o.c., the doorbell rings. sammy starts to move toward the 
               door, but terry is closer.

                                     terry
                         i'll get it.

               sammy watches him go.
