               ext. stream -- bridge. day

               terry and rudy are side by side on a small footbridge over a 
               wide running stream, fishing. the sunlight slants through 
               the canopy of trees; the birds are chattering; it's gorgeous 
               and peaceful.

                                     rudy
                         i've never been so bored in my life.

                                     terry
                         yeah... we really shoulda been out 
                         here around seven or eight a.m.

                                     rudy
                         what time is it now?

                                     terry
                         two-thirty.

               silence. the birds sing.

                                     rudy
                         was my father a good fisherman?

                                     terry
                         yeah, your father was good at all 
                         that stuff. he knew everything about 
                         the woods, everything about fishing, 
                         everything about hunting and 
                         everything about cars. if he wasn't 
                         such a pain in the ass he would've 
                         been a lot of fun to be around.

                                     rudy
                         maybe he's nicer now.

                                     terry
                         i doubt it.

                                     rudy
                         well, i think he is.

                                     terry
                         how would you know? did you ever 
                         meet him?

                                     rudy
                         no.

                                     terry
                         were you ever curious to meet him?

                                     rudy
                         i guess so.

                                     terry
                         well, he doesn't live very far from 
                         here.

                                     rudy
                         i thought he lived in alaska.

                                     terry
                         no -- i lived in alaska. your dad 
                         lives in auburn. far as i know.
                              (pause)
                         we could look him up in the phone 
                         book. wanna try?

                                     rudy
                         all right.

                                     terry
                         ok -- but -- i'm sure i don't have 
                         to say this, but i'm not kidding, 
                         man: don't -- tell -- your -- mother.
