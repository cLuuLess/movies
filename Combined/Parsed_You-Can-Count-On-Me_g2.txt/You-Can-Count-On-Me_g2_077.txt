               int. the house -- front door. simultaneous

               rudy runs up the stairs.

                                     terry
                         wait a minute, gimme your jacket!

               rudy tries to take his jacket off fast but gets his arm caught 
               in the sleeve. he tries to shake it off.

                                     terry
                         what are you doing?

                                     rudy
                         i can't get my sleeve out...!

               they hear bob's car doors slam. terry makes a comic panicked 
               face and leaps up the stairs two at a time.

               outside the house: sammy waves to bob. bob waves back as he 
               drives off. sammy goes to the front door, opens it:

               terry and rudy are in a giggly tangled panicked heap at the 
               top of the stairs, shaking rudy's arm and sleeve, frantically 
               trying to get the jacket off.

               sammy comes in. they freeze.

                                     sammy
                         what is going on in here?

                                     terry
                         um -- we were just out doing some 
                         star-gazing, and, uh, rudy lost track 
                         of the time. which i totally warned 
                         him about.
                              (to rudy)
                         you are a bad kid.
