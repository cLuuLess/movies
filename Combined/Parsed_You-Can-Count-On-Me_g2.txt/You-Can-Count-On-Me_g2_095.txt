               terry and rudy pull up in front of the driveway. terry is in 
               a silent rage. the rain has let up.

                                     terry
                         get out of the car.

                                     terry
                         you're going to carol's house and 
                         i'm going home.

                                     rudy
                         why can't i come with you?

                                     terry
                         because if you're such a baby you 
                         gotta tell your mommy about us playin' 
                         pool when i totally asked you not 
                         to, and i gotta listen to her shit 
                         all day, then you're goin' to the 
                         baby-sitter's so you can stay at the 
                         baby house.

                                     rudy
                         but i didn't tell her!

                                     terry
                         you know what? don't even fuckin' 
                         talk to me.

                                     rudy
                         i didn't!

                                     terry
                         just get out of the car.

               he leans over rudy roughly and pushes open the door. rudy 
               gets out of the car and marches down the long driveway. he 
               bursts into tears.

               terry watches him go, then drives off.
