ext. world's fair - night

over at the fence, the ltd comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the
fairgrounds.

at the trunk, jay and kay flip open the trunk and scarf up whatever
weapons look most dangerous. kay grabs a black box, unsnaps a row of
latches, and opens it, revealing --

-- the most wicked-looking shotgun on the planet.

three feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump
action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. the
shells themselves are solid, glistening like polished steel. kay loads up
the clip.

				jay
		you know how to work that?

kay pumps it once, with extreme confidence.

				kay
		no idea whatsoever.

he slams the trunk, revealing the flying saucers sitting atop their
columns in the distance.

				kay (cont'd)
		let's bag us some bug.

as if on cue, one of the saucers begins to hum. then it starts to spin,
faster and faster. the ship begins to rise.

				jay
		oh, shit.
