int. mib building - zed's office - day

zed's office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of
mib headquarters. jay and kay sit across the desk from zed. there are five
video monitors on a wall behind zed's desk, and on each monitor is another
man in black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock
ticking in a corner of the image.

while zed talks, he goes through paperwork on his desk.

				zed
		okay, let's see.
			(to one of the monitors)
		bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of
		sinalee touching down in the forest outside
		portland tonight. i'm pulling you down from
		anchorage to do a meet-and-greet.

bee, an agent on one of the monitors, nods.

				bee
		humanoid?

				zed
		you wish. bring a sponge.
			(going through memos)
		what else -- everybody, we gotta keep
		rolling fish-goat out of the sewer system,
		he's scaring the rats. and bobo the squat
		wants to reveal himself on "unsolved
		mysteries." bee, make sure he doesn't.

he turns a page, coming across a red memo.

				zed (cont'd)
		red-letter from last night -- we had an
		un-authorized landing somewhere in upstate
		new york farm country. keep your ears open
		for this one, kay, we're not hosting a
		galactic kegger down here.

next to him, his computer screen beeps importantly.  zed looks over at it.

				zed
		well, well, well -- we got a skimmer.

				kay
			(to jay)
		landed alien out of zone.
			(to zed)
		who is it?

				zed
		redgick. he's not cleared to leave manhattan
		but he's way out of town right now, stuck in
		traffic on the new jersey turnpike. why
		don't you take jay? this is a good one for
		him to warm up on.
