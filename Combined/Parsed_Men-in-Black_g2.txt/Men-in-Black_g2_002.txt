int. van -- texas/mexico border -- night

the driver of the van, a fifty-year-old american, turns on the wipers,
smearing the remains all over.

				driver
		goddamn bugs.

he squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but
now he sees something worse up ahead. it's a grouping of headlights, eight
of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road.

he bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van. he
speaks in spanish, which is subtitled.

				driver (cont'd)
		deja me hablar.
			(let me do the talking.)
