int. morgue - day

kay races into the morgue just as the examination table explodes into the
air, revealing edgar, who was hiding beneath it.

now everything happens at once. jay leaps back and draws the noisy
cricket, kay pulls out his series four deatomizer, and edgar holds his
shotgun under laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own.

				kay
		freeze it, bug!

				jay
		don't shoot! don't shoot!

				laurel
			(to jay)
		christ, are you thick!

				jay
		how was i supposed to know!?!

				laurel
		what did i have to do, sing it for you!?!

				jay
		maybe if you didn't come on like a drunken
		prom date!

				laurel
		oh, that's so typical. any time a woman
		shows the slightest hint of sexual
		independence, men just --

				edgar
		everybody shut up!

				kay
		let her go, shit eater.

				edgar
		listen, monkey boy, i may have to take that
		kind of talk in my end of the universe, but
		compared to you humans, i'm the top rung on
		the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all
		right?!

				kay
		you're breakin' my heart. move six inches
		to your left and i'll solve all your
		problems.

orion the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and
landing on edgar, hissing and scratching and clawing for all she's worth.
edgar snaps an arm up and whips her off. the cat squirms in his arm, the
icon jangling. edgar grabs the icon, holds onto it, and flings the cat
away, across the morgue. the icon comes free, remaining in his hand.

he drops it into his mouth and swallows. he shoves the gun hard against
laurel's cheek.

				edgar
		that's better. now put down your weapons.
		we're leaving.

kay freezes, teeth clenched, gun still in front of him. standoff.

				edgar (cont'd)
		have you ever pulled the wings off a fly?

edgar cranks one of laurel's arms behind her back, hard, and she cries out
in pain.

				edgar (cont'd)
		would you care to see the fly get even?

				kay
		how far you think you'll get without your
		ship? if that's what you call that hunk of
		space crap we've got back at our office.

				edgar
		put the weapons down!

				kay
		never gonna happen, insect.

edgar backs away with laurel, further into the morgue, toward a glass
window that looks out at the base of an air shaft. jay and kay advance,
slowly, cornering him.

				jay
		it's okay, laurel!

				laurel
		how is it okay?!

				jay
		i mean it's going to be okay!

				edgar
		don't bet on it, meat sack.

and with that he turns, leaps --

-- and crashes right through the window, into the air shaft.
