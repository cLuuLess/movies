int. orkin van - new york alley - night

inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its
various locks holding tight against edgar's repeated attempts to claw his
way into it. crammed into the back of the van along with his spaceship,
edgar wedges a screwdriver into the thin opening between the top and the
rest of the box and smacks it with his right fist. nothing doing.

he bellows in rage and hurls the box against the side of the van, where it
finally cracks a hinge. edgar snaps it up, pries the rest of the hinge off
with the screwdriver, and wrenches the top off the box.

inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he
promptly tosses aside as worthless. but the rest of the box is empty.

				edgar
		no. no, no, no, noooo!

he rips the box apart with his bare hands. there's nothing else there.
