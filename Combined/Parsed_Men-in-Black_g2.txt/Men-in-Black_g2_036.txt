floor number, and the descent begins. edwards continues.

				edwards
		all right. i'm in because there's some
		next-level shit going on around here, and
		i'm with that. before you beam me up, there
		are a couple of things we need to get
		straight. you chose me 'cause you recognize
		the skills. so as of now you can cease with
		all of that calling me "son" or "kid" or
		"sport." cool?

				kay

the elevator doors --
