int. farmhouse - living room - day

in the living room, kay sips some of her lemonade and winces. jay moves
through the room, checking it out as beatrice tells her story.

				beatrice
		and they said to me, "if he was murdered,
		how could he walk back in the house?" and i
		must admit, i was a little stumped by that
		one. but i know edgar. and that wasn't him.
		it was more like something else that was
		wearing him. like a suit. an edgar suit.

a little giggle escapes her at the thought. jay, over by a bookcase,
notices a framed photo of edgar, kneeling in the woods, proudly about to
skin a deer.

				jay
		damn. if he was this ugly before he was an
		alien...

				beatrice
		sorry?

				kay
		go on.

				beatrice
		anyway, when i came to, he was gone.

				kay
		did he say anything?

				beatrice
		yes! he asked for water. sugar water, if i
		remember.

				kay
		sugar water.

				jay
		did you taste her lemonade?

kay nods, puts on his sunglasses. takes out another pair, hands them to
jay.

kay draws his neuralyzer. flash! beatrice freezes, staring straight ahead
as if hypnotized. kay takes jay's glasses off and hands them back to him.

				kay
		ray bans.
			(pulling off jay's
			sunglasses)
		okay, beatrice. there was no alien, and the
		flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a
		ufo. swamp gas from a weather balloon was
		trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted
		the light from venus --

				jay
		whoa! that thing erases her memory, and you
		give her a new one?

				kay
		standard issue neuralyzer.

				jay
		and that's the best you can come up with?

				kay
		on a more personal note, beatrice, edgar
		ran off with on old girlfriend. go stay at
		your mother's for a few days and get over
		it. decide you're better off.

				jay
			(butting in)
		yeah, and you're better off 'cause he never
		appreciated you anyway. in fact, you kicked
		him out, and now that he's gone, you ought
		to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a
		decorator or something...
