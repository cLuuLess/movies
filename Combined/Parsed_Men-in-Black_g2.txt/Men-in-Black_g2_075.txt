int. mib building - headquarters - day

back at men in black headquarters, the little lights on the world map
which indicate aliens' locations are going out, one by one, about one
every five or ten seconds. a warning buzzer is sounding, over and over,
and human staffers are rushing left and right.

zed is in his office.

				zed
		containment may be a moot point, my friend.
		the exodus continues. it's like the party's
		over and the last one to leave gets stuck
		with the check.

zed looks down to the vast floor below and sees the four worm guys with
suitcases walking across the floor.

				zed
		you sorry little ingrates!

				kay (o.s.)
		what about the arquillians?

				zed
		we've only translated a part of the message
		so far: "deliver the galaxy."

				kay (o.s.)
		no, they don't want much, do they?

				zed
		oh, it gets better... they're holding us
		responsible.

he looks up at the screen. it reads:
				   mib
			   deliver the galaxy.

				zed
		another contestant has entered the ring.
