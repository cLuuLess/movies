ext. fifth avenue -- night

the perp, meanwhile, is running at top speed, when edwards glides into
frame, leaning off the back of the truck.

				edwards
		yo, man, your luck just ran out.

he leaps from the back of the moving truck and tackles the perp.

the perp, now straddled by edwards, is terrified.

				perp
		he's coming! he's coming!

				edwards
		and when he gets here, i'll kick his ass
		too.

edwards is about to slap the cuffs on him, when the perp blinks. nothing
unusual about that, but then another set of translucent, milky white
eyelids, underneath his regular eyelids, blinks also.

edwards is thrown for a moment, which is all the time the perp needs to
pull out...

his weapon, which is the strangest looking gun you've ever seen. reacting
quickly, edwards bats it out of the perp's hand.

the weapon smashes into the stone wall surrounding central park and
shatters into a million pieces.

				edwards
		what the...

whomp! the perp kicks him in the nuts, then scrambles to his feet and
takes off again. edwards staggers after him, in pain.

the perp leaps over a moving car, towards the guggenheim museum. edwards
tries to follow, but a bus pulls in front of him. after it passes, the
perp is gone.
