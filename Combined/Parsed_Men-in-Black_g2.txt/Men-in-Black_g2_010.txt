ext. guggenheim museum -- night

edwards runs over to the museum, leans over the wall that surrounds it,
and in the next instant...

the perp flies past him, having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of
the guggenheim. he scrambles up and over the ledge.

edward reacts. he runs to the front door of the museum, shoots it open and
runs inside.

he runs from the rotunda up the grand ramp of the guggenheim.
