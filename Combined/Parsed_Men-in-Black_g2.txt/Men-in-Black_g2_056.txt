int. leshko's diner - day

rosenberg comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative
darkness. at a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone -- an
enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid
fifties.

rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down. the
man (an arquillian, and if we're eagle-eyed, we recognize him as the alien
on a "diplomatic mission" from passport control) rises from his chair. he
steps forward, to face rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table.
immediately, rosenberg's cat jumps on top of it.

rosenberg and the arquillian stare at each other for a long moment --

-- and then embrace each other. the embrace has an odd, formal quality to
it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. they hold on, long and hard, and
both seemed choked with emotion.

finally, they break apart and take their seats. they speak in a bizarre
alien tongue, which is subtitled. rosenberg wipes away tears.

				rosenberg
		sorry i'm late. the cab drivers on this
		planet are terrible.

				arquillian
		your majesty, you are in grave danger.

				rosenberg
		yeah, and they overcharge you every time.

				arquillian
		sir, a bug landed here. we must get you off
		the planet.

				rosenberg
		a bug? he must know why i'm here.

				arquillian
		we think he does.
			(noticing the ornate box
			on the table)
		is that what i think it is?

				rosenberg
		no, just some diamonds for your children.
		do we have time to eat?

the arquillian relaxes.

				arquillian
		sure. i ordered you some pirogi.
