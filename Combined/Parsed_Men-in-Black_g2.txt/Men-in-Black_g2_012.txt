int. interrogation room -- night

edwards sits on one side of the table, a police inspector and a uniformed
sergeant (the one who gave up the chase and lit a cigarette earlier), sit
across from him.

				inspector
		perpetrator then blinked two sets of
		eyelids. you mean blinked with both eyes?

				edwards
		no, sir. he blinked once with one set, then
		again with another completely different set.

				sergeant
		sort of a low beam, high beam.

				inspector
		was that before or after he drew the weapon
		which you claim evaporated into a million
		pieces?

				edwards
		after, sir.

				inspector
		and why do you suppose none of the other
		officers saw either of these two events?

				edwards
		'cause some of the other officers are a
		little soggy in the midsection. and they
		couldn't keep up, sir.

				sergeant
		hey, edwards, if you were half the man i
		am --

				edwards
		what do you mean? i am half the man you are.

				sergeant
		what the hell is your problem?

				edwards
		my problem is you being all up in my damn
		face all the time.

				sergeant
		i think he threw him off the roof. ten
		minutes -- your best shot.

				inspector
			(cutting off the sergeant)
		sergeant. i want to talk to you outside.
		now.

				edwards
		you need ten minutes on a stairmaster, you
		pudgy bastard.
