ext. guggenheim museum -- roof -- night

on the roof, the perp reaches the top, climbs over the edge, and crunches
to the gravel surface. he leaps to his feet and races over to a door. it's
locked.

he tugs on another. it's locked too. he pulls on a third. it swings open --

-- revealing edwards on the other side, breathing hard. he aims his weapon
at the perp.

				edwards
		wassup?

the perp screams inhumanly and panics. he backpedals, toward the edge of
the roof.

				perp
		he's coming! he's coming because i failed,
		and now he'll kill me too!

				edwards
		stop!

				perp
		you don't understand. your world is gonna
		end.

but the perp has backed right into the edge of the roof, and now he starts
to fall over. the perp blinks.

				edwards
		what are you?!

the perp looks down. he decides.

-- and he falls, screaming, to his death.
