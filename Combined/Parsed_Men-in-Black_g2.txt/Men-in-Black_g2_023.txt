int. mib building - tunnel vent room - day

edwards steps through a heavily barred metal door and into long, bizarre
room. one wall is entirely dominated by the enormous blades of a tunnel
vent air intake. there is an elevator at the far end of the room and an
old security guard, the rent-a-cop kind, reading a comic book on a folding
metal chair halfway across.

edwards walks across the room, his footsteps echoing. the guard looks up.

				guard
		help you?

				edwards
		maybe, i'm not sure, see, i got this card --

				guard
		elevator. push the "call" button.

and he goes back to his comic book. edwards, maybe out of nothing more
than curiosity at this point, walks across the room, toward the elevator.
as he draws close, the elevator doors whoosh open, expecting him.
