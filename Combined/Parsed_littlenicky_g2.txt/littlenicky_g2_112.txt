	 ext. new hell stage - continuous

	nicky lands on both feet standing before adrian.

				nicky
		love lifts me up where i belong.

	angle on

	crowd reacts.

	on hell stage

	demons are ready to attack.  adrian waves them off.

				adrian
		not bad, little brother.  let's see what
		you've got.

	nicky thinks, holds out his hands.  a rainbow shoots out onto
	the stage between them.  pause.  we see that a cute little
	chipmunk is standing on it's hindlegs eating a nut.

	on crowd

	the army of good and scared bad people applaud as they see
	this.

	back on hell stage

	adrian nods, holds out his arms and a red stream shoots out.
	he has made a terrible python that comes over and eats the
	baffled chipmunk in one bite.

	nicky raises his hand and: turns the snake into a row of
	flowers.

	adrian raises his hand and a crazed mexican gardner with a
	lawn mower comes by and mows them down.

	nicky turns the gardner and his lawn mower into a mother
	pushing a new born baby in a carriage.

	adrian turns the baby in the carriage into an evil dwarf who
	leaps out and starts beating up on the mother.

	nicky turns the mother into a hot girl dwarf.  the evil dwarf
	stops beating her up and holds her hand.

				adrian (cont'd)
		enough.  i'm going to kill you with my
		bare hands.

	adrian punches nicky hard in the jaw.  he goes flying off the
	platform.

	nicky's body falls towards the ground.  it's about to hit,
	when a soft bed of posts and fluffy pillows break his fall.
