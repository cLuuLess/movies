	int. grand central station - pavillion - day

	the throng of commuters making their way through the terminal
	are giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking
	around suspiciously, talking to the dog.

		my name's beefy.  i'm an old friend of
		your father's.  he's asked me to help
		you out.

		i just need to find my brothers and be
		on my way, beefy.

				beefy
		it's not gonna be easy.  your brothers
		can possess people.  so they probably
		won't look like themselves.  you have to
		be suspicious of everyone.

	nicky looks at beefy warily for a beat.

				nicky
		okay, "bro," this jig is up...
			(pulling out the flask)
		just get in the bottle.  just slide
		right on in there.

				beefy
		it's not me, moron.

				nicky
		oh.  sorry.
