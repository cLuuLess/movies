	ext. new hell rally - continuous

	we hear banging and beating and yelling from inside and then
	the flask stops bouncing.  silence.  everybody outside holds
	their breath.  slowly out of the spout crawls nicky.

	hooray.  valerie, john, todd and beefy and all the living
	people cheer.  the student, very happy, opens his kimono.
	the people and demons near him are grossed out.

	valerie goes tot he very beaten up nicky and hugs him.

				valerie
		where'd a sweet southern boy learn to
		fight like that?

				nicky
		from my dad's side of the family.

	she laughs and kisses him on the mouth.  the crowd cheers.
	but nicky won't stop kissing her.  she starts to struggle for
	air.  nicky presses harder and starts to laugh.

	the crowd stops cheering.  valerie is waving her arms for
	help.  nicky turns into adrian during the kiss.  adrian lets
	her go.  and we hear adrian's familiar laugh.

				adrian
		what?  no tongue?

	adrian pulls his head back, his tongue is huge and he turns
	into a giant bat.  he lets out a huge roar, then flies
	around, laughing, scaring people.

	valerie runs over and picks up the flask.  she looks inside.

				valerie
			(whispering)
		nicky. nicky.

	no response.

				valerie (cont'd)
		you gotta fly out...i know you can do
		it.
			(still no response)
		do it for the butterflies.

	a long beat, then:

				nicky (o.s.)
		butterflies...

	and nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands
	on his feet.  adrian lands and stares down nicky.  the clock
	is one minute from midnight.

	adrian swoops down.  nicky thinks quick and pulls out the
	ball his mom gave him and smashes it on the ground.  out of
	it forms metal g-d: ozzy osborne.

				ozzy
		hello, new york.

				john and peter
		ozzy.

	they faint.

	the bat's eyes go wide in fear.  ozzy grabs the bat, his
	mouth grows big, and he bites the bat's head off.  valerie
	hands ozzy the flask.

				valerie
		put him in, ozzy.

	ozzy spits the bat head into the flask.
