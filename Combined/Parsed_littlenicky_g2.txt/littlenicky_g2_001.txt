	ext. suburbia - night

	a beautiful late summer night.  crickets chirping, sprinklers
	sprinkling.

	we pan across one particular lawn, up one particular tree,
	where we see the peeper (jon lovitz) sitting on a limb.  he
	has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a walkman.  suddenly
	the lights turn on.

				peeper
			(whispering)
		showtime!

	we see a young mother walk into the room outside the peeper's
	window.  she is wearing business attire.

				peeper (cont'd)
		rough day at the office mrs. dunleavy?
			(takes bite of sandwich)
		well you'll feel better once you slip
		off those work clothes and get into some
		sweats.

	the mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing
	her feet.

				peeper (cont'd)
		oh my g-d, yes!  i wish you would let me
		rub those feet.  of course i wouldn't
		use my hands.  heh heh heh heh...

	he sips some wine.

	the mother starts to unbutton her blouse.  she takes it off,
	revealing a nice bra.

				peeper (cont'd)
		looks like victoria just told me her
		secret.

	the peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook.  mouthing
	the words as he goes.

				peeper (cont'd)
		thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m.,
		first brassiere sighting...
			(stops writing)
		i will pleasure myself to this image for
		months.  months i tell you!

	the mother starts to unbutton her pants.  her young son walks
	in wearing a scouts uniform.

				peeper (cont'd)
		young scottie dunleavy.  what
		unfortunate timing.  you mother was just
		getting comfy.

	the son talks to his mother excitedly.

				peeper (cont'd)
		yes, yes, i'm sure you tied many great
		knots today or whatever.  now get out.

	the son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.

				peeper (cont'd)
		now what.  this simply won't do.

	the peeper takes out a cell phone and dials.  the son
	answers.

				scottie
		hello?

				peeper
		hello, scottie.  why don't you go
		downstairs like a good boy and let your
		mother freshen up.

				scottie
		who is this?

				peeper
		just a little birdie.  a birdie who
		wants to see if your mother's panties
		match her bra.

				mother
		oh my g-d scottie.  is there a man up
		our tree?

	the peeper gets nervous.

				peeper
		tell her no.  tell her it's just a big
		bird.

	the peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises.
	we see scottie with his sling shot.  the mother nods yes.  he
	shoots it.  it hits the peeper square in the head.  he falls
	to the ground with a thud.

				peeper (cont'd)
		mrs. dunleavy, please come help me.  and
		wear your bikini.

	the peeper looks up.  he sees scottie pushing a television
	out the window.  it lands on top of the peeper.  he's dead.
