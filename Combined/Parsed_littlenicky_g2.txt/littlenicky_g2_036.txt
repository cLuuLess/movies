	ext. gates of hell - day

	the gatekeeper is near the frozen fall.  we hear loud
	wailing, moaning, etc., coming from the other side.

				gatekeeper
		doesn't sound very good behind there.  i
		hope nicky's kicking some ass on earth.

	the monster is smoking a cigarette and wearing a leather
	biker's hat.  he nods along in agreement.

	pan to lucifer

	who's sitting over by a rock fishing in a small pool of
	fire/pond.

				lucifer
		you know, i was the one who created
		hell.

				gatekeeper
		i know, your wickedness.

				lucifer
		i started slow, though.  for years, i
		was just giving people hot foots.
		actually, you can give all the credit
		for hell to my first wife; she was the
		inspiration.  she was an ugly one, too.
		one day, she asked me if i wanted super
		sex.  i said i'll take the soup.

	the monster laughs really hard.

				lucifer (cont'd)
		take it easy there, chewbacca.  in fact,
		you look like her mother, except she had
		more hair.

	the monster laughs even harder.

				lucifer (cont'd)
		you know what was in hell when i came
		down here, cassius?

				gatekeeper
		it's stanley, sir.

				lucifer
		nothing.  no mountains.  no castles.
		looked like a giant parking lot.  it
		wasn't even called hell.

				gatekeeper
		what was it called, sir.

				lucifer
		boogerland!

				gatekeeper
		that's nice, grandpa.  why don't you
		just enjoy the fishing?

				lucifer
		i can't enjoy anything.  i go fishing.
		i catch nothing.  i go to orgies, i
		catch everything...

	we hear the monster laughing again as we pan down grandpa's
	fishing line to:
