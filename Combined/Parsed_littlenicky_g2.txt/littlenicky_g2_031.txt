	ext. various central park locations - day

	nicky snores.  masses of birds fly out of the trees.  nicky
	snores.  squirrels run out of trees.  nicky snores.

	on worried people

	staring at nicky who continues to snore.  two heavy-metal
	guys, john and peter, are listening to danzig and doing a
	goofy dance.  they hear something and turn the music down:
	it's the distant sound of nicky's snore.

				peter
		sounds like our devil dance actually
		worked this time.

				john
		'bout time...

	nicky snores.  it sounds like "i will eat your hearts."  the
	worried people run away.  nicky snores.  children on the
	carousel, going real fast, upset.  nicky snores.

	peter and john walk over to a position near nicky's bench.

				john (cont'd)
		there's our man.

				peter
		mr. sleepyhead must have some major ties
		to the dark side.

	a sleazy street vendor shuffles over towards nicky.  he eyes
	the flask which is half hanging out of nicky's pocket.

				john
		what's with that guy?

				peter
		gotta be one of his disciples or
		something.

	suddenly, the vendor grabs the flask (and nicky's half-eaten
	drumstick) and runs off.

				john
		yo, man, i think that devil guy just got
		ripped off.

				peter
		should we wake him up?

				john
		yeah.  you do it.

	peter gets up and shakes nicky who comes to with a loud
	snort.

				peter
		rise and shine, devil guy.  some dude
		just stole your shit.

	nicky feels for the flask.  it's gone.

				nicky
		oh nooooo....

	fire shoots out of nicky's mouth.

				nicky (cont'd)
		which way did he go?

				john
		that way.

	nicky is about to run off.  looks at john's shirt.

				nicky
		iron maiden live double disc is simply
		phenomenal.

	he runs off.

				peter
		did you check out the dragon mouth?

				john
		the dark prince is here.
