	int. throne room - later

	start on a close up of lucifer.  he's holding cards, looking
	at his hand.

				lucifer
		royal flush, you lose.  off with the
		bra.

	the demons and gatekeeper are sitting around playing strip
	poker.  the gatekeeper takes off his bra.  from behind, we
	see his breasts flop out.

				lucifer (cont'd)
		last time i saw a pair of jugs that big,
		two hillbillies were blowing on them.

	the gatekeeper throws his hand down and storms out.  the
	monster laughs uproariously.  nicky enters and moves to
	what's left of his dad.  arms, torso, and a head (with one
	ear).

				nicky
		dad, adrian's got the whole city after
		me.  he's always a step ahead.  what am
		i gonna do?

				dad
		what are you gonna do?  look at me,
		nicky!  i got no legs, i got no hips, i
		got one ear...

	dad's remaining ear falls out.

				dad (cont'd)
		i got no ears!  i can't hear!

				jimmy the demon
		now he's got no ears!  you happy, nicky?
		your father's got no ears!

				nicky
		uh, i'll do my best, dad.  do you have
		any advice at all for me?

				dad
		i can't hear you, nicky.  i can't hear
		anything!

	jimmy picks up the ear.  jimmy speaks into it.

				jimmy the demon
		check one-two.  check one-two.

				dad
		put it back on my head.  i'm falling
		apart here.

				jimmy the demon
		he's got 'til midnight tonight, nicky.
			(putting ear back on dad)
		you get your ass back up there.  you
		save your father!

	nicky looks very upset.
