	nicky walks up to a homeless man.  he thrusts the bottle in
	his face.  to nicky's surprise, the homeless man gladly takes
	it and drinks.  nothing happens.  nicky is baffled.  he tries
	to take the flask back, but the man won't let go.  finally he
	grabs it away from him.  the man starts throwing garbage at
	nicky as he walks away.
