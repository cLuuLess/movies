	int. apartment - night

	a scruffy, thirtyish buy, todd (allen covert), is on the
	phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the village.

				todd
			(on phone)
		i know exactly how you feel... the night
		reagan was elected, i said to my mother,
		"is this man going to blow up the world,
		mommy?"  then we both cried for like an
		hour.
			(knock at the door)
		somebody's here.  call you later.

	todd gets up and opens the door.  it's nicky, with beefy by
	his side.  nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.

				nicky
		hello, friend, my name is nicky.  i
		understand you're seeking a roommate, as
		per your advertisement in the village
		voice.  would it be possible for me to
		fill the slot?

				todd
		uh, don't you want to know what the rent
		is?

	nicky looks down at beefy.  beefy looks up at nicky.  both
	nod imperceptibly.

				nicky
		yes.  what is rent?

				todd
		eight-hundred, split down the middle.
		tuesdays and thursdays i rehearse with
		my scene partner so the living room will
		be off limits.

				nicky
		off limits.

				todd
		right.  and as far as household items:
		we can share the soap, but we'll split
		the cost 60/40.
		cause the person who physically goes out
		and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay
		as much as the other guy.
			(looks at nicky)
		aren't you boiling in that outfit?

				nicky
		no.

				todd
		it's like eighty degrees in this
		hallway.  you from the south?

				nicky
		yeah.  the deep south.

	nicky laughs a little too hard.

				todd
		why is that funny?

				nicky
		i don't know.

				todd
		and sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.

	todd turns and goes into the apartment.

				beefy
		you'll be alright.  go on.  big day
		tomorrow.  don't forget to do that sleep
		thing i told you about.

				nicky
		got ya.
			(to todd)
		is it okay if i do the sleep thing?

				todd
		yeah, your bedroom is right over there.

	the door closes.  beefy looks down at the welcome mat.  it
	reads: i "heart" method acting.  beefy raises his leg over
	it.
