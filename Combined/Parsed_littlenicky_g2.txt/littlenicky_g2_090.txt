	int. birthday cake - day

	everyone is sitting around drinking diet cokes.

				nicky
		are you adrian and cassius' mom, too?

				christa
		no, their mother's weren't angels.

				angel
		i think they were hookers or strippers
		or something really porno like...

	there's a knock on the door. it opens and in comes carl
	weathers dressed as chubbs from happy gilmore.

				chubbs
		holly, jenna, christa. time for your
		mambo lesson.

				angel
		oh, chubbs.  i totally spaced.  i'm so
		sorry.  i have company.  it's my son,
		nicky.  my son.  can you believe it?

				chubbs
		wow, that's terrific.

				angel
		nicky, this is chubbs.  he used to be a
		golf pro, but up here he's the dopest
		dance instructor.

				chubbs
		you mambo?

				nicky
		i don't think so.

				chubbs
		remember, it's all in the hips.  it's
		all in the hips.

	chubbs dances as he leaves.

				nicky
		where did you meet my father?

				angel
		it was a long time ago, at some heaven
		and hell mixer.

				christa
		i remember that night, you had like four
		daiquiris.

				angel
		try four and a half.  at first i totally
		didn't like him.

				jenna
		he was really conceited.

				angel
		but i don't know, he was funny, he made
		me laugh, and i hate to say it but he
		had a really nice body.

				nicky
		and that made you want to make a baby
		with him?

	the angels laugh.

				angel
		well, i really wasn't thinking about
		making a baby at the time!

	her cell-phone rings.  she answers it.

				angel (cont'd)
		hello....yes, he's here with me now... i
		don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you
		perv!  i'll call you back...
			(laughs)
		oh my g-d, i will call you back,
		goodbye.
			(hangs up)
		that was my friend, michelle, she says
		"hi."

				nicky
		well tell her i said "hi" back.

	angel makes a motion towards the phone, then stops.

				angel
		i'll call her later.

				christa
		you know, we saw you save your
		girlfriend's life.

				jenna
		that was so cool.

				angel
		that's why you came up to heaven instead
		of hell.  self-sacrifice automatically
		gets you here.

				nicky
		how did you see me?

				angel
		we can see what's going on anywhere on
		earth.  look.

	angel and the girls clear the junk from the glass table in
	front of them.  angel touches the glass and it turns into a
	reflection of earth below.
