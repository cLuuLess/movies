	ext. side street - day

	nicky is searching the street for his flask.  he walks past
	several street vendors who have set up their wares on the
	sidewalk.  pause.  nicky comes walking back into frame as he
	sees his flask (and half-eaten drumstick) laying on the
	blanket of the vendor.

				nicky
		hey...

				street vendor
		see something you like, my man?

				nicky
		yes.  i would like my flask back.

	the street vendor stands, very angry.

				street vendor
		you callin' me a thief, my man?

				nicky
		no, i'm just calling you... a guy who
		has my flask.

				street vendor
		and if that is your so-called "flask,"
		how would i have it unless i was, in
		fact, a thief?

				nicky
			(not sure what the answer is)
		i don't know?

	a yuppie jogger is checking out the flask.

				man
		yeah, how much for the silver flask
		there?

				street vendor
		well, that's a very special item.  the
		cap itself is one hundred percent
		plappium.  it's a value is over three
		thousand dollars.

				man
		really.  where's it from?

				nicky
		it was handcrafted in hell by satan
		himself and is only to be used for the
		capture and containment of my blood
		brothers so that the firefall of hades
		will burn brightly once again.

				man
		really.  i think we'll let you keep it
		then.

	he walks away.

				street vendor
		okay, now you gone and done it.  you
		done messed with my business bitch!

				nicky
		sir, i would prefer if you didn't raise
		your voice.  it's making my muscles
		tighten.

	we see that nicky's eyes are starting to glow red.

				street vendor
		oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me?
		i'll show you some crazy eyes.  let's
		get busy.

	the vendor makes an even crazier face at nicky and starts
	swinging his fists around.

	nearby, valerie, an unsure, sweetly unstylish young woman, is
	selling clothes off a spread out blanket.  she notices what's
	going on.

	nicky's eyes widen in panic.  just then, valerie steps in.

				valerie
		excuse me, does that flask belong to
		this man?

				street vendor
			(frustrated)
		now you callin' me a thief?  damn.

				valerie
		look, i know you come out here and sell
		stolen stuff all the time.  but today,
		the guy you stole from just happened to
		walk by and bust you.  so why don't you
		admit today's not your day and give him
		his flask back?

				street vendor
		or what're you gonna do about it?  ugly
		me to death?

				valerie
		no, but maybe that cop over there might
		have something to say.

	valerie points to a cop across the street.  the street vendor
	ponders this for a second, then...

				street vendor
		aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy.
			(looking at valerie)
		and you, take your raggedy-ass clothes
		and find a new corner.  before i show
		you what real crazy is.

	the vendor does crazy eyes again.

				valerie
		fine.  i will.

	nicky picks up the flask and the drumstick.

				nicky
		hey, mister.  i'll be seeing you in a
		few years.

	valerie gathers her blanket, starts walking away and nicky
	follows her.

				nicky (cont'd)
		that was amazing.  thanks so much.  you
		didn't have to do that.

				valerie
		that's okay.  i get messed with all the
		time and when i saw him doing that to
		you i just lost it.  i hate when people
		take advantage of tourists.  it ruins it
		for the rest of us.

				nicky
		you think i'm a tourist?

				valerie
		i'm sorry.  i just assumed.  your accent
		maybe.  where are you from?

				nicky
		the south.

				valerie
		really?

				nicky
		yeah.  deep south.
			(laughs hard)

	she laughs along with him, not sure why.

				valerie
		why are you laughing?

				nicky
		i don't know, but i like it.  say.  your
		glasses are nice.  they make your eyes
		look sparkly and big.  it's fun to look
		at them.

				valerie
		my dad's an optometrist.

				nicky
		my dad's in hell, and he's falling
		apart.

				valerie
		i'm sorry.  it's really tough when your
		parents get older.

				nicky
		if i don't save him, i don't know what
		i'm gonna do.

				valerie
		well, i'm sure a nice southern boy like
		you will figure something out.

	nicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her.  he
	hands her the half-eaten drumstick.

				nicky
		here, have a popeye's.  this drumstick
		ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.

				valerie
		that's alright.  i already ate lunch.  i
		actually wouldn't mind getting a gelati.

				nicky
		could i come with you to getting a
		gelati?

				valerie
		if you want to.

				nicky
		want to?  a million angry octopus people
		couldn't hold me back!

				valerie
		"octopus people?"

				nicky
		uh, it's a deep south expression.

	nicky laughs.
