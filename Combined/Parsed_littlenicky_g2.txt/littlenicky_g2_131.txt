	ext. street - central park west

	pan up from a moving baby stroller to reveal nicky and
	valerie both pushing it.  we see beefy walking with them.
	unbelievably happy.

	a nice old lady bends down to the stroller.

				lady
		oh...what an uncommonly beautiful baby.

				valerie
		thank yo.

				lady
		such a little angel.

				beefy
		only a quarter, ma'am.

	she tickles the baby.  it giggles and a small stream of fire
	shoots out of his mouth and singes the old lady's eyebrows.

				nicky
		zachariah, say you're sorry.

				baby zachariah
			(sounds like nicky)
		sorry.

	the lady scurries away.  nicky and valerie laugh and continue
	walking in absolute bliss.  they pass the preacher who runs
	towards us.

				preacher
		he has spilled his seed!  he is
		multiplying!  beware the progeny of the
		unholy union!  we're all gonna die!

	the preacher runs straight into the camera.  black.
