	ext. grand central station - day

	a blind preacher rants outside the entrance.  people put
	money in his pot.

				preacher
		oh how the lord loves you.  all his
		children.
			(passerby puts in money)
		he thanks you for your kindness.
			(another woman puts in money)
		god bless, ma'am.  the lord loves you...
		the lord loves you...

	we see nicky and beefy walk up from behind.  the preacher
	sniffs.

				preacher (cont'd)
		the lord does not love you.  i
		sense...pure evil.
			(thrusts his cross in nicky's
		   face)
		you make the lord very nervous.
			(feeling hot)
		i'm burning...ahhh.
			(running away)
		the devil walks among us!

	he runs off screaming, wildly bumping into people.

				preacher (cont'd)
		oh lord, save us from hell's beast!

	he gets off course and runs right into a subway entrance.  he
	disappears.  beefy turns to nicky.

				beefy
		makin' friends already.

				nicky
			(shivering a little)
		it's freezing up here, beefy.

				beefy
		you're on earth now, kid.  gonna have
		the same physical needs and limitations
		a human has.  we'll stop by k-mart.  get
		you some warm clothes.

				nicky
		i also have this odd pain in my mid
		section.  kind of a hollow feeling...

				beefy
		that pain is hunger.
