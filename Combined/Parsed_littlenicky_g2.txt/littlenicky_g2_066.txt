	ext. meadowlands - night

	they float high above the meadowlands.  there is an outdoor
	concert going on.  ozzfest.
	we hear the ozz on stage in his encore.  he is singing "mr.
	crowley."  nicky turns to valerie.

				nicky
		i never thought i'd ever see ozzy live
		until he was dead.
			(he looks at her)
		please tell me you like metal.

				valerie
			(sings along to song)
		"mister crowley, what's inside of your
		head..."

	nicky's jaw drops as he stares at her.

				nicky
		my dog was right.  i'm in love with you.

	they slow dance tighter.  the music swells.  john and peter
	look up from their seats far below.  nicky sees them while
	he's holding her tight.  they give thumbs up.
