	int. grand central station - day

	we see the big clock on the wall.  five minutes til noon.  we
	see john and peter (with the briefcase) walking into grand
	central with the chief and twenty-five nyc cops.  the chief
	bumps into a filthy bag lady drinking out of paper sack.

				bag lady
		hey, watch it!  who do you think you
		are?

				chief of police
			(never stopping)
		emperor of the new hell.
