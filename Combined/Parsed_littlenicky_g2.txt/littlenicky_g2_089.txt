	int. throne room - day

	dad is just a pair of lips, with ears on either side held up
	by two forearms with hands attached, lying on the throne.
	gatekeeper, lucifer, jimmy and a few other demons stand
	around.

				dad
		i can't see shit.  you're all still
		here, right?

	adrian enters.  they all cheer.

				jimmy the demon
		adrian's here.  you'll be back to normal
		in a jiffy, sir.

				dad lips
		yea!  i can't believe little nicky came
		through.

				adrian
		where's nicky?

				jimmy the demon
		he came with you and cassius, right?

				adrian
		i came through that gate alone.

				jimmy the demon
		sorry, sir, false alarm.

				dad
		boooo.

				adrian
		somebody explain what's going on.

	puts the gatekeeper in a headlock.

				gatekeeper
		you'll get nothing out of me.

				adrian
		perhaps a titty twister will loosen your
		lips.

	he twists a breast.  the gatekeeper babbles out the
	information immediately.

				gatekeeper
		the only way to save your dad is for you
		and your brothers to pass through the
		gates at the same time before he
		deteriorates completely.

				adrian
		how much time does dad have before that
		happens?

	adrian twists hard.

				gatekeeper
		thirty minutes.  and then whoever claims
		his throne will have unimaginable power.

	adrian throws him down.

				lucifer
		all boobs and no balls.

				adrian
		thirty minutes.  hmmm.  i hope you don't
		mind if i take a seat while i wait for
		you.

	he moves to the throne and throws the lips off.

				dad lips
		ahhh!

	he pushes lucifer out of the way.

				lucifer
		i don't get no respect.

				adrian
		ten thousand years.  and i never once
		got to sit here.

	he sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little.  he
	grins as two horns grow out of his forehead.

				adrian (cont'd)
		wow.  and this is just a little taste of
		my power.

				dad
		hell's gonna bust wide open.  demons,
		get him out of the chair!

	the demons approach.

				adrian
		ah-ah.  not so fast, demons.  there are
		a couple of million evil souls on earth
		ready to be harvested.  anyone
		interested?

	the demons stop.  now loyal to adrian.  all except jimmy.
