	they exit the ice cream store, eating gelati.

				nicky
		it's freezing my hands.

				valerie
		it's not that cold.  here, let me wrap
		it.

	valerie takes a few napkins and wraps it for nicky.  just
	then the preacher walks by.  he quickly turns his head,
	sensing nicky.

				preacher
		why do you taunt me with your darkness?!
		your evil is stinking up our streets!
		we're all gonna die!

	he takes off running right into a lamp post.

				valerie
		this town is really going to hell
		lately.
			(nicky nods)
		so what part of the city do you live in?

				nicky
		i have an apartment.  i don't remember
		exactly where.  my dog knows, though.

				valerie
			(laughs)
		you have a dog?  what kind?

				nicky
		i'm not sure.  i'd ask him, but he's
		uptown talking to his contacts.
