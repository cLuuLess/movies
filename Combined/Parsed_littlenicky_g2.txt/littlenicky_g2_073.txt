	ext. alley - day

	nicky is panicking, out of breath.  a bum (radioman) rises up
	out of his cardboard box.  the bum raises his bottle and
	thunks nicky on the head.  it doesn't break.

				nicky
		ow...what was that for?

				bum
		fifty million dollars.

	the bum holds up a new york post.  it reads "monster wanted!"
	and has a picture of nicky.  nicky is shocked.

	nicky turns to run out of the alley, but the mob is there
	blocking the entrance.  he's trapped.  they start running
	right at him.  he closes his eyes.

				nicky
		release the evil.

	nicky's body splits into about five-hundred horrifying
	insects, all with a miniature nicky head.

	the nickysects run right at the crowd, and the crows
	immediately starts running the other way, completely freaked
	out.
