	ext. beautiful field - day

	nicky is lying in a huge field of tall, very green grass.  he
	sits up, and feels his face to make sure it's all there.

	nicky looks around, alarmed.  he seems to be in a mountain
	vale, maybe in the foothills of the alps.  it's gorgeous.

	off in the distance, floating in the air, is a giant birthday
	cake.  nicky stands up and the cottage seems to be floating
	down to him.
