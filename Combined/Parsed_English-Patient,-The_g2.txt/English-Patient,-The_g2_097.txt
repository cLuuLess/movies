170	int.    kip's tent.    night.

hana lies over kip, unraveling his turban, slowly, sensual.

			hana
		if one night i didn't come to the tent,
		what would you do?
			kip
		i try not to expect you.

			hana
		but if it got late and i hadn't shown up?

			kip
		then i'd think there must be a reason.

			hana
		you wouldn't come to find me?
				(kip shrugs)
		that makes me never want to come here.

but she continues unraveling the turban.

			hana
		then i tell myself he spends all
		day searching, in the night he
		wants to be found.


171*.	ext.   basecamp at the cave of swimmers.  1939.  day.

the expedition team is packing up the basecamp.  madox and almásy are 
loading things into the plane.  fouad, al auf and others work at the 
cars.

			madox
		had a letter from my wife.  the wisteria
		is still out, which i'm looking forward
		to.  she says dorset is gripped with
		invasion fever.  wrong coast i
		should have thought, still...

			almÁsy
		right.

			madox
		bermann thinks he'll be interned,
		poor fellow.  i'm going to do what
		i can, but...  and d'ag turns out 
		to be a great admirer of mussolini.
		so now you can say i told you so.

			almÁsy
		i told you so.

			madox
		we didn't care about countries.
		did we?  brits, arabs, hungarians,
		germans.  none of that mattered,
		did it?  it was something finer than that.

			almÁsy
		yes.  it was.  thanks for the compass.
		i'll look after it for you.

			madox
				(shrugging this off)
		when's clifton picking you up?

			almÁsy
		tomorrow afternoon.  don't worry.
		i'll be ready.

			madox
		i'll leave the plane in the hangar at
		kufra oasis.  so if you need it...hard to
		know how long one's talking about.  we
		might all be back in a month or two.

madox kneels and takes a handful of sand, puts it into his pocket.  he 
throws his haversack into the plane then turns.  almásy puts out a 
hand.  this is a moment of great emotional weight for them both, 
conducted as if nothing were happening.

			madox
		i have to teach myself not to read
		too much into everything.  comes of
		too long having to read so much into
		hardly anything at all.

			almÁsy
		goodbye, my friend.

they shake hands.

			madox
		may god make safety your companion.

			almÁsy
				(a tradition)
		there is no god.
				(smiles)
		but i hope someone looks after you.

madox clambers into his plane, then remembers something, jabs at his 
throat.

			madox
		in case you're still wondering - this
		is called the supasternal notch.

almásy nods, goes to the propeller.

			madox
		come and visit us in dorset.  when
		all this nonsense is over.
				(then shrugs)
		you'll never come to dorset.

the plane roars into life.  almásy watches it taxi away - then heads 
back to continue with his packing up.


172*.	int.    the patient's room.    night.

madox shoots himself behind the altar in the room.  the patient's 
stertorous breathing, each intake accompanied by a small noise, a note, 
suddenly stops.  then steadies again.  he appears to be alone.
