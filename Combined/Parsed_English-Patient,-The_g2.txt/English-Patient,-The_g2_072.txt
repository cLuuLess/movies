129	int.   cairo street.   day.

almásy and madox walk down this busy and rather narrow street without 
pavements.  both of them somber.

			almÁsy
		why do they care about our maps?

			madox
		what do we find in the desert?  arrow
		heads, spears.  in a war, if you own the
		desert, you own north africa.

			almÁsy
				(contemptuous)
		own the desert.

almásy hesitates at a junction, clearly about to take leave of madox.

			almÁsy
		that place at the base of a woman's
		throat?  you know - the hollow - here -
		does that have an official name?

madox looks at him.

			madox
		for god's sake, man - pull
		yourself together.
