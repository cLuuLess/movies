	a victory celebration party.

the gramophone plays frank sinatra.  kip sits in the window, the 
shutters open, the village lit up behind his head, nodding to the 
music, sucking out of his condensed milk.  elsewhere there is an open 
bottle of cognac, some wine.  the patient has a beaker of wine.  
caravaggio is dancing with hana.

caravaggio swirls past the patient - nodding at the cognac.
