208	int.    the cave of swimmers.    torchlight.

alm√Åsy smudges katharine's pale face with color.  ochre across her 
brow, blue on her eyelids, red on her lips.  he presses his cheek to 
hers, smoothes her hair.

		...i want all this marked on my body.
		we are the real countries, not the
		boundaries drawn on maps with the
		names of powerful men...


209*.	ext.    the lane outside monastery garden.    day.

katharine's voice continues.  hana comes out to the truck, carrying her 
small bundle.  caravaggio effects some introduction, beginning with the 
woman driver, gioia.  she and caravaggio smile like lovers.

			caravaggio
		hana - this is gioia.

gioia smiles, shakes her hand.  then hana meets the others - gioia's 
brother and wife, their children.   she smiles at them.

			hana
		buon' giorno.

			caravaggio
		she can take you as far as florence.

			hana
		i can get in the back.

and she clambers up, sits down between the children.  they exchange 
some small stiff, shy smiles, and then the truck bounces away.  hana 
takes one final look at the monastery as it disappears around the bend 
and then turns and confronts the life insisting noisily in the truck.
