148	int.    interrogation room.    tobruk.    day.

later, and caravaggio comes round.  his eyes open and then his face 
spasms with pain.  he looks down at his ruined hands, then realizes 
he's alone on the floor of the room, the papers still scattered, the 
table on its side.  he gets up and staggers out of the open door and up 
the stairs.


149*.	int.  stairs from interrogation room.  tobruk.   day.
 
the corridor is deserted, but the body of a german soldier sprawls on 
the stairs leading up to daylight.  outside caravaggio can hear 
fighting.


150*.	ext.    roof.    interrogation building.    day.

caravaggio walks unsteadily along the roof of the building.  grey and 
yellow gusts of smoke and the rat-ta-tat-tat of machine gun fire 
accompany him, and there's the sound of vehicles screeching and people 
shouting nearby, but no visual clues as to what's happening.

suddenly a parachute floats down by him.  then another.  then another.  
he's surrounded by parachutes.  the british are reclaiming tobruk.  a 
paratrooper lands on the roof, and gestures to caravaggio to raise his 
hands.  he slowly does so.


151*.	int.    the patient's room.    night.

caravaggio stands in front of the bed, holding up his naked hands to 
the patient, like a man surrendering - two flaps like gills where his 
thumbs were.  the patient reaches out to take his hands and gently 
lowers them.  caravaggio finds his bandages, start to wrap them back 
round his fists.

			caravaggio
		the man who took my thumbs, i found
		him eventually - he's dead.  the man who
		took my photograph, i found him too -
		that took me a year.  he's dead.  another
		man took that man across the desert to
		cairo.  now i intend to find him.

the lights from the motorbike approaching the monastery, its growl.  
caravaggio goes to the window and watches as kip and hana arrive.
