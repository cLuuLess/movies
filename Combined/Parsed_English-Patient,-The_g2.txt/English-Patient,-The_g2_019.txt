30	ext.    basecamp at pottery hill.    dusk.

almÁsy and madox walk out to intercept the arrivals as the first arab 
dismounts, the procession of camels splaying out as if in collapse.  
almásy speaks in arabic, exchanging the ritual greetings.

during this, fenelon-barnes, sole european in this expedition, has 
finally persuaded his camel to sit, and dismounts irritably, slapping 
the animal in disgust.

			fenelon-barnes
		ugly brute.  shits and roars and
		complains all day.
				(bypassing almásy and
approaching madox)
		of course, you have your aeroplane.  
		two now!  do you still call yourselves
		explorers?  i assume not.

			madox
				(stiffly)
		fenelon-barnes.

			almÁsy
		yes, i think a sailor can call himself an
		explorer, can't he?  or should columbus
		have swum to america?
