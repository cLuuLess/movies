152	int.   ambassador's residence.   cairo, 1939.   night.

last seen at the troops christmas party, the inner courtyard has been 
transformed into an elegant outdoor banquet, with band. the 
almásy/madox team is assembled for a farewell dinner.  they are waiting 
for almásy to arrive, his seat conspicuously empty.  he is very late.  
and then he's there, dangerous drunk, terribly dashing.  he practically 
dances to his chair, which he drags violently away from its position 
opposite katharine.  he bows to lady hampton.

			almÁsy
		i believe i'm rather late.

			madox
				(ignoring the drama of this entrance)
		good, we're all here?  a toast,
		to the international sand club -
		may it soon resurface.

			the others
		the international sand club!

			almÁsy
				(raising his glass)
		misfits, buggers, fascists, and
		paedophiles.  god bless us every one.

the others drink, trying to ignore his mood.

			almÁsy
		oops!  mustn't say international.  
		dirty word.  filthy word.  his majesty!
		die führer!  il duce.

			clifton
		sorry, what's your point?

			almÁsy
				(ignoring the remark)
		and the people here don't want us.
		are you kidding?  the egyptians are
		desperate to get rid of the colonials...
				(to an embarrassed fouad)
		- isn't that right?  their best people
		get down on hands and knees 
		begging to be spared a knighthood.
				(to his host, sir hampton)
		isn't that right?

ronnie hampton shrugs.  they're all very uncomfortable.  almásy glares 
at clifton.

			almÁsy
		what's my point?
				(standing up)
		oh!  i've invented a new dance - the
		bosphorus hug.  anybody up to it?
		madox?  d'ag?  come on d'aggers.

			d'agostino
		let's eat first.  sit down.

the band is now playing manhattan - almásy, without missing a beat, 
begins to sing, replacing the words with alternatives he knows.  he 
lurches around.  katharine can't look at him.

			almÁsy
		...we'll bathe at brighton, the fish
		we'll frighten when we're in.  your
		bathing suit so thin will make the
		shellfish grin, fin to fin. --  those
		were the words - actually - before
		they were cleaned up.  could be a
		song for you, mrs. clifton -
				(a perfect english accent)
		#name?

madox gets up and pulls almásy into his chair, taking charge.

			madox
		look, either shut up, or go home.

			almÁsy 
				(darkly)
		absolutely right, shut up.  lashings of
		apologies all round.


153*.	ext.    ambassador's residence.    night.

later, now most of the group are dancing.  we see katharine dancing 
with rupert douglas, enjoying herself.  bermann is there and even madox 
jogging and grinning foolishly.  clifton looks at katharine who, as the 
dance ends, excuses herself to go to the cloakroom.  almásy hovers in 
the shadows, unseen.


154*.	int.    ambassador's residence.    night.

katharine comes along the familiar warren of rooms and corridors and is 
suddenly confronted by almásy, tortured and out of control.

			almÁsy
		why did you hold his collar?

			katharine
		what?

			almÁsy
				(mimicking her inflection)
		what?  what?  that boy, that little boy,
		you were holding his collar, gripping
		his collar, what for?

			katharine
		would you let me pass?

			almÁsy
		is he next?  do you drag him into your
		little room?  where is it?  is this it?

			katharine
		don't do this.

			almÁsy
		i've watched you - on verandahs, at
		garden parties, at the races - how
		can you stand there?  how can you
		ever smile?  as if your life hadn't capsized?

			katharine
		you know why?

he tries to hold her.  she resists

			almÁsy
		dance with me.

			katharine
		no.

			almÁsy
		dance with me.  i want to touch you.
		i want the things which are mine.
		which belong to me.

			katharine
		do you think you're the only one who
		feels anything?  is that what you think?

some women, flushed with dancing, turn the corner on the way to the 
ladies room.  they collect katharine in their train and leave almásy to 
fall back into the shadows.
