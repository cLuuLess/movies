120	int.    the patient's room.    morning.

cheek to cheek leaks into the room from a gramophone that caravaggio 
stands over proudly.  the patient opens his eyes - is confused, 
dislocated - stares blankly at caravaggio.

			caravaggio
				(grinning)
		thought you'd never wake up!

			the patient
		what?

hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.

			hana
		where did you find that?

			caravaggio
		i liberated it.

			hana
		i think that's called looting.

			caravaggio
				(relaxed)
		no-one should own music.  the real
		question is who wrote the song?

			the patient
		irving berlin.

			caravaggio
		for?

			the patient
		top hat.

			caravaggio
		is there a song you don't know?

			hana
				(speaking for him)
		no.  he sings all the time.

she goes over to the patient and kisses him gently.

			hana
		good morning.
				(of his singing)
		did you know that?  you're always singing?

			the patient
		i've been told that before.

			hana
		kip's another one.

she goes to the window, looks over to where the tents are pitched, sees 
hardy shaving, kip in the process of washing his hair, his turban 
hanging like a ribbon between two trees to dry.  he's perched a bowl on 
the sundial and is dipping his long coal-black hair into it.  as hana 
watches kip, caravaggio changes the record.  the patient identifies it 
immediately.


121*.	ext.    monastery garden.     morning.

hana walks past the tent, and passes hardy.  she's carrying a small 
cup, which she's a little furtive about.  he's carrying a whole armada 
of oil lights.  he nods upstairs.

			hana
		hello.

			hardy
		hello miss.

			hana
		i was going to say - if you want to
		eat with us, ever... you and lieutenant
		singh...

			hardy
		very kind of you, we can always eat in
		the town with the others -

			hana
		since caravaggio turned up - food
		seems to appear, so please.

			hardy
		i'll ask the lieutenant.  but thank you.

			hana
		you saved my life.  i haven't forgotten.
				(hardy waves that away)
		i thought you were very very tall.  you
		seemed to big - a giant - and i felt
		like a child who can't keep her balance.

			hardy
				(does a little mime)
		a toddler

she goes on, and tentatively approaches kip, who's still working at his 
hair.  kip hears her and puts out an inquiring arm, moving towards her 
like a blink man through the curtain of hair.  he touches her.

			hana
		sorry, is it all right i'm seeing this?

kip shrugs.

			hana
		my hair was long.  at some point.  
		i've forgotten what a nuisance it is
		to wash.  you know - if you were ever
		around - we get water from the pump
		at noon.

he continues to wash.  she holds up the cup of oil.

			hana
		try this.  i found a great jar of it.  
		olive oil.  in naples this was so
		precious it would have bought you a wife.

			kip
		thank you.

she stands for a second, then walks away.  kip examines the oil, calls 
after her.

			kip
		for my hair?

			hana
				(turning, smiling)
		yes, for your hair.
