28	int.    the patient's room.    day.

close on the herodotus.  the patient opens its cover, held together by 
leather ties.  loose papers, photographs, hand-drawn maps and sketches 
are all collected between the pages.  he claws at some water-colors 
which appear to be based on cave paintings - figures, dark-skinned 
warriors of the stone age, some with bows in their hands, others with 
plumes in their hair - arranged in abstract patterns uncannily like 
those of matisse.  some appear to be swimming, another is diving.  then 
the patient loses control of the papers and the whole parcel spills to 
the floor with a crack.
