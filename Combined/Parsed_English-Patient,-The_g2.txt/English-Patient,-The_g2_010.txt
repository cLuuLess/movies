16	ext.    the monastery garden.    day.

hana comes out, passes a dry water trough.  she hears a rustling on the 
gravel and turns to see a tortoise ambling towards the trough.  on cue 
there's a gurgling sound.  the handleless pump is suddenly gushing, 
splashing water everywhere.  the tortoise, clearly arriving for this, 
enjoys a welcome shower.  hana goes to the trough, dips her hands into 
the water.  looks around her, and makes a decision.
