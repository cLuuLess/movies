196	ext.    kip's tent.    late day.

hana approaches.  kip is inside the tent, the flap zipped.  she sees 
his shadow move, then freeze as she calls his name.  it's like a 
confessional.  the flap between them, the man in shadows, hana 
crouched, forlorn.

		why?  it's another bomb.  however
		big, what's the difference?  there've
		been so many bombs.  what about
		coventry?  what about dresden?
		where were those cities?
				(no response)
		i don't understand.  let me come in.

the shadow doesn't move.  hana is at a loss.
