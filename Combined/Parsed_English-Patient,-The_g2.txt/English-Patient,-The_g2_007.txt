11	ext.    village.    dusk.

the convoy is threading through a ruined village, passing the souvenirs 
of war.  an overturned vehicle now used as a game by some children, 
dejected refugees tramping along the side of the road.  from the end of 
one of the buildings are hanging half a dozen corpses, strung upside 
down with crude placards denouncing, in italian, their collaboration 
with the nazis.
