32	ext.    basecamp at pottery hill.    night.

	later, supper over, the company is entertaining itself.

almásy, standing outside his tent, watches the merriment from a 
distance.

d'ag is nearing the end of a passionate rendition of  puccini's e 
lucevan le stelle.  he sits down to much applause from the others and 
spins an empty champagne bottle on the sand.  it comes to rest pointing 
at clifton who gets up, grinning, and plunges into yes! we have no 
bananas with great gusto.  his version involves changing language 
during each line of the chorus - prompted by oui!  or ja!  or si!  from 
the others.  song finished, much bowing and guying, he spins the bottle 
and it arrives equidistant between fenelon-barnes and katharine - until 
with a little nudge from the husband it settles on his wife.  katharine 
gets up, awkward.

			katharine
		i can't sing.
				(the audience groans)
		but i can tell a story.
				(to almásy, who has arrived)
		i might need a prompt.  do you have your
		herodotus?  i've noticed you carry it...

			almÁsy
		i'm sorry - what have you noticed?

			madox
		your book.  your herodotus!

almásy looks uncomfortable.

			katharine
				(reacting quickly)
		it doesn't matter.  really.  i think i can
		muddle through.  okay - the story of 
		candaules and gyges.  king candaules was
		passionately in love with his wife -
				(geoffrey whistles proudly)
		one day he said to gyges, the son of
		somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -

			almÁsy
				(quietly prompting her)
		daskylus...

			katharine
				(smiles)
		yes, thank you, gyges, son of daskylus -
		candaules said to him i don't think you
		believe me when i tell you how beautiful
		my wife is.  and although gyges replied he
		did find the queen magnificent the king 
		insisted he would find some way to prove
		beyond dispute that she was fairest of
		all women.  do you all know this story?

the men all encourage her to continue her story.


33*.	int.    the patient's room.    night.

- and hana's voice continues the story as she reads to the patient who 
listens, eyes closed, still in the desert.

			hana
				(reading from the herodotus)
		i will hide you in the room where 
		we sleep, said candaules.

she stumbles over the word.

			the patient
		candaules

			hana
				(not neurotic)
		candaules...you're laughing at me.

			the patient
		i'm not laughing at you.  go on, please.

			hana
		when my wife comes to lie down she always
		lays her garments one by one on a seat
		near the entrance of the room, and from
		where you stand you will be able to gaze
		on her at your leisure...

			katharine
				(her story continuing)
		and that evening, it's exactly as the
		king had told him, she goes to the chair
		and removes her clothes, one by one, 
		until she stand naked in full view of
		gyges.  and indeed she was more lovely
		than he could have imagined.

almásy stares at her, framed by the velvet black sky.  katharine turns 
to looks at him.

			katharine
		but then the queen looked up and saw
		gyges concealed in the shadows.   and
		though she said nothing, she shuddered.
		the next day she sent for gyges and
		challenged him.  and hearing his story,
		she said this -

			clifton
		off with his head!

			katherine
		#name?
		death for gazing on that which you
		should not, or else kill my husband who
		shamed me and become king in his place.

clifton makes a face of outrage.  for katherine the story has 
collapsed.  she wants it to be finished.

			katherine
		so gyges killed the king and married
		the queen and became ruler of lydia
		for twenty eight years.  the end.
				(an uncomfortable moment)
		do i spin the bottle?

almásy shrinks away from the fire, disappears into black.

			madox
				(to clifton)
		and let that be a lesson to you!
