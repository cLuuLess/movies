100	int.  triage tent, emergency field hospital.  night.

hana walks through the main triage tent.  it's packed with the ruined 
bodies of the injured, swaddled in bloody bandages.  hana stops at a 
couple of beds, shares a word or two with the patients.  she stops at 
another bed, leans over its occupant.  his bandaged face is bloated and 
yellow.  he's not breathing.  she bends over him, his open eyes fixed 
in a glassy stare.  no pulse.  she snaps the triangular cardboard id 
from his bed to indicate he's died.  then tenderly closes his eyes.  
they suddenly snap open.  he rears up, grabbing her.

			wounded soldier
		can't wait to have me dead?  you bitch!

he slaps her hand away.  slaps at the tubes going into his arm.  hana 
is absolutely shocked.  but just as suddenly he's sunk back into semi-
consciousness.

shaken, she sits by him and takes his hand, he pulls it away, she takes 
it again.  he is in terrible pain.  his face creased with anger.  now 
his hand is clutching at hers.  she tries to soothe him.

			hana
		try t be calm.  ssssshhh.  come on.
		be calm now.  ssshhhh.  be peaceful.
		it's okay.  it's okay.

his face stills.  his hand loosens.  now he has gone.  as hana inspects 
him, a shell seems to land close by.  the lights flicker.  she ducks, 
along with everyone else.

below the bed, on slatboards, above the mud, are the now dead soldier's 
possessions.  they include a pair of tennis shoes.
