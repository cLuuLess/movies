123	int.    the monastery.    upstairs landing.    day.

hana walks along the landing with a tray.  there's a message on several 
doors in the corridor from kip: safe, then a couple with the warning: 
danger.  she hears noise from the patient's room.  listens for a second 
before going in.

			the patient (o/s)
		because you're reading it too fast!

			the patient (o/s)
		not at all.

			the patient (o/s)
		you have to read kipling slowly!
		your eye is too impatient - think
		about the speed of his pen.
				(quoting kipling to demonstrate)
		what is it - he sat comma in defiance
		of municipal orders comma astride the
		gun zamzammah on her brick... what is it?
