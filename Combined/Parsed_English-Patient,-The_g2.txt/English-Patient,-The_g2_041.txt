79	int.    shelter.    day.

almásy sits alone, writing into his herodotus, a map folded in front of 
him, from which he makes notes.  katherine comes across with a clutch 
of her sketches from the cave wall.  hands them to him.  they're 
beautiful.

			almÁsy
		what's this?

			katharine
		i thought you might paste them
		into your book.

			almÁsy
		we took several photographs,
		there's no need.

			katharine
		i'd like you to have them.

			almÁsy
				(handing them back)
		there's really no need.  this is
		just a scrapbook.  i should feel
		obliged.  thank you.

			katharine
				(exasperated)
		and that would be unconscionable,
		i suppose, to feel any obligation?  
		yes.  of course it would.

she's already turning, walking as far from him as the cramped shelter 
permits.  he continues with his maps.
