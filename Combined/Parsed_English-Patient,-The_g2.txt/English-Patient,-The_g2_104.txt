183	ext.    well.    day.

almásy lowers himself by an old rope down into a gully.  he approaches 
a pile of stones and removes them to reveal a brackish pool of filthy 
water.  he drinks, pouring water over his head, grimacing at the taste, 
but parched too.


184*.	ext.    approaching el taj.    day.

almásy gets his first sight of the fortress town of el taj and sinks to 
his knees, in relief and exhaustion.  then he gets up and trudges 
towards the town.  a corporal with a rifle in his hands appears.


184a*.	int.    el taj.    day.

the corporal brings almásy into a square.  a young officer appears from 
the shadows of his office.  his jeep is parked in the shade.

			officer
		good morning!

			almÁsy
		could i trouble you for some water?

			officer
				(registering the accented english)
		yes, of course.
				(the corporal has a water bottle,
hands it to almásy)
		so, golly, where have you come from?

			almÁsy
				(gulping the water)
		i desperately need a jeep.  there's
		been an accident.

			officer
		i see.

			almÁsy
				(brain racing)
		no, i'm not thinking clearly - i need
		a doctor too, to come with me, can i
		take this vehicle?  i'll pay, of course -
		and some morphine and...
				(calculating)
		seventy miles - i can be back
		here by dusk.

			officer
		do you have your papers, sir?

			almÁsy
		what?

			officer
		if i could just see some identification.

			almÁsy
		am i not talking sense? -  forgive me,
		i'm, i've been walking, i've - there's a
		woman badly injured at gilf kebir,
		in the cave of swimmers.  i am a
		member of the royal geographical
		society.

			officer
		right.  and what's your name, sir?

			almÁsy
		count laszlo de almásy.

the officer is writing this down.  a glance at his corporal.

			officer
		almásy - would you mind just
		spelling that for me?  what
		nationality would that be?

			almÁsy
		look, listen to me.  a woman is dying -
		my wife! - is dying seventy miles from
		here.  i have been walking for three
		days!  i don't want to spell my name, 
		i want you to give me this jeep!

			officer
				(writing)
		i understand you are agitated -
		perhaps you would like to sit down
		while i radio back to hq -

			almÁsy
				(snapping)
		no!  no!  don't radio anybody,
		just give me the fucking jeep!

almásy sets on the officer, hauling him by the lapels, but them 
immediately loses his balance.  as he stumbles up he gets the stock of 
the corporal's rifle across his head, knocking him to the ground.


185*.	ext.   el taj street.    day.

almásy, head pounding, is in the back of the jeep, chained to the 
tailgate.  he's desperate.  the corporal is driving.

			almÁsy
				(shouting hoarse)
		hey!  hey!  stop this jeep!  let me
		out of here - there's a woman dying,
		there's a woman dying while i'm - hey!

			corporal
		shut-up!

			almÁsy
		please - i beg you, i beg you, i beg you,
		please listen to me, this is a terrible
		mistake.  just stop, please, and
		listen to me.  my wife is dying.

			corporal
		listen, fritz, if i have to listen
		to another word from you i'll
		give you a fucking good hiding.

			almÁsy
		fritz?  what are you talking about?
		who's fritz?

			corporal
		that's your name innit?  count
		fucking arsehole von bismarck?
		what's that supposed to be then, irish?

almásy, berserk, starts to yank at his chains, screaming.

			almÁsy
		let me out, let me out, let me out -
		katharine!  katharine!
