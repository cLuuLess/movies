133	ext.    monastery olive groves.    day.

hana appears at the edge of the olive groves and hurries towards kip, 
who hasn't moved.  he shouts warning her.

			kip
		go to the left!  keep to the left!  there
		are mines and trip wires everywhere!

hana stops, hoists up her skirt and circles left, tentative in the long 
grass.  he shouts, doesn't want her close.

			kip
		get hardy.  he's on the other side of 
		town.  in the hills.  get him to hurry.

she keeps coming, can see that he needs her.

			hana
		it's okay - i'll help.  please.

			kip
		the mines, the wires, there's a trick.
		some explode if you stretch the wires,
		some if you cut them.

			hana
		what do i do?

			kip
		there's a mine here, but the others are
		far enough away, i think at least to
		give me a chance.  i have to work out
		which one to cut before i fall over.

			hana
		so i follow the wires?

			kip
		you get hardy.

			hana
		i follow the wires.

she kneels at his feet and tries to trace the tangled route of the web.

			kip
		don't touch them.

she follows one wire back to the closest mine, and traces another back 
to kip's foot.  then she finds another one leading off to a second mine 
some thirty metres away.

			hana
		why would anyone do this?

			kip
		i've done this.  i've had to do this.

	then hana's suddenly tense.

			hana
		give me a second.

she turns and tiptoes right through the danger area, straight to what 
had seized her attention.  kip is appalled.

			kip
		what are you doing?!  hana!

heedless, she dodges another mine and its web of wires just as the 
tortoise clambers onto a clump of rock, which is, in fact, another 
concrete-covered mine.

hana snatches him up as he ambles towards the metal.  she turns, 
holding the protesting animal in triumph.  her foot snags on a wire.  
she has to ease it off, in arabesque, still clutching the tortoise.   
she goes sideways to the safe zone - setting down the animal.  then 
she's back with kip.  he's seething.  she is strangely elated.

			kip
		what is this business with you and
		explosives?  do you think you're immune?

			hana
		i promise you that was the right thing
		to do.  he's my good luck.
				(she gets the pliers from his belt,
and hands them to him)
		now cut.  this one.
				(she indicates the wire)
		i hope we don't die.

			kip
		okay.  get away from here.  quick.

			hana
		i'm not scared.  so many people have
		died around me.  but i would be a
		shame for us.
				(shrugs)
		i don't feel like being shy.

			kip
		you must get away.  before i cut.  i'm
		not cutting if you're here.

he's struggling.  he's going to topple over if he cuts.

			hana
		actually, you can't cut, can you?
		you'll fall over.  give me the pliers.

			kip
		no.

but he hands them over.

			hana
		kiss me.  before i cut.  just in case.


			kip
		don't talk.  check again.  lie flat and
		then cut.

hana checks, lies down.  he bends as close to the ground as he dares 
and kisses her, then she immediately cuts.
