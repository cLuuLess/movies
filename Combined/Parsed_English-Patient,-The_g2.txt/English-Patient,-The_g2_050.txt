93	ext.    shepheard's hotel.    day.

almásy, still in the same clothes, and evidently weary, emerges from 
the cab, and pulls katharine's belongings from the trunk, then holds 
open the door for her.  as she walks towards the hotel, he hands her 
bag to a porter.  katharine is stung.

			katharine
		will you not come in?

			almÁsy
		no.

			katharine
		will you please come in?

			almÁsy
				(a beat)
		mrs. clifton -

	katharine turns, disgusted.

			katharine
		don't.  

			almÁsy
		i believe you still have my book.

katharine fishes the book from her knapsack, shoves it at him, then 
disappears.
