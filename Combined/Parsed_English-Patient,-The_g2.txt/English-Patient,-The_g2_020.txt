31	int.    basecamp at pottery hill.    dusk.

the arrivals come inside.  madox handles the introductions.

			madox
		i think you know all of us, except for
		geoffrey and katharine clifton, who've
		recently come out from england.

			clifton
		apprentices.

			madox
		this is clive fenelon-barnes.

			fenelon-barnes
				(to katharine)
		i know your mother, of course.

			katharine
		hello.

			fenelon-barnes
		i'm also searching for the lost oasis, 
		but by more authentic means.

			madox
				(of almásy)
		anyway, my friend here has a new theory -
		that zerzura doesn't exist.  so we may all
		be chasing windmills.  have some food.

			fenelon-barnes
		well, it's certainly not between here and
		dakhla.  nine days of nothing but sand
		and sandstorms.  an egg.  i found an
		ostrich egg and some fossils.

			katharine
		isn't zerzura supposed to be protected by
		spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?

			almÁsy
		what kind of fossils?

			fenelon-barnes
		i'll invite you to my paper at the
		royal geographical society.
		are you still a member?

he takes a long drink from a bowl of frothing camel milk.

			almÁsy
		i think you know i am.

			fenelon-barnes
				(ignoring almásy)
		quite impossible, madox.  you must know 
		that.  if you attempt to cross the sand
		sea due east of kufra by car you'll leave
		your bones in the sand for me to collect.

			almÁsy
				(leaving the tent)
		if you come across my bones - i hope
		you'll do me the honor of leaving 
		them in peace.
				(to katharine)
		excuse me.

			fenelon-barnes
		you have my word as a gentleman.
				(watching him leave)
		i've discovered a unique type of
		sand-dune.  i've applied to the king
		for permission to call it 
		the fenelon-barnes formation.
