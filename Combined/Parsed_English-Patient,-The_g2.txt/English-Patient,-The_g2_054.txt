101	int.  triage tent, emergency field hospital.  evening.

hana, wearing the tennis shoes, is giving blood.  she lies in a cot, 
next to jan.  the shelling sounds closer.

oliver, the doctor, is working on the most recent patient, a young 
canadian boy who is critically ill - the tubes hanging above him, of 
plasma and of blood.  the curtain drawn around him is pulled back, to 
reveal the two nurses in the background.  the soldier can just see 
them.  he's going to die any minute.  

			canadian soldier
				(whispering to oliver)
		is there anybody here from picton?

			oliver
		picton?  i don't know.

			canadian soldier
		i'd like to see somebody from home
		before i go.

hana can only really hear oliver's end of this conversation, but the 
mention of canada chills her, and she knows, now, not later, that 
stuart is dead.

			hana 
				(to oliver)
		why picton?

			oliver
		he's from there - edge of lake
		ontario right, soldier?

the boy nods.

			jan 
				(innocent)
		where's your stuart from?
		somewhere near there, isn't it?

			hana
				(to oliver)
		as him what company he's with?

oliver leans over, then turns to hana.

			oliver
		third canadian fusiliers.

			hana
		does he know a captain mcgann?

the boy hears this, whispers to oliver.

			canadian soldier
		he bought it.  yesterday.  shot to bits.

the shells are getting closer.

			hana
		what did he say?

			oliver
				(can't look at her)
		doesn't know him.

a shell suddenly lands on top of the site, perhaps fifty yards from the 
tent.  the lights go out.  then another lands.

everybody is on the floor, struggling to get on a helmet.

hana lies down, the blood still leaving her, her helmet on.  oliver is 
next to her in the mud.  her heart is breaking.

			hana
		he's gone, hasn't he?

			oliver
		no.  he's - no.

			hana
		oh god.  oh god.

the shells pound them, incredibly loud, drowning out her grief, but 
each explosion illuminates it for a moment.
