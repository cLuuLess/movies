mcclintock hurries down the long aisle filled with monkey
cages stacked two high on both sides. keeping pace is
felder, the president of bio-test.
                        felder
          these animals are all healthy.

mcclintock turns to a dozen biosafety-suited figures,
each carrying a doctor's bag.
                           mcclintock
          fan out.
they each go off in a separate direction, leaving
mcclintock and felder opposite a cage of african green
monkeys. mcclintock opens his black bag, takes out a
strange looking pistol and feeds in a cartridge con-
taining a turquoise-blue liquid (amobarbital).

          one of these animals may be the
          host of the worst virus the world
          has ever known.
felder shudders.     mcclintock thunders into his walkie-
talkie.
                           mcclintock
          make sure    the animals are
          completey    tranquilized before
          specimens    are drawn. use all
          level four    precautions.
felder squirms as mcclintock aims the pistol at the green
monkey, who grabs the bars of the cage and hisses. as
one gun after another goes off --

hospital parking lot - near portable bl-4 lab
chemwar-suited infantrymen standing with m-16s held
ready. behind them is a pre-school with a yardful of
toys now abandoned.
the infantrymen stare at the brown rhesus, held tightly
in a "squeeze cage." robby, mike, lisa, and wally look
on anxiously as izzy approaches the monkey with a needle
attached to a long syringe. the rhesus strains with
every muscle to lash out. izzy moves quickly, jabbing
the needle into the monkey's thigh. he pushes the
plunger. the rhesus suddenly jerks his arm.
                           robby
          izzy!

needle heads for izzy's hand (slow motion)
but he yanks it back just in time.

on izzy
trembling.   a long beat.

back to scene
the rhesus falls asleep. izzy draws blood as a jeep
carrying ford pulls up, followed by an army truck.
soldiers empty the truck, piling up crates of plastic iv
bags filled with brown fluid.
                        ford
          filo-four antiserum. antitoxin.
          anyone with symptoms or positive
          blood tests will get it stat.

                            gillespie
          what for?
                        ford
          it kills twenty-five percent of
          filoviruses.
                          izzy
          not motaba.    we tried it.
                       ford
          in the lab. people react
          differently.
gillespie and izzy exchange a skeptical glance: is ford
losing it, or what?
                        ford
          we have nothing to lose -- the
          disease is incurable.

                        robby
          general ford is right.
                            ford
          thank you.
