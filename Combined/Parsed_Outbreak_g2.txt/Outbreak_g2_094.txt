int. awacs plane
inside, the radar operators scan.   they're pissed.

                        radar operator
          where the hell did it go?
                                              cut to:

black hawk (directly below on interstate 5)
flies just thirty feet above the freeway, at the same
speed as the traffic. the black hawk's radar detector
squawks each time the awacs radar scans it, every two
seconds.

inside black hawk

salt flies anxiously. one moment of inattention could
bring the black hawk down on top of one of the cars on
the freeway.
                        salt
          it moves like a truck, it reflects
          radar like a truck, but guess what?
          it ain't a truck.

on interstate below black hawk
an irate driver is watching salt and yelling into his
cellular phone:
                        irate driver
          that's right, sheriff -- flying
          too goddamn low --
