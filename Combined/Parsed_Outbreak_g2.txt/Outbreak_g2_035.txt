int. 757 cabin
jimbo scott is asleep against the window in the back
row of the plane.
                         billy boy (o.s.)
          bang, bang!   you're dead.
jimbo bolts up, and looks groggily at the four-year-
old boy standing on the next seat: he's dressed in
a cowboy's outfit with a huge sheriff's star pinned
to his chest. he sneezes right in jimbo's face. his
mother puts down her cosmo.
                        billy boy's mother
          billy!?  say you're sorry.
                 (to jimbo)
          he's so excited; he's going to
          see his cousins.
                        billy boy
          my uncle's a real cowboy at a
          rodeo.
jimbo looks terrible. his eyes are red and he's
having trouble swallowing. he grabs his pillow and
blanket and gets up. billy jabs his six guns into
jimbo's belly:
                        billy boy
          where d'you think you're goin',
          mister?
                        jimbo
          someplace they don't have lawmen.
he goes to the back of the plane where's it's deserted,
and lies down across three seats. his body shakes
with a chill. he pulls the blanket tight against his
chest.
                                              cut to:
