mike and izzy strip off their clothes.

                        izzy
          admit it, for chrissakes: the dogs
          will get better care with her than
          they got with you.
                        gillespie
          that really cheers me up.
                        izzy
          you think cause we're friends i
          should ignore reality.
                        gillespie
          i think cause we're friends you
          might show some tact.
                                            (continued)

                                                        29.

                        izzy
          you were gone so often that when
          you were home... you spoiled 'em.
          robby keeps an even keel.
                        gillespie
          hey, she's available...
                        izzy
          don't think i haven't thought
          about it.
                         gillespie
          you're just what she's looking
          for. mr. stability. three wives
          in five years.
                        izzy
          two. i never married sherry.    i
          liked her too much...
izzy pulls a red air hose down from the ceiling and in-
flates his space suit before he puts it on; this is stan-
dard safety procedure. mike steps right into his suit.
                        izzy
          what are you doing?
                        gillespie
          what?
                        izzy
          you forgot to test your suit.
          look! it's torn.
there is a small tear on the left leg of gillespie's suit.

they both realize gillespie's mistake could have cost him
his life.
                          izzy
                  (beams)
          if i let you die, who've i got to
          rag on?
