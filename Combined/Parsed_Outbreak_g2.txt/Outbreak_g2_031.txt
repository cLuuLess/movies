int. red nissan
in her cage in the back seat, betsy moves back and forth
restlessly, a baby bottle of water in her hand.
                        jimbo
          cars put babies to sleep, why
          not you?
betsy takes a mouthful of water and spits it on jimbo.
his reaction is instant rage. he slams the cage:

                        jimbo
          you stupid fucking monkey!
          why'dya wanna go and do that?
he shoves the cage further away. then he sees it - a
small cut on his hand, caused by a couple of wire pro-
trusions on the cage. he rubs the blood off on his shirt.
the nissan roars down the road.
                                           cut to:

extreme closeup - tissue culture - through electron
microscope
a normal cell.
                        salt (o.s.)
          a normal healthy liver cell.
the image changes.

                           salt (o.s.)
          infected cell.
the infected cell is swollen and filled with black brick-
like structures.
                        salt (o.s.)
          bricks of virus. they multiply
          until...
the image changes: the bricks have completely overrun the
cell, shattering its outer membrane so that bricks run
rampant inside and outside the cell.

                        salt (o.s.)
          they explode the cell and destroy
          it. then they move on to the next
          healthy cell. and the next. 'til
          there's nothing left to kill.
