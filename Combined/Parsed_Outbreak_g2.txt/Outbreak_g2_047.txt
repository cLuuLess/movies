int. boston municipal hospital - pathology lab
boston doctor #3, in a biosafety suit, stares at jimbo's
naked body lying on the autopsy table. dr. sanchez,
also in a biosafety suit, stands opposite.

                        julio sanchez
          go very carefully, very slowly.
          maximum sharps precautions.
sweat drips off boston doctor #3's face, fogging his
visor. he starts to make the first cut, but his hand
is trembling too much.
                        julio sanchez
          don't let your eyes leave the
          blade. ever. and you'll be okay.
doctor #3 cuts deep into jimbo's ribs but no matter
how slowly he cuts, the sharp edge of the scalpel
seems too close to his fingers. pull back to reveal
they're doing the autopsy in a plastic tent using
negative pressure suction pumps. as the pumps whir...
                                             cut to:

          jesus -- the liver, spleen,
          kidneys -- they've turned into
          jelly.

          it's as if they swallowed a bomb
          and it went off inside them.
                        (more)

                        julio sanchez (cont'd)
          i don't know if it's motaba but
          it sure looks like what gillespie
          described.
intercut with:

robby
at her kitchen table. petrified. we see she's been
working late: her laptop's on, papers are strewn about.

                        robby
                 (into phone)
          how many were exposed?
                        julio sanchez
          too many. the medical staff
          didn't know what they were dealing
          with so they didn't take
          precautions. they're scared outa
          their minds.
julio gazes through the glassed-in walls at the half-
dozen pathology residents and nurses, peering at him
with worried expressions. he spins around in his
chair so he doesn't have to see them.
                        julio sanchez
          that's just the beginning.
          patient zero -- this guy jimbo
          scott -- worked in an animal
          quarantine facility in san jose,
          california. that's probably where
          he picked it up. probably the
          whole place is infected by now and
          is gonna have to be nuked.
                 (beat)
          it gets worse. jimbo here takes
          a goddamn plane from portland to
          boston. the plane stopped in
          chicago. two hundred and eight
          people on the first leg, and
          christ, something like two hundred
          and fifty on the second! if this
          guy was infectious, by now the
          whole country's been exposed. and
          gillispie says there's no treatment
          for this mother, nothing to do but
          pronounce people dead. what are
          we supposed to do, robby? christ,
          what the hell are we supposed to do?
                                           (continued)

                                                        58.
continued:
                        robby
                 (coolly)
          gillespie said motaba only spreads
          by direct contact, that the
          disease isn't airborne. was
          patient zero coughing?
sanchez flips through scott's medical record.
                        julio sanchez
          i don't see anything about his
          coughing.
                        robby
          then the people on the plane are
          probably okay. but we're going to
          have to check every one of them
          out. plus all the medical staff
          who worked on him and his
          girl friend. plus all their recent
          contacts.
                        julio sanchez
          -- that's thousands of people --
                        robby
          -- i don't see a choice --
                        julio sanchez
          -- this whole hospital is buzzin'
          with rumors... it's gonna hit the
          press real soon. what are we
          gonna tell them?
                        robby
          that the c.d.c. is investigating
          the situation, but we do not feel
          there's reason for alarm. i know
          it's scary, julio, but the truth
          is we don't know what it is yet.
                        julio sanchez
          gillespie's the only one who can
          tell us.
robby has mixed emotions: the last person she wants to
involve is her ex-husband.
                        robby
          send him everything by stat
          courier.
                        julio sanchez
          got it.
                                              (continued)

                                                      59.
continued:
he hangs up. stay with robby: her mind racing. she
punches in a speed-dial key. an operator answers:
                        operator (v.o.)
          center for disease control.
                        robby
          this is dr. keough.   put out a
          stage three alert.
                        operator (v.o.)
          your password, doctor?
                        robby
          zebra, apple, charley, kill.

war room of c.d.c (23:00)
a wan drew reynolds enters this large, frenetic room
crowded with doctors and staff man the phone banks and
fax machines that take up an entire wall. along another
wall is a huge electronic map of the u.s. a red circle
blinks on boston. reynolds knows that if motaba virus
rips through america, he's scapegoat number one. he
makes his way to --
robby at the large desk in the middle of the room.
                        robby
                 (into phone)
          great! now get the list of all
          his friends in san jose. i want
          to know every contact the last
          last five days.
she hangs up, turns to lisa aronson, on the phone at the
next desk.
                        robby
          paitent zero didn't take a
          commercial plane to portland.
          presumably he went by car. fax
          every emergency room in the
          portland area a description of the
          disease. then hit every hospital
          along every freeway from san jose
          to portland.
                        lisa aronson
          right.
                                            (continued)

continued:
drew reyonlds sits down at robby's desk.   suddenly he
looks much older.
                        drew reynolds
          we don't even have confirmation.
          this could all be for noth --
                        robby
          -- worst first. my father never
          made the same mistake twice.
reynolds is humbled.
