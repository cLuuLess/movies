ext. isolated stretch of oregon coast (10:00)
warrant officer deterich, dressed in underwear, huddles
against a huge rock. a pile of rations lie beside him.
                        gillespie
          there's food and water for two
          days. they'll find you by then.
gillespie slips on deterich's uniform, salt pulls on
gillespie's.
                        gillespie
          you never expected to make colonel
          this fast, did you, salt?
                                             cut to:

                                                           106.
int/ext. black hawk
hovering above deterich. salt opens the throttle; the
chopper roars down the coast and deterich becomes nothing
but a dot in a cove shut off by soaring cliffs on one
side and the ocean on the other.
salt keeps the chopper just feet above the whitecaps.
                        gillespie
          not bad for somebody who hasn't
          flown in six years.
                          salt
          seven.    want to see my loop-d-
          loop?

he pulls the wheel, brining the nose up to a high angle
of attack.
gillespie looks panicked.    salt levels out the chopper.
                        salt
          just kidding, sir.
gillespie studies the air map of the pacific ocean.
                         gillespie
          cut inland at klamath river and
          keep this mountain ridge between
          us and oregon.
                        salt
          to san jose, sir?
                         gillespie
          no.   ford will anticipate that.

                        salt
          lisa aronson sent us all the
          shipping records...
                           gillespie
          no, not all...     just the ones
          biotest had.

computer keys pound.
superimpose:    klamath falls, oregon -- 10:10

two f-15 eagles
scream down the runway and lift off.     within seconds,
more follow.

                                                           107.
