int. motaba hospital ward - simultaneously
ford walks through the motaba ward, now overflowing with
infected patients, some of them unconscious and some of
them moaning. their loved ones have not been allowed into
this infected ward, so most of these people are alone and
scared.
in ford's eyes we see pain.

          if you're feeling sick in any way,
          you should hang a pillowcase or
          other piece of cloth on your
          front door. soldiers will take
          you somewhere safe for a test.
          you'll know the result within a
          few hours. if you're positive,
          you'll go into one of our isolation
          hospitals, so bring clothes and
          personal things you might need.
