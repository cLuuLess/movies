int. surgery locker room
robby, alone, peels back her triple-thick glove, and...

the second layer is cut, too!   she rips off the second
layer and...
the third layer is cut, too!    she pulls it off to reveal:
her finger -- we see just the tiniest thin line of
crimson blood.
terrified, she runs into...

surgical scrub room
and squeezes her finger, trying to expel any virus. she
pours iodine into the tiny wound and frantically scrubs,
as if her life depened on it. it does.
she turns at the sound of the door opening.    it's
gillespie.

                        gillespie
                 (anguished)
          you took the hit for me... why?
tears fill her eyes. her mouth opens.     she can't talk.
only a low moan of terror.
gillespie cradles her head against his.
                                              cut to:

prop plane (07:45)
spraying over the forest outside bonneville.
huge wafts of smoke drift over the birch and pine forest
like a thick fog.
                                              (continued)

                                                          98.
continued:
hidden in the dense woods, tommy hull takes a slug of
whisky and watches the plane. between him and the plane
are armed personnel carriers, their gas-masked personnel
unaffected by the poison. tommy coughs.
he stands up on the hood of an old blue van and screams
at the troops.
                          tommy
          that's right.    kill us all.   c'mon!
they can't hear him or see him.   he finishes the last of
the bottle and climbs into...


his beat-up van
we see on the floor a half dozen guns including a shotgun
and an ak-47. he starts the engine and roars off.
                                                cut to:

perimeter checkpoint (08:00)
                        checkpoint guard #1
          i'm sorry, colonel. you can't
          proceed.
gillespie's jeep is blocked by three guards armed with
m-16s.
                        gillespie
          get the hell out of my way.     i'm
          going to see the general.

                        checkpoint guard #1
          strict orders, sir. anyone with
          direct patient care is
          contaminated.
                        gillespie
          that's a load of crap. get him on
          the line, soldier. now!
                         checkpoint guard #1
                 (punches on the
                  radio)
          checkpoint three to base. colonel
          gillespie to speak to general ford.
suddenly, tommy hull drives up and brakes to a stop.
                                                (continued)

                                                         99.
continued:
                         checkpoint guard #2
          go home.
                         tommy
          you go home.
before guard #2 can react, hull raises his shotgun and
fires.
gillespie dives under the dashboard of his jeep.
the other guards react. too late. tommy hull pulls an
ak-47 out from behind his seat and chews them up.
the radio blasts:

                        radio (v.o.)
          base to checkpoint three: what's
          goin' on?
tommy hull fires the shotgun again, annihilating the
radio. he roars ahead.
gillespie races over to soldiers.    they're dead.   he looks
at...
the van, racing toward the crest of the hill.     suddenly,
from the other side of the hill:
two apache helicopters appear.
hull sticks the ak-47 out the window and fires at the
choppers.
they keep coming.

red sparks erupt from their bellies.    hellfires.
the van explodes into tiny pieces.
gillespie guns the jeep toward the wreckage.
a jeep driven by general ford comes over the hill and
pulls up on...

opposite side of wreckage
ford and gillespie both survey the charred remains of the
van. both are appalled.
                                               (continued)

                                                         100.
continued:
                         gillespie
           you had the antiserum to the
           original african strain, you
           could've made it available right
           away. the virus would've never had
           a chance to mutate. you could
           have stopped this whole epidemic
           before it got started. why?
ford says nothing. he stares at the wreckage as if some-
how he could find an answer there he himself believes.
                         gillespie
           why?

silence.   finally:
                         ford
           it's so strange... you look at
           these viruses under the electron
           microscope... they're like... like
           beautiful symmetrical crystals, so
           cold, so pure. you think you're
           looking at some fabulous piece of
           sculpture behind a museum wall...
           till you see the blood and people
           dying all around you. i stopped
           it once. i thought i could stop
           it again.
                         gillespie
           you ordered the attack on iwabi's
           people in africa?
silence. ford neither confirms nor denies the accusation.
then with sadness and remorse, ford tells the truth:

                         ford
           we had to ensure that we had the
           only live samples of the virus.
                         gillespie
           biowarfare research is illegal.
           we signed a treaty...
                         ford
           ... what do you know about the
           real world, gillespie? even the
           air you breathe is artificial. why
           do you think saddam hussein didn't
           kill our boys with his anthrax and
           his botulism and all the other crap
           he created in his labs? 'cause he
           knew we had something worse --
                                               (continued)

                                                        101.
continued:
                        gillespie
          -- one mad man --
                        ford
          -- every fucking dictator of the
          future's going to use biological
          weapons that you can manufacture
          cheap in a test tube with
          technology you can buy at the
          newsrack. deterrence works.
gillespie, horrified, steps away from his boss as he
begins to understand the scope of the deception which he
has been the victim of.

                        ford
          we spent years synthesizing an
          antibody that worked with the
          original african strain. we
          assumed it would work with this
          bonneville strain. we gambled.
          we lost. we can't afford to lose
          again...
                        gillespie
          so you're going to wipe out this
          entire town -- kill everyone in
          it?
                        ford
          the virus is going to reach the
          river.
                        gillespie
          take the people who are well and
          get them out!

                        ford
          if even one were sick, no matter
          where we were, the disease would
          start again.
beat, gillespie knows he's right.
                        gillespie
          your only hope is to look for the
          host.
                        ford
          i did -- for thirty years.
                        gillespie
          let me.
                                              (continued)

                                                      102.
continued:
                        ford
          you might be contaminated.
                        gillespie
          i know i'm not.
                        ford
          we have facilites to hold a few
          people in quarantine. get out
          now. take your team.
                        gillespie
          izzy is sick, robby infected.
beat.
                        ford
          i'm sorry.
beat.
                        gillespie
          wipe out the town, wipe out motaba.
          and you're still the only one in
          the world who's got the virus. no
          matter what, your program's
          secure.
                        ford
          that's not a consideration.
                        gillespie
          bullshit!

salt looks outside, worried:

                                                        103.

a black hawk helicopter takes off. soldiers gather
around a second black hawk and start to load their gear.
the biowar defense unit is pulling out of the town.

back to scene
hold on salt's face:    scared.
robby has as yet no sign of the fever.     she and gillespie
pour over the fax from lisa aronson.
                        wally
          colonel, we gotta go now.

beat. mike and robby exchange a glance, knowing this may
be the last time they're together.
                          robby
          no goodbyes.    it's bad luck.

another angle - on gillespie
desperately torn, not wanting to leave her.
                        robby
          i'm glad you were here.
