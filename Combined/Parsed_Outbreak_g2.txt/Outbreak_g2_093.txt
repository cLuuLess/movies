int. pre-school office (17:45)
other staff idly watching the news.   mrs. jeffries enters
and grabs a cup of coffee.

on tv, we see the face of mike gillespie, and we hear
the tail end of his plea:
                        gillespie (v.o.)
                 (on t.v.)
          if you have any information about
          this monkey, please call...
hold on mrs. jeffries' face.
                                              smash cut to:

black hawk (pouring rain) (18:50)
flying low over the redwoods of northern california.
                                              (continued)

                                                         120.
continued:
gillespie clicks off the phone.   salt is dumbfounded:
                        salt
          i'm gonna fly into the heaviest
          radar surveillance on earth on
          account of something that might
          have been seen by a toddler?
                        gillespie
          we know that jimbo scott took an
          animal up to bonneville to sell.
          this place, molalla, would be
          right on the way to the airport.
gillespie studies the map.

                        gillespie
          to get back up there we're gonna
          haveta fly through everything the
          air force has got. are you
          feelin' lucky, captain?
                        salt
          luck ain't gonna be enough.
salt pushes the wheel down, until the black hawk is just
a few feet above the tall redwood trees. he veers to
avoid --
a particularly tall redwood -- and misses it by inches,
whacking off a few of its upper branches with the rotor
blades.
                        salt
          'course -- a little luck won't
          hurt us any.

he and gillespie exchange a tense, worried glance.      that
was close.
as the chopper skims low over the redwoods --
                                              cut to:

awacs plane (at 10,000 feet)
cruising high above the clouds which now blanket the
terrain below.
