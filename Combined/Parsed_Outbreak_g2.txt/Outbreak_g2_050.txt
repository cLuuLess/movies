int. ford's office
a fuzzy, bright fluorescent glow fills the screen. as
the image comes into focus, we see the ugly, large red
circles of motaba.

another angle
a shaken bill ford pulls back from his scope.   he tries
to project an air of calm:
                        ford
          p.c.r. tests are tricky. it's
          easy to make a mistake --
                        gillespie
          -- yeah, i followed your orders
          instead of my gut.
he grabs the phone and punches in a long distance number.
                        gillespie
          i should've blasted our african
          findings across every newspaper
          in the country.

intercut c.d.c. war room - robby
one person after another sees her on the phone and real-
izes what this is about. within seconds the room is si-
lent. drew reynolds squeezes his tennis ball. robby's
shoulders sag with dismay.
                        robby
                 (into phone)
          you're sure?
reynolds drops the ball. around the room: shock; even
though they all anticipated the positive result, nobody
can quite believe it.
                        gillespie
                 (into phone)
          you need my help, robby.
robby, flustered, doesn't answer.
                        gillespie
          i know this virus, you don't.
          i've worked this virus, you
          haven't. how many people are
          infected?
                                            (continued)

                                                         63.

she's afraid to tell him.
                            gillespie
           how many?
                         robby
           we don't know. we've only got a
           whole emergency room full of
           people in bonneville, oregon, and
           we don't know what they've got.
                         gillespie
                  (dismayed)
           how could that many people get
           infected so fast?

                         robby
           we're not sure.
                         gillespie
           robby, don't get anywhere near
           this thing.
robby doesn't answer.
                         gillespie
           you've been in an office for years.
           you've forgotten what these things
           are like.
                         robby
           i worked with the a.i.d.s. virus.
                         gillespie
           that's level two, nothing! this
           is level four. stay the fuck
           away, robby.
on robby
she is scared.

back to scene
                            gillespie
           please, robby.     stay away.
                         robby
           i need to be able to test a lot of
           people and quickly. i need the
           primer --
                                               (continued)

                                                       64.
continued:
                        gillespie
          why has it always been so hard for
          you to admit that you need
          anything from me?
                        robby
          i don't have time to fight with
          you. i'll have a courier pick up
          the primer at 01:00.
she hangs up without giving him a chance to respond.
                        gillespie
          robby!

hands trembling, he hangs up the phone.   ford says
nothing, but in his eyes -- pity.
                        gillespie
          request permission to bring my
          team to bonneville, oregon, sir.
                        ford
          request denied. civilian infections
          are not within our mandate --
                        gillespie
          -- a presidential order can override --
                        ford
          let the c.d.c. do its job. if they
          need help, they know we're here.
                        gillespie
          the goddamn fuse is lit! what're
          you gonna do? wait for the bomb
          to go off?
                        ford
          we don't live in the african bush.
          we don't crap in our streets, we don't
          drink dirty well water filled with
          spit. the disease will be stopped.
                        gillespie
          yeah? today, maybe they've got a
          handful... by tomorrow they could
          have a hundred, and the day after
          that, a thousand. when the
          president and congress ask why you
          didn't bring in one group, the
          only group in the entire world
          with experience in fighting this
          disease, what're you gonna say?
                                             (continued)

                                                          65.
continued:
                          ford
            you don't obey orders, gillespie.
            you're the last person i'd send.
                          gillespie
            i'm sending a letter to the surgeon
            general right now. i'm going to
            create a paper trail. you will fry.
gillespie storms out.    ford remains unruffled.
