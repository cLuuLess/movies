int. chopper
gillespie stows betsy in the back.      salt sees the
glistening lights of the apaches.
                           gillespie
            up!   fast!
salt yanks the wheel back.    the black hawk starts
climbing.
the apaches quickly surround it.       intercut:

                                                     125.
command center - lead apache
on a radar screen, ford can see gillespie's chopper and the
apaches. he and gillespie and mcclintock converse through
their radios:
                        ford
          give me the monkey, mike.
the black hawk climbs higher and higher, through the thick
layer of clouds, now absolutely black in the darkness of
the night.
                        gillespie
          if the antibodies work, we'd have
          a way to stop the epidemic by
          medical means --

                         ford
          -- we have no way to produce them
          in quantity --
                        gillespie
          -- dr. iwabi --
                        ford
          there's no time for that now.
in the lead apache, snipers lean out the window.   their
telescopic sights lock on gillespie and salt.
                        mcclintock
          give me an order to fire, sir.   we
          don't need the monkey.
                        gillespie
          you do. because if you fail to
          contain the virus, you're going
          to be racing to synthesize an
          antiserum. how long did it take
          you to do the last one? a year?
          two years? five?
ford's torn.
                        gillespie
          if the monkey's antibody is
          effective, you could use it as
          a template. maybe you could
          save europe.
ford hesitates.
                           mcclintock
          sir, let me --
the black hawk blasts through the cloud cover and emerges:

                                                        126.
above clouds - night
a full moon illuminates the black hawk.
the apaches burst through the clouds, too.
