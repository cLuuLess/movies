ext. mountain forest - night
betsy's eyes glow in the moonlight. she looks hungry
and sad. she hears the shriek of a hawk and freezes.
these are foreign sounds. she moves stealthily
across the forest floor.
                                              cut to:

mountain forest - later that night
a patch of wild blackberries grow in a thicket.     betsy
begins eating them ravenously. then she hears
something and turns to see --
a coyote poised to leap.     betsy races up a pine tree.

her pov
the coyote barks below. he's joined by his mate.        the
coyotes settle in for a long, hungry wait.
betsy is terrified.
                                              cut to:

                                                        48.
mountain forest - following morning
betsy, still high up in the pine tree, looks down on --
the coyotes, still waiting. one of them pricks up his
ears and growls. suddenly a shot rings out, and the
coyotes bolt.
in the distance a hunter takes aim and fires again.
betsy cowers behind the tree, hiding herself from this
new danger.
the hunter runs under betsy's tree, rifle in hand,
cursing to himself, hell bent on killing the coyotes.

close on betsy in tree

she waits as two more shots ring out in the distance,
then slowly climbs down.
