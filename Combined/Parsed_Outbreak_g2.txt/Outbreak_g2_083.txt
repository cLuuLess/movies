int. record room
a shaggy, sloppily dressed computer jock types.
                          computer jock
            biotest is very methodical about
            their paper work.
the printer spits out pages of animals. gillespie cross-
checks them against the fax pages from lisa. they match
perfectly.
                           computer jock
            that's it.   sorry.
gillespie leans back:    in despair.   not sure what to do
next.

a long beat.    the computer jock walks over to the printer.
                           computer jock
            damn!   jammed again!
he hits a reset button.     one more page prints out.
at the top of the page: an entry that lisa's list doesn't
have. gillespie circles it in red.
                          gillespie
            that's it. the apeldoorn, a dutch
            freighter. one monkey. but what
            kind of monkey?
                          computer jock
            there's no way to tell.

climbing into the black hawk.     the rain is much heavier
