int. sherry's tent
sherry templeton tries to come to terms with the fact
she's positive.

                        sherry
          does this mean my children have
          it, too?
                         gillespie
                  (shaken by her pain)
          no...
but she sees he's not sure.
                         sherry
          oh my god.

bl-4 lab - izzy and robby
working.   izzy looking under the scope.   everything is
purple.
                         izzy
           how can this be? doctor mascelli
           can't be negative. i know he's
           got it. something's wrong.

bl-4 lab - little later
izzy concentrates on mascelli's blood test.    his eyes
are bloodshot from fatigue.


extreme closeup - air hose coupling
at izzy's side. the red umbilical cord connected to the
ceiling catches on the sink handle in the center island;
it slowly slips out of its coupling and drops. the sound
of rushing air suddenly stops.

back to scene
... but izzy doesn't hear it. he continues looking
through the scope. suddenly, he spots the red umbilical
cord lying on the floor.
                           izzy
           no!
robby grabs the cord and re-inserts it into izzy's suit;
the rush of air quickly fills the suit, but --

izzy - panicked - runs out of the lab into:

formaldehyde shower area
and blasts himself with formaldehyde.   as the frothy
liquid bath pours over him:

close on izzy's face
terrified:   did he breath in the virus?

locker room - minutes later
                         robby
           it was only a few seconds, nothing
           got in.
                          izzy
           i know.   i'm fine.
silence.
                         robby
           i can finish the tests --

           -- i'm fine.

she nods, worried.

hospital ward - night
ford checks henry's (the lab tech's) pulse. nothing. he
looks at mcclintock, staring at henry's corpse into which
the antiserum is still flowing. in the next bed, corinne,
henry's girl friend, also lies dead.
                         mcclintock
           the motaba antiserum doesn't work.
                         ford
                  (devastated)
           the virus has changed enough so
           that the antibodies can't recognize
           it. we've got to find the host,
           donny.

                         mcclintock
           how? the san jose animals were
           all negative.
                  (sharply)
           for thirty years you've thought it
           was a breath away. and we looked,
           and tested and tested. and we
           couldn't find it.
                  (beat)
           what good would it do anyway? the
           virus has mutated. the host would
           carry the antibodies against the
           african strain -- before it
           mutated.

continued:
                        ford
          nature is more generous than man,
          donny... it creates more
          variablity in the antibodies. if
          we find the host, its antibodies
          may be effective against the
          mutated strain.
                        mcclintock
          that's a guess. and there's no
          time, no cure. we have no choice
          but to implement the emergency
          containment plan.

bl-4 lab - later that night
gillespie, robby, lisa, and izzy peer...
into the brown rhesus's cage. the monkey looks dreadful:
he's crouched in a fetal position and his nose drips puss.
                        salt
          he's dying of motaba. his blood
          doesn't have any protective
          antibodies. nothing.
gloom and defeat sink over the room.
                        robby
          but where did this monkey get the
          disease?

                        lisa aronson
          christ, it could have been
          anywhere... maybe he was on a boat
          from africa, next to the host.
                        izzy
          then there's no hope.
                        gillespie
          no. unless jimbo scott had close
          contact with the host and that
          animal is somehow traceable.
          there's got to be something at
          bio-test.

                        robby
          lisa, go back there. there's got
          to be something that was missed.
lisa nods.

bl-4 lab - later
salt looks plaintively at the rhesus. he opens the
refrigerator and takes out a bottle labeled morphine.
he's about to close the fridge, but stops and stares...

inside the refrigerator: a unit of antiserum just lying
around. he looks at the antiserum, then at the monkey,
sick in its cage.

quarantine perimeter - dawn
the line of troops and tanks stretches for miles.      hueys
thunder overhead, keeping watch.
behind the tanks are a swarm of figures wearing red bl-4
suits. they're moving cages filled with insects and
animals toward a huge series of trailers.
