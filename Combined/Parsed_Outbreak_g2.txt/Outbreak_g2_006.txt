int. billy ford's office (fort detrick, maryland)
gillespie's boss, general billy ford, md, is a heavy-set
man in his early 60's with thinning hair, piercing, in-
telligent grey eyes and a warm smile. scattered all
around his office are cages filled with frogs and rep-
tiles. as he talks on the phone, he's feeding a green-
horned toad some dead flies.
