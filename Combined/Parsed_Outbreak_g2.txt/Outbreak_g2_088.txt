                        dr. frankle
          the storm's blowin' up the coast
          faster than we thought. that's a
          problem. the wind's going to
          hasten vector transmission and
          the rain's going to absorb the
          gas.

                                             (continued)

          jesus christ, colonel, you'd have
          to hit the town two, three times
          to be sure you got everybody.
the thought of this troubles ford deeply.
                        ford
          what time's that storm going to
          hit?
frankle wavers.
                        ford
          goddammnit, you got every computer
          in the world here, what time's it
          comin'?
                        dr. frankle
          any time before dawn you should be
          okay.
                        ford
          then we go at midnight.
