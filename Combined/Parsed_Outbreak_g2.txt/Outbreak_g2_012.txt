int. chopper
gillespie, salt,   berman and ford stand by the door,
ready to get out   as soon as the chopper puts down.
gillespie has to   shout at salt over the sound of the
whirling chopper   blades:
                         gillespie
           captain salt, if you fail to
           observe strict decontamination
           protocol, three things can happen.
           first, you can be court-martialed.
           second, you can die from this
           horrible disease. third, and
           worst of all, you can incur my
           displeasure. you got it?
                          salt
           yes, sir.
                         gillespie
           if one of us gets sick, we all get
           sick.
                  (turns to ford)
           and i didn't come here to die.

burning huts - wide angle shot
juxtaposed against the u.s. army choppers disgorging
the u.s. army infectious disease team -- blue space-
suited figures with the u.s. flag emblazoned on their
arms and helmets.
the ju-ju man remains high on the cliff above the
village, chanting and wailing, burning an offering to
the gods.
the u.s. army team approaches the village through the
smoky haze, and we see --
two different worlds juxtaposed -- men in spacesuits
and a man in a loincloth.
gillespie, followed by berman, salt and ford,    moves
across the village which now looks devastated    and
deserted except for a few remaining huts and    a small
cinder block building with an old volkswagen    van,
marked with a red cross, parked out front.
                                             (continued)

                                                         22.
continued:
ford walks slower taking everything in, appalled at
what he sees.
the u.s. army team enters the cinder block hut.
