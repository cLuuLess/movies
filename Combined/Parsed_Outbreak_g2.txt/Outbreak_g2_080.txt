ext. above oregon coastal forest
mcclintock's apache sweeps above the forest. the radar
screen indicates a return. mcclintock picks up the radio:
                        mcclintock
          portland regional, please
          identify transponder 2caw442.
          over.
                        traffic controller (v.o.)
          that's another light plane, number
          86221 zebra, registered
          corvallis...
mcclintock grimaces.

                        mcclintock
          where the hell's that a.w.a.c.s.?
                        pilot
          sir, they're comin' from oklahoma.
the radio crackles:
                        f-15 pilot (v.o.)
          got a low target sitting on the
          coast. going down for visual.
intercut with:

inside black hawk helicopter
where salt sees a blip on the radar screen.
                          salt
          problems.

he pushes the wheel down, and     the camouflaged-painted
chopper descends into a tight     ravine between two rocks.
the blades whirl inches from     disaster. gillespie holds
his breath; so does salt who     tries to hold the black hawk
motionless. we hear a sonic      boom. the f-15 streaks
overhead.
gillespie and salt exchange a glance.     have they been
seen or not?
                          f-15 pilot (v.o.)
          i've lost it.    possible bird
          flock.
the plane turns inland.    gillespie and salt breathe
again.

                                                        108.
