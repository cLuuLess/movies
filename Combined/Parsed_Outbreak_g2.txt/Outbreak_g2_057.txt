int./ext. pickup - night
tommy hull, 28, a construction worker, sings along. the
windows of his pickup are wide open and the wind blows his
long hair straight back. there's an empty gun rack in the
back. he rounds a turn and brakes to a screeching halt.
the glare of flashing red and blue lights crosses his
face.
                           tommy
          what the hell?

tommy's pov - three highway patrolmen
wearing gas masks and  toting shotguns in their latex-
gloved hands, stand in  front of their patrol cars whose
emergency lights flash  off and on, creating an eerie
glow. down the road,   is a second checkpoint where the
patrol cars are facing  the other way.

back to scene
tommy hull climbs out.     the highway patrolman raises his
shotgun and aims it.

                                                       72.

          what's goin' on?
                        highway patrolman #1
          stay inside your car.
tommy hull freezes.
                        highway patrolman #1
          turn around, go home, and stay
          there.
                        tommy
          what's goin' on? why are you
          wearin' all that stuff?

                        highway patrolman #2
          go home and you'll be all right.
          move it.
tommy hull ain't gonna argue with three loads of buckshot.
he starts his truck, then stops and gapes, as rapidly ap-
proaching from the opposite way towards town is...

convoy of three state police cars
they zoom by him. in the back seat of the lead car, we
see robby and lisa aronson.
