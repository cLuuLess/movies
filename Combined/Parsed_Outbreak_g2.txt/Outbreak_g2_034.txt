int. rudy's pet shop (bonneville, oregon) - day
computer keys pound:   "bonneville, oregon... friday,
august 31."
jimbo slides a cage containing betsy into a space beside
a cage containing a male brown rhesus monkey. he grabs
the bars of his cage and hisses. betsy cowers.
rudy alvarez, the owner of the shop, slips on a pair of
gloves and opens the cage, reaches in for betsy. she
tries to avoid his grasp.
                        rudy
          you got the papers and all?
                                            (continued)

                                                        44.
continued:
                        jimbo
          yeah, sure... i got the papers.
          she's legal.
                        rudy
          whaddya mean 'she'?
betsy takes advantage of the opening and bolts out of the
cage, heading for the window. as rudy and jimbo both
chase after her, rudy is steaming.
                        rudy
          i told you a male.
                        jimbo
          you said 'she'.
                        rudy
          bullshit! i said 'he'. the
          customer's already got a female
          colobos. he wants to breed 'em.
betsy slams against the glass.    rudy grabs her.
                        rudy
          c'mon, baby... c'mon.
she lashes out at his naked forearm, digging her nails
into him, drawing blood. he yelps and lets go, and she
runs away to the other side of the room, passing the
brown rhesus, who eyes a half-eaten banana in betsy's
cage. he grabs it and scarfs it down.
jimbo finally grabs betsy from behind. rudy grabs her
from the front and they thrust her back into her cage.
rudy wipes the blood off his arm.

                        rudy
          get this bitch outa here.
                        jimbo
          what about my money?
                        rudy
          go back and get me a male colobos.
                        jimbo
          we ain't got one. this was the
          only colobos we had... look, i'll
          sell her cheap.
                        rudy
          i wouldn't take her for free.
                        (more)
                                              (continued)

                                                           45.
continued:
                        rudy (cont'd)
                 (indicating the
                  brown rhesus)
          i can't even sell this one.
                        jimbo
                 (depressed)
          hey, i need some money now, man.
rudy hesitates.
                        jimbo
          i done you a lot of favors.
rudy pulls out a billfold.

                        rudy
          all right... fifty bucks for
          your expenses. a lot more when
          you bring me a male.
                        jimbo
          what am i going to do with her?
rudy shrugs.
                                                 cut to:

small road deep in forest - later that day
jimbo opens the cage which is sitting on the side of the
road by the nissan, but betsy shrinks back in a corner
of the cage. jimbo feels sorry for her.
                        jimbo
          look at all the trees.     it's like
          home.
jimbo jabs her lightly with a drumstick. she runs out of
the cage but stops at the edge of the road, afraid of the
forest she doesn't know.
                        jimbo
                 (flicking pebbles
                  at her)
          c'mon, get. get!
she scampers off into the forest.    jimbo follows her
with his eyes, a little saddened.
                                                 cut to:

                                                        46.
