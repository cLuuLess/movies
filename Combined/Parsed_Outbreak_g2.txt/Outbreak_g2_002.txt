the mercenary tries to lift himself out of his stretcher.
can't. he's too weak. his skin is yellow and covered
with blisters that look like chicken pox.

           he's still over a hundred and
           six. why can't we bring it down?
the black african army physician, dr. raswani, looks on,
helpless. suddenly, the australian emits a sharp cry.
his eyes roll back, and he begins convulsing. before
raswani can even reach into his bag for medecine, the
mercenary is dead.
raswani and his nurse stare with horror.
the drone of a chopper grows louder as a bell z180 ap-
pears over the edge of the forest and kicks up a storm of
dust as it lands. raswani and the nurse run to meet it.

two space-suited figures emerge from the chopper, their
faces hidden by thick green plexiglass shields. the u.s.
flag is emblazoned on the side of their helmets, which
also display their ranks. the much taller man is a
lieutenant whom we'll know as mcclintock. through his
visor, we can just make out his pock-marked, angular
face. the shorter, pear-shaped man is a captain. we
can't see his features, only the reflection of horn-
rimmed glasses.
                          raswani
            have you brought the medicines?
                          captain

            them?

            killing our men faster than enemy
            bullets.
the captain stops at a young american mercenary's cot.
he's shaking with fever. his skin is mottled and looks
like the pulp of an orange. his voice is a whisper:
                          american mercenary
            take me home, captain... get me
            outta this shithole. please, i
            wanna see my girl.
the american mercenary reaches out with his arms to the
captain, who shrinks back, not wanting to be
contaminated.
                          captain
            we'll get you home, soldier.
            first, i need a tissue sample.
he pulls from his black bag a long metal syringe and
plunges the biopsy needle deep into the man's liver. he
places the needle in an aluminum test tube and seals it.
