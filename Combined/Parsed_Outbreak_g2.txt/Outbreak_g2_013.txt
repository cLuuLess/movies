int. cinder block hut
a short, slender, bespectacled black man in his late
forties -- dr. iwabi -- head of the zaire infectious
disease heath agency -- and his nurse, protected only
by a smock, a surgical mask, and gloves, gives comfort
to a young woman who's dying.
                           gillespie
          doctor iwabi?     i brought blood,
          plasma --
                        dr. iwabi
          -- you're too late.
                        gillespie
          i came as soon as i could.
                        dr. iwabi
          it wouldn't have mattered when you
          came. this  one is different --
          worse than lassa, worse even than
          ebola. it  strikes and kills so
          fast. the  young, the healthy,
          everybody.
                        gillespie
          who was the index case?
                        dr. iwabi
          a road construction worker.
                        izzy
          how did he get it?
                           dr. iwabi
          we don't know.     he died three days
          ago.
salt moves ahead to the next bed and pulls aside the
thin mosquito curtain to inspect the patient. ford
is right behind him.
                           salt
          god...
                                               (continued)

                                                       23.
continued:
the corpse's eyes are yellow and his flesh, speckled
with hemmorrhages, looks like pulp. blood oozes from
his nose and his nipples. ford turns away in horror.
                        salt
                 (retches)
          i'm gonna be sick.
he starts to rip off his mask.   gillespie grabs his
arms.
                        gillespie
          keep you helmet on, goddamit!
                        salt
          i can't breath.
salt vomits in his helmet. rips it off.    he rushes
out. izzy moves after him.
                        gillespie
          put him in quarantine. now!
                        dr. iwabi
          you don't need to.
                        gillespie
          why?
                        dr. iwabi
          it's not spread in the air.
                        gillespie
          how do you know?
                        dr. iwabi
                 (pulls down his mask)
          there's no cough. or we'd all be
          dead. for days we've been working
          with only these masks. they can't
          keep out a particle as small as a
          virus.
                        gillespie
          could any infected person have
          gotten out of this village and
          spread it?
                        dr. iwabi
          the incubation period is only one
          or two days. the mortality is one
          hundred percent.
                        (more)
                                            (continued)

                                                        24.
continued:
                        dr. iwabi (cont'd)
          if anyone got out, they are dead,
          or will be soon. and if they have
          spread the disease, we will know
          rather quickly.
                        gillespie
          finding the host is the only way
          to control the spread. our only
          hope is that this is like most
          viruses and that it has to live in
          a host, an animal, to which it's
          adapted over thousands of years.
          and that animal host has developed
          antibodies to protect itself
          against the virus. if we can
          identify that animal host, and
          harvest its antibodies, we can use
          them to fight the disease in
          humans.
                        dr. iwabi
          there are a hundred thousand
          species of animals and insects in
          this rain forest. the
          construction worker could have
          been in contact with any one of
          them. where do i start?
                        gillepsie
          general, tell him that our
          government will help with money,
          personnel supplies, whatever it
          takes.
ford hesitates.

                        ford
          of course, we'll do whatever we
          can.
                                              cut to:
