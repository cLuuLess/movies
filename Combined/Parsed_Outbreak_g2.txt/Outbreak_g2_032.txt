int. bl-4 lab - m.i.d.u.
gillespie, berman, and salt, dressed in their biosafety
suits, peer at the video monitor hooked up to the electron
microscope. salt flicks a switch on the console to
change the magnification. the fuzzy brick-like structures
are computer enhanced and enlarged to razor-sharp crystal-
line structures that look like huge ominous steel balls
climbing up the sides of thick pillars.

          there's our guy, mr. motaba.

          ugly bastard, isn't he?
                        salt
          i wouldn't let him date my sister.

extreme closeup - microscope field
as the image comes into focus we see a wavy purple out-
line of a cell.
                        salt (o.s.)
          the blood test. normal is this --
          pure purple. but if you're
          infected...
focus changes and another image fills the screen: the
field is filled with wide patches of red circles.
gillespie and berman each peer into the scope.
                        gillespie
          if you're red, you're dead. is
          that what you're telling me?
                        salt
          that's right, colonel. the virus
          doesn't know the cold war is over.

          but the rest is just a quickie; i
          haven't had time to refine it.
          there are false negatives, purples
          that should be red. i don't know
          why yet.

          how long to fix it?
                          salt
          hard to say.
                          gillespie
          how long?
                        izzy
          hey, don't pressure the   kid! it
          took the nih guys eight   months to
          get the kinks outa the   aids test...
          and they didn't have to   put up with
          your nagging.
