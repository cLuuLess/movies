ext. porch
she walks slowly down the small  path, knowing this could
be the last time she ever makes  this walk, ever sees her
family. she stops, wipes a tear   off her cheek. she wants
to look back so bad, to get one  last look at her kids,
but doesn't want them to see her  scared. she climbs into
the waiting army jeep.
sherry waves as the jeep pulls away. but she's sitting
next to a soldier in full chemwar gear, and this only
amplifies the fear in her children's eyes.
the jeep drives past other houses with pillowcases over
the door.
                                            shock cut to:

sherry's arm
her fist clinches as lisa aronson finishes drawing blood.
