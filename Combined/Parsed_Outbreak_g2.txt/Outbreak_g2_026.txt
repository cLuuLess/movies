gillespie, salt and izzy search through the round freezer.
                        izzy
          every sample of motaba gone...
          where the fuck did he put it?
owi looks contrite.
                        owi
          general ford ordered me to move
          all tubes to the sealed vault in a
          wing... only he has access. he
          said you weren't gonna need it
          for months.
gillespie and his men are despondent.
                        gillespie
          those were the only samples in the
          world of motaba, iwabi lost all
          his in the fire.
                 (to owi)
          there's got to be a way to get
          that access code from ford's
          computer.
                        owi
          sir, i don't want any more
          trouble.
                        (more)
                                            (continued)

                                                        38.
continued:
                        owi (cont'd)
          it's bad enough that i already
          made one mistake and forgot to
          transfer one of the tubes of
          motaba. i seemed to have mixed
          it up with a tube of common cold
          virus. if i give you the tube,
          i'm sure you'll fix my mistake,
          sir.
he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a gleaming
aluminium test tube with the words "motaba #48" written
on the side.
                        gillespie
          i love it when you make mistakes,
          owi.
                        owi
          how do you know? i never made
          one before now.
hold on their grins, fade up the sound of furiously
rushing wind and:
