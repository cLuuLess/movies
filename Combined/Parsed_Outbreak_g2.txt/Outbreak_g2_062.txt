int. rudy's pet shop
the brown rhesus sits in the back of his cage, staring at
biosafety suited doctors crowded around his cage. the
other animals screech with hunger.

          i found this note on the desk...
she holds a post-it with the words scribbled across it:
"scott - monkey - 8/31."
                        lisa aronson
          this must be the monkey scott
          brought up from biotest.
                        salt
          and if he is the host, his blood
          will give us a treatment.

          he's so cute it's hard to believe
          he's caused such destruction.

          hitler's girl friend used to say
          the same thing.
ford stands in the back of the room, disinterested, as if
he knows already the brown rhesus is going to lead
nowhere. robby peers into the rhesus's cage.
                        robby
          why is he so quiet?
                        gillespie
          monkeys get quiet when they get
          hungry...

          ... or sick.
