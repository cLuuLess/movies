int. general ford's command center - dawn
the command center is buzzing with activity. along one
wall is an array of supercomputers all feeding data to...

the big board -- a computerized map of the quarantine
area.
dr. frankle, a biowar defense expert, an intense, bearded
man of about 50 -- paces in front of the big board. as
frankle briefs ford and mcclintock, we literally see the
epidemic spreading out from the center of bonneville --
more and more terrain is colored red each time the big
screen redraws. the red gets larger and larger, until it
comes within three miles of the columbia river, which cuts
a big blue swath through the map.

          mosquitoes are picking up this
          virus. an  hour ago a squirrel
          with motaba was trapped just three
          miles from the river.
                                             (continued)

                                                    93.
continued:
                          ford
                  (angry)
           increase the spraying, goddamnit!
                         frankle
           the best stuff we've got won't
           kill every last one. eventually
           one bug, one animal's going to get
           through to the river. worst case
           is the virus penetrates the
           ecosystem. then we can't stop it.
                         ford
           there's got to be a way to deal
           with it --

                         frankle
           -- the only similar case i know of
           is the influenza epidemic of 1918.
           it circled the globe in two weeks.
silence.
                         mcclintock
           people can be asymptomatic, for
           weeks.  the tests are faulty. we
           have to assume everyone in this
           town is infected and will get this
           disease sooner or later.
silence.   finally:
                         ford
           i want the most rapid-acting nerve
           gas. something so quick they'll
           never know what hit 'em.
