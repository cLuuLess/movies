ext. docks (san francisco) - day
betsy stares out from her cage as it swings down from
ship to wharf.

biotest animal holding facility (san jose, california)
we're in a long aisle with monkey cages stacked two high
on both sides. a translucent skylight gives this place
a greenhouse glow.
a forklift putters down the aisle with betsy's cage in
front. betsy's cage is lifted up and placed into a slot.
betsy stands out from all the other monkeys because she
is the only black and white colobos -- the other monkeys
are all brown rhesus.
betsy's cage slides into place.    betsy shrieks at the
man in the forklift.

meet. jimbo's beeper sounds. he checks the message,
then looks puzzled.
