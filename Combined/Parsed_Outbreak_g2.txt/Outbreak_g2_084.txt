          so 'cause of the storm, you want
          me to fly twenty miles through a
          gale and hover while i drop you on
          board a ship at sea?
                         gillespie
          yes.

          tomorrow.
salt is torn.
                        gillespie
          if you want, i could try to hover
          and drop you on board.
                         salt
          no way.

the chopper fighting the gale, trying to find the ship in
the storm. the sky is so dark it's like night. rain
pounds the windshield; the wipers can't keep up.

          colonel, i couldn't find my

the mist, a red light flashes.
                                              cut to:

black hawk
hovering above the apeldoorn, riding rough on twenty-
foot swells. the winds rock the chopper.

on the deck of the apeldoorn: four crewmen hold tight
onto their lifelines and wait for --
gillespie, who emerges from the belly of the chopper.
he hangs tight onto the winch, which strains in the wind,
thrusting gillespie over the waves. one breaks on top
of him.

a crewman grabs the line with a hook and reels gillespie
in.

opening.   gillespie isn't ready for this:
frozen on a shelf, is seaman dieter jans. even under a
layer of ice, the yellow skin, blood streaking from his
nipples, and other signs of motaba are all too clear.
                         gillespie
           how long has it been since the
           monkey was on the ship?
one of the seamen translates gillespie's question to
the captain in dutch. the captain answers in halting
english:
                          dutch captain
           how long?   six days.
                         gillespie
           when did seaman jans first get
           sick?
                         dutch captain
           yesterday -- he is sick yesterday
           night. he is dead early this
           morning.

                        gillespie
          captain, your ship will have to be
          quarantined at sea. no one is to
          go near this freezer. do you
          understand?
the captain nods, overwhelmed by sudden fear.
                        gillespie
          someone else must have seen the
