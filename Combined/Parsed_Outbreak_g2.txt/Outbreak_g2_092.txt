          colonel gillespie's action --
          commandeering this news room at a
          california television station in
          order to get his message out --
          raises troubling questions about
          what is really going on inside the
          quarantine area.

          great, now we've got the whole
          fucking world watching. you
          should've locked him up when we
          got here. people'll be calling
          washington... the president won't
          be able to make up his mind, and
          the whole fucking planet will go.
outside, it's starting to sprinkle.

pre-school classroom (molalla, oregon)
empty except for mrs. jeffries who's cleaning up. a pile
of paintings. one is of an enormous black and white
monkey towering menacingly over a little stick figure.
mrs. jeffries smiles.
