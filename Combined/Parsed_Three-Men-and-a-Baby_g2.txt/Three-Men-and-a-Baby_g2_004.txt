4   int. apartment - few hours later - night                   4
    the guests are leaving. commotion in the hall, people
    are saying goodbye to peter and michael.
    natalie is about to walk out.
                            peter
              natalie, why don't you stay for a
              nightcap?
                            natalie
              no, i've gotta get up early...

                                                             14.


                        carl
                 (to natalie)
          do you care to share a cab?
                         natalie
          oh yes, thanks -- that's really
          nice of you...
                        carl
                 (smiling
                  triumphantly;
                  to peter)
          good night, peter.
                         peter
                 (with a forced
                  smile)
          good night, carl... i'll call
          you sunday, natalie.
she has already left.   the door closes on the last of the
departing guests.
                        michael
          so you struck out again with
          natalie, huh? that carl is a
          real smooth operator.
                        peter
          he's an asshole!
                 (mimicking carl)
          'i heard you're not ready yet.'
          'we're gonna kick your ass.' well,
          we may be behind schedule, but
          we're still going to beat that
          sonofabitch and maybe i haven't
          scored with natalie yet, but
          neither has he. she's not an easy
          lay, that's what i like about her.
          you know what they say: it ain't
          over till it's over.
peter and michael go into the living room. peter is
picking up glasses. michael is emptying ashtrays into
the wastebasket.
                        michael
          well, i didn't do so well either
          -- i blew it with rosalie. i
          don't even know how...
                           peter
          who's rosalie?
                        michael
          that beauty i managed to swipe

                                                                   15.

              from jack. i was about to ask
              her to stay the night when...
                            peter
              your old friend sophia appeared
              and got you involved in a thrilling
              conversation about modern art,
              and meanwhile rosalie...
                            michael
              how could you know that?
                            peter
              michael, all you want to do is
              steal jack's girl friends. you
              don't give a shit about the women
              themselves...
                            michael
              that's not true. it's just that
              sophia drives me crazy. she knows
              all the right buttons to push to
              make me mad.
                            peter
                     (going into the
                      kitchen)
              anyway, it was a great party,
              everyone had a good time...
                             michael
                     (still in the living
                      room, shouting to
                      peter)
              terrific... time.
    he, too, leaves the living room and runs into jack, who
    has his arm around clementine's waist as he heads toward
    his bedroom with her.
