2   int. newark airport - passenger terminal - day              2
    jack is saying an emotional goodbye to jane as she leaves
    with her teammates. jane finds it all very funny, but
    jack looks totally wretched seeing her go.
    jack and paul walk toward the exit.

                            jack
              god, what a woman!
    paul is nervous, glancing uneasily from car to car.
                            jack
              wanna share a cab?
                               paul
              yeah, sure!
    a black ford pulls up in front of them and its driver
    looks at paul who immediately turns his back on him.
                            jack
              she's so beautiful! i've never
              been so in love before. can you
              believe she gave me her phone
              number... oh, christ -- where is
              it?... oh, no, don't tell me i
              lost it... it's a matter of life
              and death... oh here it is --
              thank god!
    all the while    jack has been rambling on, a beige car
    on the other    side of the street has slowed down. paul
    notices it.     in the beige car, a narcotics agent, graton,
    is behind the    wheel with one of his colleagues sitting
    beside him.
                            graton
              they're slowing down.    take a
              picture.
    the colleague snaps a picture of everyone who happens to
    be standing near the black ford, including jack and paul.
    the black ford pulls out. the beige car follows it.
    paul observes all this out of the corner of his eye.
                            paul
              listen, i need a favor, i got

                                                         7.

          a little problem.
                        jack
          yeah, sure... hey, look, will you
          -- look at that sparkling beauty.

a very beautiful woman is coming down the walkway with
cart overflowing with luggage. one of them falls off.
                        paul
          yeah... i mean, it's like...
          there's this little package...
                        jack
          she'll never make it with all
          that luggage she's got. i gotta
          give her a hand. look at the
          colors in her hair! christ, i've
          never seen a woman like her
          before...
he's about to walk off when paul grabs him by the arm.
                        paul
          jack, listen, can i...
                        jack
          sure you can, no problem...
          listen, i gotta go now, i'm
          gonna see if she'll share a cab
          with me.  you take the shuttle,
          okay?
                        paul
          but i gotta explain to you
          about...
                        jack
          come over to my place tonight.
          we're having a huge party. come
          around 9, okay? see ya later.

jack races toward the woman and begins to help her
with the fallen luggage. we see him talking to her
and we can hear a little of what he's saying.
                        jack
          as exquisite as you are...
          i think i'm gonna faint.
he kneels, takes her hand and puts it over his heart.
the young woman is flabbergasted.
a lonely-looking paul hails the shuttle bus.

                                                                  8.
