90   int. apartment living room - evening                        90
     in the devastated living room peter, still disguised as
     a punk, and michael, both very high, are dancing around
     in circles with each other and laughing. they are
     singing a lullaby at the top of their lungs, and har-
     monizing. peter is holding mary close, and michael,
     holding a near-empty bottle of liquor, staggers over to
     him and starts turning around in circles with him.
     mary, snuggled up warmly between peter and michael, is
     laughing her head off.
     in the b.g., in the hall, jack, also still in his punk
     getup, is on the phone. he's got a glass in his hand
     and is a little smashed.
                             jack
               paul, hi, it's jack! hey, listen,
               i brought you back a little present
               from south america. can i see you
               right away so i can give it to you?
               ... yeah, the sooner the better!
               i can't wait to let you have it.
               how about 67th and east river?
