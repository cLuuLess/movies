59   ext. street - day                                           59
     punk #1 is attempting to strap the basket onto the
     motorcycle with a bungie cord. punk #2 watches him
     coolly.
                             punk #2
               we'd be better off taking the
               subway.
                             punk #1
               you want to ride the subway with
               a hundred grand in uncut dope,
               go ahead.
                             punk #2
               well we can't ride around
               carrying this baby basket.    we'll
               get stopped by the cops.
                             punk #1
               so go ahead, take the subway and
               stop bothering me. i'm going to
               hook this onto the back seat.

                                                         52.


                        punk #2
          it'll never hold, man.
                        punk #1
                 (desperately going
                  at the hook and
                  the basket)
          goddamn hook! christ, what a
          stupid idea hiding the shit with
          this kid. it's ridiculous!
peter comes rushing out of the building.
                        peter
                 (huffing and puffing)
          oh, thank god, you're still here!
          there's been a terrible mistake.
          that wasn't the package you
          were s'posed to take. it was
          another one. i have it right
          here.
                        punk #1
          what do you mean? what other
          package?
                        peter
          i'll take the basket back and
          give you the other package, here.
          no mistake.
peter takes the package from his pocket and is about
to grab the basket. punk #1 pushes him back violently.
                        punk #1
          you ain't takin' nothin' back,
          man.
                        peter
          but i'm tellin you it was a
          mistake...
                        punk #1
                 (in a low but very
                  aggressive tone)
          you tryin' to double-cross us or
          something? beat it before i get
          pissed, man.
                        peter
                 (panic-stricken,
                  in an equally
                  low tone)
          but i'm telling you, i've got
          your package right here. there's
          been a mistake...

                                                            53.


                        punk #1
          a mistake my ass! now get outa
          here, man, or i'm gonna stick
          this right in your gut.

he discreetly reveals a switchblade knife he's carrying.
                        punk #1
                 (to punk #2)
          start the bike.
punk #2 is about to get on the motorcycle.   peter stops
him.
                        peter
          but i'm telling you, i've got
          the real package in my pocket.
                        punk #2
                 (to punk #1)
          watch it, the cops!
peter quickly puts back the package in his pocket. a
patrol car comes up next to them, right beside the car
in which graton is sitting, taking in every bit of the
action.
                        graton
                 (to his partner)
          terrific! i bet these morons
          screw up everything.
one of the cops gets out of his car and comes over to the
punks and peter. peter is scared stiff.
                        punk #1
                 (whispering)
          if you called the cops on us,
          pal, you're a dead man.
                        cop #1
          all right, what's that doing on
          the back of the bike?
no one answers.
                        cop #1
          you wouldn't by any chance be
          intending to drive with a baby
          basket on your motorcycle, would
          you?
                        punk #1
          of course not, officer. we'd
          never do something like that.

                                                          54.

                        cop #1
          so why did you strap it on in
          the first place if you had no
          intention of driving with it?
                        punk #2
          so it wouldn't fall off.
                        cop #1
          very funny.
as he speaks, peter undoes the bungie cord from around
the basket and takes it off the motorcycle.
                        peter
          no, really, officer, they weren't
          gonna drive off with it -- they
          were just watching it for me while
          i was doing a quick errand.
                 (to the punks)
          thanks, guys.
punk #1 gives him a dirty look.
                        cop #1
          all right, let's see some
          identification, everybody.
the punks exchange a glance.   suddenly punk #1 shouts:
                        punk #1
          go!
they take off running in different directions. cop #1
charges after punk #1 and yells to his partner who's
still in the car:
                        cop #1
          watch the guy with the basket!
cop #2 leaps out of the car, gun in hand.
peter stiffens with fear.
                        cop #2
          freeze! all right, asshole, let's
          see some i.d.
                        peter
                 (urbanely)
          listen, officer, let's stay calm
          now. i haven't the slightest
          intention of running. i am not
          a criminal. i'm an architect.
                        cop #2
                 (calming down

                                                           55.

                  a little)
          your i.d., let's see it.
                        peter
          i'm terribly sorry, officer, but
          i don't have any identification
          on me. i just came down with my
          baby to run a quick errand. i
          haven't committed any crime.
                        cop #2
          all right, let's go, in the car.
          i'm taking you down to the
          station.
                        peter
          oh, c'mon, that's impossible --
          you see i have a baby. i have
          to give her a bottle in fifteen
          minutes, i can't go anywhere.
          i live right in this building --
          let me go up to my apartment
          and i'll get you my license
          immediately... you can even
          come with me if you like...
                        cop #2
          all right, lead the way.
they disappear inside the building. peter is carrying
the basket in his left hand; his right hand is clenched
on the horrible package hidden in his pocket.
just then cop #1 comes running back, empty-handed.
graton gets out of his car and comes up to cop #1, show-
ing him his badge.
                         graton
                 (angry)
          inspector graton, narcotics. it
          just so happens i was tailing
          those two guys and now because
          of you clowns i lost them,
          probably forever. thanks a lot!
                        cop #1
          how could we know?
                        graton
          forget it. listen, your partner
          went in here with the guy and the
          baby. he lives up on the tenth
          floor. i can't go in because if
          he sees me, my cover is blown. so
          could you please try not to lose
          this one, okay? he's someone who's

                                                                    56.

               gotta be watched very closely.
               i've called for backup and it's on
               its way.
