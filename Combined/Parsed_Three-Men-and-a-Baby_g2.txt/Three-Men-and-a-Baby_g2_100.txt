                              jack
                okay, listen, you guys... i've
                tried everything and nothing's
                working: my mother's off on a
                cruise; mrs. razzolini won't
                speak to us ever since the whole
                business with the cops -- we don't
                want to involve any of our
                girlfriends; sylvia's taking it
                easy in europe and there's no
                way she's gonna come back now
                that michael went and told her
                everything's just fine and dandy.
                peter did a terrific job getting
                rid of mrs. bretsaws, and all
                that's left are the daycare
                centers, but peter's positive
                they're a breeding pit for a.i.d.s.
                so you tell me: what are we
                suppose to do? you want me to
                split with the kid? or dump her
                in an orphanage?
                              peter
                       (pretending to
                        play the violin)

                                     96.

here we go.
               michael
look,  her mother'll be back in
less  than five months. let's not
waste  a shitload of time looking
for a  solution for such a short
time.   let's get organized.
              jack
what do you mean, organized?
              peter
well, you'll have to ask to fly
the new york-washington shuttle
for five months, on account of
serious personal problems.
              jack
what? never! i'd rather be a
subway conductor.
              peter
       (barking)
then dump her in an orphanage,
'cause there's no way we're gonna
take care of her all by ourselves
anymore!
              michael
come on, stop arguing, you two!
jack, you're going to have to
ask to do the new york-washington
shu...
               jack
        (stubborn, yelling)
no!   never.
              michael
       (unruffled)
that way, you can do the 6-10 a.m.
shift. that amounts to two bottles
and two diaper changes. you do
the shopping when you get home in
the evening and that's all. peter,
you'll take the 6-10 p.m. shift.
that's two bottles and two diaper
changes, her bath and her laundry.
since i work at home i'll take
the longest shift from 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. i'll take her to the park
for an hour, but that's it. no
shopping, no cooking, no cleaning.
              peter
what if she gets up at night?

                                                                  97.

                whose shift is that?
                              michael
                well... i thought you might do
                it...

                                 peter
                not a    chance! i'm not doing the
                night    shift. i absolutely refuse.
                i have    too much work to catch up
                on for    the competition.
                              jack
                well, needless to say i refuse,
                too!

                              michael
                listen to me, you selfish bastards!
                my shift is eight hours in a row.
                no way i'm gonna do nights too.
                after 6 p.m. she can scream all
                she wants, i don't give a shit.
                              peter
                you know, jack, you're a real
                slime ball! we give you the
                easiest shift: the morning. she's
                always in great shape in the morning,
                isn't she? we've got to work like
                crazy to save our jobs and you
                have the nerve to refuse nights.
                goddamit, she's your daughter.
                are you that horny?
                              jack
                       (extremely pissed
                        off)
                hey, horny yourself! i don't
                give a shit. i don't need you
                guys. i'll find some other way
                to do it. and i won't take the
                new york-washington shuttle!
      he exits, furious.
