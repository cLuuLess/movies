     peter is talking with a safeway clerk, a woman in her
     50's, who is tall and heavy, somewhat gruff and masculine
     in appearance, and wearing slacks and a smock.
                             peter
               so what's the best brand?

                                    26.

              store clerk
depends on what your pediatrician
recommends.
              peter
oh right, the pediatrician...
but which one sells the most?
              store clerk
       (pointing to a
        can)
this kind.
              peter
oh, so this is the best kind?

              store clerk
it's the cheapest.
              peter
then it's the worst kind?
              store clerk
they're all good, sir.
              peter
       (pointing to another
        can)
oh, okay, then i can take this
kind.
              store clerk
it's got iron in it.
               peter
oh.   is that good or bad?
              store clerk
it's very good.
              peter
well, why don't they all have
iron in them?
              store clerk
some babies are allergic to iron.
              peter
       (pointing to yet
        another can)
oh, okay, well i'll take this
kind then.
              store clerk
that kind doesn't have any milk
in it.

                                                                  27.

                             peter
               oh, i see, there's milk with no
               milk in it?
                             store clerk
               some babies are allergic to milk.

                             peter
               so what's the stuff that no
               babies are allergic to?
                              store clerk
               soy formula.
                             peter
               oh, okay, i'll take the soy formula.

     he takes a can.
                             store clerk
               that one's advance.
                              peter
               oh really?   what's advance?
                             store clerk
               how old's your baby?
                             peter
                      (peter tries to
                       estimate mary's
                       size)
               uh... about this old.
