76   ext. street - day                                             76
     michael is peeking out at the street from the window
     above. peter comes out of the building and turns left,
     walking very quickly.
     suddenly, peter stops, turns     around and retraces his
     steps. we can clearly see a      man, who was walking about
     six yards behind peter on the     opposite side of the
     street, also turn around and     retrace his steps.
     it is graton.
