65   int. michael's room - day                                  65
     mary is lying on michael's bed. he has just finished
     putting a regular diaper on her.
     then michael looks for the tampered-with diaper in the
     box. he finds it, checks that it is well-sealed, and
     places it under mary's bottom.
     just then agent #3 appears in the doorway. michael
     calmly finishes putting the dope-filled diaper on the
     baby on top of the other one. mary is cooing. every-
     thing appears normal. however, a trained eye might be
     very surprised by the enormous thickness of the diaper
     covering the young lady's backside. but a narcotics
     agent is not necessarily the most qualified person to
     notice something odd like this.
     agent #3 silently observes michael, who gives him a big
     smile as he slips on mary's pajama bottoms. michael
     picks mary up and for the first time talks to her in the
     kind of silly babytalk used by adoring parents.

                                                            62.

                        michael
          okey-dokey, honeybunch, it's time
          to go beddy-bye now... we're gonna
          take a nice long nappy-wappy...
he goes back to the living room, followed by agent #3.

agent #1 is in the process of showing peter a photograph.
                        agent #1
          do you recognize anyone in this
          picture?
peter looks: it's the photo of jack and paul that was
taken at the beginning of the movie.

                         peter
                  (pointing)
          sure.   this is jack collins.
                         agent #1
          oh yeah?   now that's interesting.
michael has laid mary down for a nap in her basket,
observed by the five cops. he now sits down, cheerful
and bubbling over with enthusiasm.
                       michael
          so! can i get you something to
          drink?
agent #1 totally ignores him.
                        agent #1
          so, who's the baby belong to?
                        peter
          it's jack's daughter.
                        agent #1
          and why are you two taking care of
          her?
                        peter
          because her mother's in europe
          for six months, and since jack had
          to be away for two weeks, i took
          my vacation to take care of her,
          i love kids.
                        michael
          yeah, peter and i just love kids!
                        agent #1
          now that's interesting. well,
          we'll be seeing each other again
          soon, in fact very soon. in the

                                                           63.

          meantime, i'd appreciate it if you
          didn't leave new york in the next
          few days.
all the cops head for the door. michael accompanies
them, putting on a very urbane act.

                        michael
          come back anytime, gentlemen.
          you're always welcome here. we
          have no particular plans to leave
          new york in the near future, so
          don't worry about us now. 'bye now.
once the cops are gone, michael races back to the living
room. peter has collapsed into his armchair.

                        peter
                 (in a low tone)
          christ, what a mess! they'll be on
          our tails around the clock! how
          the hell are we gonna get rid of
          the goddamn dope?! by the way,
          where is it?
                         michael
                 (also speaking in
                   a low tone)
          it's cool, don't worry, i got it
          stashed.
                        peter
          where?
michael points to mary's bottom.
                        peter
          huh?
                        michael
          this way it's close at hand!
                        peter
          are you out of your mind??
                        michael
          relax, will you.
                        michael (cont'd)
          i diapered the dope on her right
          in front of the cop and he never
          noticed a thing!
                        peter
          i told the cops we were taking
          care of her. you realize we're
          now stuck with the kid till jack

                                                                      64.

               comes back. there ain't nobody
               coming to pick her up, and i have
               to go back to the office today!
                             michael
               wait a minute. you're not gonna
               stick me with this kid! tell
               them you need a maternity leave,
               tell them anything, but we've got
               to go 50-50 on this!
                             peter
               and that's not all -- we haven't
               heard from the punks yet either!
