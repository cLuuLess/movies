81   int. apartment - night                                     81
     jack emerges from the elevator happy as a lark and
     feeling frisky.
                             jack
                      (opening the door)
               yoo-hoo, guys! i'm home! i've
               got presents for you... so where's
               that wonderful fantastic babe...
     he enters and sees the state the apartment is in.
                             jack
               ... what the hell happened here?
     he walks into the apartment, shocked and overwhelmed.
                               jack
               peter!    michael! are you here?
     he goes into the    living room -- no one'sthere. into
     michael's room.     no one's there. he goes into his own
     room, where the    destruction is even moreshocking than
     elsewhere since    nothing has been touchedin there.
                             jack
               oh, my god! my beautiful room!
               my beautiful, beautiful room!
                      (very angry)
               michael!... peter -- where the
               hell are you, for chrissakes?
     he runs like a madman into peter's room and stops short
     on the threshold. michael and peter are each holding a
     handle of the basket as they rock it gently.
                             jack
                      (furious)
               what the hell is going on around
               here? what happened to this place?
               what happened to my room?
     peter and michael look him right in the eye, still
     rocking the basket.
                             jack
               and anyway, what the hell are you

                                                             76.

          swinging that thing for?
                 (silence)
          answer me for god's sake!
                 (looking in)
          oh my god, there's a kid in there!
          have you've gone bananas!? there's
          a goddamn kid in there!
                 (silence)
                        jack
          oh, i get it. the    'silent' treatment!
          okay, if you won't   talk to me, you can
          talk to my lawyer!    this is grounds for
          divorce! you're in    big trouble, the
          both of you.

he leaves.   a second later, he comes back.
                        jack
          i paid to have this place decorated,
          too, you know. i'm not going to let
          you get away with this.
he leaves; a second later, he comes back.
                         jack
          it's too late to try and talk me
          out of it. i'm history. i'm gone.
          i'm outa here.
he leaves.   a second later, he comes back.
                        jack
          i'm giving you one more chance to...
                        peter
                 (very calmly)
          would it be asking too much of you
          to shut your big mouth for a few
          seconds? there is a child here
          who's trying to sleep.
                        jack
          and that's another thing! i will
          not have a baby in this house!
          babies are not part of our agreement!
                         peter
                 (softly)
          michael, please hold me back... or
          i'll kill him.
michael takes the basket handle from  peter's hand, places
the basket carefully on the bed, and  walks without a word
towards jack, who he takes by the arm  and steers into the
living room. peter softly shuts the   door behind them and
follows.

                                                                      77.
