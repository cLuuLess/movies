     diapers and a bag of groceries.
     in addition to the two cops there are now three narcotic
     agents who are interrogating peter. he is holding mary.
     the basket is on an armchair.
                             michael
               hello, officers... what's going
               on?
                             peter
               don't worry, michael, it's
               nothing serious, just a little
               misunderstanding.
                             michael
               did you give her the 5:30 bottle?
                             peter
               yeah, i just gave it to her.

                                                                    59.


                             michael
               did you change her?
                             peter
               no, she's soaking wet.

                             michael
               okay, i'll do it.
     michael puts down his bag of groceries, takes mary from
     peter and disappears with the box of diapers.
     in his room, he lays mary down on his bed and starts
     undressing her.
