                      (on the phone; things
                       are heating up)
               that's right, you heard right:
               i'm not coming in to work for two
               weeks... no, i can't explain why...
                      (in a louder tone)
               ... because i can't, that's all!...
               no, this has nothing to do with
               chasing ass! jerry... jerry!
               will you stop screaming for a
               minute and listen? i'm in trouble,
               you understand? deep trouble... i
               know... i know...
                              peter (cont'd)
                      (yells)
               ... goddammit, jerry, of course
               winning the competition is
               important to me! the firm's my
               whole life if you must know. no,
               no, please -- don't send anyone
               over here... don't you come either.
               no, jerry... okay, listen, i'll be
               there in a half-hour, but i can't
               stay long. no! don't come here!
               i'll be right over.
     he hangs up.   michael enters the room, with his coat on.
                              michael

                                                                65.

              i gotta go over to    mr. oxman's --
              he just called and    he's freaking
              out. he says if i     don't bring
              some cartoons over    now, the deal's
              off.

                            peter
              you're going now?
                            michael
              yeah, but don't worry about it,
              i'll be back before it's time
              for her next bottle. she's asleep
              now.
                            peter
              terrific, just terrific! jerry
              just called: i have to go to the
              office right now.
                            michael
              well, call him back. tell him
              you'll come later.
                            peter
              there's no way. i can't, he's
              suicidal. why don't you call oxman
              and tell him you'll be there in a
              few hours.
                            michael
              you're crazy. oxman is leaving in
              an hour. if i don't meet him
              before then, i blow my 15,000
              dollar contract.
                            peter
              oh shit, i can't take this
              anymore!
                            michael
              look, maybe we could pawn her off
              on mrs. razzolini, just for a
              couple of hours -- she's crazy
              about her!
                              peter
              good idea!    let's go.
