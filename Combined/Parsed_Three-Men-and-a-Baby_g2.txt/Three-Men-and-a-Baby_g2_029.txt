                             peter
                       (on the phone)
               i need to reach jack collins, he's
               one of your pilots... no, i don't
               know exactly where he is, but he
               was supposed to be flying the
               miami-caracas-rio route... the guy
               who proposed to you?... oh, did
               he?... well, congratulations.
               please... listen to me... you
               must contact him and tell him he's
               got to call home immediately.
               okay? it's an emergency, a
               family problem... no, don't worry,
               he's not married to someone else.
               it's another kind of family

                                                                       40.

               problem... of course he still
               loves you. but he's been really
               busy lately. so anyway, please
               try to get in touch with him, it's
               real important... i can count on
               you then?... good. thanks.
               goodbye!... right, see you at the
               wedding.
     peter hangs up.
