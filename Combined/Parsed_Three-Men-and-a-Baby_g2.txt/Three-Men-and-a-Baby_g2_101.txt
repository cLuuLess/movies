104   int. charter company - day                            104
      jack is coming out of   an office that says "executive
      offices." he is grim    and sullen-looking. he runs into
      his friend paul, who   jumps three feet away to avoid a
      potential mishap with   jack.
                               paul
                       (shyly)
                hi, jack, something wrong?

                                                                        98.

                              jack
                       (who hadn't
                        noticed him)
                oh, hi... nah, nothing's wrong.
                              paul
                what were you doing in the boss's
                office?
                              jack
                i was asking to do the new york-
                washington shuttle for a few
                months.
                              paul
                oh, and he said 'no,' huh?

                              jack
                       (barking)
                as a matter of fact, he said
                'yes.'
      paul backs up against the wall, protecting his face
      with his arms. jack leaves, disgusted. paul watches
      him go, totally confused.
