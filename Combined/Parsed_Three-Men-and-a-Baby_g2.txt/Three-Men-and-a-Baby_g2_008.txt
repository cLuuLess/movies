                                                                  18.


    jack is in the cockpit with his copilot, ron. the
    engines are revving. jack is checking gauges. he looks
    out the window idly and sees:
    the crew of another plane walking across the tarmac.
    paul is one of the crew. paul sees jack and begins to
    gesture wildly, but his voice is drowned out by the noise
    of the engines.
    just seeing paul is enough to remind jack about his
    package.
                            jack
              damn! i forgot to tell them about
              the package!
                     (to ron)
              i gotta make a quick phone call.
              i'll be right back.
                            ron
                     (knowingly)
              jack, there'll be plenty of girls
              where we're going.
                            jack
              oh, c'mon, i've really got to
              make a phone call! what do you
              think i'm going to do, pick up
              one of the new jersey delegates
              to the i.b.m. convention?
    jack walks back towards the phone. as he walks we see
    that the plane is filled with ugly, boring businessmen.
