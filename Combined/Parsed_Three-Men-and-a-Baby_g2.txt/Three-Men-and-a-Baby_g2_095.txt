98   int. apartment - late afternoon                            98
     the doorbell rings.
     jack goes to the door.
     at the door stands a rather distinguished-looking woman,
     with her hair tied back very properly, a suitcase in her
     hand. it is mrs. bretsaws, who speaks with a british
     accent.
                             mrs. bretsaws
               good afternoon. i'm mathilda
               bretsaws, from the second mommy
               agency.
                             jack
                      (very eager,
                       very gracious)
               oh, yes, i was expecting you.
               won't you come in...
     they disappear into the living room. jack shuts the door
     behind him. michael peeks into the hall, then goes and
     looks into the living room through the crack in the door.
     peter, too, peeks in.
                               peter
               who is it?
                             michael
               must be some nanny he found through
               an agency.
     peter shrugs and walks away.
     jack comes out of the living room.
                             jack
                      (softly, to michael)
               she wants to see mary.
                               michael
               she's asleep.
                             jack
               well, she wants to see her anyway!
     he heads toward peter's room.

                                                                    91.

                             peter
                      (returning from
                       the kitchen)
               what do you want?
                             jack
               nothing, nothing.
                             peter
               don't go into my room, she's
               asleep.
                             jack
               yeah, but the nanny, mrs. bretsaws,
               she wants to see her.

                             peter
               no, damn it, no! you're gonna
               wake her up! it already took me
               an hour to sing her to sleep...
                             jack
               yeah, but she wants to see her.
                             peter
               all right, i'll go explain the
               situation.
                             jack
                      (holding him back
                       with both hands)
               no, no, peter, please, really,
               don't go, don't bother, i'll go
               explain it to her myself...
                              peter
               it's no bother, jack.    i'll be
               glad to do it.
     he rushes toward the living room.
                             jack
                      (sighing, to michael)
               wanna bet she's out of here in
               ten minutes slamming the door
               behind her?
     they tiptoe over to the living room door and eavesdrop.
