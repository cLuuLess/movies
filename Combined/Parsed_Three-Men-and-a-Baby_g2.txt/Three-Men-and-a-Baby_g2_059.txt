62   ext. park - day                                            62
     michael is sitting on a bench facing the grass, with
     his back to us, he seems quite busy.
     as we close in, we discover that he has opened the box of
     diapers and that he's holding one of them; its plastic
     has been carefully cut out with scissors.
     casually, glancing right and left, he takes the individ-
     ual packets of white powder out of his pocket and shoves
     them into a little plastic bag from the supermarket.
     then he carefully tapes the bag so it's well-sealed and
     flattened out, and he inserts it into the diaper, be-
     tween the plastic and the absorbent fabric.
     next, the diaper is taped up, folded back up and put
     back in the box, neatly packed between the other ones.
     michael closes the box again and glues it together so
     it looks as if it's never been opened. he throws all
     the other stuff away in a trash can and grabs hold of
     his brand-new box of diapers. he walks away.
