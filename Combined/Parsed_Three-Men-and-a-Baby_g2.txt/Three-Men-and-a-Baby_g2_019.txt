19   int. apartment - day                                      19
     peter comes in with bags in his arms.
     michael, holding the baby, dashes toward him, extremely
     pissed off.
                             michael
               what the hell were you doing?
               you've been gone for hours! this
               damn kid's been crying the whole
               time. i've got a lot better
               things to do with my time! you're
               a real pain in the ass!
                             peter
                      (flabbergasted)
               hey, how dare you speak to me like
               that! you've never spoken to me
               like that before...
                             michael
               well, what the hell took   you so
               long? what'd you do, go    out for
               breakfast or something?    i didn't
               even have time for a cup   of
               coffee, for chrissakes.
                             peter
               will you please cut it out for a
               second, huh? i didn't have any
               coffee either, it took me forever
               at the goddamn safeway.
                             michael
               okay, well, here -- take the kid,
               i've got work to do.
                             peter
               whaddaya mean, take the kid? i
               can't hold her and make her bottle
               at the same time. and why should
               i be the one to hold her?
                             michael
               'cause, it's your problem.    you
               found this kid.
                             peter
               hey, asshole, i'm the one who found

                                                            34.

          her because i'm the one who was
          gonna get you some bagels for
          your breakfast, and...
                        michael
          jesus, there she goes again!      we
          gotta feed her something.
                        peter
          yeah, well you just don't feed a
          baby. first you gotta look and
          see if she has any teeth or not.
                           michael
          why?

                        peter
          to figure out how old she is so
          we know what to feed her, that's
          why.
peter attempts to look into mary's mouth but she squirms.
                        michael
          do you look on top or bottom?
                           peter
          how do i know?
                        michael
          try feeling with your finger.
peter slides his finger over mary's gums.
                        peter
          i can't feel anything -- i'll
          give her the stuff for newborns
          and hope she's not allergic to
          it.
peter starts off toward the kitchen, michael follows.
                           peter
          and then we'll    have to  see if
          she's allergic    to iron,  to soy
          or to milk --    you can't  imagine
          how much stuff    they can  be
          allergic to!
                        michael
          she's soaking wet -- did you buy
          any diapers?
                           peter
          diapers?
                           michael

                                                                      35.

                       (furious)
                figures. i'll take care of
                this, it'll save time.
      he sticks mary in peter's arms, right on top of the bags,
      and storms out.


19a   int. safeway - day                                         19a
      michael rushes in and stops short in front of the moun-
      tains of diaper boxes that he starts examining in bewil-
      derment. finally, he approaches the store clerk.
                              michael
                excuse me, miss, could you tell
                me which diapers are the most
                absorbent?
                              store clerk
                i would suggest the ones that say
                'ultra-absorbent.'
                              michael
                yeah, but which are better:    20-35
                pounds or 12-24 pounds?
                              store clerk
                       (suspiciously)
                depends how much your baby weighs.
                              michael
                oh right, how much she weighs...
                              store clerk
                       (threateningly)
                you wouldn't happen to have a
                friend who came in here a little
                while ago, would you?
      michael grabs just any box of diapers.
                              michael
                i have no idea what you're talking
                about! he's no friend of mine.
      michael takes off very, very quickly.
