88   ext. central park - day                                    88
     michael is lying on the grass near the fountain with
     mary on her blanket near him.
     graton is nearby, also lying casually on the grass,
     watching them out of the corner of his eye.
     michael glances at his watch, then at the passersby.
     the punk from the day before walks by with his arm around
     a girl. he strolls by casually. he spots michael and
     their eyes meet. the couple sit down on a bench a few
     yards away and they begin "making out."

                                                            80.

michael leans over mary, coochie-coos her and surrepti-
tiously takes off her diaper, which he puts down beside
him. he puts the clean diaper on her.
graton, nervous and wary,   watches michael and the
passersby. just then, two    punks (peter and jack) come
running up to michael. he    ostensibly takes the brown
package out of his plastic   bag and gives it to them.
the two punks immediately take off with the package.
graton leaps up, shouts "let's get 'em" and takes off
after the punks, followed by about 10 other plainclothes
detectives, who'd been hiding all around.
michael quickly gets up,    picks mary up and discreetly
deposits the dope-filled    diaper in a trash can, giving
the punk on the bench an    intent look. then he goes off
in the direction of the    cops.
the punk calmly goes over to the trash can, takes out the
diaper, which he stuffs into his girl friend's purse, and
goes off in the opposite direction.
the cops have meanwhile arrested peter and jack, who put
up no resistance whatsoever. michael now joins them.
                        michael
          what's going on?
                        graton
          inspector graton, narcotics. do
          you admit you gave these men this
          package?
                       michael
          sure. i gave it to them, just a
          moment ago.
                        graton
                 (to one of the cops)
          officer, will you please open this
          package in front of these witnesses?
the cop opens the package: it's a box of chocolate
easter bunnies. graton is mortified. he crushes all
the bunnies -- there's absolutely nothing but chocolate
inside them.
                        michael
          is it against the law to give a
          box of candy to my friends?
peter and jack take off their glasses.
                        graton
          oh, it's you guys!

                                                                    81.


                             peter
               what's the problem?
                             graton
               you guys must think you're pretty
               smart, don't ya?
                      (suddenly freezes)
               holy shit! the diaper!
     graton starts running like crazy back to the fountain.
     he rummages like a sick dog all around the spot where
     michael had been lying. suddenly he dashes toward the
     trash can and dumps out its contents, throwing the
     garbage around like a lunatic.

                             graton
               the goddam diaper! what a jerk,
               what a goddam schmuck i am!
     peter, michael, jack and the 10 plainclothes detectives
     watch graton going bananas.
                             michael
                      (to the cops)
               i think that guy needs a vacation.
                             jack
               he should try south america.
                             peter
               yeah, i hear it's nice there this
               time of year.
