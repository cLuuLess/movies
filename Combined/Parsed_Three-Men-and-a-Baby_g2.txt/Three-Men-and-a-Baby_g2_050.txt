53   int. living room - night                                  53
     peter and michael are asleep in their bathrobes on the
     living room couches.
     peter has a child care book over his face. mary, in her
     basket, wakes up and utters a few little noises. the
     two men jump up and go over to her basket like robots.
     mary looks at them and smiles.
