73   int. apartment - dawn                                       73
     the doorbell rings.
     michael, asleep on his mattress on the    floor in the
     middle of his wrecked bedroom, emerges    from sleep and
     glances at his clock: it's 6:10 am.      he staggers to the
     front door and opens it. the door is     being held together
     with a string.
     agents #1, #2, and #3 are at the door, with four other
     cops backing them up.
     mrs. razzolini is standing behind them and staring, wide-
     eyed, a look of horror on her face.
                             michael
               morning, officers. can i help
               you?
                             agent #1
                      (holding out a piece
                       of paper to him)
               search warrant.
                             michael

                                                                69.

                      (playing  the gentleman,
                       waving  away the paper)
               i believe you,  officer. go ahead,
               we have nothing  to hide. hello,
               mrs. razzolini!

     mrs. razzolini turns her back on him and hurries away.
     the cops enter the apartment.
                             michael
               you'll have to excuse the mess...
               we had a few friends over last night...
                             agent #1
                      (looking at the
                       devastation)
               oh, really? well, if i were you
               i'd get myself some new friends!
     peter comes in, in his bathrobe, furious.
                             peter
               what the hell are you guys looking
               for, anyway?
                             agent #1
               probably the same things your
               friends were looking for last
               night! didn't mrs. razzolini
               bring you a package last sunday?
                             peter
               you mean the chocolate easter
               bunnies? we ate them already.
     he starts to walk away.
                             peter
               anyway, you have no idea how many
               packages we've been getting lately.
               it's hard to keep track of them.
                             agent #1
               maybe we can help.
                      (to his colleagues)
               let's get to work!
     all the cops enter the apartment.
