75   int. apartment - day                                       75
     the cops are leaving.
                             agent #1
               well, there's obviously been a
               mistake. as far as you're
               concerned this investigation is
               closed. we apologize again.
                              michael
                      (big smile)
               oh, don't mention it! it was a
               pleasure having you here! i hope
               you'll find what you're looking
               for very soon!
                             agent #1
                      (looking straight
                       at him)
               so do we.
     michael closes the door and races into the living room
     where he discovers peter putting on his jacket.
                             michael
                      (softly)
               did you hear that? he said
               there'd been a mistake and they
               weren't going to bother us anymore.

                                                                        71.


                             peter
               bullshit, it's a trick.
                               michael
               you think so?    really?

                             peter
               they just said that to put us off
               guard. they saw the condition
               this apartment's in.
                             peter (cont'd)
               they know the punks were here
               looking for the dope and that they
               probably didn't find it. so that
               means we've still got it.
                             michael
               but he said the investigation was
               closed.
                             peter
               okay, let's just see how closed
               it is. i'll go downstairs. you
               watch out the window and see if
               i'm being tailed.
