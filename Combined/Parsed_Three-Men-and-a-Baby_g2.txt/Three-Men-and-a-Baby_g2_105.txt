108   int. bathroom - evening                                108
      peter enters the bathroom. he's carrying mary, who's
      naked and wrapped in a towel.

                                                                     101.

      peter carefully locks the door behind him. he removes
      mary's towel and sits her in her little tub, filled
      with warm water.
      mary quivers as she comes in contact with the water.
      peter kneels down and very gently pours glasses of water
      on her shoulders and head. the water streams down her
      face. she blinks and laughs. peter whispers lovingly
      to her in a barely audible, very low voice. mary
      stares at him.
