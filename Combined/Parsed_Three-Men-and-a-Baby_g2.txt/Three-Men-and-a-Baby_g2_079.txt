82   int. living room - night                                    82
     michael sits jack down in an armchair.     he speaks with
     forced calm.

                             michael
               all right, jack. why don't we
               start at the very beginning. the
               very day you left for your
               vacation...
                             jack
               hey, will you please stop talking
               like mr. rogers? it's getting on
               my nerves.
                             peter
                      (his fuse has blown,
                       laughing hysterically)
               his nerves! ha. ha. ha. his
               nerves! michael, his nerves!
               you wanna talk about nerves! then
               just shut up and listen. it so
               happens we don't want a kid here
               either, but when someone dumps one
               on us, we take goddamn care of it.
                             michael
               yeah, we take goddam care of it.
                             peter
               we haven't had a decent night's
               sleep in two weeks. michael's
               probably going to lose a $15,000
               contract...
                             michael
               peter couldn't leave. jerry almost
               jumped out the window. it's lucky
               they even made it to the finals!
                                jack
               what?
                             peter
               first, we've got the    narcs on our
               ass, then there's the    drug gang
               threatening to carve    us up. then
               bottles... bottles...    every three
               hours, bottles.
                              michael
               and diapers. have you ever tried
               to do diapers?

                                                                   78.

                             peter
               'la paz, bolivia...' he calls from
               ... 'i'm onto something hot.' he
               says. 'did the package get there?'
               he says. you asshole!

                             michael
               and the day they wrecked the
               apartment, peter came home and
               couldn't find mary. i've never
               seen him in tears like that bef...
                             peter
                      (cutting him off;
                       embarrassed)
               never mind about that. look, jack,
               you got us into this mess, and
               you're going to help us get out of
               it.
                             jack
               what are you guys talking about?
               what narcs? what gang? and who's
               that fucking baby?
                             peter
               for your information, the 'fucking'
               baby's name is mary. and if i
               were you, i'd watch what i said
               about her... because she just so
               happens to be your daughter!
                             jack
               what??
                             michael
               and it just so happens, we've got
               a lot better things to do with our
               lives than wipe a baby's ass, even
               if she's yours!
     peter and michael exit, slamming the door.
