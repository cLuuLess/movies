56   ext. street - day                                      56
     on the street two men drive by on a motorcycle looking at
     the numbers on the apartment buildings. they stop a few
     yards from the entrance to peter, michael and jack's
     building.

                                                                       46.


     they are being followed by the beige chevy that pulls
     ahead of them and parks just beyond them. in this car
     we recognize graton sitting with a partner.
     the two men, who look like young tough guys (punks), get
     off their motorcycle and disappear into the lobby of the
     building.
     graton gets out of his car    and heads for the building.
     he glances into the lobby,    then goes in. he watches the
     elevator floor indicator,    notes the floor it stops on,
     then calmly returns to his    car.
