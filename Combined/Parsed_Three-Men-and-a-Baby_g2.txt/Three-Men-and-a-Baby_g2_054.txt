57   int. living room - day                                       57

     peter and michael are still sitting on the living room
     couches. the doorbell rings. michael springs up and
     runs to open the door. peter follows him.
     on the    doorstep stand the two punks. one of them is
     short    and speaks with a heavy brooklyn accent. the
     other,    tall, thin and creepy-looking, stands behind his
     buddy    and doesn't speak.
                               punk #1
                 jack collins live here?
                                 michael
                 yes, he does.
                               punk #1
                 we came for the package.
                               peter
                 package? oh that's cute,
                 referring to her as a package!
                 anyway, you can tell sylvia she's
                 a lousy stinking bitch.
                                 punk #1
                 sylvia?
                               peter
                 yeah, sylvia! you can tell her
                 she's got a hell of a nerve
                 dumping her problems into our
                 laps!
                               punk #1
                        (nervously)
                 problems? did you guys have
                 trouble?
                               michael
                        (sarcastically)

                                                        47.

          he wants to know if we had trouble!
                        peter
          do you have any idea what it's
          been like around here for the
          past four days?

                        michael
          she could have at least given us
          a phone number or the name of
          someone to contact...
                        punk #1
                 (surprised)
          i don't get it. didn't they tell
          you we were gonna be here today?

                        michael
          sure they told us! so what?
          that doesn't make the last four
          days any less hellish than they
          were!
                        peter
          well, anyway, they're here now,
          that's all that matters!
peter turns and walks toward the basket.
                        peter
          the next bottle's in 45 minutes.
          i made it already. it's in the
          basket.
                         punk #1
          bottle?   whadda ya mean, bottle?
                        michael
          about an hour after her bottle,
          she starts yawning. put her to
          bed right away or it's pure hell
          for the next three hours, at least
          that's what we've noticed.
peter has returned with the basket. the punks look at
the baby, their eyes wide with disbelief.
                        punk #1
          what the hell is that?   a baby?
                        peter
                 (sarcastic)
          no, it's a very short teenager.
          of course it's a baby! now listen
          carefully: i'm giving you a can
          of the milk she's been getting.
          she loves it, and more importantly,

                                                          48.

          she's not allergic to it. i even
          put a can of the same brand in
          here for you, but in powdered form,
          understand?
punk #1 hears "powder" and catches on.

                           punk #1
          oh! i get it!      powdered milk!
          very clever!
                        peter
          yeah, right... real clever...
          okay, here. she's all yours.
          good luck.

he hands them the basket.    punk #1 grabs the handles.
                        punk #1
          okay, i got it. you can take her
          out now.
                           peter
          take what out?     i'm not taking
          anything out.
                        punk #1
          wait a minute, i don't get it!
          we take the basket and the milk,
          that's all. we ain't gonna take
          the... what's inside.
                        peter
          whadda ya mean, what's inside?
                        michael
          you take it all, man!    it's a
          package deal!
                        punk #1
          but what are we s'posed to do
          with it?
                        michael
          how do i know? you take it
          where they told you to take it.
                        punk #1
          y'mean, i take it to the
          connection?
                        michael
          yeah, whatever you want to call
          it.
                        punk #1
          are you sure that's the plan?

                                                              49.


                        michael
          you bet that's the plan! we're
          not keeping her one more second.
                        punk #1
          okay, if that's the plan...
he passes the basket to punk #2
                        punk #1
          ... here, hold this. okay, so
          long!
they start to leave, pressing the elevator button.

                        peter
                 (suddenly a little
                  worried)
          uh... listen... maybe you could
          leave us the address or the phone
          number just in case. so we can
          find out how she's doing?
the punks exchange a puzzled glance.
                        punk #1
          oh, yeah, sure, the address.
                 (feebly searching
                  his pockets)
          oh shit, i don't have it on me...
          but i'll call you. okay, so long!
                           peter & michael
          so long!
the elevator has arrived.    the punks quickly slip inside
it with the basket.
michael closes the door.
peter plops down in the armchair by the front door.
                        peter
          aah, relief at last!    good riddance!
                        michael
          you said it! now maybe i can get
          some work done.
he disappears in the direction of his room.
peter is sitting    on something hard. he pulls it out from
under him, it's    a package. he looks at it, casually
reading: "care     of jack collins." he tosses it to the
side. suddenly,     it dawns on him. he leaps up, grabs
the package and    runs into michael's room.

                                                                  50.
