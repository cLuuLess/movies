92   int. apartment - day                                     92
     in the living room, michael is sitting in front of the
     tv. he's not really watching -- he's eavesdropping on
     jack's phone conversation.
                             jack
                      (very aggravated)
               listen, sylvia, you've got to come
               back. i travel, i can't take care
               of her... yeah, but you're her
               mother... i'm her father -- what
               makes you so sure i'm the father!?
               the dates coincide! big deal!
               that doesn't prove a thing... but
               she's still your kid, so do me a
               favor, get your ass back here
               immediately and take her off our
               hands... 'cause we've got a lot
               better things to do with our
               lives than wipe a baby's ass,
               okay? sylvia?... hello! hello!
               sylvia, goddam it!
                             jack (cont'd)
                      (he slams the receiver
                       down like he was
                       hammering a nail)
               shit! that bitch hung up on me!
               women! i could kill them!
                             michael
               why don't you call her back?
                             jack
               i don't have the number. i got
               a message to her through her
               agency, they won't tell me where
               she is. i don't even know where
               she was calling from. and you
               better believe she's not going

                                                                 84.

               to call back!
     the phone rings.   michael answers it.
                             michael
               hello?... no, it's michael... how
               are you?... oh, she's doing just
               fine, she's in great shape. we're
               taking very good care of her, you
               have nothing to worry about.
               'bye.
     he hangs up.
                                jack
               who was that?

                             michael
               sylvia -- she wanted to know how
               mary was doing.
                             jack
               what? jesus christ, michael, why
               didn't you let me talk to her!?
                             michael
               she would have just hung up on
               you again. the important thing
               is she knows mary's fine.
                             jack
               you jerk! you should've said
               she was terrible, sick as hell!
               practically on death's door!
                      (exits, furious)
               what a jerk, what a pain in the
               ass you can be sometimes...
                             michael
                      (to himself)
               what's with him? the kid's doing
               really great!
