     peter enters the store and rushes right over to a store
     clerk.
                             peter
               what aisle's baby food on?
                             clerk
               down there by the meat section.
     peter heads for it purposefully. when he    gets to the
     right aisle, he stops short, taken aback:    a vast range
     of products extends before him. he starts    examining the
     baby food jars and cans of formulas, going   from one to
     the next, not knowing where to begin.
