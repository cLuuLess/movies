                               agent #1
               and who's he?
                             peter
               he's my roommate.
                             agent #1
                      (raising an eyebrow)
               oh, i see, i see...
                             peter
               no, you don't see. there are
               three of us sharing this place.
                             agent #1
               oh, three, huh? a regular 'mirage
               a trois'!
                             peter
               it's 'menage'... and it's not.
               we all have lots of girlfriends,
               thank you.
                             agent #1
               uh-huh, so what's your friend do?
                             peter
               he's a cartoonist.
                             agent #1
               what about the other guy?
                               peter
               he's a pilot.
                             agent #1
               ah-hah... now that's interesting...
                      (to his colleague)

                                                          60.

          ... get me those photographs,
          the ones taken at newark airport.
agent #1 looks in his attache case.
                        agent #1
          so does this friend of yours ever
          fly to south america?
                          peter
          no.   never.   only north america.
the phone rings.
                        agent #1
          would you object if i answered it
          for you?
                        peter
          not at all, go right ahead.    i've
          got nothing to hide.
agent #1 picks up the phone and listens.
                        agent    #1
          it's a collect call    from a jack
          collins in la paz,    bolivia. that
          wouldn't happen to    be your pilot
          friend, would it?     the one who
          never goes to south    america?
                        peter
          yes, it is him.
agent #1 hands him the phone.
                        peter
          hello, yes, operator, i accept the
          charges.
agent #1 gestures to agent #3 to take a look around the
apartment. agent #3 slips away.
                        agent #1
          would you mind very much if i
          listened?
                        peter
          please, go right ahead.
agent #1 picks up the other telephone.
                        peter
          hello, jack? fine, yeah. how're
          you? yeah, he's fine, too.
          yeah, we left a message for you,
          right... no, it was nothing

                                                                     61.

               special, it was just, i mean...
               to see how you were doing and all
               ... no, no emergency. everything's
               fine.
                             peter (cont'd)
                      (loud)
               i said everything's fine! the
               what?... i don't know what you're
               talking about... oh yeah, the
               package! yeah, yeah, it got here
               ... and was picked up, uh-huh.
               hey! why didn't you call sooner?
               huh? 'cause what?... oh, you're
               onto something hot -- well, aren't
               you the lucky one!... so when are
               you getting married?... forget it,

               have a good time. see you in a
               couple of weeks. 'bye.
     peter hangs up.   so does agent #1.
                             agent #1
               now that's interesting. so you
               wanna tell me about this package
               and the hot something-or-other
               your friend lucked onto... in
               la paz... bolivia... south america?
     peter sits down, stunned.
