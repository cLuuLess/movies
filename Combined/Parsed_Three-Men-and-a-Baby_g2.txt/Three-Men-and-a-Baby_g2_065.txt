68   int. building - dusk                                  68
     peter and michael get out of the elevator on mrs.
     razzolini's floor. they each are holding one of the
     handles on the basket. they are walking quickly.
     suddenly michael stops peter.

                                                            66.

                        michael
          wait -- i hear someone... i'll go
          see...
peter waits with the basket.   michael tiptoes to the
corner of the corridor.

at the very end of the corridor, on mrs. razzolini's
doorstep, he sees the three narcotics agents talking with
mrs. razzolini. we can hear snippets of their
conversation.
                        razzolini
          yes, i brought a package up to
          them... i think it was last
          sunday...

                        agent #1
          what are these people like? what
          kind of lifestyle do they have?
michael hastily returns to peter, still on tiptoes. he
leads him back to the elevator and pushes the elevator
button.
                        michael
                 (whispering)
          just as i thought -- the goddamn
          cops are grilling mrs. razzolini.
                        peter
          oh shit! we sure as hell can't
          hand her the baby with an ass full
          of dope... right in front of the
          narcs!
the elevator has arrived meanwhile.
                        peter
                 (breaking down)
          what should we do? i really gotta
          go...
                        michael
          listen, she's just had her bottle.
          she's sleeping like a log. let's
          just leave her in the apartment.
          what can possibly happen to her?
          she's as regular as clockwork.
          she won't wake up till 8:30 and
          we'll easily be back by then...
                        peter
          yeah, you're right, we won't be
          long.
they rush into the elevator.

                                                                      67.
