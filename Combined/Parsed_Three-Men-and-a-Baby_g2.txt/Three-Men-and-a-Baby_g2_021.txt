21   int. apartment living room - day                          21
     peter and michael have laid mary down on the couch,
     taking care to place several towels between her bottom
     and the immaculate velvet. mary is squirming, laughing,
     feeling great. they have already gone through half
     a box of cotton in their attempts to clean up the
     crap. but it's still all over, on their hands, on the
     baby's feet and legs, on the towels, etc.
                              peter
               hold her.   hold her, goddamn it!
                             michael
               i can't hold her. this kid's
               out of control here!
                             peter
               just gimme the cotton.
     michael lets go of mary's feet and she sticks them back
     in the crap.
                             peter
               oh for chrissake, don't just let
               go of her!
                             michael
               then get the cotton yourself
               if you don't want me to let
               go of her!
     peter grabs a huge wad of cotton.
                             peter
               take the towels off -- they're
               full of shit.
                             michael
               but the couch'll get dirty!
                             peter
               yeah, but she keeps getting it all
               over herself. man, this shit is
               sticky!... we need cleaning fluid
               or something to get it off...
                             michael
               how 'bout after-shave?
                             peter
               are you kidding?! waste our saint
               laurent on babyshit?
                             michael
               okay, let's just put the diaper

                                                                  37.

          on and the hell with it.
                           peter
          right.
michael hands him a diaper.        peter tries to figure out
how it goes on.
                        peter
          these tape things -- do they
          go on the front or the back?
                        michael
          how am i supposed to know...?
peter tries to slide the diaper under mary's backside
but she squirms and kicks it off with her feet.
                        peter
          hold her under her arms -- i'm
          gonna try it this way.
michael holds mary under    her armpits.     peter tries to put
the diaper on her. it's     hard. what's     more, it would
seem that michael didn't    buy the right    size -- the
diaper comes all the way    up to mary's    chin.
                        peter
          what the hell kind of lousy
          stinking diapers did you get?
          they're way too big!
                        michael
          i don't think they're too big --
          they're ultra-absorbent. that's
          all. the more absorbent the
          better.
peter has more or less managed to adjust the diaper.
                        peter
          how the hell do these tape
          things work? hold her for
          chrissakes!
                        michael
          my arms are getting tired.
                           peter
          there.     i got it.
he tapes the diaper closed.
                           peter
          damn it.     i didn't make it tight
          enough.

                                                                     38.

     he tapes the other side:   the diaper gapes and sags.
                             michael
               it's not working... what about
               laying her down?

                             peter
               go ahead... no, not on the towels,
               they're all covered with crap...
     michael lays mary down right on the couch. peter vigor-
     ously undoes the tape, and the whole plastic lining rips
     apart.
                             peter
               ... what the hell is this friggin'
               mess? oh, man, this is
               unbelievable! to think, they
               bombard us day and night with
               their goddamn tv commercials! and
               will you look at this junk? this
               stuff is pure shit -- you tape it
               closed, it sags, you undo the tape:
               bingo -- the whole goddamn thing
               falls apart!
                             michael
                      (taking another diaper)
               well, whaddya expect, if you pull
               on it like an ape, it's gonna rip!
                             peter
               michael, will you give me a break,
               will you please?
     peter takes the torn diaper off. mary utters a tiny cry
     and pees copiously all over the velvet couch.
                             peter
                      (exploding)
               oh shit! now she's pissing. look
               at the couch. the sneaky little
               bitch was just waiting for me to
               get the diaper off, then whammo...
     mary gives them a big smile.
                             peter
               i happen to like my furniture.
               i'm going out to get some real
               diapers.  you can clean the couch
               up in the meantime.
     he exits, slamming the door.
