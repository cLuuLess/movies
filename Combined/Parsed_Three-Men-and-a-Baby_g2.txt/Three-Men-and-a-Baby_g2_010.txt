10   int. apartment - day                                         10
     peter, dressed in casual clothes, knocks on the door of
     michael's room, and peeks in.
     michael is asleep fully clothed on his bed. his drawing
     table is strewn with papers, overflowing ashtrays and
     empty coffee cups. the lamp is still on.
                            peter
              i'm going out for bagels -- how
              many you want, three or four?
                            michael
                     (opening one eye)
              what time is it?
                               peter
              eleven-thirty.
                               michael
              a.m. or p.m.?
                              peter
              a.m.    c'mon, up 'n' at 'em.
                            michael
              up 'n' at 'em yourself, asshole
              -- i just went to bed.
                               peter

                                                                  21.

               did you finish?
                             michael
               nah, i didn't get anywhere.
                              peter
               well then... nap time's over.
               back to work. so how many bagels,
               three or four?
                               michael
               six, six!
     he buries his head under the pillow.
