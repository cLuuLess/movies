96   ext. house (miami) - day                              96
     a cab slowly pulls up in front of jack's mother's house.
     there is a big red convertible filled with four jovial
     senior citizens. jack comes out of the cab with the basket
     and stares at his mother, margie, who's just locking her
     door. next to her, holding her luggage is steve (a man in
     his sixties). they head toward the trunk of the car.
                                jack
               hey, mom!
                             margie
                      (hits steve)
               hey, he finally made it!
                             margie (cont'd)
                      (to jack)
               do you have any idea what time it
               is? it's four. you said two.
                             jack
               but, mom, i missed the plane.
                             margie
               yeah, but now i have to go.
                             jack
               where are you going?
                             margie
               on a cruise around the world.
                             jack
               but why didn't you say so on the phone?
                             margie
               because you never would've come.
               now let me see her.
                      (she grabs mary and
                       covers her with kisses)
               oh, my little strudle!
                                steve

                                                                   89.

               hey, margie.   we're a little late...
                             margie
               bye-bye, sweetie love... i'll
               bring you back presents from all
               over the world.
                      (to jack, giving
                       back mary)
               four o'clock.
     she runs into the car and they pull away.     everyone
     waving goodbye.
                              jack
                       (holding mary)
               'bye!
