17   int. apartment - day                                      17
     michael is rapidly    pacing up and down the apartment,
     vigorously rocking    mary. as soon as he sits down
     anywhere to rest,    mary screams, so michael pops back
     up and begins the    marathon all over again.
                             michael
               mary had a little lamb, little
               lamb, little lamb, if that jerk
               isn't back in three seconds i
               swear i'll throw her down the
               garbage chute... mary had a
               little lamb, little lamb...
     the doorbell rings.
                             michael
               well, it's about goddamn time!
     he hurries towards the door, grabs the knob and throws it
     open.
                             michael
               where the hell have you been?
     he stops. before him stands the apartment manager, mrs.
     razzolini, a squat little woman with a moustache.
                             michael
               oh -- hi, mrs. razzolini!

                                                          31.


                        manager
          this package came for you...
          oh! what a cute little baby!
          is it yours?

                        michael
          no, it's not me, i mean she's
          not mine...
                        manager
          oh, so it's peter's?
                        michael
          no, no, it's jack's, i mean it's
          not jack's, it's... someone loaned
          it to us, i mean someone...
                        manager
          and what's the little girl's name?
                        michael
          mary.
                        manager
          ooh, what a pwetty wittle name,
          mary! i didn't know you had a
          baby...
                        michael
          yeah, well, i have to put her to
          bed now.
                        manager
          you have to put her to bed?    where's
          mary's mommy?
                        michael
          she's... she's not here.   she'll
          be back soon.
michael starts to close the door.    she pushes it back
open and holds out the package.
                        manager
          oh here, this just came for you.
          they just dropped it off. can
          i hold her for a second?
                        michael
          well, like, y'see... she doesn't
          like to be held by strangers...
the apartment manager has already given michael the
package and grabbed mary. she covers her with kisses.
mary smiles. michael absent-mindedly looks at the
package.

                                                                     32.


                             manager
               she loves to be held by strangers!
               hey, she's soaking wet hmm, no
               i think it's number 2. want me
               to give you a hand changing her?

                             michael
               oh no, don't worry, i'm used
               to it.
                      (faking a smile)
               well, so long, mrs. razzolini.
                             manager
               'bye, mary, i'll come back to
               visit.

     mrs. razzolini regretfully hands the baby back. no
     sooner is mary back in michael's arms than she screams
     her head off.
     he closes the door; his smile instantly fades.
                             michael
               what a leech! and that other
               idiot isn't back yet!
     he throws the package onto an armchair in the hall.
                             michael
               so you love to be held by
               strangers, do you?
