               so?   was i right?
                             michael
               there's one guy for sure! a
               redhead, kind of young, disguised
               sort of like a college student.
                             peter
               i knew it. they're going to be
               watching us around the clock.

                                                                     72.

               how are we going to get the dope
               back to the punks?
                             michael
               i have the feeling they'll come
               to us.

                             peter
               we'll have to be very careful.
