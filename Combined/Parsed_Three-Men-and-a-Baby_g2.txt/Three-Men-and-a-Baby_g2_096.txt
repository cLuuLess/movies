               ... a sleeping child should not be
               awakened. if you don't know that,
               then you're not fit to be a nanny.

                                                                    92.

                       (tense, but still
                        calm)
                i never said that i wanted the
                child to be awakened, sir. i only
                asked to see her. if i'm going
                to be taking care of the child on
                a round-the-clock basis, then...
                              peter
                'round-the-clock'? whaddya mean
                'round the clock'? are you
                intending to sleep here?
                              mrs. bretsaws
                absolutely, sir. a second mommy
                is a second mommy.
                              peter
                and where are you going to sleep?
                              mrs. bretsaws
                well, i expect you to show me to
                my quarters.
                              peter
                well, i don't know where jack
                intends to stick you... that's his
                problem... maybe in his room...
                but i'm warning you, mrs.
                brestshow.

                studs.
