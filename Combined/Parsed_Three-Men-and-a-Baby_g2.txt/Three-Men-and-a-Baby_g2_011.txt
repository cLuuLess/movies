11   int. apartment hallway - day                            11
     peter opens the front door, he stumbles over an object,
     looks down; at his feet he sees a wicker basket lined
     with pretty pink-and-white checked gingham. in the
     basket a tiny baby lies fast asleep, her head gently
     resting on a lace pillow. peter looks at this object
     in amazement. there is an envelope pinned to the basket
     with the words, "for jack" written on it. peter picks up
     the letter -- he opens it and reads.
                             peter
                      (to himself)
               you gotta be kidding!
     abruptly he turns and races back to michael's room.
                               peter
               michael!    michael!
                              michael
                       (still groggy)
               what?
                             peter
               get your ass out here and see
               what's on the doorstep.
                      (mutters)
               this has gotta be somebody's idea
               of a joke!
     they run to the front door.
                               michael
               what is it?
                             peter
               look for yourself.
                             michael
               it's a basket with a baby in it.

                                     22.


               peter
no shit.
       (reads michael the
         letter)
'dearest jack, here is the fruit
of our love. take good care of
her. i have to go to europe and
japan for six months, her name is
mary. good luck, love, sylvia.'
              michael
what are we going to do with it?
              peter
give it back to her mother, that's
what.
              michael
but it says she went to europe.
              peter
well, we'll see about that, d'you
have her phone number?
              michael
whose phone number?
              sylvia
the girl's... sylvia's...
               michael
why the hell would i have her
number? i've never even heard
of this chick!
              peter
you mean you don't know who she
is?
              michael
no way. if i had to keep track
of all jack's girlfriends, i'd
have to be a full-time secretary.
              peter
well, what are we gonna do?
              michael
hey, look, she's waking up...
hey, look, she's crying...
              peter
oh no, this can't be happening!
she's not gonna start to cry now?!
              michael

                                     23.

uh-oh, now she's really crying!
              peter
what's her problem?
              michael
maybe she's hungry?
              peter
well, what are we s'posed to do?
              michael
feed her, i guess...
              peter
yeah, but what?

              michael
soft stuff... i guess.
              peter
       (exploding)
oh no, i swear to god this is
unreal! can you believe that
bastard jack?! 'a little package,'
he tells me on the phone, 'just
put it aside till thursday.' put
it aside -- can you believe him!?
               michael
really?   jack said that?
              peter
yeah and he also said 'don't tell
anyone about it -- anyone at all.'
              michael
oh, so he told you about this?
              peter
yeah, he told me a package would
be coming today, but he didn't
say it'd be this!
              michael
       (very angrily)
boy, he's got a helluva nerve!
              peter
just listen to the racket she's
making! what are we s'posed to
do?
              michael
       (brilliant idea)
let's call jack's mother!

                                                    24.

                       peter
         she lives in miami for christsake.
         she can't stop the baby crying
         from miami.
                       michael
         well, just to ask her advice...
                       peter
         no, he said not to tell anyone...
                       michael
         but this is an emergency!
                       peter
         no! no way! you know what a pain
         that woman is -- she'll be on the
         next plane here to move in with
         us...
                       michael
         maybe i should call my mother...
                       peter
         no, please -- leave the mothers
         out of this, okay?! it's only
         four days. we should be able to
         handle that, besides you know
         the rule around here: it's fine
         to have a woman over once in a
         while, but...
michael finishes the sentence in unison with him.
                       peter and michael
         ... never for more than one night
         at a time!
                       peter
         and that includes mothers!
peter steps over the basket and heads towards the
elevator.
                       michael
         where are you going?!
                       peter
         i'm going to the store to buy
         some baby food.
                       michael
         what am i supposed to do while
         you're gone?
                       peter
         pick her up and hold her.

                                                                       25.


                             michael
                      (panic-stricken)
               whaddya mean, pick her up? i've
               never held a baby -- i'll drop
               her!

     peter is already gone.
