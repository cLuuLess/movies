     peter, wearing a coat, enters carrying packages that he
     puts down in the living room, now transformed into a
     nursery. a makeshift changing table, rubber wash basin,
     baby clothes, baby lotion, talcum powder, soap and baby
     shampoo, etc. are all over the place. he drops all his
     purchases on the floor, sits down on the couch and picks
     up a book, in which he's instantly absorbed: we see from
     the cover that it's a book on children.
