     michael is walking on the street carrying two bags of
     groceries. suddenly, a guy walks up to him and elbows
     him sharply.

                             punk
               hi! doin' a little shopping, huh?
               how's your place -- not too much
               damage, i hope.
                             michael
               what do you guys want?
                             punk
               we want the dope. tomorrow.
                             michael
               and we want to give it to you.
               but the cops are tailing us
               nonstop. matter of fact, there's
               one right behind us now...
                             punk
               that's your problem, man. figure
               out a way to shake 'em. either we
               safely get the dope tomorrow, or
               you, your friend and the kid'll
               get this.
                      (he quickly stabs
                       the grocery bags
                       three times)
               we'll call you tonight.
     he runs off, disappearing into the darkness. from the
     slit-open grocery bag milk flows out onto the sidewalk.
     michael is shaking all over. standing about twenty yards
     away, graton hasn't missed a thing.
