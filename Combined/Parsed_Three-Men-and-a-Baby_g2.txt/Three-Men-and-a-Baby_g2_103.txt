106   int. michael's room - morning                                  106
      michael is working at his drafting table.      jack rushes
      in, wearing his uniform, ready to go out.
                              jack
                okay, i'm off. she's well fed
                and she's sleeping now.
      we hear mary crying.
                               jack
                shit, she's crying.      i'll go
                pick her up...
      peter passes him in the corridor.      he, too, is ready to
      go out to his office.
                                 peter

                                                                   99.

                 let her cry, she's just trying
                 to get to sleep, she'll stop in
                 a couple of minutes.
                               jack
                 no, she needs to burp -- i've
                 gotta rock her for a little...
                               peter
                 i'm telling you, the more you
                 pick her up, the longer it'll
                 take her to get to sleep.
                               jack
                 thanks for the advice -- now why
                 don't you just shove it? i know
                 you let her scream for hours but
                 i can't.
                                peter
                        (in a state of
                         shock)
                 i never let her scream for hours!
                               jack
                 you'd resort to any theory to not
                 take care of her. just because
                 you've read some books...
                               peter
                 can you believe what he just
                 said to me... i read those books
                 bec...
                               jack
                 it's not your shift, anyway.
                 piss off, will ya?
                               michael
                 come on, guys, cool it! it's my
                 shift now.
                        (to jack)
                 i'll rock her for a few minutes...
                        (to peter)
                 ... and then i'll put her right to
                 bed. so off to work, both of you.
       he pushes them both out.
