91   ext. east river - evening                                   91
     a broadly smiling jack arrives at the riverside. paul
     is sitting on a bench. when he sees jack, he gets up
     and comes to greet him, smiling and extending his hand.
     without warning, jack suddenly jumps him and  sends him
     with a forceful shove flying into the water.   paul lands
     on his back with a big splash, and comes back  up to the
     surface totally dumbfounded. jack leans over   the water
     and yells at him, like a madman, still a bit  drunk.
                             jack
               that was for your 'little' package,
               and consider yourself lucky i
               didn't turn you in to the cops!
               and get one thing into your thick
               skull: i have never touched dope,

                                                                   83.

               and i never will. you and your
               shit-dealing, you can go straight
               to hell, and you can take the
               money you make from it and stick
               it up your ass! so long.

     jack turns his back on paul and staggers off.
                             paul
               hey, come back! -- how'm i gonna
               get out of here?
                             jack
               crawl.
