     peter is making a phone call.   he has mary in his arms.
     he's in a foul mood.
                             peter
               hello, natalie? it's peter.
               listen, i'm really screwed. jerry
               just called and we've run into a
               snag with the blueprints for the
               competition, it's an emergency.
               i've gotta go over to the office
               right away, i think it's gonna be
               an all-nighter... of course i
               didn't know about this yesterday --
               he just called me.
     mary reaches out and begins to jab the buttons on the
     phone. peter pulls her back.
                             peter
               hello? hello?... no, i'm not
               trying to hang up on you. we're
               having some problems with the
               phone, that's all... no, natalie,
               there's no one else here! you're
               the only woman i... i swear i'm
               not lying to you... what? you're
               going to call carl?
                      (furious)

               want. i don't give a shit... of
               course i'm not jealous. what
