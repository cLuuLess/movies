18   int. safeway - day                                         18
     in the baby food aisle there are now five women arguing.
     peter, his arms still laden with cans, looks uncomfort-
     able.
                             woman #2
               this guy doesn't even know how old
               his baby is and you don't find
               that strange?
                             woman #1
               this guy asked for advice,   i'm
               giving him advice, okay?    if you're
               so paranoid, why don't you   run
               home and chain your kid to   his
               crib?
                             woman #2
               anyway, i think someone should call
               the cops.
                             woman #1

                                                                    33.

               the cops, the cops -- i bet you
               call the cops every time your
               cat pisses on the carpet.
     peter slips away.
