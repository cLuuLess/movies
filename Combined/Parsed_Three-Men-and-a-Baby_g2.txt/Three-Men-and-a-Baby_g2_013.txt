13   int. apartment - day                                         13
     michael is still in the hall holding mary very clumsily
     in his arms. he is anxious. he realizes she's soaked.
     this disgusts him. he holds her at arm's length; she
     squirms. he goes and gets a towel from the bathroom,
     spreads it out on the living room couch and lays the
     baby down on it. mary screams -- she much prefers
     michael's arms to the couch. a panicky michael picks her
     up again, grumbling.
                             michael
               okay, okay, don't cry like that...
               i'll hold you, i'll hold you.
     he tries rather unsuccessfully to wrap the towel around
     the child. obviously michael is very put off by the
     smell coming from mary.
