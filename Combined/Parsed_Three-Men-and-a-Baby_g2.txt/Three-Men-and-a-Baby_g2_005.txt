    in the kitchen peter is straightening up. michael joins
    him, dumping the ashes. peter begins washing the glasses.
                              peter
              where's jack?    did he leave?
                            michael
              no, he's cuddling up with a blonde
              named clementine...
                            peter
              that's not clementine. i saw him
              doing his famous routine with
              christie...

                                                            16.


                        michael
          no, it is clementine, the one with
          the tits this big...
                        peter
          christie's got tits that big,
          too...
                        michael
          yeah, but he was with christie at
          the beginning of the evening --
          after that he was with rosalie
          and then with clementine. and
          since i stole rosalie away from
          him... are you following this?

                          peter
          i'm not.
jack enters the kitchen in very high spirits, singing.
                        jack
          nice work if you can get it, and
          you can get it if you try... any
          scotch left?
                        peter
          yeah, here, i just put it away.
                        jack
          sorry i can't give you guys a
          hand, but i've got something
          cooking.
                        peter
          i thought you were leaving at
          dawn for south america?
                        jack
          i am, the night's still young!...
          it's gonna be a lively one. i'm
          gonna make us a little snack.
he makes up a tray with sandwiches.
                         michael
          so, who is it anyway -- christie
          or clementine?
                          jack
          maxine.    beautiful, enchanting
          maxine.
peter and michael look at one another surprised, mouthing
silently, "maxine?"

                                                                    17.

                            jack
              hey, michael -- how'd it go with
              rosalie?
                            michael
              well, things were going great
              until...
                            jack
              your old friend sophia appeared
              and dragged you into a thrilling
              conversation about modern art and
              in the meantime rosalie took off
              with someone else.
                            michael
              how did you know?
                            jack
              i dunno -- lucky guess...
                            michael
              well, i don't give a damn anyway,
              i have 24 drawings to hand in to
              my editor three days from now and
              i gotta work all night anyway...
              so it was all for the best. but
              you better not leave that maxine's
              phone number lying around because
              when i'm done...
                             jack
              don't worry, i'll leave you her
              phone number on the hall table.
              if she's really terrific i'll put
              a big 'x' next to it. 'bye, guys
              -- love ya. i won't wake you
              tomorrow morning. see you in
              three weeks...
