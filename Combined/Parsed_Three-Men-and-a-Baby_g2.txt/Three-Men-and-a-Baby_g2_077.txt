80   int. apartment - night                                      80
     peter and michael are seated in the living room, which is
     still an utter wreck. they can't take their eyes off the
     phone that's between the two of them.

     they are sitting silently, not moving.
     mary is playing in her basket.
     the phone rings.   peter and michael both jump three feet
     in the air.
     michael picks up the phone.
                             michael
               hello? who? goddamn it, where
               are you?...
                      (to peter)
               ... it's jack. he just landed in
               newark. he came back early.
                             peter
               gimme that.
                      (he grabs the receiver
                       out of michael's
                       hand)
               jack? what the hell are you
               doing?
                      (listens to a long
                       explanation)
               yeah... yeah... oh yeah? well,
               listen very carefully, jack.
               that wonderful, fantastic babe
               you brought back from bolivia?
               the one you're gonna marry
               tomorrow? well, you're not going
               to bring her here!... you are
               going to say 'goodbye' to her very
               nicely and put her in a cab back
               to bolivia... why? because there's
               another wonderful, fantastic babe
               waiting for you right here at home
               ... who is she? oh, that's a
               surprise! you'll see when you
               get here. but believe me, she's

                                                                    74.

                out of this world. you're going
                to be up all night with this babe.
                she's crazy about you.
                              michael
                       (in a low tone)
                make it quick, the punks may be
                trying to call...
                              peter
                so hurry home, jack, this little
                doll can't wait to see you. 'bye.
      he hangs up.
                              peter
                       (in a furious temper)
                that goddamn mother fuckin' jerk
                of an asshole! i swear when he
                comes through the door i'll kill
                him!  i'll...
      the phone interrupts.   michael leaps up and answers it.
                              michael
                hello? listen, tomorrow, central
                park at the fountain near the
                merry-go-round, five o'clock. be
                there, but...
      they've hung up on the other end.   michael hangs up
      and sits down, drained.
                              michael
                ... that was it.
                              peter
                       (equally drained)
                all we can do now is hope our
                plan works.
                              michael
                you think the cops have our phone
                bugged?
                              peter
                i don't think that's legal, is it?

      graton is speaking into the microphone of his radio.
      next to him sits a cop with phone-tapping equipment.
                              graton
                       (very excited)
