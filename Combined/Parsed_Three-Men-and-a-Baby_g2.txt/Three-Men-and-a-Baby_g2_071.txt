74   int. peter's room - day                             74
     peter is in bed, with the basket beside him. a narcotics
     agent is rummaging through his scattered belongings.
                             agent

                                                                     70.

               mess.

     peter gets up, takes the basket off the bed and keeps it
     in his hands. the agent searches the bed.
                             agent

               don't mind...

     he picks up mary with her huge diaper.   the agent
     searches the whole basket.
                             agent
               thank you very much, sorry about
               this...
     he goes out.   peter, undaunted, pats mary's big behind.
