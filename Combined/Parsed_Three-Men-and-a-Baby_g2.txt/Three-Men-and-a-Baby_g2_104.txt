1076   int. apartment - day                                  107
       it's noon, the sun is   shining brightly. michael is
       diapering mary on her   changing table. she's naked.
       he tickles her, bites   her toes, neck and ears; she
       bursts out laughing.    michael is totally gaga over her.

                                                                   100.

                               michael
                 coochie, coochie, coo... woo,
                 woo, woo... bippity, boppity
                 boo...
      peter comes rushing into the apartment and runs toward
      his room. he stops short in the corridor -- he hears
      mary's laughter and michael's coochie-coo's.
      noiselessly he tiptoes over to the living room door and
      listens, troubled. then he walks away and shouts, as
      though he were just coming out of his room.
                               peter
                 hi, michael, i just came back
                 to get a file i forgot...

      michael stops his baby-talk immediately, as though sud-
      denly paralyzed, embarrassed, guilty. peter enters the
      room.
                               peter
                 everything okay?
                               michael
                        (without looking
                         at him)
                 yeah, okay.
      silence.
                               peter
                        (not moving)
                 well, i guess i'll be going now.
                               michael
                        (not moving either)
                 yeah...
      they're both uneasy.
                                  peter
                 the baby okay?
                               michael
                        (not budging
                         an inch)
                 yeah, okay.
      peter exits.
