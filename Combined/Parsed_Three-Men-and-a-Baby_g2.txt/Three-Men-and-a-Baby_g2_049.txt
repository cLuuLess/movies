52   int. living room - dusk                                   52
     the living room is a total mess. a harrassed peter,
     lying on the floor, dreamily watches mary who is lying
     on her tummy in a sheet, playing with a squeaky rubber
     giraffe. they look at each other, as sober as judges.
