58   int. michael's room - day                               58
                             peter
                      (holding the package)
               what the hell is this?
                             michael
               well, a package, i guess.
                             peter
               was this package delivered to
               you?
                             michael
               yeah, why?
     peter raises his voice, exasperated by michael's calm
     attitude.
                             peter
               when the hell did this package
               arrive?
                             michael
               will you quit shouting!
                             peter
                      (screaming even
                       louder)
               when did this fucking package
               fucking arrive, michael?
                             michael
               i don't know... oh yeah, sunday --
               mrs. razzolini brought it up...
                             peter
               holy shit!
                             michael
               what's the matter?
                             peter
               this is the package those guys
               came for, not the baby, you
               asshole.
                             michael
               hey, asshole yourself!... oh shit!
     peter nods and begins to bark orders.
                             peter
               look out the window and see if
               you see them, i'm gonna try to

                                                                      51.

               catch up with them...
     michael runs to the window.
     peter runs like a madman through the apartment out the
     front door. he presses the button for the elevator.
     it's in use.
                              peter
               goddamit!
     he opens the door leading to the stairs and races down
     them, holding on to the bannister. he flies, overwhelmed
     by anxiety. suddenly he trips, loses his balance and
     makes a spectacular crash landing. the package gets a
     bit crushed, and little individual packets of white powder
     spill out of it. peter stares at them in horror.
                             peter
               what the hell is this?
     he picks up a few packets and examines them.
                             peter
               oh, god, no... dope!    that's all
               we need!
     he starts to tremble  with fear. he picks the packets up
     as fast as he can and  hastily puts them back into what's
     left of the package;  then shoves it all into his pocket
     and continues racing  down the stairs.
