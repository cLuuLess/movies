105   int. jack's room - night                                 105
      jack is sitting on his bed, wearing a dressing gown.
      he's got a sleeping mary in his arms. the basket is on
      the floor beside the bed. jack attempts to put mary back
      in her basket but she shudders and he immediately sits
      back down again and doesn't move. mary falls back asleep.
      jack looks at her skin, her hands. very gently, he
      kisses her forehead. mary smiles in her sleep.
