1   int. airplane - day                                        1
    on a chartered plane flying from miami to newark airport.
    jack is the captain. his copilot paul is seated beside
    him. in the passenger cabin, a female gymnastics team is
    celebrating a hard-won, glorious victory over the miami
    team. they are singing, dancing in the aisles and
    drinking champagne.

    in the rear of the cabin, there are three regular pass-
    engers: a teenager, his mother, and a man who appears to
    be a businessman.
    the plane is flying over the coastline.
    the partition between the cockpit and the passenger cabin
    is open. jack is very excited. he can't stop turning
    around to look at the passengers.
                             jack
                      (to paul)
               oh my god! i can't believe my
               eyes! look at these women! will
               you look at the gorgeous calves on
               them?! i'm telling you, give me
               an athlete any day... oh god!
               look at that redhead over there,
               and look at that one! christ,
               i hadn't noticed her.
                      (miming a heart
                       attack)
               paul, i've just fallen madly in
               love with the most beautiful
               woman in the world...
                             paul
                      (totally
                       uninterested)
               oh yeah? which one?
                             jack
                      (as though about
                       to keel over)
               the blonde over there, she's too
               gorgeous for words. just look at
               those eyes, look at those
               shoulders and the way she moves.
               i'm in love. here, take over,
               i'll be right back.

                                                          3.


jack gets up and paul takes his place at the controls.
jack makes his way up the aisle, through the girls who
are blocking the way, to the object of his affections.
she is sitting in one of the aisle seats and singing
her head off. jack leans over and whispers, quickly and
intensely, to her.
                         jack
          hello.   i'm the captain of this
          plane.   may i ask your name?
                        girl
          sure, my name is jane.    why?
                        jack
          listen, jane, i've seen many
          beautiful women in my life but i
          swear to you, i've never, ever
          met a woman as exquisite as you
          are.
jack kneels down before her, and the girl looks at him,
amused. he takes her hand and places it over his heart.
                        jack
          jane, can you feel my heart? it's
          pounding. this is horrible, i
          think i'm gonna faint. listen: i'm
          madly in love with you, i'm single
          and here's my phone number.
he hands her his business card.
                        jack
          i'm putting my fate in your hands.
          if you don't call me, you'll make
          me the most miserable man on earth.
          this is no line and i'm not trying
          to get you into bed. this is
          something completely different. i
          love you jane and if you call me i'll
          be the happiest man in the entire
          universe -- this is 'love at first
          sight.' out of all these beautiful
          women i noticed only you, and...
the girl laughs as jack goes on. meanwhile, the busi-
nessman who was seated in the rear of the plane has
gotten up and walked over to jack.
                          businessman
          are you paul?
                        jack
          no, i'm not.
                 (to jane)

                                                     4.

          my name's jack and i live in a
          fabulous apartment in manhattan
          overlooking the park and...
                        businessman
          but you're the pilot, aren't you?

                        jack
          yes, i'm the pilot...
                 (to jane)
          ... i'm not even asking for your
          phone number...
                        businessman
          isn't there a pilot whose name is
          paul?

                        jack
                 (annoyed)
          yeah, the copilot -- he's up
          front...
the businessman disappears in the direction of the
cockpit.
                         jack
                  (back to jane)
          i'm leaving it all up to you,
          jane, but if you do give me
          your phone number, then jane,
          then...
the businessman has reached the cockpit.
                        businessman
                 (in a low tone)
          are you paul?
                        paul
                 (turning around
                  nervously)
          yeah... are you jim?
                        businessman
          yeah.
he hands paul a man's purse.
                        businessman
          here's your cash.
                        paul
          what about the stuff?
                        businessman
          i don't have it. we've got
          problems. too much heat. too

                                                       5.

          risky. we think the cops are
          on to us.
                        paul
          whadda ya mean us?   you mean me?

                        businessman
          i mean shut up and listen. two
          guys will be waiting for you in
          a black t-bird, expecting the
          dope. just ignore them. it'll
          be delivered to you on sunday
          and picked up the following
          thursday, okay?
                        paul
          but i won't be home, i'll be in
          the air for two weeks.
                        businessman
          that's your problem. make
          arrangements, a deal's a deal.
          got it!?
                        paul
          got it.
jack returns.
                        jack
                 (bursting with
                  excitement)
          i got her phone number!   she gave
          me her phone number!
                        businessman
          that's some magnificent view,
          isn't it?
                        jack
          it's wonderful -- life is
          wonderful!
the businessman goes back to his seat and jack grabs
hold of the microphone.
                        jack
          this is your captain speaking. in
          honor of your victory, in honor of
          your beauty, and in honor of jane,
          the most beautiful gymnast i have
          ever met. i'm going to give you a
          little demonstration of aviation
          gymnastics -- reserved only for the
          most important guest, hip, hip...
everyone shouts "hooray!" except for paul and the

                                                                    6.

    businessman, who remain grim.
    jack dips the plane very low over the water and skims the
    cliffs along the coast. it is a beautiful, impressive
    stunt. there are gleeful shouts in the cabin among the
    passengers.
