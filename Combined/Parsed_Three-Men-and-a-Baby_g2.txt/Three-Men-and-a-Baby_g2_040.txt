40   int. michael's room - dusk                                   40
     michael and peter are in the doorway.    a stormy argument
     is going on.
                             michael
               oh no you're not, you're not gonna
               leave me alone with her.
                             peter
               i told you -- i have a date.
                             michael
               you rotten bastard -- do you see
               me going out on any dates?
                             peter
               look, it's with natalie -- i've
               been after her for months already.
                             michael
               so what! if you leave me alone
               with this kid, i swear i'll pack
               up and be outta here by morning.
                             peter
               you're a real drag, y'know?
               tonight was gonna be my big night!
               now i bet it's gonna be carl's big
               night.

                                                                      42.


     he exits, violently slamming the door behind him.
     michael sits back down, grumbling.
