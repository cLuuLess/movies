97   int. apartment - night                                   97
     jack comes in with the basket; he's in a vile mood.
     he's got a bottle ready in his hand.
     peter, who had been working in his room, rushes to the
     hall.
                             peter
               you're bringing her back?
                             jack
               yeah... she's starving. i gotta
               heat this bottle up right away.
     they go into the kitchen together. peter immediately
     gets busy; he heats the bottle up quickly while jack
     soothes the hungry mary by carrying her in his arms.
                             peter
               so what happened? did you two
               have a fight?
                             jack
                      (grim)
               goddamn cruises...
                             peter
               didn't she want to take her?
                             jack
               sure she did, but she was just
               leaving for some stupid cruise
               around the world. the entire
               fucking world! with some bimbo
               boyfriend of her's... and a bunch
               of retired bozos.
                              peter

                                                                     90.

               the apple doesn't fall far from
               the tree.
                               jack
               what?
