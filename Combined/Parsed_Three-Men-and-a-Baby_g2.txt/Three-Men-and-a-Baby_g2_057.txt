60   int. apartment - day                                      60

     the elevator doors open, peter and cop #2 exit.
                             peter
                      (key in hand)
               this is it. please come in...
               can i get you a cup of coffee or
               something?
                              cop #2
               no thanks.   i'll just wait out
               here.
     peter enters the apartment and calmly crosses through
     the house, carrying the basket.
     as soon as he's out of the cop's sight, he starts running
     like a madman down the corridor. he runs into michael
     who was just coming to meet him.
                             michael
               hey, what's happening? what
               were those cops doing...
     peter shuts him up, grabs him roughly under the arm and
     leads him into his room, closing the door behind them.
     peter speaks softly but he's totally freaking out, he
     can hardly breathe.
                              peter
               michael... michael... we're in
               deep trouble. the package...
               the package...
                               michael
               yeah?   what?
                             peter
               there's a cop on the doorstep...
               he didn't see you... he mustn't
               see you... we're in deep
               trouble, michael...
                             michael
               tell me what...
                              peter
               the package  they came for wasn't
               the baby, it  was dope, drugs, a
               shitload of  dope! we were stopped
               by some cops  down on the street.

                                                             57.


                       michael
         but did the cops see the dope?
                       peter
         no, it's right here.

he takes out the package.
                        michael
         shit!
                       peter
         we'll get twenty years if the
         cops find this on us! climb down
         the fire escape and hide it...
         anywhere!
michael takes the package, opens the window and starts to
climb out it when peter stops him.
                       peter
         hey, whatever you do,   don't lose
         the goddamn dope, we   gotta be
         able to return it to   those dealers
         or we're dead. those    guys are
         serious.
                        michael
         don't worry.
he starts down the fire escape, then stops and turns back.
                       michael
         oh, by the way, i put some water
         up to boil for her bottle.
michael disappears. peter picks up mary, grabs his  wal-
let and leaves the room. when he gets to the hall,  he
discovers that cop #1 has joined cop #2, to whom he is
whispering something. peter holds his license out  for
them to see.
                       peter
         here's my license.
                       cop #1
         i'm afraid i'm going to have to
         ask you to remain in the apartment.
         the narcotics squad will be
         arriving any moment now. they
         want to ask you a few questions.
                       peter
         narcotics squad? what do they
         want with me? i don't even use
         aspirin!

                                                                     58.
