9   int. architecture office - day                            9
    in the architecture firm of which peter is one of three
    partners. the whole staff, about 15 people in all, is
    gathered around a large model, the project for a big
    amusement park. they all seem worried about something.
    jerry, one of peter's partners, seems particularly angry.
                            jerry
              the model's not finished, the
              blueprints are a mess and you may
              as well forget the specs, they're
              a disaster! i know we're talented.
              i know we're good. then why is it
              we can never get organized? why
              is it we're always behind schedule?
                            jay
              look, jerry, architects since
              leonardo have always been behind
              schedule. it's a tradition, for

                                              19.

         god's sake.   why break with
         tradition?
                       jerry
         because this is the chance of a
         lifetime for our company, and
         there happens to be a deadline.
         there are millions of dollars
         at stake here. and our main
         competition had their project in
         three days ago!
                       peter
         yeah, but word around town is
         their project's a piece of
         shit!

                       jerry
         of course, it's a piece of shit,
         but it's a ready piece of shit.
                       jay
         we're just going to have to buckle
         down, that's all.
                       jerry
         you're damn right we are. starting
         now, everybody works around the
         clock! everybody! we have two
         weeks to be ready for the semi-
         final selection. and we will be
         ready. and we will win. you want
         to know why we'll win?
                       jay
         because we're gonna cheat.
                       peter
         i'll go bribe the judges!
                       jerry
         i don't think this is a joking
         matter, gentlemen.
                       peter
         come on, jerry...
a secretary enters.
                       secretary
         there's an urgent call for you,
         peter.
                        peter
         i'm not in.

                                                                       20.

                            secretary
              it's jack -- he says it's 'super
              important...'
     peter picks up the phone.

                            peter
              hi... yeah... listen, make it
              quick, i'm in a meeting here...
              yeah, a package... okay...
              someone'll drop it off sunday
              and pick it up thursday...
              no problem ... yeah... we'll
              put it aside, okay... no, no,
              we won't tell anybody about it...
              is that it?... right, we won't
              tell anyone... hey -- love 'n'
              kisses to the brazilian girls,
              vaya con dios, old buddy.
     peter hangs up, laughing.    jerry gives him a dirty look.
                               peter
              what?
