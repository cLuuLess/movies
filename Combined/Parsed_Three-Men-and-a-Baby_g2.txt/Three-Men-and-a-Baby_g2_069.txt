72   int. peter's room - night                                   72
     peter is in bed, completely out of it.
     michael is changing mary very carefully. he puts one
     diaper on her, then the second one, full of dope. he
     lays mary down in her basket, then places the basket on
     the bed, nestled between the wall and peter's body.
     michael, holding the soiled diaper, silently goes out.
     once he's alone, peter leans over the basket. mary and
     he stare at each other intently and seriously. peter
     switches off the light.
