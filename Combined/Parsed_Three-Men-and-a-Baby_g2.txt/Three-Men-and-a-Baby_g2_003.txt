3   int. apartment - night                                    3
    a large, stylishly decorated apartment in manhattan.
    a tremendous living room. a party's going on. very
    loud jazz is playing. the lights are dim. there are
    about 30 guests. lots of young pretty women. gourmet
    buffet. people are sitting on couches talking, others
    are eating, drinking or dancing. in a dimly-lit corner,
    jack is kneeling before a girl sitting in an armchair.
    she is laughing as she listens to him.
                             jack
                     (whispering
                      passionately)
              this is no line and i'm not
              trying to get you into bed. this
              is something completely different.
              this is 'love at first sight.'
              oh, i'm so happy... let me go get
              you a glass of champagne. i'll
              be right back.
    jack gets up and goes over to the buffet. as soon as
    he's out of the girl's line of sight, he starts running
    toward the other end of the apartment. on the way he
    passes michael, who's deeply engrossed in a vehement
    conversation about modern art with a girl called sophia.
    they're fighting like cats and dogs but seem to be enjoy-
    ing it.
                            sophia
              are you saying that's art, are
              you really saying that's art?
              well then you explain why.
                            michael
              it goes back to prehistoric man.
              they had comic strips on their
              walls, for god's sake.
                            jack
                     (whispering
                      in michael's
                      ear)
              i'm having a hard time.    i'm
              working on two at once.
                            michael
                     (very interested)
              oh yeah, who?
                            jack
              the brunette in the armchair in
              the living room -- her name's
              rosalie...
                             michael

                                                           9.

          and the other one?
                         jack
          clementine -- she's waiting for
          me in the den.

he moves away towards the den.
                         michael
                 (to sophia)
          wait one second for me, i'll
          be right back.
michael walks off in the direction of rosalie.
paul is wandering among the guests, trying to find jack,
he sees peter who is talking with another young woman,
nicole. peter is nodding, idly looking around, com-
pletely uninterested in the conversation.
                        nicole
          you guys have a beautiful place
          here. but the rent must be a
          killer.
peter isn't paying attention.
                        nicole
          isn't it a killer?
                           peter
          what?...
                           peter (cont'd)
          oh,    the rent... yeah, it's high
          but    split between the three of
          us    it isn't that bad, as long
          as    we don't eat.
nicole laughs.
                        paul
          hi peter, i'm looking for jack,
          have you seen him?
                        peter
          oh hi, paul, how are you doing?
          yeah, sure, i'll take you to
          jack.
                 (to nicole)
          excuse me for a minute.
they move away.
                        peter
          you're a lifesaver, i've been
          trying to get away from that woman

                                                          10.

         for 20 minutes. that sonofabitch
         carl is moving in on my natalie.
         gotta go... bye.
                       paul
         wait -- what about jack?

                       peter
                (in a hurry)
         he's around somewhere.     check
         under all the couches.
paul walks off in jack's direction. we stay with peter,
who reaches natalie. she is talking with a very styl-
ishly-dressed, tall, young man, carl.

                       peter
         oh natalie, i've been looking
         for you all night.
                       carl
         all night? i just saw you deep
         in conversation with nicole!
                       peter
         deep? hell no, we were just
         talking shop.
                       natalie
         oh come on peter, we all know
         what a ladies' man you are.
                      peter
         who, me? jack's the ladies' man,
         not me. you're the only lady i'm
         after.
                       carl
                (interrupting)
         so tell me, how's your project
         coming along? i heard you're not
         ready yet.
                       peter
         we've still got two weeks left
         before the semi-finals. we'll
         be ready.
                       carl
         we've been ready for three days
         now. we're gonna kick your ass.
                       natalie
         their project is really incredible.
                        peter
         oh really?   you've seen it?

                                                            11.


                        natalie
                 (smiling broadly
                  at carl)
          no, it's top secret but he's been
          telling me about it...

                        peter
                 (in a bad mood)
          ours is incredible too.
                        carl
          if you ever get it finished.
paul comes up to jack, who is kneeling before clementine,
whispering passionate sweet nothings in her ear. it
appears he's gotten beyond the "this is love at first
sight" stage. he's getting down to the nitty-gritty
now. clementine is thrilled. paul taps jack on the
shoulder.
                        paul
          jack, can i talk to you for a
          second?
                        jack
          oh, hi, paul, yeah sure...
                        jack (cont'd)
                 (to clementine)
          ... please darling, don't move...
          i'll be right back, okay? i'll
          bring us back some champagne...
he disappears with paul.
                        jack
          you're a lifesaver, paul. i
          thought i'd never get away.
          rosalie's waiting for me in the
          living room. isn't she
          terrific?
                            paul
          who?   rosalie?
                            jack
          clementine.
                        paul
          oh yeah, for sure, i dunno.
          listen, can you do me a favor?
with some difficulty, paul follows jack as he picks his
way through the people dancing, heading in rosalie's
direction.

                                     12.

              jack
yeah... what kind of favor?
damn, i've got to get her
a glass of champagne.
              paul
listen, i've got a little problem.
i'm having a valuable package
delivered to me on sunday, but i'm
not going to be home. i've got to
do the hawaii-tahiti-australia
route, so can i have the package
delivered here instead?
              jack
       (filling a glass
        with champagne)
yeah, sure, of course.
       (he stops,
        thinking)
no, wait, i'm leaving for south
america tomorrow. i'll be gone
for three weeks.
              jack (cont'd)
but it's okay. peter and michael
will be here. they'll take care
of it.
              paul
will you be sure to tell them
about it?
               jack
absolutely.   don't worry about
a thing.
              paul
it'll be delivered sunday and
picked up next thursday, okay?
              jack
delivered sunday picked up
thursday. got it. no problem.
              paul
this is a very delicate matter,
jack. it's very important they
don't tell anybody about this
package. it could be very... uh,
embarrassing for me, you know
what i'm saying?
             jack
sure. you got it.    i'll see you
later...

                                                                   13.

    jack is about to rejoin rosalie.     paul grabs his arm.
                            paul
              not to anyone at all.    tell
              them that, okay?

                            jack
              okay, sure, not to anyone at
              all... look, i'm sorry paul, but
              i gotta get back to rosalie. now
              go have a good time. i'll take
              care of everything.
                            paul
              bye and thanks a lot.

                            jack
              don't mention it.
    paul leaves.
    jack finally reaches the armchair where rosalie is
    sitting. he stops short, obviously disappointed.
                             jack
              uh-oh.   too late.
    michael is sitting next to rosalie, right next to her.
    they get up to dance. as he passes jack, michael
    smiles broadly.
                            michael
              all's fair, old buddy...
    jack watches a moment, then breaks into a wide smile.
                            jack
                     (singing)
              oh my darling, oh my darling,
              oh my darling clementine.
    jack whirls around and heads back towards clementine.
