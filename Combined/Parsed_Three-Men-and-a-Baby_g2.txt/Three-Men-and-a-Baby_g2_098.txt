101   int. living room - late afternoon                          101
                              mrs. bretsaws
                ... and as for screwing, i have
                all i need at home, thank you very
                much. with a few days off every
                month, i'm sure i'll be fine. the
                only thing i'm interested in is the
                care of the child and i can tell
                she needs some.

                                      93.


               peter
oh, yeah?   how do you figure that?
              mrs. bretsaws
shouldn't i be discussing all this
with the father?
              peter
well, listen, mrs. fretsaw, umm...
brainsore...
              mrs. bretsaws
bretsaws, mrs. bretsaws.
              peter
right... bratsnot, lemme tell
you something. with a child you
always know who the mother is,
but the father -- that's another
kettle of fish. so don't give me
that bullshit, okay?
              mrs. bretsaws
very well. i won't discuss it any
further with you. will you please
show me where the kitchen and the
bathroom are?
               peter
what for?
              mrs. bretsaws
so i can make you a list of the
things we need.
              peter
what do you mean, make you a list?
-- don't you do the shopping
yourself?
              mrs. bretsaws
no shopping or laundry or
housekeeping. i am a professional
nanny.
              peter
we have plenty of everything.
              mrs. bretsaws
do you have a sufficient amount
of fruit and vegetables for the
child?
              peter
she only eats milk and cereal.

                                        94.

              mrs. bretsaws
that's not enough, sir. from
the age of three months children
should be started on a normal,
varied diet.

              peter
oh that's bullshit. you don't
feed a baby like an adult.
              mrs. bretsaws
       (mockingly)
oh, really? and how would you
know?
              peter
i've read plenty of books. the
diet recommended by those quack
pediatricians today is way too
rich. i'm in favor of natural
methods, mrs. breathmint.
              mrs. bretsaws
bretsaws, mrs. bretsaws.
              peter
for instance, if a child is having
trouble getting to sleep, what
would you do?
              mrs. bretsaws
depends, if it was a continuing
problem, i might recommend a
mild sedative...
              peter
       (exploding,
        triumphantly)
i knew you'd say something like
that, you jerk!
              mrs.    bretsaws
fine. anything you     say, sir.
let me just remind    you that i have
my diploma and that    medicine is
a serious matter.
              peter
do you know the song that goes
'medicine's a whore and the
pharmacist is her pimp'?
              mrs. bretsaws
no, i don't. we must listen to
different music. personally i'm
very fond of opera.

                                                                    95.

                              peter
                mrs. breakballs, if you don't
                get out of here right this minute
                i'm gonna punch you in the nose!
                this is my home, now get out!

                              mrs. bretsaws
                the name's bretsaws. i am
                blessed with infinite patience
                when it comes to children, sir,
                but i'm not qualified to deal
                with lunatics. goodbye and
                good luck!
      mrs. bretsaws grabs her suitcase and exits, dignified
      and stiff as a broom, slamming the door behind her.
