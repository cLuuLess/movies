     now peter is surrounded by three women arguing: the
     store clerk standing with her arms crossed and haughtily
     looking down on everyone; an efficient, practical sort
     of young woman (woman #1); and another thin, pale woman
     whose baby is lying in a baby carrier in her shopping
     cart and who seems very nervous (woman #2).
                             woman #1
               does she have any teeth yet or
               not? that would give us a clue
               as to how old she is.
                             peter
               i haven't looked.

                             store clerk
                      (coolly disagree-
                       ing; to woman #1)
               my grandson's only five months old
               and he already has two teeth.
               but my daughter didn't have a
               single one at seven months -- so,
               y'know, how many teeth they have...
               doesn't mean a thing.
                              woman #2
               but didn't those friends of yours
               tell you what formula they usually
               give the baby?
                             peter
                      (embarrassed)
               no, actually they had to leave
               unexpectedly. they had to catch
               a plane...
                             woman #1
                      (to peter)
               is she teething?
                               peter
               teething?
                             woman #1
               does she drool? does she cry all
               night long? does she chew on her
               fists? does she put everything
               into her mouth?
     she acts out her words.
                             peter
               i know she can't talk.
                               woman #2

                                     29.

but didn't those friends of
yours tell you how old she was?
              peter
       (as woman #2 is
        starting to get on
        his nerves)
i told you they had to leave
unexpectedly.
              woman #1
or else you could weigh her; that
would tell you how old she is.
              store clerk
see, my five-month-old grandson
weighs more than my neighbor's
grandson and he's nine months old.
so, y'know, how much they weigh...
doesn't mean a thing.
              peter
so what about me? what should i
buy?
              woman #2
didn't they even tell you the
pediatrician's name?
               peter
        (still calm)
no.   they didn't.
              woman #2
you sure have weird friends.
              peter
you have no idea how weird.
              woman #1
or else her hair. does she have
lots of hair?
              store clerk
my grandson, y'know, he has so
much hair you can make a ponytail
with it! and i know some kids
who are totally bald at a year-
and-a-half. so, y'know, how much
hair they have... doesn't mean a
thing...
              woman #1
       (sarcastic)
gee, he's really something, your
grandson -- is he good at math
too?

                                                                    30.


     peter starts to pick cans off the shelf.
                             peter
               look, ladies, thanks for all the
               advice. but i think i'll just
               take one of each. to be on the
               safe side.
                             stock clerk
                      (to peter)
               don't forget -- if the baby's
               less than three months old, you
               have to be sure to sterilize the
               bottles.

     peter stops and turns back.
                                peter
               what bottles?
                                woman #2
               you know what?     this must be a
               kidnapping.
