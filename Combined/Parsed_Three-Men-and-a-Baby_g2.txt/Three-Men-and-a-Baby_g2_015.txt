15   int. apartment - day                                    15
     mary is screaming in michael's arms as he walks her up
     and down the whole apartment. now there are three towels
     wrapped around her. michael is exasperated. he angrily
     sings her a lullaby.
                             michael
               rock-a-bye baby on the tree top...
                             michael (cont'd)
               stop crying now; c'mon, stop...
               quit it, will you?... when the wind
               blows, the cradle will rock...
               what is that jerk doing? milking
               the cows or something?... when
               the bough breaks the cradle will
               fall...
     mary only screams louder.

                                                                     28.
