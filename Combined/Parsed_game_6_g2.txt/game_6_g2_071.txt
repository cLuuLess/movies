int. the barrymore

eople seating themselves in the orchestra.

noise from the tavern tv continues to be heard from the
subjective viewpoint of a man in the theater who has a
miniature tv and earphones.

steven schwimmer in an aisle seat in the orchestra. he sees
paisley sitting in the theatre some distance away.

house lights go down.

two figures hurrying down the aisle. an usher leading a young
woman. the woman is laurel rogan, nicky's daughter, wearing
her headset antennas.

laurel squeezes past some people and takes her seat, and
steven, sitting three rows back, watches her with interest.

the curtain comes open.
