int. steven schwimmer's loft

steven shaving. he does it symmetrically. a stroke under the
left sideburn; a stroke under the right sideburn. left side
of jaw; right side of jaw.

steven standing in his shorts, applying putty to his jaw to
make it square. then a false mustache and a wavy blond
hairpiece. then a thick bronze makeup paste.

steven in front of a full-length mirror near the bed, putting
on a bulletproof vest, which gives him a solid appearance,
bulking his caved-in chest and concealing his pot belly.

steven putting on black trousers, a brash shirt with a bright
bow tie, which he tips slightly askew. a pair of black and
white shoes with elevator heels. then his shoulder holster.

steven leaning over the coffee table, inserting bullets into
the chamber of the revolver.

with the gun in his holster, he stands in front of the
mirror. takes the gun out, aims it, puts it back in the
holster.

does a dazzling karate move.

steven putting on a metallic rayon sport coat. a long silk
scarf.

we see a handsome, dashing young man.

he puts on a pair of dark glasses and heads for the door.
