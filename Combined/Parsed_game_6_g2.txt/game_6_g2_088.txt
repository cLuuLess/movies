int. the barrymore

he theater is nearly emptied out. a few people still heading
toward the exits. laurel rogan remains seated, wearing her
headset, listening to the ball game. she is concentrating
deeply, fists clenched.

only one other person is still seated, three rows back. it is
steven and he is looking intently at laurel.

the house lights dim.
