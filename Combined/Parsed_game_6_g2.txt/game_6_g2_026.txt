int. restaurant - later - same table

the food has arrived. nicky is eating compulsively -- in
contrast to elliot, who sips his mineral water, dabs his
mouth with a napkin, looks around the restaurant between
bites. when nicky is finished with his food, he begins
picking among the items on elliot's plate. elliot uses his
fork to deflect nicky's fork and the two men have a brief
duel with utensils, fencing silently but intently, using
knives and spoons to vary action.
