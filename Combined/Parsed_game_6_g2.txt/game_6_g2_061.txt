int. the barber shop

nicky sits in the barber chair. elliot pulls up a customer's
chair and sits with his back to the mirror, more or less
facing nicky. the barber, an elderly hawk-eyed man named
dodgie, begins his preparations for nicky's haircut.

                         nicky
               he carries a gun.

                         elliot
               then you should carry a gun.

he places the sheet over nicky's upper body and fastens it at
the neck.

                         nicky
               i used to carry a gun when i drove
               a cab.

                         elliot
               where is it?

                         nicky
               i gave it away. i thought, i'm a
               writer now.

                         elliot
               that was a big mistake.

                         dodgie
               you should never be without a gun.
               in this city?

                         elliot
               if he carries a gun, you have to
               carry a gun.

                         nicky
               we're making too much of this.

                         elliot
               no, we're not.

                         nicky
               i'm not a lonely spooky writer like
               you. nursing a hundred grudges. i'm
               a man who loves life.

                         elliot
               we're talking about something
               deeper than grudges. how do we
               respond to personal attack?

                         dodgie
               in this city? and you don't carry a
               gun?

                         elliot
               how do we maintain our dignity and
               self-respect?

                         nicky
               in other words why should we suffer
               silently at this kind of abuse? the
               man is out there ruining lives.

                         elliot
               it's your best play, nicky.

                         nicky
               he'll hate it.

                         elliot
               he'll kill it. he'll write a review
               so devastating it will shatter your
               career and cause the most
               unmanageable psychic grief. what
               happens to your apartment on the
               east river? your house in
               connecticut, where you watch things
               grow.

dodgie goes to the cabinet on which the cash register sits.
he opens the cabinet door, slides out a drawer and removes
some hand towels. there is something there he wants nicky to
see. an old pockmarked revolver.

nicky sees the gun.

                         nicky
               we were thinking of putting in a
               pool.

                         elliot
                    (quoting)
               `the most interesting thing about
               elliot litvak is that he writes the
               way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and
               shifty-eyed.'
                    (beat)
               i'm telling you as a friend.

                         nicky
               what?

                         elliot
               there are things that speak to us
               from the past.

                         dodgie
               in this city you don't walk five
               feet out the door and there is
               somebody trying to take what's
               yours.

                         elliot
               your truth is locked in your past.
               find it. know it for what it is.
                    (beat)
               shoot him, nicky.

                         nicky
               shoot him.

                         elliot
               the american theater doesn't need
               people like that.

                         nicky
               shoot him, nicky. not that we
               really mean it. but where does he
               live?

                         elliot
               keep going west. last building
               before the river.

                         nicky
               how do you eknow.

                         elliot
               paisley porter.

                         nicky
               what do you mean?

                         elliot
               about an hour and a half ago. i saw
               her come out of a place. she said
               she was visiting a friend. but she
               wouldn't tell me who.

                         nicky
               had to be him.

                         elliot
               she was very evasive.

nicky gets out of the chair. dodgie removes the sheet for him
and elliot smooths down his clothes and hair, like a pair of
grooms attending a warrior.

nicky goes to the cabinet, gets the gun. he returns to the
chair.

                         nicky
               i'm enjoying this more every
               minute.

elliot takes an after-dinner candy out of his pocket -- the
candy he pocketed in the italian restaurant after lunch. he
blows the lint off and eats it.

                         dodgie
               how do you want the sideburns.

                         nicky
               elegant and refined.
