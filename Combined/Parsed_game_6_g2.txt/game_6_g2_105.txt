int. the loft

on the sofa, laurel is straddling steven, whose shirt is
almost completely off, exposing his bulletproof vest. laurel
is blouseless and barefoot, with her unzipped skirt still on
and her bra dangling from one shoulder.

                         laurel
               i have this thing where i have to
               know a person is being honest with
               me before, you know, i can feel
               completely free to be myself.

                         steven
               we're strangers in the night. the
               last thing we want is honesty.

                         laurel
               what do we want?

                         steven
               mystery. deception.

                         laurel
               deception isn't something i
               personally consider sexy.

                         steven
               what's sexy?

                         laurel
               knowing who a person is. down deep.

                         steven
               even if the truth about a person is
               sad or depressing or shocking?

                         laurel
               you won't even tell me your name.
               what's shocking about a name?

steven maneuvers himself into a sitting position so that he
and laurel face each other at equal height and at close
quarters. 

                         steven
               even if the truth requires a
               certain adjustment?

steven begins removing the cosmetic putty around his
naturally shallow chin. he uses laurel's hair clip to scrape
his jaw clean. then he peels off his fake mustache. and
borrows laurel's dangling bra cup to wipe the bronzing agent
off his face.
