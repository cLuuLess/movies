int. taxi

stalled between park and madison. the driver has opened the
door and is standing just outside the cab, trying to
determine the cause of delay.

                    (whispering)
               how is lillian? i haven't seen her.

                         nicky
               she wants a divorce.

                         elliot
               don't talk like that.

                         nicky
               it's over, finished and done with.

                         elliot
               that sounds so final. but are we
               really surprised?

                         nicky
               i'm completely stunned. i don't
               want this to happen.

                         elliot
               but didn't we know it would happen?

                         nicky
               don't needle me, elliot. tell me
               how bad you feel. we're suppose to
               feel bad together. this is what
               friends do.

                         elliot
                    (whispering)
               joanna bourne. so rich and crisp.
               this woman lets you touch her body?
               you put your hands on her personal
               parts?

nicky hits elliot -- a token blow to the arm. elliot thinks
about it, then hits back.

they swat each other, half kiddingly, each of them leaning
away from the other to prevent being hit in the face.
