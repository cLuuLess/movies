ext. shea stadium

crowds of people pouring down the ramps from the train
station, hurrying, late.

the umpire's room -- six men nibbling cookies, smoking a last-
minute cigarette, adjusting equipment.

an unidentified room somewhere in there lower reaches of the
stadium. twenty cases of great western champagne stacked and
ready for the postgame celebration.
