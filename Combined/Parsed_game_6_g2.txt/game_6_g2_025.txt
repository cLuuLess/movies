int. restaurant - later

a small narrow room. handsome wall paintings -- a tuscan hill
town. very slow day.

nicky and elliot sitting with a carafe of wine, a bottle of
mineral water and some bread sticks. glancing at menus
intermittently.

                         nicky
               i'm trying to think. when did you
               start looking so terrible? you look
               awful.

                         elliot
               i can tell you the year, the day,
               the night, the minute.

                         nicky
               you used to love life. you don't
               exude this any more.

                         elliot
               what do i exude?

                         nicky
               suffering. you exude a person who
               sits in a small dark apartment
               eating soft white bread.

                         elliot
               tonight you find out what it means
               to suffer.

                         nicky
               tonight. what's tonight?

                         elliot
               shit. they don't have any carrot
               soup.

                         nicky
               you mean because what's-his-name.

                         elliot
               you will suffer because he is in
               the theater. and you will suffer a
               thousandfold when his review
               appears.

                         nicky
               it's just a review.

                         elliot
               it is just a review. do not inhale.
               very dangerous.

                         nicky
               what's the fuss? i don't get it.

                         elliot
               that's what i said eighteen months
               ago.

                         nicky
               what happened eighteen months ago?

                         elliot
               before his broadway days. he
               reviewed the one-act i did at the
               fulton fish market. we did this
               play at four am, outdoors in the
               rain. one performance. for the fish
               handlers.

                         nicky
               and he was there?

                         elliot
               steven schwimmer. i memorized every
               word of this review.

                         nicky
               that's awful.

                         elliot
               i recite it to myself with
               masochistic relish.

                         nicky
               a year and a half later? you're
               still brooding?

a patron approaches the table and stares at nicky with a
fixed grin of crazed recognition.

                         man
               yessirree bob! yessisree bob!

nicky's jaw becomes set and he pours himself a glass of wine
as the man backs off.

                         elliot
               you don't know about obscure
               writers, nicky. how we have our
               anger to nurture and love. our
               murderous fantasies for any amount
               of fame, money , power and sex.

the waitress comes by. she is paisley porter, attractive, in
her mid-twenties.

                         paisley
               guys ready to order?

                         elliot
               paisley porter. i didn't know you
               were waiting tables.

                         paisley
               elliot?

                         elliot
                    (to nicky)
               this is a great young out-of-work
               actress.

                         paisley
               elliot litvak. have you been ill?
               and mr. rogan. how nice.

                         nicky
               what's good?

                         paisley
               we have a very nice pasta today.
               alla putanesca.

                         elliot
               say it again.

                         paisley
               alla puttanesca.

                         elliot
                    (to nicky)
               isn't she great? what did i tell
               you? a talent.
