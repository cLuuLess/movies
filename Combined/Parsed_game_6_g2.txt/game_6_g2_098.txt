int. manion's old timer tavern - the table

nicky watches as if in a trance. complete silence around him.
he is separate from everybody else, the only clearly defined
figure in a group of shadowy and indistinct people.

tv screen

nicky's viewpoint. an image of bill buckner in silvery light
expanding out of the tv screen to fill the larger
environment. moving soundlessly in slow motion, buckner
fields the bouncing ball and heads toward the bag. he beats
wilson to the base by an eyelash and the inning ends with the
teams tied at 5-5.

frozen moment: buckner holding his glove hand aloft, the ball
securely gripped. in the drama of the moment, buckner seems
to be crying out a word or name, but his face is twisted with
tension and exertion and we can't make out what he is saying.
