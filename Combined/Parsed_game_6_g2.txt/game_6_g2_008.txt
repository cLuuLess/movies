int. buchanan apartment - seconds later

nicky and joanna embracing with wordless abandon.

they are in the hallway clutching each other, stumbling. the
walls on either side are hung with expensive art.

they grapple past the living room. fleeting look at the
paintings by longo and fischl, a poster by the guerilla
girls.

the edge of the bedroom. nicky is crawling into the room and
joanna is hanging on to him, being dragged. they are fully
dressed except for one of joanna's shoes.

the bedroom. a lichtenstein, a hockney, a silk-screen of
joanna by andy warhol. a jeff koons piece. nicky and joanna
roll on the floor until they are halfway under the bed.
