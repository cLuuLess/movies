               two-all after six.

                         lillian
               i've been looking for you because i
               want to let you know what's been
               going on before you read about it
               in a gossip column.

                         nicky
               we stranded five runners in the
               first two innings. this will come
               back to haunt us.

                         lillian
               i want to be fair-minded, nicky.

                         nicky
               all right. what's been going on?

                         lillian
               i've been talking to a prominent
               divorce lawyer.

                         nicky
               how prominent?

                         lillian
               he has his own submarine. i'll be
               getting everything that matters.
               i'll get new york and i'll get
               connecticut.

happy roars from the bar crowd.

a young waiter arrives with menus.

                         nicky
               i'll have whatever she's having.

                         lillian
                    (to waiter)
               i don't want to be responsible for
               his food. just a small green salad.
               and a perrier.

                         nicky
               bring me the bay scallops with
               mercury poisoning.

                         waiter
               yessiree, bob.

                         nicky
               get the hell out of here. i don't
               want you bringing our food. send a
               real waiter.
