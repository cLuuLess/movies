ext. the barrymore theater

47th street between broadway and eight avenue.

nicky walking slowly backwards, arm raised, trying to hail a
cab. it is getting dark. he glances left, sees a large two-
panel poster in front of the theater. one half is a black-and-
white photo -- a younger nicky rogan, in a tuxedo, holding an
award in his raised hand.

the other half is all type --

                         sidewalks
               the new
                         nicky
               ogan

he sees someone enter the theater lobby. it is his daughter
laurel. he follows, catching up to her at the end of a short
line of people at the ticket window.

                         nicky
               laurel. tickets are all set. i
               double-checked.

                         laurel
               thanks, daddy. but i just need one.
               mother's not going.

                         nicky
               opening night?

                         laurel
               i know -- why should a bitter
               divorce interfere with tradition?

laurel reaches the window and speaks to the clerk.

                         laurel
               rogan, laurel. you also have a
               rogan, lillian. she won't need it.
               sell it.

                         nicky
               take it yourself. take a date.

                         laurel
               i don't have a date. i don't want a
               date.

they leave the window with laurel's ticket.

                         nicky
               and you blame me. it's because we
               never talk. let's talk.

                         laurel
               i have a class. i'm late.

                         nicky
               can we talk later? will you be at
               the party?

                         laurel
               i'm not sure.

she is out the door, hurrying across the street. nicky stands
under the marquee, calling out to her.

                         nicky
               i'll find you. after the show.
               somewhere.
