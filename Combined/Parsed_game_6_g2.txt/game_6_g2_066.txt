int. manion's old timer tavern

we see that the image is on a tv screen over the bar. the
place is crowded, a neighborhood tavern.

near the door: nicky embracing the owner, a beefy man named
georgie. people coming and going.

                         nicky
               georgie.

                         georgie
               nicky, god bless. you're well? your
               family's well? that's all that
               counts.

                         nicky
               are you absolutely sure?

                         georgie
               hey. i love this guy. be good. stay
               well. i'm serious: give my best to
               everybody.

they embrace.

faces lining the bar.

tv images from the game.

people at tables standing occasionally for a better look at
the game.
