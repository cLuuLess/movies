               i cleaned out the ashtrays
               religiously.

                         driver
               i am sitting here five years in
               traffic. it is one continuous
               traffic since i arrive. why must it
               be?

a taxi pulls up alongside. nicky notices the young woman in
the rear seat. it is his daughter laurel. he opens his
window.

                         nicky
               laurel, stay there.
                    (to his driver)
               keep the meter running. and try to
               stay abreast.

nicky leaves his taxi and gets into laurel's.
