int. the taxi - nicky and elliot

nicky is reading the newspaper. the driver is speaking
chinese into his two-way radio. squawky replies from the
dispatcher in machine gun chinese.

                         elliot
               the man has taken over my mind.
               he's not only out there. he's in my
               head and i can't get rid of him. i
               can't write a word without
               imagining his response. i'm
               paralyzed as an artist.

                         nicky
               i don't have the problems that
               artists have.

                         lliot
               you've been saying that for years.

                         nicky
               what?

                         elliot
                    (mockingly)
               `i'm just a professional. a dues-
               playing member of a guild.' because
               you're afraid, nicky. that's the
               darkest part of you. you don't
               think you're good enough.

nicky lowers the newspaper.
