               these wives named lillian. i used
               to say to her, `you don't kick a
               door once or twice and expect it to
               open. it's only in the movies a man
               can kick in a door with such
               amazing ease. because a real door
               requires a tremendous and prolonged
               pounding before it finally gives
               way.' he's a great player...how
               could that ball go through his
               legs?

nicky turns, steps back and kicks the door. it opens at once.
