int. michael rogan's living room

the room bears some resemblance to the living room set at
the barrymore. michael sits at the end of the sofa, weary.
nicky is taking an athletic bandage -- about four feet long
and three inches wide -- out of the package.

he sits in a chair that is set perpendicular to michael's end
of the sofa, so that nicky is looking at his father in
profile.

                         michael
               `why doesn't he come live with us?'
               because everything is here.

                         nicky
               i know, pop.

                         michael
               i'm lucky they don't knock down the
               building. it could happen anytime.
               and everything worth remembering is
               right here.

                         nicky
               i think the building's okay. at
               least for the time being.

                         michael
               you didn't think it was okay when
               you lived here. you wanted to get
               out so fast i thought you were
               running a marathon.

                         nicky
               normal boy's ambition. i like
               coming back. you know that.

                         michael
               you tell your friends your father
               used to work the docks. callused
               hands. but you had an attitude when
               you were growing up that wasn't
               easy for your mother and me to
               understand.

nicky is gradually unbuttoning his father's shirt so that he
can wrap the bandage around the old man's chest and back.

                         nicky
               i was in a hurry to do big things,
               make big mistakes. any mistakes
               were okay as long as it was big.
               but i'm trying to see these things
               clearly and honestly. that's the
               play they're going to kill starting
               tonight. there's a guy out there
               getting ready to rip it apart. and
               that's us. who we were and where we
               come from.

                         michael
               so what are you going to do about
               it?

                         nicky
               what do you want me to do?

                         michael
               show him who we are.

nicky takes off the shirt.

michael struggles out of his t-shirt and we see that he is
wearing the elastic bandage he thought he had lost.

he is sitting with his head tilted up, eyes closed, and is
unaware that he is wearing the bandage.

nicky takes the new bandage, winds it tightly and puts it
back in the box.

his father has gone to sleep.
