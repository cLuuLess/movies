int. steven schwimmer's loft

the port-o-san. steven emerges and goes to the stacked
cardboard boxes against the wall. his hate mail. he is
wearing a bath towel like a prayer shawl over his sweat
clothes.

he drags one of the boxes to the ratty armchair. he sits in
the chair by the filthy window that looks west toward the
early-setting sun.

he takes a letter from the box, opens it, reads it, lets it
fall to the floor. takes another letter, opens it --

there is a knock at the door.

steven tenses, does not move.

another knock.

he moves warily toward the door.

                         paisley (v.o.)
               steven, it's me. will you open
               please.

steven releases the dead-bolt lock and opens the door.

                         steven
               you've come to me. i wanted to
               believe you would one day.

                         paisley
               i haven't come to you.

                         steven
               but you're here. so you must have
               come to me.
