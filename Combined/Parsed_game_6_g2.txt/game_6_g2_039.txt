int. gotham book mart

nicky walks along the main aisle, looking at a woman standing
in the poetry nook.

only a few people in the shop.

he enters the back room and gets a glimpse of a woman walking
through the opposite doorway back into the main room.

he squeezes past a browser and looks through the doorway.
someone is just leaving the shop.

he walks to the rear of the store, where the office is
located. the door is open, the room is empty.

he re-enters the main room and sees a woman seated on the top
step of the stairway that leads to the basement stacks. her
back is to nicky and she is reading a book. he approaches
slowly and then squats by the doorway to get a closer look at
her.

she turns. it is paisley porter.
