     ext. campsite - sundown

     kelly, still in wet clothes, is talking on her portable phone.
     keough is there as hector approaches.  jack is approaching as
     well.  activity bustles in the b.g.

                         kelly
                    (into her phone)
               none of us actually saw anything.
                    (then)
               i realize this sir, but something
               flipped us over, i doubt very much
               it was a mink.

                         hector
               what's going on?

                         keough
               they don't believe her.

                         kelly
                    (still into phone)
               thank you, it's so rewarding to
               imagine my tax dollar finding its
               way to you, you fucker.
                    (she clicks off)

                         hector
               such the flirt.

                         kelly
               u.s. wildlife won't send anybody
               without a confirmation.

                         jack
               same thing from fish and game.

                         kelly
               something's in that water.

                         jack
               well until we see it, we're not
               gonna be convincing too many
               people.

     as deputy sharon gare approaches--

                         gare (o.s.)
                    (calling)
               sheriff.

     keough looks over.

                         gare
                    (pointing to the ground)
               you might want to see this.

     they all walk over.

     angle the ground

     there's hundreds, maybe a thousand worms squirming,
     surrounding... a human toe.

                         kelly (o.s.)
               oh god, worms.  i got a thing about
               worms.

     resume

                         gare
               it's a human toe.

     hector studies it, picks it up.  then--

                         hector
               some decomposition, little acidic,
               it has been swallowed.
                    (to keough; holding the
                     toe)
               is this the man who was killed?

     keough deadpans back.  then--

                         keough
               we'd only just met.

                         hector
               well, you've got a croc alright,
               they're keystone species.

                         keough
               keystone what?

                         hector
               species, keystones affect the
               entire ecosystem, that could
               explain all these worms, the water.
               you've got a crocodile.
                    (proffering the toe)
               bury your friend.

     hector gives the toe to keough, then heads off.  keough stands
     there, holding the tow, as we:

                                             dissolve to:
