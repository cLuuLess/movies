     ext. campsite - sunset

     burke's body is being loaded into an ambulance.  people move in
     silence, the wake of tragedy.  a few state troopers are on the
     scene.

                         keough
                    (giving a statement)
               nobody actually saw it.  it
               happened sudden.

     pan to find kelly, staring almost blankly, as jack, finishing a
     phone call, approaches.  he measures her expression, she's still
     in shock.

                         jack
               you okay?
                    (nothing)
               kelly?

                         kelly
               yeah.
                    (then)
               nobody saw anything?

                         jack
               no.
                    (then)
               u.s. wildlife is on their way.

                         kelly
               that's probably good.

                         jack
               police want to keep it quiet, if
               the press gets word... lake
               monster.  they just want us to sit
               tight.

     angle kelly

     she is visibly undone, she appears almost to be fighting off
     shock.  jack puts his hands on her shoulder to steady her.

                         jack
               are you okay?

                         kelly
               um... y'know...
                    (swallows)
               yeah.

     jack can see she's willing herself to be stoic.

                         jack
               a man died.  you don't have to be
               so tough.

     she nods, appreciatively.  part of her would love to collapse
     into him but a bigger part demands that she remain stoic.

                         kelly
               i'm fine.  i uh... i'm fine.

     pan to find keough, walking.  still visibly shaken.  he
     unwittingly approaches hector.  they hold a look.

                         hector
                    (genuine)
               i'm sorry.

     a beat.

                         hector (cont'd)
               was he a good man?

                         keough
               yup.

                         hector
               whenever somebody dies i consider
               it such a waste that i didn't know
               him better.

     a beat.  then--

                         keough
                    (fighting off disbelief;
                     shock maybe)
               his head was just... bitten off.

                         hector
                    (sadly)
               i used to have this recurring
               nightmare that i was headless.

     keough turns to stare at him with incredulity.

                         hector (cont'd)
                    (quietly rattling it off)
               i'd be on the ground looking up at
               my body, no head, walking around
               bumping into everything.  and my
               parents wouldn't let me in the
               house 'cause they'd just bought all
               these new antique lamps and they
               were afraid i'd knock them over,
               made sense, and meanwhile, the
               neighborhood bullies would see my
               round little head on the ground
               looking like a ball, and they'd
               come rushing over to start up a
               game of soccer.  i'd actually feel
               grateful just for being allowed
               into the contest, that's esteem for
               you, what are your thoughts?

     keough has had enough of this guy.

                         keough
                    (a powder keg)
               you know, hector, i'm sure you're
               a fine person in your own mental
               way.  but i think it would be best
               if you and i didn't speak.

     and keough heads off.  he takes about four steps... then snap.
     up goes his upside-down body like a rocket.  he's stepped in
     hector's spring-bow trap.  a beat.  he swings upside-down like
     a pendulum.  another beat.

                         hector
               this is a setback.

                         keough
               you don't want to cut me down.
               'cause i'll kill you.

                                             cut to:
