     ext. lake - continuous

     kelly, treading water.  find keough on the boat, he now has the
     engine running, fighting against the drag but whatever has that
     boat has a fucking strong hold.

                         keough
               cut the goddamn rope!

                         burke
                    (working away)
               i'm trying!

     and finally, as he severs the rope the boat almost goes airborne
     with a jump, burke nearly sails out.  keough's boat then races
     to kelly.

     angle kelly

                         kelly
               hurry up!!

     suddenly about thirty feet away... we see fish breaking water.

                         kelly (cont'd)
               shit!!  hank!!

     the boat is zooming toward her.  it arrives.  as keough and
     burke go to pull her aboard, we see a dark shadow rising.

                         burke
                    (screaming)
               look out!!

     and jack explodes out of the water, it was his shadow.  keough
     and burke pull them both aboard.

                         keough
                    (back to kelly)
               are you alright?

                         kelly
               i think.  my hair.
                    (then)
               where's hector?!
                    (to jack)
               where is he?

                         jack
               we went in different directions.
               that water is thick, you can't see
               through it!
