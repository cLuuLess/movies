                    (to hector)
               nice and slow.
                    (to the others)
               let's get ready.

     hector's chopper, cow dangling, is slowly approaching the shore.
     behind it... the snout and eyes of a giant croc.  back on the
     shore, keough's men ready themselves for action.  tranq guns.
     rifles... the team is mobilized.  we hear a distressed cry from
     the cow.

                         kelly
               he's mooing.

                         jack
               you wouldn't?

                         keough
               they're coming right in.

                         kelly
               such a simple idea and it's
               working.  what does that tell you?

                         keough
               that it's about to go wrong.

                         jack
                    (into walkie talkie)
               almost here, hector.  don't forget
               to lift up the cow.

                         hector (o.s.)
                    (sarcastic, through walkie
                     talkie)
               thank you, jack.

                         jack
                    (to the team)
               you shoot on my order.  if he
               charges, i'll be yelling "go" which
               means drivers take off.  and drive
               fast, they can move on land.
                    (to keough)
               you set?

                         keough
               don't worry about me.

     incredibly... the plan is working.  a giant dragon is following
     a dangled suspended cow to the shoreline.

     hector dangles the cow closer, they're now nearing shore.  the
     big crocodile, eyes on the prize, is moving in for the flank
     steak.  the time is now.
