     ext. hector's tent - night

     two deputies are digging deep pits about thirty feet in front of
     his tent.  from within we hear music, the sounds of a party.
     keough approaches... looks at deputy burke, who's digging.

                         burke
                    (shrugs)
               he paid us.  five hundred.

     keough continues on toward the tent.
