     ext. bickerman's house - an hour later

     we hear the chopper.

                         bickerman
                    (to keough)
               i'll sue you.

                         keough
               go ahead.

     and up goes hector's chopper.  and... reveal connected to a long
     cable... a cow.  an airborne cow, dangling from the chopper.

                         bickerman
                    (to jack)
               you can't take a cow by eminent
               domain.

                         jack
               we won't let him get hurt, ma'am.

                         bickerman
               you're all fuckers.  vicious little
               fuckers.

     jack turns to kelly.

                         jack
               are we crazy?

                         kelly
               well...

                         jack
               we've got a cow hanging from a
               helicopter.

     she shrugs.

                         keough
               let's get back to camp.

                                             cut to:
