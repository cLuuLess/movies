     ext. beach - an hour later

     a crew, including vets, are working on the sedated croc, trying
     to free it from the wreckage.  find the paramedics with hector,
     on a stretcher.  jack, kelly, and keough are there.

                         paramedic
               we're gonna airvac him to portland.

                         kelly
               okay.
                    (to hector)
               that's where they're taking the
               croc, hector, they've got some big
               tank there.

                         hector
               he's gonna live?

                         kelly
               yeah.  thanks to you.

                         hector
               and hank.
                    (to keough)
               i know you weren't really trying to
               hit him.

                         keough
                    (gently)
               i was aiming for you.

     hector smiles.

                         hector
               thanks for the rescue.

     jack leans down.

                         jack
               you take care.

                         hector
               you talk to bickerman?

                         jack
               she didn't tell us about the other
               croc 'cause she was afraid we'd
               blow it's head off.

                         hector
               women's intuition.  are there
               anymore?

                         jack
               just those two.

                         paramedic
               we gotta take him.

                         jack
               okay.

                         paramedic
               we got room for one.

                         jack
               well... i got stuff to pack up
               and...

     he looks to kelly, but before she can say "yes"--

                         keough
                    (grudging)
               i'll go.

     hector smiles.  the paramedics board hector.  keough turns to
     jack.

                         keough
               thanks for your help.

                         jack
               you too.

     handshake.  respect.  that's about as much affection as you get
     from keough.  he then extends his hand to kelly.

                         kelly
               i'm sure this would offend you on
               principal but... could we keep in
               touch?

                         keough
               i guess.

     and she kisses him on the cheek.  keough fights off his blush,
     boards the chopper.  as it then lifts up, kelly turns to jack.

                         kelly
               well...

                         jack
               you wanna ride in my truck?

                         gare
                    (arriving)
               your truck is jammed.  should we
               take some stuff out?

                         kelly
               no, no, i'll be a while anyway.
               i'm gonna say goodbye to the lake.

                         jack
               you sure?  i don't mind...

                         kelly
               no, i actually want to stay for a
               little while.

     they hold a look.  then--

                         kelly (cont'd)
               i'll miss you most of all
               scarecrow.

     and she kisses his cheek.

                         jack
               if i'm ever in new york...

                         kelly
               yeah.

     they hold another look.

                         jack
               y'know, if we didn't live in
               separate worlds and...
                    (a beat)

                         kelly
               but we do.
                    (then)
               hey, we'll always have maine.

     he smiles.

                         jack
               it was... something meeting you.

                         kelly
               likewise.

     he kisses her hand.  holds a look.  heads off.
