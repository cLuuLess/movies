     int. bickerman house - day

     keough, kelly, and jack are questioning a slightly hostile mrs.
     bickerman.

                         bickerman
                    (indignant)
               i haven't broken any laws.

                         keough
                    (bordering on
                     condescension)
               oh, but you have, ma'am.  you lied
               to us, that could be obstruction of
               justice.  a man's been killed in
               part 'cause of your silence, i
               could make out a charge of reckless
               endangerment and i'm sure peta
               would be annoyed at how you treat
               your cows.

                         bickerman
               the reason i lied is if i'd told
               you the truth, you'd just hunt it
               down and kill it which seems to be
               exactly what you're doing.

                         kelly
               how long have you been feeding this
               thing?

                         bickerman
               about six years.  he first appeared
               in may of nineteen-ninety-one.
               bernie was out fishing and it
               followed him home.  so we threw him
               some scraps and well... he didn't
               seem to bother anybody.  he became
               kind of like a pet who lived in the
               wild.

                         jack
               he just appeared.  you have no idea
               how he arrived in this lake?

                         bickerman
               no.  do you?

                         keough
               ma'am.  your husband, bernie.  you
               didn't, by any chance, lead him to
               the lake blindfolded?

                         bickerman
                    (offended)
               no, i did not.
                    (then)
               the crocodile did kill him, though.
               but it was all... it was a mistake.

                         kelly
               a mistake.

                         bickerman
               one of our horses got loose two
               years ago, went to the lake to
               drink and... well the crocodile
               started coming in, bernie went to
               intercede and... it was all a
               terrible misunderstanding.
                    (then)
               if i reported it, they would've
               sent people to kill it.

     keough, kelly and jack can't quite believe what they're hearing.
     then--

                         keough
               ma'am, how could you not report
               this?  he puts human life at risk
               and--

                         bickerman
               nobody lives on this lake.  it's
               really his lake now.
