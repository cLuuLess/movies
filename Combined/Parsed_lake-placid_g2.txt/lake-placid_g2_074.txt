     ext. campsite - day

     jack and keough are there to meet kelly.

                         jack
               just heard from wildlife and
               florida fish and game.  they should
               be here by four.

                         kelly
               okay.

                         jack
               we might as well pack.

                         kelly
               good idea.

                         hector (o.s.)
               they'll kill him.

     they turn to see, hector is standing there.

                         hector
               they're not going to be able to
               snag him in pitmans.  tranq him in
               water, he drowns.

                         kelly
               they could try to tranq him on
               land.

                         hector
                    (knowing)
               they won't.  he's taken human life,
               the mission will be to put him
               down.

                         keough
               gee, that would really disappoint
               me.

                         hector
               forget about him being god, he's
               thirty feet long, he is a miracle
               of nature, who somehow made his way
               to maine.  this is a grand beast.
               a grand dragon.  an attempt should
               at least be made to capture him
               alive.

                         jack
               well, you can try talking them into
               that, if--

                         hector
               i have enough flaxedil with me to
               put him out.  and i think i know a
               way to--

                         jack
               forget it.

                         hector
               look.  i know i'm crazy, but when
               they come, they will kill it.  they
               have to, politically, he's too
               dangerous, if something were to go
               wrong... the odds are he will be
               destroyed,--

                 keough                    hector (cont'd)
        which is exactly          please, hank, let me finish
        what...                 i'm having a sane moment, this
                                  is a window.

                         hector (cont'd)
               if he were neutralized when they
               got here... they might consider
               saving him.

                         kelly
               and how would we neutralize him?

                         hector
               we lure him on land and pump him
               with the drugs.

                         jack
               no way.

                         hector
               jack.  we've all seen it.  he's
               probably a hundred and fifty years
               old, he's bigger than an elephant.

     hector's impassioned here, he's not fooling around.

                         jack
               so maybe wildlife will try to save
               him, they're more equipped to--

                         hector
               we both know what they'll do.

     silence.  admission by silence.  then--

                         jack
               even if we could tranq him-- how
               would we get him on land.

                         keough
               other than to eat us?

                         hector
               he follows anything that moves.
               you guys can be in the trucks with
               tranq guns.  if he charges, drive
               off, plus hank you've got your hand-
               held cannon.  we could do this with
               no safety risk.  if it works, we
               save a beast that should be saved.

     a beat.  they are sympathetic to the idea.

                         jack
               and again.  how would you get him
               on land?

                         hector
               that's actually the easy part.

                                             cut to:
