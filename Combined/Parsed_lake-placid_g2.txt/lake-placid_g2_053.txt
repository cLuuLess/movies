     ext.  lake (westside) - night

     the teenagers are now skinny-dipping, having a grand ol'
     flirtatious time.  as they splash and frolic and cop their
     feels, we angle... about fifty yards away.  two eyes pop above
     the surface... followed by the snout.  go to:

     the croc's p.o.v.

     six fresh delicious teenagers.  midnight buffet.

     resume

     the croc as he slowly starts to move.  the teenagers start to
     take turns, swinging on a rope from a branch which overhangs the
     shoreline.  as they laugh and yell, danny swings on a long
     rope... landing with a splash.  about ten feet from the croc,
     waiting stealth-like, his eyes barely above surface.  he could
     easily go for danny... but he somehow knows the service will get
     better.  as danny swims back to shore, janine takes hold of the
     rope.

                         janine
               here i come.  ready or not.

     and she swings away... a better swing than danny's... and she
     splashes down about five feet from the eyes.  again, the eyes
     don't move.  the teenagers cheer janine's record-setting swing
     as tom takes hold of the rope.

                         steve
               all or nothing, tom.

                         tom
               from the jaws of defeat...

     and he flies away.  it's a leap to die for.  as he splashes
     down... gulp.  like a seal grabbing a fish... and tommy has
     vanished.  the kids, cheering at the leap, stop cheering when
     tommy fails to resurface.  a beat.  they first think he's
     playing a joke.

                         steve
               ha ha.

     another beat.  still no sign of tommy.

                         janine
                    (still in the water)
               tommy?
                    (then)
               this isn't funny, tommy.

     and now they're concerned.  they all move down toward the shore.

                         steve
               tommy?

                         danny
               c'mon,  tommy.

     and now they're starting to panic.

                         janine
               where is he?

                         danny
                    (yelling)
               this isn't funny!!

     suddenly-- thrusting up out of the water.  the crocodile, tommy
     in its jaws.  bloodcurdling screams from all as we:

                                             cut to:
