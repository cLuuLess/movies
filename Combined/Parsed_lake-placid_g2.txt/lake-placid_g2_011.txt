     ext. new york city - day

     kelly and okubo emerge from the movie theater.

                         kelly
               what do you expect, mugging me from
               behind?

                         okubo
               i tapped you.

                         kelly
               well you shouldn't have.  how did
               you even know where i was.

                         okubo
                    (sarcastic)
               wild guess.

                         kelly
               i don't like to be scared, myra, i
               have a thing about fright, don't
               ever scare me.

                         okubo
               kevin told me you were upset.

                         kelly
               really?  i never realized he was so
               psychic, how could he detect that,
               did he tell you there's somebody
               else?

                         okubo
                    (sheepish)
               well... he didn't have to tell me
               that part.

     kelly freezes.  stares at her.  then:

                         kelly
               you?

                         okubo
               it started before you, kelly, i
               never would've--

                         kelly
               you?

                         okubo
               it was just a quick thing which we
               thought was over, and and...

                         kelly
               you and kevin.

                         okubo
               it wasn't suppose to happen, i
               don't know what to say...

     a beat.

                         kelly
               you don't know what to say, lucky
               for you action speaks louder than
               words.

                         okubo
               kelly--

                         kelly
               i'm not upset, myra, okay.  i just
               never thought of you as a y'know...

                         okubo
               backstabber?

                         kelly
                    (don't be silly)
               no.

                         okubo
               liar?

                         kelly
                    (c'mon)
               myra.

                         okubo
               shitbutt?

                         kelly
               i really... i should get back.

     and kelly peels off to go on her way.  bumps into a pedestrian.
     she then gives him an angry shove, under--

                         kelly (cont'd)
                    (to the pedestrian)
               don't fuck with me!

     and off she goes.  the pedestrian and okubo exchange a look.

                                             cut to:
