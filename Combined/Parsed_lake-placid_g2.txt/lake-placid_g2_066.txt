     ext. lake - continuous

     the chopper, free-floating, is drifting near a small cove.
     hector, in diving gear, is about to go into the water, as gare
     tries to dissuade.

                         gare
                    (getting panicked)
               c'mon hector.  i know you're crazy
               but you can't--

                         hector
               i need to see his habitat.

     as he drops in.

                         gare
               please.  i'll have sex with you,
               anything, but get out of the water.

                         hector
               he's not gonna hurt me.
