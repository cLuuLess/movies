     ext. beach - dusk

     the tents are down, everything's packed.  a couple trucks
     remain.  the croc is gone.  things are quiet.  kelly stands down
     by the water, staring out.

     her p.o.v.

     hypnotic beauty.  the lake doesn't even ripple.  she soaks it in
     as if she knows it may be a while before she ever gets close to
     this again.  she hears every bird.  including a distant loon.
     serenity has returned.  then suddenly... a stone goes skipping
     out, four, five, six skips.  kelly turns around.  jack stands
     there.  they hold a look.

                         jack
               i thought i should say goodbye to
               the lake too.

     he approaches.  takes her hand.

                         kelly
                    (weakly)
               different worlds, jack.

                         jack
               yeah, i thought about that as i was
               driving... and... i haven't found
               somebody in my world.  you found
               anyone in yours?

                         kelly
               no.

                         jack
               so i was thinking... maybe if i met
               anybody in my world who was good
               for you and if you know somebody in
               new york good for me, we could fix
               each other up.

                         kelly
               you think?

                         jack
               worth a try.  we don't wanna be
               alone forever, do we?

                         kelly
               probably not.

     they hold a look.  he kisses her softly.

                         jack
               that was... y'know if the guy asks
               me can she kiss, now i'll be able
               to tell him if you can.

                         kelly
               good thinking.

     and they kiss again, this one escalates a little.  they break.
     and then he holds her.  tightly as the camera pulls up to an
     aerial view of them, embracing at the water's edge.

                                             dissolve to:
