     ext. campsite - an hour later

     hector, keough, jack, and kelly, looking tired, trek toward
     their tents.

                         hector
               just spit him back out.  some shall
               live, some shall die, arbitrarily,
               sound like any higher power we
               know?

                         keough
                    (dismissive)
               he didn't eat the kid cause he'd
               just swallowed a bear.

                         hector
               sobek.  half man, half croc, oldest
               god--

                         keough
               i'm tired, hector.  i know this
               because you're beginning to not bug
               me.

                         hector
               that sounds good but underneath
               it's hurtful.
                    (then)
               nightcap?

                         keough
               raincheck.

     they're growing on each other.  jack and kelly exchange a smile.
     hector and keough are developing an odd kinship almost.  they
     continue on as jack and kelly stop at her tent.

                         jack
               well.  goodnight.

                         kelly
               we seem to say goodnight a lot.

                         jack
               we could not say it and...
                    (suddenly a coward)
               well, that thing is ambulatory if
               you want somebody in your tent
               to...

     she smiles.  then:

                         kelly
               night.

     he holds another look.  she goes into her tent.  he stands
     there.  a beat.  waits to see if she calls him back.  she
     doesn't.  he then heads off.  her head pops out.  watches him
     go.  almost calls after him.  doesn't.
