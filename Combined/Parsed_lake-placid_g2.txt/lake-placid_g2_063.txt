     ext. shore - continuous

     kelly and jack are still working on the footprint.  physical
     proximity, which they're both a little distracted by.

                         kelly
               thing we can lift it?

                         jack
               maybe.  don't mush it.

                         kelly
                    (annoyed)
               i'm not mushing it.

                         jack
               you're mushing it a little around
               the--

                         kelly
               i'm not mushing it.

     suddenly another beaver scurries out from underfoot, scaring all
     of them, but particularly kelly who jumps.  her foot lands on a
     long extended branch, and even more suddenly burke's severed
     head seesaws out of the shallow water, hitting her in the shin.
     she screams as they all jump back.

     angle the head

     resume

     they just stare, as kelly continues to scream.

                         jack
                    (holding her)
               okay.  okay.  okay.

                         kelly
               that is it!!

                         jack
               really--

                         kelly
               no.  i keep getting hit with heads!

                         jack
                    (holding her shoulders)
               calm down.

                         kelly
               you calm down!

                         jack
               calm down.

     she takes a couple of calming breaths.

                         kelly
               i'm being very calm.  i'm composed.
               this is the second time i've been
               hit with a severed head, i'm
               entitled to complain.

                         stevens
                    (re the head)
               is that uh...

                         keough
               i can't recognize him from the
               back.  it looks like him.

     keough takes a stick.  squeamish, he tentatively pokes the head,
     trying to turn it over.

     angle the head

     it is burke.

     resume

     keough leans in for a closer look.

                         keough
               that's him.
                    (re something)
               what the...?

     something appears to be in his mouth.  keough takes a small
     twig, pries back a cheek... the mouth is full of worms.

                         keough (cont'd)
               now i'm gonna puke.

                         jack
                    (seeing something)
               you gotta be kidding.

                         kelly
               what?

                         jack
                    (pointing)
               look.

     about a hundred yards north, mrs. bickerman is leading a
     blindfolded cow to the water.

     resume

     kelly raises her binoculars.  so does jack.

                         kelly
               what is she doing now?
                    (then)
               mother of god.

                         keough
               what?

                         kelly
               look ten feet into the water.

     their p.o.v.

     there waiting... mouth fully open... is the fucking crocodile.

     resume

     kelly, jack, and keough, as they lower their scopes.  they look
     at each other, then back at the foregoing.
