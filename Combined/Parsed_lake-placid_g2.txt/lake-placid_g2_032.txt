     ext. lake - morning

     keough, kelly, hector, and deputy burke are cruising in the
     whaler.  hector and jack are both in full diving gear.  jack
     also has a stick gun for protection.  hector does not.

                         keough
               again, i don't mean to be annoying
               with my questions.  but if it is a
               crocodile which i don't think it
               is.  and if they do charge these
               baby hatchling sounds...
                    (to jack)
               why exactly would you want to be
               underwater at the time?
                    (to hector)
               with you it makes sense.

                         hector
               they don't really attack underwater
               and--

                         keough
               that "walt" guy got hit underwater--

                         hector
               no crocodile has ever--

                         kelly
                    (to hector)
               you should take a flax pole.

                         hector
               and what if i tranq him kelly?  he
               drowns.  you think about that?

                         kelly
               i'm just saying last resort.

                         keough
               again.  not to be disruptive.  do
               we have a problem with it dying?

                         hector
               crocodiles don't sever with their
               teeth, their molars are blunt.

     as if that's suppose to clear it up.  keough stares back
     blankly.  then:

                         keough
               is this a trick?

                         hector
               what i'm saying is if it's a
               crocodile that cut a man in half he
               would have to be over twenty feet
               which would make him well over a
               hundred years old, it would be
               unthinkable to destroy him.

                         jack
                    (to burke)
               alright, let's just drop here.

     burke lowers the anchor, as keough just continues to stare at
     hector.  kelly readies the hatchling recorder.  she lowers it
     into the water.

                         kelly
               they respond pretty quick.  i'll
               wait till you get down before i
               turn it on.

                         jack
               good.
                    (climbing over)
               see ya soon.

                         kelly
               good luck.

     there was a twinge of real concern in her voice.  he makes eye
     contact with her.  then drops over.  goes under.

                         hector
                    (to kelly)
               two years married, divorced, used
               to be a lawyer, quit, i'm still
               waiting on his sperm count.

                         kelly
               what?
                    (off hector's look)
               oh as if i'm interested.

                         hector
               as if.
                    (as he's about to go
                     overboard; to keough)
               will you miss me?

                         keough
                    (to hector)
               i brought a pork chop, maybe we
               could hang it around your neck for
               luck.

                         hector
               no thank you, but maybe later you
               can chew the bark off my big fat
               log.

     and hector drops overboard.

                         keough
                    (to kelly)
               was that like a homo-sexual remark?

                         kelly
                    (strict)
               i asked you to be nice to him.

     keough rolls his eyes.

                                             cut to:
