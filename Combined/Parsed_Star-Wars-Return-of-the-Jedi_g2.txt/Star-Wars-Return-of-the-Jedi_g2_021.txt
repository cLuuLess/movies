24   int barge observation deck

jabba the hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. his 
entire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time. 
leia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to 
her neck is pulled tight and jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to 
him.

jabba	 (in huttese subtitled)
soon you will learn to appreciate me.

threepio wanders among the sail barge aliens, bumping into a smaller 
droid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. the stubby 
droid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.

threepio
oh, i'm terribly sor... artoo! what are you doing here?

artoo beeps a quick reply.

threepio
well, i can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. 
they're going to execute master luke and, if we're not careful, us too!

artoo whistles a singsong response.

threepio
hmm.  i wish i had your confidence.
