66   ext scout campsite - forest

han, chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait 
anxiously in the clearing. artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed 
head and revolves, scanning the forest. he beeps.

threepio
oh, general solo, somebody's coming. oh!

han, chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.

luke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. he's 
too tired to care. he plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.

han
luke! where's leia?

luke	 (concerned)
what? she didn't come back?

han
i thought she was with you.

luke
we got separated.

luke and han exchange a silent, grim look. luke gets up wearily.

luke
hey, we better go look for her.

han nods, and signals to a rebel officer.

han
take the squad ahead.  we'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.

luke
come on, artoo.  we'll need your scanners.

luke, chewie, han, and the droids move off in one direction as the 
squad proceeds in another.

threepio
don't worry, master luke.  we know what to do.

they move off into the woods.

threepio	 (to artoo)
and you said it was pretty here. ugh!
