10   int boiler room

the door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy 
machinery. the guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are 
met by a tall, thin humanlike robot named ev-9d9. behind the robot can 
be seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work 
droid. a second power droid is upside down.  as smoking branding irons 
are pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized 
electronic scream. artoo and threepio cringe as the guard grunts to ev-
9d9.

ninedenine
ah, good. new acquisitions. you are a protocol droid, are you not?

threepio
i am see-threepio, human-cy...

ninedenine
yes or no will do.

threepio
oh. well, yes.

ninedenine
how many languages do you speak?

threepio
i am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can 
readily...

ninedenine
splendid! we have been without an interpreter since our master got 
angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.

threepio
disintegrated?

ninedenine	 (to a gamorrean guard)
guard! this protocol droid might be useful. fit him with a restraining 
bolt and take him back to his excellency's main audience chamber.

the guard shoves threepio toward the door.

threepio	 (disappearing)
artoo, don't leave me! ohhh!

artoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. then he beeps 
angrily.

ninedenine
you're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. i have 
need for you on the master's sail barge. and i think you'll fit in 
nicely.

the poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured 
electronic scream.
