115  ext forest

the battle rages on. stormtroopers fire on ewoks with sophisticated 
weapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the 
imperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs.

a walker marches through the undergrowth blasting ewoks as it goes. an 
ewok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. the 
logs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until 
it finally topples over with a great crash.

a scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. the other end 
of the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever-
tightening circles until it runs out of rope and
crashes into the trees with a huge explosion.

chewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. two ewoks 
cling to him. they land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine, 
then hang on for dear life. one of the ewoks peeks through the window.

walker pilot #1
look!

pilot #2
get him off of there!

the walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. he is yanked 
out and tossed overboard before he can scream. the two ewoks jump into 
the cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. the ewoks are 
thrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. outside, 
chewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch 
with a series of angry barks. the ewoks are too busy and frightened to 
listen to the wookiee's complaint. chewie slips inside the walker.

chewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at 
unsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other imperial walkers. the 
ewoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the 
battle in their favor.
