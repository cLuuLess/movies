5    ext road to jabba's palace - tatooine

a lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate tatooine 
terrain. we hear a familiar beeping and a distinctive reply before 
catching sight of artoo-detoo and see-threepio, making their way along 
the road toward the ominous palace of jabba the hutt.

threepio
of course i'm worried. and you should be, too. lando calrissian and 
poor chewbacca never returned from this awful place.

artoo whistles timidly.

threepio
don't be so sure. if i told you half the things i've heard about this 
jabba the hutt, you'd probably short-circuit.

the two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.

threepio
artoo, are you sure this is the right place? i better knock, i suppose.
