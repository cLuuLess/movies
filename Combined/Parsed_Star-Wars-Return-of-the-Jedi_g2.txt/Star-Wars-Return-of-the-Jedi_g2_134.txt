137  ext endor forest - night

luke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where his 
father's body lies, again dressed in black mask and helmet. he stands, 
watching sadly, as the flames leap higher to consume darth vader -- 
anakin skywalker.

in the sky above, fireworks explode and rebel fighters zoom above the 
forest.
