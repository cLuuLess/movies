130  int death star - main docking bay

chaos. for the first time, the death star is rocked by explosions as 
the rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over, unloading 
a heavy barrage. imperial troops run in all directions, confused and 
desperate to escape.

in the midst of this uproar, luke is trying to carry the enormous 
deadweight of his father's weakening body toward an imperial shuttle. 
finally, luke collapses from the strain. the explosions grow louder as 
vader draws him closer.

vader	 (a whisper)
luke, help me take this mask off.

lure
but you'll die.

vader
nothing can stop that now. just for once... let me look on you with my 
own eyes.

slowly, hesitantly, luke removes the mask from his father's face. there 
beneath the scars is an elderly man. his eyes do not focus. but the 
dying man smiles at the sight before him.

anakin	 (very weak)
now...go, my son. leave me.

luke
no. you're coming with me. i can't leave you here. i've got to save 
you.

anakin
you already have, luke. you were right about me. tell your sister...you 
were right.

luke
father...i won't leave you.

darth vader, anakin skywalker...luke's father, dies.

a huge explosion rocks the docking bay. slowly, luke rises and, half 
carrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a 
shuttle.
