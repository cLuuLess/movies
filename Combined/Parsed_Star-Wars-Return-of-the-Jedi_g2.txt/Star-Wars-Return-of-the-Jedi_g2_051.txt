54   int headquarters frigate - main docking bay

the millennium falcon rests beyond the stolen imperial shuttle, which 
looks anomalous among all the rebel ships in the vast docking bay. 
chewie barks a final farewell to lando and leads artoo and threepio up 
the shuttle, crowded now with the rebel strike team loading weapons and 
supplies. lando turns to face han. luke and leia have said their good-
byes and start up the ramp.

han
look. i want you to take her. i mean it. take her. you need all the 
help you can get. she's
the fastest ship in the fleet.

lando
all right, old buddy. you know, i know what she means to you. i'll take 
good care of her.
she-she won't get a scratch. all right?

han	 (looks at him warmly)
right. i got your promise now. not a scratch.

lando
look, would you get going, you pirate.

han and lando pause, then exchange salutes.

lando
good luck.

han
you, too.

han goes up the ramp. lando watches him go and then slowly turns away.
