artoo and threepio make it to the door, as han and leia provide cover 
fire.

threepio
we're coming!

han
come on! come on!

threepio
oh, artoo, hurry!

the little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. a 
large explosion hits near artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally 
landing on his feet. the stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and 
smoldering. suddenly there is a loud sprooing and han and leia turn 
around to see artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his 
appendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in 
his body. han rushes to the terminal, as threepio rushes to his wounded 
companion.

threepio
my goodness! artoo, why did you have to be so brave?

han
well, i suppose i could hotwire this thing.

leia
i'll cover you.

ewoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the 
stormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries.  one is hit in the 
wing with laser fire and crashes. a walker lumbers forward, shooting 
laser blasts at frantic ewoks running in all directions.  two ewoks are 
struck down by laser blasts.  one tries to awaken his friend, then 
realizes that he is dead.
