118  ext space - air battle

the two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each 
other in individual point-blank confrontations. a star destroyer 
explodes. the rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a 
series of minor explosions. the rebel cruiser manages to move in next 
to a second star destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the 
imperial star destroyer with it. the falcon and several fighters attack 
one of the larger imperial ships.
