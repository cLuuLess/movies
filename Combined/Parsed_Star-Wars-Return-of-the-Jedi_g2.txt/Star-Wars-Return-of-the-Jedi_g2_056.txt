han looks back at luke and leia as chewie flips several switches. 
through the viewscreen, the death star and the huge super star 
destroyer can be seen.

han
if they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty 
quick, chewie.

chewie growls his agreement.

controller	 (over radio)

han
shuttle tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.

controller	 (over radio)
shuttle tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.

han
transmission commencing.

leia and chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed 
transmission begins.

leia
now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.

han
it'll work. it'll work.

chewie whines nervously. luke stares at the huge super star destroyer 
that looms ever larger before them.

luke
vader's on that ship.

han
now don't get jittery, luke. there are a lot of command ships. keep 
your distance though, chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep 
your distance.

chewie barks a question.

han
i don't know.  fly casual.

luke
i'm endangering the mission. i shouldn't have come.

han
it's your imagination, kid. come on. let's keep a little optimism here.

chewie barks his worries as the super star destroyer grows larger out 
the window.
