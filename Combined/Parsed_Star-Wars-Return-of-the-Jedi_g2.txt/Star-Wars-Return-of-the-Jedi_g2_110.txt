113  int millennium falcon - cockpit

lando steers the falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating 
giants. he's been yelling into the comlink.

lando	 (desperately)
yes! i said closer! move as close as you can and engage those star 
destroyers at point-
blank range.

ackbar
at that close range, we won't last long against those star destroyers.

lando
we'll last longer then we will against that death star...and we might 
just take a few of
them with us.

the rebel cruisers move very close to the imperial star destroyers and 
begin to blast away at point-blank range. tiny fighters race across the 
giant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire.

the control tower of a star destroyer is under attack.

rebel pilot
she's gonna blow!

y-wing pilot
i'm hit!

the damaged y-wing plummets toward the star destroyer, and crashes into 
the control tower, exploding.
