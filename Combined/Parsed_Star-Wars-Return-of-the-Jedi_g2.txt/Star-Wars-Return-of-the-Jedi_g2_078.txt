81   int millennium falcon - cockpit

lando is in the pilot seat. his alien copilot, nien nunb, takes some 
getting used to in the familiar environs of the falcon's cockpit. lando 
speaks into his comlink.

lando
admiral, we're in position. all fighters accounted for.

ackbar 	(vo)
proceed with the countdown. all groups assume attack coordinates.

lando turns to his weird copilot.

lando
don't worry, my friends are down there. they'll have that shield down 
on time...
(to himself) 
or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.

the copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment.

ackbar	 (vo)
all craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.

lando
all right. stand by.

he pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak.
