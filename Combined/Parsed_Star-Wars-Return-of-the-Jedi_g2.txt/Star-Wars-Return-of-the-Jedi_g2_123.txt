126  ext/int - space battle - fighter and death star

rebel fighters follow the falcon across the surface of the death star 
to the unfinished portion, where they dive into the superstructure of 
the giant battle station, followed by many tie fighters.

wedge
i'm going in.

lando
here goes nothing.

three x-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed 
by the falcon and four other fighters, plus tie fighters who 
continually fire at the rebels. lights reflect off the pilot's faces as 
they race through the dark shaft.

lando
now lock onto the strongest power source. it should be the power 
generator.

wedge
form up. and stay alert. we could run out of space real fast.

the fighters and the falcon race through the tunnel, still pursued by 
the tie fighters. one of the x-wings is hit from behind and explodes.

lando
split up and head back to the surface. see if you can get a few of 
those tie fighters to
follow you.

pilot
copy, gold leader.

the rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the tie's, while lando and 
wedge continue through the main tunnel. it narrows, and the falcon 
scrapes the side dangerously. two other tie fighters continue to blast 
away at them.

lando
that was too close.

nien nunb agrees. the battle between the rebel and imperial fleet rages 
on. several cruisers fire at the giant super star destroyer.
