30   ext skiff - plank

luke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the 
bloodthirsty spectators. but, before anyone can even perceive what is 
happening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his 
fingertips. the plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him 
skyward. in midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of 
the plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. he 
casually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which artoo has 
sent arcing toward him, drops into his hand.

with samurai speed, luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded 
him off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. the 
other guards swarm toward luke. he wades into them, lightsaber 
flashing. lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff.
