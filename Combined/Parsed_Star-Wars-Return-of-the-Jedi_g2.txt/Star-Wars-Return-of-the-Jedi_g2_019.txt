22   int throne room

the crowd of creepy courtiers parts as han and chewie are brought into 
the throne room, and other guards drag luke up the steps.

luke
han!

han
luke!

luke
are you all right?

han
fine. together again, huh?

luke
wouldn't miss it.

han
how are we doing?

luke
the same as always.

han
that bad, huh? where's leia?

luke looks to leia.

leia
i'm here.

threepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes leia 
like a pet cat. several of the guards, including lando, bring luke from 
the other side of the room. boba is standing behind jabba.

threepio steps forward and translates for the captives.

threepio
oh, dear. his high exaltedness, the great jabba the hutt, has decreed 
that you are to be terminated immediately.

han
good, i hate long waits.

threepio
you will therefore be taken to the dune sea and cast into the pit of 
carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful sarlacc.

han	 (to luke)
doesn't sound so bad.

threepio
in his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as 
you are slowly digested over a thousand years.

han
on second thought, let's pass on that, huh?

chewie barks his agreement.

luke
you should have bargained, jabba. that's the last mistake you'll ever 
make.

jabba cackles evilly at this.

as the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer 
rises from the crowd. leia and chewie exchange concerned looks, but 
luke skywalker, jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.
