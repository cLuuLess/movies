64   ext forest clearing - campsite

the four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far 
from the two imperial scouts.

han
chewie and i will take care of this. you stay here.

luke
quietly, there might be more of them out there.

han	 (grins)
hey... it's me.

han and chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts. 
luke and leia exchange smiles.

han sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout 
whirls, knocking han into a tree. the scout shouts for his companion.

scout #1
go for help! go!

the second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but chewie 
gets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to 
crash into a tree. han and scout #1 are in a rousing fistfight.

luke	 (sarcastic)
great. come on.

luke starts for the scuffle, followed by leia with her laser pistol 
drawn. as they run through the bushes, leia stops and points to where 
two more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied 
bike parked nearby.

leia
over there! two more of them!

luke
i see them. wait, leia!

but leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. she 
starts it up and takes off as luke jumps on the bike behind her.

luke	 (pointing to the controls)
quick! jam their comlink. center switch!

luke and leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely 
avoiding two huge trees.

han
hey, wait! ahhh!

he flips the remaining scout to the ground.
