138  ext ewok village square - night

a huge bonfire is the centerpiece of a wild celebration. rebels and 
ewoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight, drums beating, singing, 
dancing, and laughing in the communal language of victory and 
liberation.

lando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by han and chewie. then, 
finally, luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and embrace him. 
they stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort in each other's 
touch, together to the end.

rebels and ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. the original 
group of adventurers watch from the sidelines. only luke seems 
distracted, alone in their midsts, his thoughts elsewhere.

he looks off to the side and sees three shimmering, smiling figures at 
the edge of the shadows: ben kenobi, yoda, and anakin skywalker.
