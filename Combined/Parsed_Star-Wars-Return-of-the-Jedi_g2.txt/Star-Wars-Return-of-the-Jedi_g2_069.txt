72   ext forest - series of shots

a procession of ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest. their 
prisoners - han, luke, chewie, and artoo - are tied to long poles and 
wrapped in vines, cocoonlike.

each pole is carried on the shoulders of several ewoks. behind the 
captives, threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by the 
remaining creatures.
