60   int vader's star destroyer - bridge

lord vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the death star. 
now, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn. after a moment 
of stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where admiral 
piett is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen 
earlier. piett straightens at vader's approach.

vader
where is that shuttle going?

piett	 (into comlink)
shuttle tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?

pilot voice    (han)   (filtered)
parts and technical crew for the forest moon.

the bridge commander looks to vader for a reaction.

vader
do they have a code clearance?

piett
it's an older code, sir, but it checks out. i was about to clear them.

vader looks upward, as he senses luke's presence.

piett
shall i hold them?

vader
no. leave them to me. i will deal with them myself.

piett	 (surprised)
as you wish, my lord.
(to controller)
carry on.

piett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink.
