12   int dungeon corridor and cell

gamorrean guards lead chewie down the same hallway we saw before. when 
a tentacle reaches out at the wookiee, chewie's ferocious roar echoes 
against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror. 
it takes all the guards to hurl chewie roughly into a cell, slamming 
the door behind him. chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the 
iron door.
