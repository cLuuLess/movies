76   ext ewok village - night

the walkway is deserted now. the windows of the little huts glow and 
flicker from the fires inside. the sounds of the forest fill the soft 
night air. luke has wandered away from the chief's hut and stands 
staring up at the death star. leia finds him like that.

leia
luke, what's wrong?

luke turns and looks at her a long moment.

luke
leia... do you remember your mother? your real mother?

leia
just a little bit. she died when i was very young.

luke
what do you remember?

leia
just...images, really. feelings.

luke
tell me.

leia
(a little surprised at his insistence)
she was very beautiful. kind, but...sad.
(looks up)
why are you asking me all this?

he looks away.

luke
i have no memory of my mother. i never knew her.

leia
luke, tell me. what's troubling you?

luke
vader is here...now, on this moon.

leia	 (alarmed)
how do you know?

luke
i felt his presence. he's come for me. he can feel when i'm near. 
that's why i have to go.
(facing her)
as long as i stay, i'm endangering the group and our mission here.
(beat)
i have to face him.

leia is distraught, confused.

leia
why?

luke moves close and his manner is gentle. and very calm.

luke
he's my father.

leia
your father?

luke
there's more. it won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. if i 
don't make it back, you're the only hope for the alliance.

leia is very disturbed by this. she moves away, as if to deny it.

leia
luke, don't talk that way. you have a power i--i don't understand and 
could never have.

luke
you're wrong, leia. you have that power too. in time you'll learn to 
use it as i have. the force is strong in my family. my father has 
it...i have it...and...my sister has it.

leia stares into his eyes. what she sees there frightens her. but she 
doesn't draw away. she begins to understand.

luke
yes. it's you leia.

leia
i know. somehow...i've always known.

luke
then you know why i have to face him.

leia
no! luke, run away, far away. if he can feel your presence, then leave 
this place. i wish i could go with you.

luke
no, you don't. you've always been strong.

leia
but, why must you confront him?

luke
because...there is good in him. i've felt it. he won't turn me over to 
the emperor. i can save him. i can turn him back to the good side. i 
have to try.

they hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.

leia holds back her tears as luke slowly lets her go and moves away. he 
disappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. leia, bathed 
in moonlight, watches him go as han comes out of the chief's hut and 
comes over to her. leia is crying, her body trembling. he realizes only 
now that she is crying.

han
hey, what's goin' on?

leia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.

leia
nothing. i - just want to be alone for a little while.

han	 (angry)
nothing?  come on, tell me.  what's goin' on?

she looks up at him, struggling to control herself.

leia
i...i can't tell you.

han	 (loses his temper)
did you tell luke? is that who you could tell?

leia
i...

han
ahhh...

he starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her.

han
i'm sorry.

leia
hold me.

han gathers her tightly in his protective embrace.
