84   ext bunker - entrance

paploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the imperial 
scouts are lounging. he silently swings his furry ball of a body onto 
one of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at 
random. suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a tremendous roar. 
paploo grins and continues flipping switches. the scouts leap up in 
surprise.
