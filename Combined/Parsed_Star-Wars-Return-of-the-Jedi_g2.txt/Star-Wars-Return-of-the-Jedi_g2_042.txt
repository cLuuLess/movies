luke is at the controls, with artoo attached behind him outside the 
canopy. luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the millennium 
falcon.

luke
i'll meet you back at the fleet.

leia	 (over comlink)

luke
i will.

han	 (over comlink)
hey, luke, thanks. thanks for comin' after me. now i owe you one.

a message from artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of 
luke. he smiles at the monitor and speaks to artoo, as he pulls a black 
glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.

luke
that's right, artoo. we're going to the dagobah system. i have a 
promise to keep... to an old friend.
