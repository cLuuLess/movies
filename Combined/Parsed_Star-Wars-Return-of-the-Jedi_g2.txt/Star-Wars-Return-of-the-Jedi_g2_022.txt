25   ext sarlacc pit 

the convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. the sail barge stops to one 
side of the depression, as does the escort skiff. but the prisoner's 
skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. at the bottom of 
the deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by 
thousands of needle-sharp teeth. this is the sarlacc. a plank is 
extended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. guards release luke's 
bonds and shove him out onto the plank above the sarlacc's mouth.
