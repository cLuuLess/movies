6    ext jabba's palace - gate 

threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly 
knocks on the iron door.

threepio	 (instantly) 
there doesn't seem to be anyone there. let's go back and tell master 
luke.

a small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical 
arm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects 
the two droids.

strange voice
tee chuta hhat yudd!

threepio
goodness gracious me!

 threepio points to artoo, then to himself.

 threepio
 artoo detoowha bo seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka jabba du hutt.

the eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the 
eye zips back into the door. the hatch slams shut. artoo beeps his 
concern.

threepio
i don't think they're going to let us in, artoo. we'd better go.

artoo beeps his reluctance as threepio turns to leave. suddenly the 
massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic screech. the 
robots turn back and face an endless black cavity. the droids look at 
one another, afraid to enter.

artoo starts forward into the gloom. threepio rushes after his stubby 
companion. the door lowers noisily behind them.

threepio 
artoo, wait. oh, dear! artoo. artoo, i really don't think we should 
rush into all this.

artoo continues down the corridor, with threepio following.

threepio
oh, artoo!  artoo, wait for me!
