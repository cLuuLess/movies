15   int dungeon cell

the heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open. a 
guard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door 
slams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack 
in the door. han is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is 
heard from the far side of the cell. he jumps back against the cell 
door and listens.

han
chewie? chewie, is that you?

the shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward han, lifting 
him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light, 
revealing chewie.

han
ah! chew--chewie!

the giant wookiee barks with glee.

han
wait. i can't see, pal. what's goin' on?

chewie barks an excited blue streak.

han
luke? luke's crazy. he can't even take care of himself, much less 
rescue anybody.

chewie barks a reply.

han
a...jedi knight? i--i'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets 
delusions of grandeur.

chewie growls insistently. he holds han to his chest and pets his head.

han
i'm all right, pal. i'm all right.
