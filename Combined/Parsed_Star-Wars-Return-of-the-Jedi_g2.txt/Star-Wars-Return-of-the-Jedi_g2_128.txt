131  ext death star

the millennium falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the immense 
superstructure of the half-built death star. the rebel star cruisers 
outside continually bombard the huge station. and each direct hit is 
answered by resonating, chain-reaction explosions within the station 
itself.
