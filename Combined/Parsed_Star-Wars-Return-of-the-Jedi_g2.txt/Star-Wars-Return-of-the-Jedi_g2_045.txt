48   int docking bay - death star

thousands of imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth 
docking bay. vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where 
the shuttle is coming to rest.

the shuttle's ramp lowers and the emperor's royal guards come out and 
create a lethal perimeter. the assembled troops move to rigid attention 
with a momentous snap.

then, in the huge silence which follows, the emperor appears. he is a 
rather small, shriveled old man. his bent frame slowly makes its way 
down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. he wears a hooded cloak 
similar to the one ben wears, except that it is black. the emperor's 
face is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow 
eyes. commander jerjerrod and darth vader kneel to him. the supreme 
ruler of the galaxy beckons to the dark lord.

emperor	 (to vader)
rise, my friend.

vader rises and falls in next to the emperor as he slowly makes his way 
along the rows of troops. jerjerrod and the other commanders stay 
kneeling until the supreme ruler and vader, followed by several 
imperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the 
procession.

vader
the death star will be completed on schedule.

emperor
you have done well, lord vader. and now i sense you wish to continue 
your search for young skywalker.

vader
yes, my master.

emperor
patience, my friend. in time he will seek you out. and when he does, 
you must bring him
before me. he has grown strong. only together can we turn him to the 
dark side of the
force.

vader
as you wish.

emperor
everything is proceeding as i have foreseen.

he laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of imperial 
troops.
