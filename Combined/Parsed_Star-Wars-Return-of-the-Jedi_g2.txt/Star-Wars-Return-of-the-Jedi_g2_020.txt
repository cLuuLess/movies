23   ext tatooine sea - skiff

jabba's huge sail barge moves above the desert surface accompanied by 
two smaller skiffs. one of the skiffs glides close, revealing luke, 
han, and chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is 
lando in disguise.

han
i think my eyes are getting better. instead of a big dark blur, i see a 
big light blur.

luke
there's nothing to see. i used to live here, you know.

han
you're gonna die here, you know. convenient.

luke
just stick close to chewie and lando. i've taken care of everything.

han
oh... great!
