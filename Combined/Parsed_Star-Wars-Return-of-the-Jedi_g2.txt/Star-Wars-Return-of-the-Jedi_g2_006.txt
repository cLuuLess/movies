7    int jabba's palace - hallway

the door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark 
passageway. the frightened robots are met by two giant, green gamorrean 
guards, who fall in behind them. threepio glances quickly back at the 
two lumbering brutes, then back to artoo. one guard grunts an order. 
artoo beeps nervously.

threepio
just you deliver master luke's message and get us out of here. oh my! 
oh! oh, no.

walking toward them out of the darkness is bib fortuna, a humanlike 
alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.

bib
die wanna wanga!

threepio
oh, my! die wanna wauaga. we -- we bring a message to your master, 
jabba the hutt.

artoo lets out a series of quick beeps.

threepio	 (cont)
...and a gift.
(thinks a moment, then to artoo)
gift, what gift?

bib shakes his head negatively.

bib
nee jabba no badda. me chaade su goodie.

bib holds out his hand toward artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit, 
letting out a protesting array of squeaks. threepio turns to the 
strange-looking alien.

threepio
he says that our instructions are to give it only to jabba himself.

bib thinks about this for a moment.

threepio
i'm terribly sorry. i'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort 
of things.

bib gestures for the droids to follow.

bib
nudd chaa.

the droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed 
by the two guards.

threepio
artoo, i have a bad feeling about this.
