the main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that 
landing platform. this
isn't gonna be easy.

han
hey, don't worry. chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily 
guarded than this.

wicket and paploo are chattering away in ewok language. they speak to 
threepio.

leia

threepio
he says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
