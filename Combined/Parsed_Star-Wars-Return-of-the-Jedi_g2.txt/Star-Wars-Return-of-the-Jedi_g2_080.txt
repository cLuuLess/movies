83   ext endor - ridge overlooking control bunker

han, leia, chewie, the droids, and their two ewok guides, wicket and 
paploo, have reunited with the rebel strike squad. the entire group is 
spread through the thick undergrowth. below them is the bunker that 
leads into the generator. four imperial scouts, their speeder bikes 
parked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. chewie growls an 
observation, and paploo chatters away to han in ewok language.

han
back door, huh? good idea.

wicket and paploo continue their ewok conversation.

han	 (cont)
it's only a few guards. this shouldn't be too much trouble.

leia
well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.

han	 (with self-confident grin)
then we'll do it real quiet-like.

threepio explains what is going on to wicket and paploo. the ewoks 
chatter a moment between themselves. then paploo jumps up and scampers 
into the underbrush.

threepio asks wicket where paploo went and is given a short reply.

threepio
oh! oh, my. uh, princess leia!

leia
quiet.

threepio
i'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.

leia
oh, no.
