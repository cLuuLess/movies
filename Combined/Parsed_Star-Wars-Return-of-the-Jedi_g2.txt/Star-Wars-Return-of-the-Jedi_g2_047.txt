50   int yoda's house

the tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of 
the cottage. our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that 
clutches it, and then to the familiar face of yoda, the jedi master. 
his manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker.

yoda
hmm. that face you make. look i so old to young eyes?

luke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his look 
has been woeful. caught, he tries to hide it.

luke
no... of course not.

yoda	 (tickled, chuckles)
i do, yes, i do!  sick have i become. old and weak. 
(points a crooked finger)
when nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. hmm?

yoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.

yoda
soon will i rest. yes, forever sleep. earned it, i have.

yoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.

luke
master yoda, you can't die.

yoda
strong am i with the force... but not that strong! twilight is upon me 
and soon night must fall. that is the way of things... the way of the 
force.

luke
but i need your help. i've come back to complete the training.

yoda
no more training do you require. already know you that which you need.

yoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.

luke
then i am a jedi?

yoda	 (shakes his head)
ohhh. not yet. one thing remains: vader. you must confront vader. then, 
only then, a jedi will you be. and confront him you will.

luke is in agony. he is silent for a long moment, screwing up his 
courage. finally he is able to ask.

luke
master yoda... is darth vader my father?

yoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. an odd, sad smile 
creases his face. he turns painfully on his side, away from luke.

yoda
mmm... rest i need. yes... rest.

luke watches him, each moment an eternity.

luke
yoda, i must know.

yoda
your father he is.

luke reacts as if cut.

yoda
told you, did he?

luke
yes.

a new look of concern crosses yoda's face.  he closes his eyes.

yoda
unexpected this is, and unfortunate...

luke
unfortunate that i know the truth?

yoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.

yoda		 (gathering all his strength)
no. unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your 
training. not
ready for the burden were you.

luke
well, i'm sorry.

yoda
remember, a jedi's strength flows from the force.  but beware.  anger, 
fear, aggression.
the dark side are they.  once you start down the dark path, forever 
will it dominate your
destiny.

he beckons the young jedi closer to him.

yoda
luke...luke...do not...do not underestimate the powers of the emperor, 
or suffer your father's fate, you will. luke, when gone am i
(cough),
the last of the jedi will you be. luke, the force runs strong in your 
family. pass on what you have learned, luke... 
(with great effort)
there is...another...sky...sky...walker.

he catches his breath. a shiver runs through the ancient green 
creature, and he dies. luke stares at his dead master as he disappears 
in front of his eyes.
