114  int emperor's tower - throne room

out of the window and on the view screens, the rebel fleet is being 
decimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. but in here there 
is no sound of battle. the emperor turns to luke.

emperor
your fleet has lost. and your friends on the endor moon will not 
survive. there is no escape, my young apprentice. the alliance will 
die...as will your friends.

luke's eyes are full of rage. vader watches him.

emperor
good. i can feel your anger. i am defenseless.  take your weapon! 
strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark 
side will be complete.

luke can resist no longer. the lightsaber flies into his hand. he 
ignites it in an instant and swings at the emperor. vader's lightsaber 
flashes into view, blocking luke's blow before it can reach the 
emperor. the two blades spark at contact. luke turns to fight his 
father.
