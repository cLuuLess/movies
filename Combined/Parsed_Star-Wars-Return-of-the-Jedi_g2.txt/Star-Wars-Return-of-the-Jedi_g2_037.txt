40   ext upper deck - sail barge

luke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by 
guards and fighting like a demon. leia emerges onto the deck as luke 
turns to face another guard.

luke	 (to leia)
get the gun! point it at the deck!

leia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels 
the gun around.

luke
point it at the deck!

a laser blast hits luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain, 
but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the 
guards. he looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. he 
flexes the hand; it still works.

near the rail of the upper deck, artoo and threepio steady themselves 
as threepio gets ready to jump. artoo beeps wildly.

threepio
artoo, where are we going? i couldn't possibly jump.

artoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself, 
tumbling toward the sand.

luke runs along the empty deck toward leia and the barge gun, which she 
has brought around to point down at the deck.

luke
come on!

luke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. he gathers 
leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. the gun 
explodes into the deck as luke and leia swing out toward the skiff.
