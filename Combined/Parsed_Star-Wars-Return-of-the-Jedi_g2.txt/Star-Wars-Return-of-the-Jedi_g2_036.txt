39   int sail barge - observation deck

leia is struggling against her chains in desperation as artoo zips 
through the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby 
little droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart.

leia
come on. we gotta get out of here quick.

artoo and leia race for the exit, passing threepio, who is kicking and 
screaming as salacious crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out 
one of the golden droid's eyes.

threepio
not my eyes! artoo, help! quickly, artoo. oh! ohhh! you beast!

artoo zips over and zaps salacious, sending him skyward with a scream, 
crashing into the rafters as artoo, leia, and threepio (with his eye 
dangling from a wire) hurry off.
