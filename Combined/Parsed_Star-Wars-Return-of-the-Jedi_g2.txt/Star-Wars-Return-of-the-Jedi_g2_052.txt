55   int imperial shuttle - cockpit

luke is working on a back control panel as han comes in and takes the 
pilot's seat. chewie, in the seat next to him, is trying to figure out 
all the imperial controls.

han
you got her warmed?

luke
yeah, she's comin' up.

chewie growls a complaint.

han
no. i don't think the empire had wookiees in mind when they designed 
her, chewie.

leia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near luke.

chewie barks and hits some switches. han's glance has stuck on 
something out the window: the millennium falcon. leia nudges him 
gently.

leia
hey, are you awake?

han
yeah, i just got a funny feeling. like i'm not gonna see her again.

chewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out at the 
falcon, too. leia puts a hand on han's shoulder.

leia	 (softly)
come on, general, let's move.

han snaps back to life.

han
right. chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. ready, 
everybody?

luke
all set.

threepio
here we go again.

han
all right, hang on.
