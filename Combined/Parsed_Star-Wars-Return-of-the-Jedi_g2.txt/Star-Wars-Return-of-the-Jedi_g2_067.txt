70   ext forest clearing - leia's crash site

han, luke, chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move 
through the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw leia. 
luke finds leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern.

han	 (os)
luke! luke!

luke runs with the helmet to where han has found the charred wreckage 
of a speeder bike in the grass.

threepio
oh, master luke.

luke
there's two more wrecked speeders back there. and i found this.

he tosses the helmet to han.

threepio
i'm afraid that artoo's sensors can find no trace of princess leia.

han	 (gravely)
i hope she's alright.

chewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off 
through the foliage.

                              han
what, chewie? what? chewie!

the others rush to keep up with the giant wookiee. as he scoots along, 
artoo whistles nervously.
