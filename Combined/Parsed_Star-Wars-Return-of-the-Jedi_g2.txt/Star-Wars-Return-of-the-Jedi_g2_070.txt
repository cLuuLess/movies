73   ext forest walkway - moon forest

the procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high in the 
giant trees. it stops at the end of the walkway, which drops off into 
nothingness. on the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts 
and rickety walkways, attached to the giant trees. the lead ewok takes 
hold of a long vine and swings across to the village square; the other 
ewoks follow suit.
