95   int millennium falcon - cockpit

lando looks worriedly at his alien copilot, nien nunb, who points to 
the control panel and talks to lando.

lando
we've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up 
or down. well, how
could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming.

lando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching death star as the 
implications of what he's just said sink in. he hits a switch on his 
comlink.

lando
break off the attack! the shield is still up.

red leader	 (vo)
i get no reading. are you sure?

lando
pull up! all craft pull up!

the falcon turns hard to the left. out the window the stars and the 
death star move off right.
