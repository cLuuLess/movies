91   int bunker - main control room

han, leia, chewie, and the rebel strike team storm through a door and 
enter the main control room, taking all of the personnel prisoner.

han
all right! up! move! come on! quickly! quickly, chewie.

the rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels. 
leia glances at one of the screens on the control panel.

leia
han! hurry! the fleet will be here any moment.

han
charges!  come on, come on!

outside, threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more 
controllers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards at 
the door.

threepio	 (to wicket)
oh, my! they'll be captured!

wicket chatters in ewok language, and then takes off full steam into 
the forest.

threepio
wa-wait! wait, come back! artoo, stay with me.

inside the bunker, han looks up from setting charges as an imperial 
commander enters.

commander
freeze! you rebel scum.

han and leia spin, to find dozens of imperial weapons trained on them 
and their cohorts. a poised force of imperial troops surround them. 
even more pour into the room, roughly disarming the rebel contingent. 
han, leia, and chewie exchange looks. they're helpless.
