16   int main gate and hall - jabba's palace

noisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding light 
and reveal the silhouetted figure of luke skywalker. he is clad in a 
robe similar to ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. luke 
strides purposefully into the hallway. two giant guards move to block 
luke's path. luke halts.

luke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately 
lower their spears and fall back. the young jedi lowers his hand and 
moves on down the hallway.

bib fortuna appears out of the gloom. he speaks to luke as they 
approach each other, but luke doesn't stop and bib must reverse his 
direction and hurry alongside the young jedi in order to carry on the 
conversation. several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness.

luke
i must speak with jabba.

bib answers in huttese, shaking his head in denial. luke stops and 
stares at bib; he raises his hand slightly.

luke
you will take me to jabba now!

bib turns in hypnotic response to luke's command, and luke follows him 
into the gloom.

luke
you serve your master well.

bib responds.

luke
and you will be rewarded.
