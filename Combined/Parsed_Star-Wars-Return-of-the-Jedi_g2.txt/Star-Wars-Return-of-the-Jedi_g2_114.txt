117  int emperor's tower - throne room

luke and vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even 
more vicious then the battle on bespin. but the young jedi has grown 
stronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. vader is 
forced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. luke 
stands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack.

emperor (laughing)
good.  use your aggressive feelings, boy!  let the hate flow through 
you.

luke looks momentarily toward the emperor, then back to vader, and 
realizes he is using the dark side. he steps back, turns off his 
lightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being.

vader
obi-wan has taught you well.

luke
i will not fight you, father.

vader walks back up the stairs to luke.

vader
you are unwise to lower your defenses.

vader attacks, forcing luke on the defensive. the young jedi leaps in 
an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. vader 
stands below him.

luke
your thoughts betray you, father. i feel the good in you...the 
conflict.

vader
there is no conflict.

luke
you couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and i don't believe 
you'll destroy me
now.

vader
you underestimate the power of the dark side. if you will not fight, 
then you will meet
your destiny.

vader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding 
the catwalk, then returns to vader's hand. luke tumbles to the ground 
in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the emperor's 
platform. vader moves to find him.

emperor	 (laughs)
good.  good.
