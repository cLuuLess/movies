38   ext upper deck

the deck gunners have chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in 
their gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention: 
luke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber. 
the deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young 
jedi has demolished them. immediately, luke turns to see two more 
gunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge) 
racing for him, firing their laser pistols.
