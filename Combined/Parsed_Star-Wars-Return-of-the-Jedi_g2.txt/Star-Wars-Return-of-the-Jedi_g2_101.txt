104  int emperor's tower - throne room

the emperor, vader, and a horrified luke watch the aerial battle 
fireworks out the window and on the viewscreens. another rebel ship 
explodes against the protective shield.

emperor
as you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. now 
witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle 
station.
(into comlink)
fire at will, commander.

luke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the death star to the 
rebel fleet beyond.
