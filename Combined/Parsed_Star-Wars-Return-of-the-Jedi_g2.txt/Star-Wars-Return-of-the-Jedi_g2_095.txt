98   int death star - emperor's throne room

through the round window behind the emperor's throne can be seen the 
distant flashes of the space battle in progress.

emperor
come, boy. see for yourself.

the emperor is sitting in his throne, with vader standing at his side. 
luke moves to look through a small section of the window.

emperor
from here you will witness the final destruction of the alliance, and 
the end of your insignificant rebellion.

luke is in torment. he glances at his lightsaber sitting on the armrest 
of the throne. the emperor watches him and smiles, touches the 
lightsaber.

emperor
you want this, don't you? the hate is swelling in you now. take your 
jedi weapon. use it. i am unarmed. strike me down with it. give in to 
your anger. with each passing moment, you make yourself more my 
servant.

vader watches luke in his agony.

luke
no!

emperor
it is unavoidable. it is your destiny. you, like your father, are now 
mine!
