116  ext forest - generator bunker

han works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to 
hotwire the door. he motions to leia, who is blasting away at some 
stormtroopers.

han
i think i got it. i got it!

the three wires spark as the connection is made. with a loud whoosh, a 
second blast door crashes down in front of the first.

han frowns and turns back to the wires again. leia exchanges shots with 
stormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her 
shoulder hit by a laser blast.

threepio
oh, princess leia, are you all right?

han
let's see.

leia
it's not bad.

stormtrooper	 (os)
freeze!

they freeze.

threepio
oh, dear.

stormtrooper
don't move!

leia holds her laser gun ready, behind han, out of view of the two 
stormtroopers moving toward them. han and leia's eyes lock; the moment 
seems suspended in time.

han
i love you.

another shared look between them, as she smiles up at han.

leia
i know.

stormtrooper
hands up! stand up!

han stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in leia's hand. she 
disposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. as han turns back toward 
leia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him, 
its deadly weapons aimed right at him.

han	 (to leia)
stay back.

the hatch on top of the walker opens and chewie sticks his head out and 
barks triumphantly.

han
chewie!  get down here!  she's wounded!  no, wait....  i got an idea.
