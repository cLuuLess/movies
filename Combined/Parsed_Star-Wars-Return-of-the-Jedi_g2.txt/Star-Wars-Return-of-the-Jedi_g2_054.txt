57   int emperor's throne room

the converted control room is dimly lit, except for a pool of light at 
the far end. there the emperor sits in an elaborate control chair 
before a large window which looks out across the half-completed death 
star to the giant green moon of endor.

darth vader, standing with other members of the imperial council, 
cautiously approaches his master. the ruler's back is to vader. after 
several tense moments, the emperor's chair rotates around to face him.

vader
what is thy bidding, my master?

emperor
send the fleet to the far side of endor. there it will stay until 
called for.

vader
what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust?

emperor
it is of no concern. soon the rebellion will be crushed and young 
skywalker will be one of us! your work here is finished, my friend. go 
out to the command ship and await my orders.

vader
yes, my master.

vader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the emperor walks 
toward the waiting council members.
