paploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. it's scary, 
but he loves it. when the imperial scouts pull within sight behind him 
and begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. as he rounds 
a tree, out of their sight, paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the 
trees. a moment later, the scouts tear under him in pursuit of the 
still-flying, unoccupied bike.
