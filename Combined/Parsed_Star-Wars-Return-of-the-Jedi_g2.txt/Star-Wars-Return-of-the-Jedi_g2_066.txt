69   int emperor's tower - throne room

two red imperial guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens 
to reveal vader. vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. it 
appears to be empty. his footsteps echo as he approaches the throne. he 
waits, absolutely still. the emperor sits with his back to the dark 
lord.

emperor
i told you to remain on the command ship.

vader
a small rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on endor.

emperor	 (no surprise)
yes, i know.

vader	 (after a beat)
my son is with them.

emperor	 (very cool)
are you sure?

vader
i have felt him, my master.

emperor
strange, that i have not. i wonder if your feelings on this matter are 
clear, lord
vader.

vader knows what is being asked.

vader
they are clear, my master.

emperor
then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for them.

vader	 (skeptical)
he will come to me?

emperor
i have foreseen it. his compassion for you will be his undoing. he will 
come to you and
then you will bring him before me.

vader	 (bows)
as you wish.

the dark lord strides out of the throne room.
