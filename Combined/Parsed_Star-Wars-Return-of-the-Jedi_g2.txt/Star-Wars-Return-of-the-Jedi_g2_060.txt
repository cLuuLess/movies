63   ext forest landing site - endor

the stolen imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's dark, 
primeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees.

on an adjacent hill, the helmeted rebel contingent makes its way up a 
steep trail. leia and han are slightly ahead of chewie and luke. the 
troops of the strike-team squad follow, with artoo and threepio 
bringing up the rear. artoo beeps.

up ahead, chewie and leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly 
to the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop. han and luke 
crawl up to take a look.

threepio
oh, i told you it was dangerous here.

their pov. not far below them, two imperial scouts are wandering 
through bushes in the valley below. their two rocket bikes are parked 
nearby.

leia
shall we try and go around?

han
it'll take time. this whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.

leia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, han, luke and chewie 
start quietly down.
