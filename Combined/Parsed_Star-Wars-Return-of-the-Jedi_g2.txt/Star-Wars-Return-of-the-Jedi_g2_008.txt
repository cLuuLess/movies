9    int dungeon corridor 

one of jabba's gamorrean guards marches artoo and threepio down a dank, 
shadowy passageway lined with holding cells. the cries of unspeakable 
creatures bounce off the cold stone walls. occasionally a repulsive arm 
or tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. artoo beeps 
pitifully.

threepio
what could possibly have come over master luke. is it something i did? 
he never expressed any unhappiness with my work. oh! oh! hold it! ohh!

a large tentacle wraps around threepio's neck. he manages to break 
free, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.
