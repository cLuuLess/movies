4    int death star - main docking bay

the death star commander, moff jerjerrod, a tall, confident technocrat, 
strides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp. 
the troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival. 
but the death star commander stands arrogantly tall.

the exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a whoosh, revealing only 
darkness. then, heavy footsteps and mechanical breathing. from this 
black void appears darth vader, lord of the sith. vader looks over the 
assemblage as he walks down the ramp.

jerjerrod
lord vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. we're honored by your 
presence.

vader
you may dispense with the pleasantries, commander. i'm here to put you 
back on
schedule.

the commander turns ashen and begins to shake.

jerjerrod
i assure you, lord vader, my men are working as fast as they can.

vader
perhaps i can find new ways to motivate them.

jerjerrod
i tell you, this station will be operational as planned.

vader
the emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.

jerjerrod
but he asks the impossible. i need more men.

vader
then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.

jerjerrod	 (aghast)
the emperor's coming here?

vader
that is correct, commander. and he is most displeased with your 
apparent lack of progress.

jerjerrod
we shall double our efforts.

vader
i hope so, commander, for your sake. the emperor is not as forgiving as 
i am.
