17   int jabba's throne room

jabba is asleep on his throne, with leia lying in front of him. 
salacious sits by jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. leia is now 
dressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a 
manacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, jabba the hutt. 
threepio stands behind jabba as bib comes up to the gangster slug.

threepio
at last! master luke's come to rescue me.

bib
master.

jabba awakens with a start and bib continues, in huttese.

bib
...luke skywalker, jedi knight.

jabba	 (in huttese subtitled)
i told you not to admit him.

luke
i must be allowed to speak.

bib	 (in huttese subtitled)
he must be allowed to speak.

jabba, furious, clobbers bib and shoves him away.

jabba	 (in huttese subtitled)
you weak-minded fool! he's using an old jedi mind trick.

luke stares hard at jabba.

luke
you will bring captain solo and the wookiee to me.

jabba	 (in huttese subtitled)
your mind powers will not work on me, boy.

luke
nevertheless, i'm taking captain solo and his friends. you can either 
profit by this... or be destroyed! it's your choice. but i warn you not 
to underestimate my powers.

jabba's laugh is mean and loud. threepio attempts to warn luke about 
the pit.

threepio
master luke, you're standing on...

jabba	 (in huttese subtitled)
there will be no bargain, young jedi. i shall enjoy watching you die.

luke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies 
into luke's hand. the bewildered guard grabs for it as jabba raises his 
hand.

jabba
bascka!

the floor suddenly drops away, sending luke and the hapless guard into 
the pit. the pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. jabba 
laughs and his courtiers join in. leia starts forward but is restrained 
by a human guard-- lando, recognizable behind his mask. she looks at 
him and he shakes his head "no."
