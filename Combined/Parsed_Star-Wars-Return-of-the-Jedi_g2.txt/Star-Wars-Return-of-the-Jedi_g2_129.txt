132  int millennium falcon - cockpit and gun ports

lando's crew fires away at the pursuing tie fighters as the dashing 
baron of bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main reactor 
shaft. it is awesome. a lone x-wing is just in front of the falcon.

there it is!

lando
all right, wedge. go for the power regulator on the north tower.

copy, gold leader. i'm already on my way out.

the x-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires several 
proton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series of small 
explosions.

the falcon heads for the main reactor, and when it is dangerously 
close, lando fires the missiles, which shoot out of the falcon with a 
powerful roar, and hit directly at the center of the main reactor.

he maneuvers the falcon out of the winding superstructure just ahead of 
the continuing chain of explosions.
