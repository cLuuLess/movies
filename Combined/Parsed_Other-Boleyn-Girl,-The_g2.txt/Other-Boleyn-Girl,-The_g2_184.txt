                           a
      anne faces the lords, as she makes her case..

                          anne
             my noble lords..the love i have for my
             brother is the love any sister would
             have for someone with whom she has grown
             up in the same house, nursed when sick,
             played games as children, shared life's
             celebrations.

      as anne delivers this speech, our camera slowly pulls back,
      back, towards the door..

                          anne
             that is the love i have for him. not
             what you suggest.

      our camera pulls out through the door...

      ..and into a corridor beyond, where we find henry hunched in
      shadows, eavesdropping, his face cast in shadows..

                          anne (v/o)
             judge me, my lords, as you see fit. but
             never forget that your verdicts will be
             judged again by god, in the greatest
             court of all..

      henry's face is a study of guilt. his knuckles whiten, his nails
      dig into his hands..

                          norfolk (v/o)
             my lords, the time has come to cast your
             vote.
