      mary continues to read the letter, as anne is forced to kneel by
      the executioner..

                          cromwell (v.o.)
             "but you risked your life coming to
             court and you are advised you not to do
             so again. you will not be shown the same
             clemency a second time. your sister anne
             was tried and found guilty, her crimes
             were high treason and she deserves to
             die. cromwell."

      mary, who is reading, looks up in horror..

                          mary
             no!

      anne looks up. she sees the look on mary's face.

      mary's eyes.

      anne's eyes.

      `whoosh', the masked executioner swings his sword. anne is
      beheaded. mary almost chokes..

      the crowd falls eerily silent. a stunned calm descends on tower
      green. nothing but the sound of the wind.

      mary sways, then falls backwards, having lost consciousness. she
      falls, falls..but is caught by a strong pair of arms..

      ..william stafford, who has followed her to london.

      suddenly the crowds burst into life. a great, bloodthirsty roar
      echoes around tower green as anne's head is lifted aloft..

                                                         (continued)

      william stafford carries mary in his arms. they walk against the
      flow, of teaming crowds, and newly-arriving families coming to
      watch the spectacle..

                                               slow fade to black:
