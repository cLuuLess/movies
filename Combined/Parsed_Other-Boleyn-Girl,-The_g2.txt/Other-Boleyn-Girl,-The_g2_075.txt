     sir thomas beams with excitement and satisfaction...

                         sir thomas
            you should have seen the seymours! their
            faces!

     mary lies in bed. sitting by her side is her father..

                         sir thomas
            they must have thought that with you out
            of the way, they had a real opportunity
            with that pale-faced thing of theirs,
            jane...

     sir thomas smiles as he remembers..

                         sir thomas (cont'd)
            but anne put pay to that. last night,
            the king only had eyes for us boleyns.

     mary shoots a private, knowing look..

                         mary
            or her, you mean.

                         sir thomas
            what?

                         mary
             'm wary of any suggestion that anne
            would serve anyone but herself. france
            can't have changed her that much.

                         sir thomas
             n this occasion i am quite satisfied
            she was being loyal to you.

                         mary
            really?

     mary stares hollow-eyed..

                         mary (cont'd)
            then ask yourself this. if she is really
            so concerned for my well-being...
                   (a beat)
                         (more)
