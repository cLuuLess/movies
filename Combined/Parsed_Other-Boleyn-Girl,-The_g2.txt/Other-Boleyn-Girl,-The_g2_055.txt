     george boleyn, visibly shocked and distressed, stands in front
     of his father.

                          eorge
            i beg you, father. no.

                         sir thomas
            she's well connected, her father is
            cousin to the king. and there's money,
            too.

                         george
            but must i actually...marry her?

     sir thomas's expression changes..

                         sir thomas
              thought you had ambitions for this
            family.      g
                          eorge
            i do.

                         sir thomas
            and that you wish to make a contribution
            yourself. not just stand back and watch
            your sisters.

      eorge nods..

                         sir thomas
            then my advice would be to start
            behaving like a man. a real man. do i
            make myself clear?

     sir thomas walks out. george stares after him..

                         george
                   (quiet)
            yes, sir.
