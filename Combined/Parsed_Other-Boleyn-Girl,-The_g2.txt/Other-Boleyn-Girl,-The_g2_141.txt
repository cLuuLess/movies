      mary is walking back to her apartments, when william stafford
      runs after her, appearing in the corridor behind her..

                            stafford
             wait! mary..

      stafford catches her up..

                          stafford
             i couldn't help overhearing. and before
             you agree to any of your sister's
             matches, let me just say..

      stafford takes a deep breath. his heart racing..

                          stafford
             ..i have saved money...not a lot...but
             enough. i've my eye on a place in the
             west...tatton...near where i grew up..

      mary turns, an incredulous look..

                            mary
              hat?
                    (surely this is a joke)
             stafford?

       tafford blurts it out..

                          stafford
             mary...i love you. there..i've said it.
             from the moment i joined your family..

                            mary
             wait..

      mary looks at him. a lightening flash of recognition. she's
      heard those words before, and puts two and two together..
                           m
                          mary
             it was you, wasn't it? at the masked
             ball?

                            stafford
             yes.

                          mary
             oh, stafford..

                          stafford
             mary..i have watched how your family has
             treated you.

                                                         (continued)

             betray you...or take you for granted..i
             would love you and cherish you to my
             dying day..

                          mary
             but it's impossible. you know that. now
             anne's queen, my family would never
             allow it.

                          stafford
             and you would care? what they think?
             after everything they have done to you?

       tafford stares incredulously. then goes.
