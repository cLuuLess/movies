     mary sits up. her eyes widen in horror..

                         mary
            why?

     sitting beside her in the darkness, is her brother george..

                         george
            i suppose they felt three years of exile
            was punishment enough.

                         mary
            but the king visits me every day.
            there's no need for her. or anyone else.

                         george
            they just want to protect you. leave
            nothing to chance.

                         mary
            but in who's interests do they imagine
            anne will act? certainly not mine.

     george turns, looks all around him..

                         george (cont'd)
            why do they make this room such a
            dungeon? does it really need to be this
            dark?

     george notices mary's vexed expression..

                         george
            don't worry. she's had three years to
            forgive you. and she's not going to risk
            being sent away again. she'll do as
            she's told, i'm sure.
                   (a beat)
            besides, the most important thing is..

     george moves mary's lips into an upward shape..

                         george
            the three of us will be together again.

     mary's lips: a reluctant, unconvincing smile..

                                                      fade to black:
