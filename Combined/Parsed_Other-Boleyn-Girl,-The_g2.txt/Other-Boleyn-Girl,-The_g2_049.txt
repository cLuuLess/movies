     a grand masque ball. we're in a spectacular candle-lit ballroom.
     musicians play. large formations of dancers perform elaborately
     choreographed moves. among them we pick out..

     sir thomas boleyn stalking the party. ever watchful. on duty.
     vigilant. he is distracted by the sight of...

     his son, george boleyn, surrounded by francis weston and his
     friends. george is clearly in his element. laughing in delight.
     very fond and intimate with francis weston..

     sir thomas looks concerned for the first time.

      n another corner, mary is in costume, but looking forlorn. she
     watches proceedings with a blank, distant expression. presently,
     a voice behind her..

                         masked man
            why look so glum, mary?

     mary turns to see a masked man behind her.

                         mary
            what reason have i to be happy?

                         masked man
             ou have two men, the king of england
            and i, both fighting for your love.

     the masked man is tall. his voice is quiet, but strong.

                         mary
            do i know you?

                         masked man
            you know me, mary - but not half as well
            as i know you. i know you better than
            anyone here. and love you better than
            anyone here, too. and if god had made me
            your husband instead of william carey,
            one thing i know..
                   (a beat)
            i would never have let you go.

     mary's smile fades..

                         mary
            wait! who are you?


                                                       (continued)

mary lunges for the man's mask to try and remove it, but the man
retreats into the safety of the shadows. meanwhile..

all around mary the crowds part, and a deep voice booms out.

                     asked man #2
       ah! who have we here?!?

mary turns to see a second masked man, (unmistakably the king),
surrounded by courtiers.
                     m
                    mary
       my name is kindness.

                      masked man #2
           wonder, will you be kind to me?

                    mary
       what is it you desire?

                    masked man #2
        our love, fair lady.

                    mary
       you demand a great deal.

                    masked man #2
       no more than i would give in return.

mary notices her father is among the masked courtiers. his eyes
giving mary cues..

                    mary
       it is easy for a man to declare love
       from behind a mask.

                     asked man #2
        ut if i remove it, you might reject me.

                    mary
       if your feelings were sincere, i would
       never reject you.

                    masked man #2
       but you do not know who i am? i could be
       ugly. or poor.

                    mary
        o matter how you looked. or who you
       were.

                    masked man #2
       really? then i shall hold you to your
       word. and unmask..!

with a flourish, the king rips off his mask..


                                                  (continued)

                         mary
            your majesty..!

     sir thomas urgently nods, `go on!' mary theatrically swoons.
     falling into the king's arms. a gasp among the courtiers..

                         henry
             he faints! quick! take her to my rooms!
            call my physicians..!

     sir thomas quickly picks mary up. he carries her through the
     crowds, out of the ball-room..

     queen katherine watches from a distance. a flicker of pain.
     then, with great dignity and pride, she turns back to watch the
     entertainment..
