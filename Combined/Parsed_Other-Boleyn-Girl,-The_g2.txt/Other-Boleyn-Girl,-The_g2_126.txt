      mary closes the door behind her. anne stares at her, then..

                          anne
                    (with difficulty)
             i am forever in your debt.

                          mary
             you owe me nothing, sister. i did it
             that we may finally draw a line beneath
             everything that has happened between us.

                          anne
              hen let it be exactly that. a new start
             between us. here at court.

      anne embraces mary, who stiffens.


                                                        (continued)

                          mary
             thank you. but i'd rather go back to our
             home in the country.

                          anne
             what? that damp old ruin? with no food?
             or warmth?
                     a beat)
             why don't you let your family look after
             you? your children would have the best
             of everything here. they would grow up
             safe and secure.

      mary stares, horrified. but before she can reply...

      the sound of a commotion, from outside. the sound of trumpets.
      the unmistakable noise of arriving soldiers.

       veryone rushes to a window. looks down to see a small army.

       t the centre of everything: an grand, old, bearded archbishop
      climbs down from an opulent carriage.

                           mary
              ho's that?

                          sir thomas
             the papal legate. sent by the pope to
             preside over the queen's trial.

      mary looks first at anne, then back out as the long procession
      dramatically enters the palace gates.

                          mary
             so, it's true. it's really happening?

      anne suddenly looks pale. vulnerable. frightened.

                          anne
             yes, it is. stay with me, please? i need
             my sister by me side.
