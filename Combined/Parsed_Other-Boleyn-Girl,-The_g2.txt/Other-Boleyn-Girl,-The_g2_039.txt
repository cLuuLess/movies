     int. mary's room - court - day
41                                                                41
     mary enters her room, and closes the door. she begins
     undressing, taking off her clothes, then catches sight of a dog
     in the shadows. she gasps. it's the king's dog.

                         henry (o.s.)
            please, don't be alarmed.

      enry steps out of the shadows..

     mary covers herself in modesty, and falls to her knees in a deep
     curtsey of deference. henry steps into the light, walks towards
     her..                h
                          enry
            i wanted to find somewhere we could be
            alone so i might say a few words to you
            in person.

      enry turns, looks around the room..

                         henry
            i hope your accommodation is
            comfortable. i realise it's no
            substitute for the life you had in mind
            in the country..
                   (a beat)
            but please, give me the opportunity to
            try to make you happy here..

            the moment i met you, i realised i..

     henry tails off as mary unbuttoning her dress..

                         henry
                   (tailing off)
            what are you..?

     mary's dress comes off her shoulder. the king's eyes, however,
     instead of staring at mary's beautiful, exposed body, stay
     focused on her eyes. an uncomfortable moment..

                         henry
            i am sorry.
                   (delicately putting her
                    clothes back on mary)
            you obviously misunderstand me.

     henry bows in respect, then turns, and takes his leave, leaving
     mary standing in the room..
