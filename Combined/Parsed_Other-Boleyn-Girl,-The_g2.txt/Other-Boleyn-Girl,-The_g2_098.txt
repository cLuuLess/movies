      int. mary's apartment - day
 00                                                               100
      mary looks up as anne enters, and freezes..

                          mary
             how can you show your face in here?

                          anne
             i understand you're angry - but be
             assured. i did nothing, except remind
             him of you.

                          mary
             oh, spare me. you did this deliberately.
             as revenge.
                    (a beat)
             and now you have what you wanted you
             probably think justice has been done.

                          anne
             well, hasn't it?

                          mary
             be careful, that's my advice. learn from
             my experience. because he'll only do to
             you what he has done to me.

                          anne
             never. i'll make sure he understands i'm
             a greater thing by far. that he can
             never have me until he makes me a far
             greater offer.




                                                        (continued)

      o




                                                                 68.


                          mary
             you'll never get henry percy back, if
             that's what you mean.

                          anne
             that's not what i mean.

      anne's eyes burn with anger..

                          anne
             and don't you ever mention his name to
             me again. i'll never forget how you
             betrayed me.

                          mary
             if that's what you think, fine. tell
             yourself that.

                          anne
             i did, sister. every day for three
             years.

      anne turns, and walks out.
