    the party afterwards. musicians play. the bride and groom,
    (william and mary), are dancing, surrounded by well-wishers and
    other guests..

                        william
           are you happy?

                         mary
           very.

                        william
           you don't secretly wish you'd married
           someone grander? with a title?

                        mary
           no. i want a husband who loves me. and
           who thinks it first thing every morning.
           and last thing at night.

                        william
           then you've found the right man.

    in another corner:

    anne is dancing with her brother george. she looks up to see the
    nobleman who was staring at her across the church..

                        anne
           who is that? he was staring at me in
           church?

                        george
           that's henry percy. heir to the duke of
           northumberland. richest landowner in
           england.

    anne's eyes widen in interest, "really?"




                                                      (continued)

          


                                                              4.


                        george
           but don't get your hopes up. he is
           already betrothed.

    george indicates a tall, haughty-looking fiancee beside percy..

                        anne
           betrothed is not married, brother
           george. a lot can happen before you
           reach the altar.

    anne stares over at henry percy. who stares back.


    in another corner:
6                                                                  6
     he duke of norfolk, the most powerful nobleman in the room, and
    close personal friend of the king's walks with his growling dogs
    to where sir thomas boleyn and lady elizabeth are sitting. sir
    thomas gets to his feet..

                         sir thomas
           thomas..

     he duke ignores thomas, and goes instead to his sister, (lady
    elizabeth), and kisses her..

                         norfolk
           i think i have managed to persuade the
           king to come and stay with you on
           progress. a week-end's hunting in late
           summer.

                        sir thomas
           but that's wonderful! thank you, thank
           you so much..
                  (he turns to elizabeth)
           did you hear that, elizabeth?

                        lady elizabeth
                  (hates the idea)
           yes.

                        sir thomas
           finally we can present george, and with
           luck, get him a position at court.

    lady elizabeth excuses herself, and leaves..

                        norfolk
           these are difficult times. i have it on
           good authority that the queen no longer
           bleeds - yet the matter of a male heir
           is still not resolved.
                   a beat)
           it cannot be long before the king is
           forced to look outside the marriage.

                                                        (continued)

       

                                                             5.


                        sir thomas
           what? and make a bastard king of
           england?

                        norfolk
           a legitimized bastard. what choice does
           he have?
                  (a beat)
           obviously, i've given it thought, and
           wondered which howard girl i could put
           under his nose. imagine the influence
           that would give us. to be blood family
           of the next king of england. equally,
           imagine if another family were to
           achieve the same?

    norfolk indicates sir john seymour in the corner, and his two
    loathsome, ambitious sons edward and thomas..

                        sir thomas
           what about anne?

    sir thomas turns, and indicates anne across the crowds, who's
    dancing with george...

                        sir thomas
           i realise as a `boleyn' she is not
           officially a `howard', but as your
           sister's daughter..

                        norfolk
           but she's your eldest, thomas. your
           first born. and your favourite. wouldn't
           you prefer her to have a nice,
           uncomplicated, respectable marriage?
           like mary?

                        sir thomas
           if anne were an uncomplicated,
           respectable girl like mary, then i'd say
           `yes'. but she's not.

    sir thomas looks out at anne..

                        sir thomas
           she's anything but.
