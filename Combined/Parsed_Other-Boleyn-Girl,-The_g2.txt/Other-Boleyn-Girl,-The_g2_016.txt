     music is being played. everyone is dressed in their finest, a
     packed banquet hall. musicians come to a climax, loud and
     enthusiastic applause from everyone. henry gets to his feet..

                         henry
            well played! and, may i say..
                   (a modest smile)
            ..an excellent choice of music too!

      nowing smiles from the courtiers, sir thomas and lady
     elizabeth, the duke of norfolk, etc..

                         henry
            sir thomas, lady elizabeth, dear anne.
            your health.
     h
      enry raises his glass. cheers and applause from the courtiers.
     a beaming sir thomas raises his glass.

                                                          cut to:

     later: dinner is served. everyone is eating. henry and several
     close courtiers are engaged in debate..

                         henry
            ..i had it from the lips of the spanish
            ambassador himself. that our musicians
            are the envy of all europe.

                         brandon
            ..then he was flattering you, your
            grace.

                         henry
            our universities and philosophers, too.

                    brandon
       ...another lie. that honour would have
       to go to the germans.

                    henry
       what of our painters, then?

                     randon
       years behind their italian counterparts.
       the truth is far from leading the world,
       we're a provincial outpost, lagging far
       behind.

                    henry
       what? is no one proud to be english?
              (turns to anne)
       anne? what say you?

anne gulps. the clanking of cutlery. all eyes on her.

                    anne
       me, my lord?
               clears throat)
       i know little of such matters, but i've
       not heard mention of our armies.
       undefeated, i believe, in a generation.

                     enry
       well said.

                    anne
       or our navy? the finest in the world.

                    henry
       it's true.

                    anne
       the universities in spain and the
       philosophers in germany may be strong,
       but are they really the equal of oxford
       and thomas more?

                    henry
       never!

                    anne
       i doubt there is a country that is
       fairer in government, or better
       protected by nature from her enemies,
       whose people are happier or more
       prosperous..

                    henry
       she's right, by god! she's right!

henry is delighted. sir thomas stares proudly across the room at
anne. who's hand, we notice, is shaking.

     her heart pounding in her chest.
