     mary is getting ready to leave. she turns a corner and `bang',
     walks straight into anne. a tense moment. the two sisters stare
     at one another..

                         mary
            i'm so sorry..

                         anne
            what for? you think i want the king? or
            to be used and abused by him?
                   (puts on brave smile)
            no! you're welcome to him. i have my own
            plans, which don't involve becoming a
            rag that will one day be discarded.

     mary stares, saddened, `oh, anne', but there's no time to talk.
     she has to go. anne is left. her eyes blazing.
