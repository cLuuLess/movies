     a family meeting: anne and henry percy, (the handsome young
     nobleman from mary's wedding), stand in front of the duke of
     norfolk and sir thomas boleyn and george..

                         sir thomas
            what were you thinking? the marriage of
            a senior noble is a matter of state.
            something only the king can decide..

     henry percy looks down, avoiding eye contact..

                         norfolk
            who knows about this?

                         anne
            no one.

                         norfolk
            then that is how it shall remain.
            forever.

                         anne
            but you cannot undo what has been done
            before god.
                   (defiant stare)
            and consummated too.

     `snap', norfolk's quill breaks. sir thomas almost chokes.
     george's eyes widen..

                         norfolk
            what?

                         sir thomas
                   (struggling to contain his
                    anger)
            there have been improper intimacies,
            too?

                         anne
            i have lain with my husband. there is
            nothing improper about it..

                         norfolk
            silence! my god, if you were my daughter
            i'd thrash you within an inch of your
            life..

     anne recoils, terrified..

                         sir thomas
            the boy will return to northumberland -
            where he will marry the talbot girl. as
            arranged.

     sir thomas gives the signal for william stafford to escort percy
     out.

                          orfolk
            as for you. you will go to france and
            stay there until you have learned your
            lesson.

                         mary
            what?

                          orfolk
            how could you do this to your sister?
            you know full well her friendship with
            the king is at an extremely delicate
            stage. any scandal or black mark against
            mary's name now could be fatal.

     sir thomas dismisses her..

                         norfolk
            you will join the court of the french
            queen. and stay there until your father
            has forgiven you.

     anne goes. george follows..
