     int. court - day

     the king's birthday. the master of revels has organised a lavish
     ball. the entire court is assembled and dancing, but henry
     appears sullen, distant. unable to celebrate.

     he misses mary.

      he queen has several of her prettiest spanish ladies-in waiting
     surrounding the king. giggling, fragrant butterflies.

     but henry shows no interest.

     the duke of norfolk notices this. a flicker of concern.
