      mary's face. lost in thought. stafford's words still ringing in
      her ears. she sits at the foot of anne's bed. anne sits in bed.
      heavily pregnant. on the other side is george.

                          anne
             god, i look hideous.

                             eorge
             does it hurt?

                          anne
             little nips and stabs.

      mary isn't listening. she is lost in thought.

                          george
             just imagine. it it's a boy. the unholy
             trinity will be mother, uncle and aunt
             to the next king of england.

                          anne
             but if it isn't? the king will take that
             as evidence of god's displeasure. and
             will turn further against me. he's
             already become so cold.

      anne touches her stomach anxiously..

                          anne
             they say you can tell by the shape of
             the stomach. mary, what do you say? boy
             or girl?

      anne tails off when she sees mary. miles away.

                          anne
             what's the matter with her?

      mary looks up, `what?'

                                                        (continued)

                          anne
             you've been like this for days.

                            mary
             what?

                          anne
             mooning. you're not in love, are you?

                            mary
             what?
                    (blushing)
             certainly not..

      mary gestures dismissively..

                          mary
                    (flustered)
             in love!

      mary returns to her book, flicking pages. but privately she is
      shocked. is it that obvious?
