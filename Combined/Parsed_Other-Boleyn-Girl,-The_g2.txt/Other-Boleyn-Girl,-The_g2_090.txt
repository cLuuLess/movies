     anne steps into the corridor. closes the door behind her.

                         anne
             ecause my sister lies in bed with your
            child. if you wish to please me, sir,
            then send her the gifts you send me.

                         henry
            i have shown mary enough kindness and
            generosity. it's you i want, anne.

                         anne
              beg you, my lord, do not do this. what
            has changed so?

                         henry
            you. don't you see? you have changed.

                         anne
            but mary is still the mother of your
            child. and even if she weren't..

                          enry
            what?

                         anne
            how could i forget that you chose her
            above me when we first met? you liked
            her better.

                         henry
            not true..

                         anne
            either way, i could never betray my own
            sister..

              now i beg you, leave me. this is too
              difficult to bear.

                           henry
              you see! the same pain as mine! it
              proves you feel the same way!

                           anne
              perhaps. but since it can never come to
              anything..

                           henry
              let me decide that. for now, you have
              given me hope.

      enry goes on bended knee, kisses her hand, and goes. anne is
     left alone. she breathes out. then looks down at her hands.

      hey are shaking.
