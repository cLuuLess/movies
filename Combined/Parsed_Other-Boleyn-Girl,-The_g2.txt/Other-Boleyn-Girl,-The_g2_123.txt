      the king sits in his private apartment. he looks up as mary
      enters, and curtseys deeply. seeing mary, his dog
      enthusiastically greets her. lapping at her.

      mary looks at the king. she is overcome with emotion, but finds
      the strength to hide it..

                          henry
             ah! mary! come in.

      mary walks closer.

                          henry
             closer..
                    (beckons)
             into the light.

      mary walks closer. henry looks at her..

                          henry
             the other boleyn girl. i'd forgotten how
             beautiful you were.

      mary looks at him. something has changed in him. a perceptible
      darkness around the eyes. a sadness..

                          mary
              ou asked to see me, your grace?
