      a fire roars. stafford warms himself, staring at mary's new baby
      daughter, (catherine), in a a cot.

                           tafford
             she's beautiful.

                          mary
             thank you.



                                                        (continued)

                          stafford
             i brought gifts from your family. a
             night-dress from your mother.
                    (to young henry)
             this from your uncle george.

      stafford produces a small wooded sword from behind his back.
      little henry takes the sword. swooshes it with excitement.

                          mary
             please be sure to thank them - though
             one wonders what's kept them so busy
             that not a single one of them found time
             to visit the new baby.

                          stafford
             it's anne. she's turning this country on
             its head. she has persuaded the king to
             test the validity of his marriage, and
             put the queenm on trial.

                            mary
             what?

                          stafford
             she continues to hold out. expertly
             witholding her favours until...

                          mary
             ..until what?

                          stafford
             until he makes her the ultimate offer.

      mary's eyes widen..

                          mary
             high stakes indeed.
