      mary and george arrive breathlessly in anne's room, to find..

      anne is on the floor before the fire, her arms wrapped around as
      if she were hugging herself. on the floor beside her is a
      bloodstained bundle of sheets.

      anne looks up through the trailing locks of her hair..

                    anne
       i lost it. almost without pain. and so
       fast it was over in a moment.

mary looks down at the bundle of sheets..

                    mary
              (heart cracks)
       oh, anne..

mary hugs anne tightly. all animosity now gone..

                    anne
        ou have to get rid of it. bury it. get
       rid of it somehow. no one must know.

 eorge rushes to a cupboard, and pulls out a cape. he wraps it
around anne. then he pours wine into a glass. mary wraps anne in
a blanket to warm her. and begins making the bed with fresh
linen..

                                                   dissolve to:

an hour later: anne is composed. staring into the fire. mary and
george sit on either side of her.

                    anne
       it's not the first. miscarriage.

mary's heart cracks. takes anne's hand.

                    anne
       they will take it as proof that i cannot
       bear children. that i am cursed by god.
       and should be dispensed with.

                    mary
       why? there's still time. you could sleep
       with the king, and fall pregnant again.
       no one would know..

                    anne
        he king would never lie with me now,
       and risk damaging the `child' he
       believes i'm carrying..
               a beat)
       besides, he is barely capable anymore.
       and i couldn't go through that again.

anne stares at mary and george..

                    anne
       no, if i am to survive..i have to take
       matters into my own hands.

mary and george exchange blank looks..

                    mary
       i..i don't understand.

                    anne
       i need a baby, mary.
               rolling eyes)
       must i spell it out?

                    mary
       you mean lying with another man?

                      anne
       of course.

                    george
       but that would be treason.

                    mary
        esides, where would you find someone
       you could trust?

                    anne
       obviously, it would have to be someone
       close. very close..

anne stares meaningfully at her brother..

                      george
       what..?
                 horrified)
       no..!

                    mary
       stop it, anne! it's madness..

                    anne
       don't you see? this affects all of us.
       if i go down, so do all of you. the only
       way to save ourselves..is to do this..
              (a beat)
       and pray it's a boy.

mary covers her mouth in horror, gets to her feet..

                    mary
       i can't listen to this..
              (feeling nauseous)
       ...this is monstrous..

                    anne
       mary, sit down..

                    mary
       no, anne! i understand you have had a
       shock tonight. a terrible shock. but
       there is no need for this..

      mary reaches the door, turns to george..

                          mary
             come, george..

      george gets to his feet..

                          anne
             george is staying. he understands this
             involves the whole family..

                          mary
             no. come, george..
