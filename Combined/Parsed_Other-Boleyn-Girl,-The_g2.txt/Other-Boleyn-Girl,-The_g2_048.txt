     mary paces anxiously in the corridor. presently, anne emerges
     from the room. burning with humiliation. their eyes meet. mary
     is about to speak, but anne cuts her off..

                         anne
             ou told them, didn't you?
                    a beat)
            how could you?

                         mary
            because you would never have got away
            with it. and it would have ruined your
            prospects forever.
                   (a beat)
            believe me. i did it for your good.

                         anne
            really? for my good? i'll try to remind
            myself of that. while i'm in exile. and
            you're here, in the king's bed, and
            unchallenged for our father's affection.
                    a beat)
            that it was for my good. not yours.

                         mary
            anne, wait..!

     anne storms out. george shoots mary a look, "i'll deal with
     this", and runs after anne..

     over this: we fade in music and the sound of laughter..
