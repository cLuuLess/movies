      anne enters a lavish drawing-room, and sits down. she picks up a
      book, and pretends to be reading. henry enters, sidles up behind
      anne, putting his arms around her, then..

                          henry
             wolsey has agreed to draw up plans for
             the queen to be sent to a nunnery.

      henry kisses anne on the neck..

                          henry
             she will protest, of course. she won't
             go quietly, but she knows she has failed
             to give me a son, and deserves her
             exile.
                     henry kisses anne)
             which leaves you all alone at court..

      he begins to unbutton her dress..

                          henry
             ...queen in all but name. mother to any
             future heir.

       enry unbuttons and kisses lower, lower.

                          henry
             so, is this assurance enough? will you
             give yourself to me now?

      a flicker behind anne's eyes, then..

                          anne
             i'd like to. but i'm afraid i find the
             insult too much to bear.

                            henry
             what insult?




                                                        (continued)

                          anne
             because as long as we remain unmarried,
             any child i gave you would forever be
             daubed `bastard' and i a `whore'.

                           enry
              ut what alternative is there?
                     throws hands up in
                     exasperation)
             my love for the queen may have died, but
             even you must concede, she is still very
             much alive. a

                          anne
             katherine of aragon is alive. that woman
             is not worthy of the title `queen'.

                           enry
             oh, anne.

                          anne
             i really do not know why we waste time
             talking of convents when you could annul
             the marriage.

                          henry
             annul it?

                          anne
             that woman married two brothers and
             therefore sinned against god.

                          henry
             but she never consummated the marriage
             with my brother.

                          anne
             they were married six months.

                          henry
             arthur was a sick man.

                          anne
             and katherine is a shrewd woman who knew
             that her position as queen would never
             be safe until she bedded your brother.
                    (a beat)
             talk to your advisers. they will tell
             you as much.

      anne walks out. henry stares.
