     int. william carey's house - night

     william and mary lie in bed. mary is equally wretched. tears are
                          m
     also running down her cheeks. she stares at her husband..

                         mary
            how could he do this to me? my own
            father.
                    a beat)
            what if we just refused?

                         william
            we would be cut off. he made that clear.

                         mary
            but would that be so bad?

     mary stares at him..

                         mary
            position means nothing to me. nor
            wealth. we could find somewhere. a small
            farm. away from everything.

                         william
            you say that now - but when you're
            older? and our children are grown up?
                   (comforting her)
            this won't last long. a year. maybe two.
            and at the end of that - we'll we have
            everything we want.
                   (a beat)
            it's for our future.

                         mary
             ut can't you see? do this, and we might
            not have a future.
