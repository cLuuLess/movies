    ext. field - day
1                                                                  1
     we're moving through a cornfield. at speed. the sound of
    children's laughter. excited shrieking.

     a beautiful young girl, (mary boleyn, 8), our heroine, runs
    through the fields, being chased by her younger brother, george,
    and sister, anne, (10).

     touchingly, mary is barely taller than the corn, her head
    skimming along the sheaves.

     reverse angle to reveal: the children are being watched by their
    parents, (sir thomas and lady elizabeth boleyn).

                            sir thomas
              i received a formal request for marriage
             today for anne.
                     (a beat)
              from the carey family.

    sir thomas indicates to
                         anne; the eldest. dark-haired.
    intelligent. the obvious leader among the children.

                        lady elizabeth
           but that's wonderful.

                        sir thomas
             i turned it down.

     lady elizabeth turns...`what?'

                        sir thomas
            and offered them mary instead.

    sir thomas indicates 
                         mary, the middle child. fair-haired.
    pretty. sweet-natured.

                          sir thomas
           fnne's too good for william carey. she
           can do (better than a merchant's son.

                          lady elizabeth
            you underestimate mary.

                          sir thomas
            not true. i think she's..the kinder of
           the two. quite possibly the fairer.

    the children, meanwhile, have started a race..

                         sir thomas
           but to get ahead in this world, you need
           more than fair looks and a kind heart.

     on the field, anne wins. she jumps up and down, holding her arms
    aloft, as mary flops to the floor. vanquished.

                                                                2.


    sir thomas smiles, `see?' he walks towards anne..

                        sir thomas
                  (applauding his favourite)
           bravo! anne!
