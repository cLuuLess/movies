      a cemetery in mid-winter. william carey's coffin is lowered into
      the ground. mary, dressed in window's black, steps forward, take
      a shovel, throws earth on the grave.

      mary walks back to comfort the children. the elderly priest
      continues with the service.

      mary bows her head. then she senses someone's eyes are on her.
      she looks up, and her expression changes..

      there is george. her brother. standing among the handful of
      mourners. staring at her.
