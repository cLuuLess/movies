    mary is in a bathroom. being prepared by anne for her wedding
    night. anne brushes her sister's hair. rubs oil in her skin.

                        mary
            o - the king himself is coming to
           hever. i'm so happy for george.

                        anne
           yes. but father took me aside. it seems
           he has ambitions for me, too.

                                                              7.

            he thinks i'm anne(coage dnow...and of not
                          of an nt' )
            unpleasing appearance...

                         mary
            what? what are you saying..?

                         anne
            it's known the king has a wandering eye.
            imagine...if he were to like me?

                          mary
            but...you could never be more than his
            mistress. and that's no substitute for a
            husband.
                         anne
            but as the king's mistress the least i'd
            get after he finished with me would be
            an earl. and if i fell pregnant? and
            gave him what his wife has failed to?
                    a beat)
            quite apart from the money, it'd be a
            duke at least.

                         mary
            but what about your happiness? your
            future?

     anne shrugs, smiles..

                         anne
            i could be a happy duchess.
