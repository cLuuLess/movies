      a small ceremony. held in secret. the distant sound of crowds
      protesting. booing. jeering. mary watches from the shadows as
      archbishop cranmer marries henry and a visibly pregnant anne..

                          archibishop
                    (in latin, we see sub-titles)
             do you, henry tudor, take anne boleyn as
             your lawful wedded wife..?

      henry's face: eyes burning with self-loathing..

                          henry
             i do.

      their voices are almost drowned by the shouts of protest and
      dissent coming from the streets..`whore', `witch'.
