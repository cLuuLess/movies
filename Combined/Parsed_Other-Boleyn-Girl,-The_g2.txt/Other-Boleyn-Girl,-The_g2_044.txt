     in the country church: the priest's eyes become accustomed to
     the dark. everywhere, long shadows, eerie darkness..

                         priest
            are you there?

     presently, a woman steps into the light. it's anne. dressed in a
     shawl.

                         priest
            no one saw you?


                                                       (continued)

                         anne
            no.

                         priest
            you brought the money.

     anne hands over a purse of coins. they walk to the altar..

                         priest
            and the groom? is he here?

     up ahead, the groom slowly steps out of the shadows. now we see
     his face. it's henry percy.

                          riest
            good. then let us begin.
