     afterwards: henry and his courtiers, (among them george), are
     being undressed and washed by their pages and squires..

                         henry
            you're a fortunate man, george. to be
            blessed with g
                         two such sisters.

                            eorge
            yes, my lord.

     there is a powerful physicality, a sexual confidence to henry
     which he exudes, even among men. he moves closer to george.

                          enry
            tell me. are they as different in temper
            as they are in looks?

                         george
            oh, yes. each has her own, quite
            distinct virtues. mary for example..

                         henry
            i'm familiar with mary's. tell me about
            anne's.

                         george
            anne? well, she's strong. some might say
            `difficult'.

                          enry
            headstrong. with a fiery temper.

                         george
            but with it comes great passion, too.
            it's both the best and the worst thing
            about her.
                    a beat)
            there are no half measures with anne.

                         henry
            careful, you'll make me think i chose
            the wrong boleyn girl.




                                                       (continued)

                         george
            oh, no. i'm certain mary is the   right
            choice. you will have a serene,   happy,
            life with her. the risk is with   anne, it
            might be like being caught in a   wild
            summer storm.

                         henry
            is that so..?

     george has tried to put henry off. but might just have said the
     wrong thing.

                           henry
                storm, you say..?
