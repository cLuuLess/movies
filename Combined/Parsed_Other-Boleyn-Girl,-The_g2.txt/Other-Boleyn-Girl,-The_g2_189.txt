      george boleyn's eyes are covered with a cloth. he puts his head
      on the block. a priest says last rites as george's arms are held
      back. terrified, his lips mouth prayers..begging forgiveness.

      the axe falls. a huge roar goes up.

      reverse angle to reveal: this has been watched by sir thomas
      boleyn.
