      at that precise moment, william stafford's horse reaches the top
      of the hill..

                            stafford
                      (pulling horse up)
             whoa..

      stafford turns, and faces back down at the house. he takes a
      last look. for a moment there is a connection between them both.

       hen, he turns, and kicks his horse, and rides over the brow.
