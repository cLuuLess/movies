      henry and anne walk through the gardens. out of earshot of the
      entire court which is assembled outside..

                          henry
             well, i have done what you asked. will
             you give yourself to me, now?

                             anne
             as what?

                          henry
             my one true mistress. to whom i am loyal
             above all others?

                          anne
             but it's not true. you are loyal to the
             queen above all others.

                          henry
             my wife? i barely see her.

                          anne
             but she sits on a throne beside you.
             accompanies you to every state function.

                           enry
             for appearance sakes only. in every
             other regard, our marriage is a sham.

                          anne
             still, she is your wife. and ever
             present. and i feel her eyes on me. and
             those of her spies.

      anne nervously looks left and right..

                          anne
             and look at us. forever reduced to
             meeting in secret like this. speaking in
             whispers.
                     a beat)
             hardly conducive to passion?

                          henry
             well, what would you have me do?
