       s in the opening scene: three children, a boy and two girls,
      run through the fields, playing. touchingly, they are barely
      taller than the corn, heads skimming along the sheaves..

      caption #3: "she and william stafford lived happily away from
      court for the rest of their lives."

      reverse angle to reveal: the children are being watched from a
      distance by mary and william stafford, standing outside hever
      castle. mary smiles, shielding her eyes from the sun..

      and adviser to his cousin elizabeth.."

      we close on young henry and anne's unmistakable red-headed
      daughter elizabeth..
