      anne sits in her study working. henry appears in the doorway.
      his face is dark. conflicted.

                          henry
             wolsey has agreed to charge the queen?

                          anne
             but that's wonderful.

      anne's smiles, then notices..

                          anne
             why do you look sad?

                          henry
             because she will contest it. which means
             putting her on trial. and hearing these
             delicate matters in public.

                          anne
              es. but any court made up of your
             bishops will surely find in your favour.
             and declare the marriage invalid.

      now it's anne's turn to start kissing henry round the neck..

                          anne
              hen you, my sweet lord, will be free to
             remarry.
                    (sensing his arousal)
             then i can give myself to you fully.
                     kissing him lower, lower..)
             and give you everything you..
                    (a beat)
             ..desire.

      anne stops, leaving henry highly aroused..
