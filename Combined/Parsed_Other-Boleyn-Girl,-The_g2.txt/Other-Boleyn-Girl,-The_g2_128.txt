      we're in a packed courtroom. the room is filled with the
      country's highest-ranking bishops. to one side: anne and mary
      watch from behind a screen..

mary hears the crowd's cheering for the queen. screams of
support and affection, `long live queen katherine', `our one
true queen'. mary looks anxious..

                    mary
       the crowds are with her.

                    anne
       the crowds have no vote.
               a beat)
       and the bishops that do are in wolsey's
       pocket.

anne watches as katherine enters court. the queen sees anne, and
starts walking directly towards them..

                    anne (cont'd)
       god, she's coming towards us.

queen katherine walks towards the screen, reaches it, then
                     q
pushes it aside, intimidatingly flanked by her lawyers..

                     ueen katherine
       so..the boleyn whores. two former ladies
       of mine. hiding in shadows.
              (a beat)
       what did i do to upset you, that you
       should turn against me like this?

                    anne
       you failed to give england an heir.

                    queen katherine
       and that upsets you so?

                    anne
       what upsets the king upsets me.

queen katherine straightens. big mistake.

                    queen katherine
       how dare you!

                    crier
              (calling out)
       katherine, queen of england, come into
       court..!

katherine's lawyers try to drag her away from anne, but she
wrenches herself free..

                    queen katherine
        ou want me to creep away and become a
       nun? well, i shall not. you want me to
       lie before god and admit my first
       marriage was consummated? well, it was
       not.

       you want me toueen katherine(cont'd)
                     q retire and withdraw my
       daughter's claim as sole rightful heir
       to the throne? well i shall not. not in
       a thousand years, not if you rack me to
       within an inch of my life...
              (beat)
       i am katherine, queen of england, the
       king's one true wife, and mother of the
       heir to the throne. beloved of the
       people, and beloved of a king you have
       bewitched.

katherine turns and enters the packed courtroom. she makes no
reply to the crier, instead walks over to where the king sits,
and falls onto her knees..

mary looks at anne, who is visibly shaking. and tries to compose
herself.

throughout the courtroom, people exchange looks. gasp. katherine
is completely disregarding the court, campeggio and wolsey, and
appealing directly to her husband..

                    katherine
       my lord, how have i offended you? for
       twenty years, i have been a true,
       obedient wife. i have loved all those
       whom you loved, and given you children
       though it has pleased god to take them
       away. if there is any just cause that
       you can allege against me, i will
       happily depart to my shame and
       dishonour, but i tell you, as god is my
       witness, there is none.

 enry sits in silence, but can barely contain his rage.

                     atherine (cont'd)
       so, i beg you, dear husband, to spare me
       this humiliation. but if you will not,
       and i am to be tried..

                    henry
              (defiant)
       you are.

                    katherine
       ..then let it be in a proper court and
       by the only authority i recognise. his
       holiness himself.

an audible gasp from the court. henry shoots a look at wolsey,
`what?!?' wolsey is horrified, `i know nothing of this.'
katherine gets to her feet, and dramatically walks out of the
court, stopping only to pause by a window..

      the cheers from the loyal people who are waiting outside ring
      through the court. henry looks dark, thunderous. he storms out
      of court. wolsey watches, visibly shaken...

                          wolsey
             since it has pleased the queen to absent
             herself from the court, the trial will
             simply proceed without her.

      a lawyer gets to his feet. the trial begins..
