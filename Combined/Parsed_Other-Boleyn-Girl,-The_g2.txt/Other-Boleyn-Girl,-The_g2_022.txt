     the dogs and riders roar across fields. the hounds snarl, almost
     delirious with primal agitation..

     among the riders, the more advanced horsemen have already opened
     up a clear lead on their weaker counterparts..

      n the advanced group, are henry, several courtiers, his guards
     and, of course, anne..

     they jump over a hedge. one of henry's courtiers catches the
     hedge and falls. henry smiles, then turns to see..

     anne comfortably jumping the hedge herself. henry's smile fades.
     he urges his horse to greater speed..

                           henry
                     (kicking his horse)
            hah..!
