      int. corridor outside anne's room - night

      mary leaves the room. tears stream down her cheeks. she runs
      down the corridor, rushing towards her children..

      but as mary goes, we reverse angle to reveal:

      a figure sits in the shadows by anne's door. someone who has
      heard everything that has been said..
      i
       t's jane parker. who turns, holding her head, covering her
      ears, unable to listen to any more..
