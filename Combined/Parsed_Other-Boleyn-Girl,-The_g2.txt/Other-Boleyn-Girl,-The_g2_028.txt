     mary and anne are sitting together. presently the door opens,
     and william stafford emerges..

                         stafford
            your father wishes to see you.

     mary and anne get to their feet. stafford raises his hand..

                         stafford
            just mary.

     mary shoots anne a quizzical look, then goes with stafford.
     anne's smile fades. a flicker of suspicion. she follows..
