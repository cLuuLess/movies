     mary walks through the packed corridors of court, her face
     burning from the humiliation. the sound of a voice behind her..

                         woman's voice
             ait! mary! stop!

     but mary does not hear. she continues walking, distressed, and
     distractedly enters..

     finally, she is caught by jane parker, whom we had seen at the
     window earlier. younger, also english, a kindred spirit..

                         jane
            i know that must have been agony, but
            put yourself in her shoes. she knows the
            only reason the king has asked you here
            is because he desires you. for a wife
            that must be very difficult.
                    a beat)
            she's a good woman. trust me.

     jane smiles. mary manages a smile..

                            ane (cont'd)
            jane parker.

                           mary
            mary carey.

     the two girls shake hands.

                         jane
            you have a brother, don't you? george?


                                                       (continued)

                           mary
            yes.

                         jane
            i've seen him a few times at court. and
            like him...very well.
                   (a beat)
            but i don't think he has noticed me.

                         mary
            i can't imagine.
                   (a beat)
            should i mention you to him?

                           jane
            would you?

                         mary
            of course. happily.

      ane parker smiles. but as soon as mary's back is turned, the
     smile fades.
