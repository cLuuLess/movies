      queen katherine, screaming in protest, surrounded by wailing
      ladies-in-waiting, is dragged roughly away from court by a unit
      of armed guards..

                          katherine
             how dare you!
                    (struggling)
             take your hands off me..

      the guards drag the queen away, her heart-breaking kicking and
      screaming continues. as she disappears..

      we reverse angle to reveal: this is being watched shadows by the
      king himself..

      his face: burning with guilt and self-loathing.
