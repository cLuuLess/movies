            bravo, anne! the king was quite smitten!
            told me so himself. and has requested
            you sit beside him at dinner.

     sir thomas adjusts her hair..

                         sir thomas
            my girl. my dear, remarkable girl. i
            knew you would up to the task.

     mary watches. a momentary stab of jealousy at father's
     attention. but as anne looks over at mary for support..

     she thinking?
