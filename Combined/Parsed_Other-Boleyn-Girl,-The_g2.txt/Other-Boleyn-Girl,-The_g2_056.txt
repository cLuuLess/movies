     musicians play. we're at george's wedding. attended by the king
     and queen, all the senior lords. it's a markedly grander and
     posher affair than mary's earlier wedding, a clear indication of
     the boleyns' new, elevated status.

a formation dance is in progress. at the centre of it: george
dances with a radiant, triumphant jane parker. george's eyes
meet those of francis weston across the room.

 y contrast: henry dances with mary. a couple with eyes on for
each other. locked to one another. blissfully unaware of and
uninterested in anyone else. silently counting the minutes
before they can tear off one another's clothes..

 everse angle to reveal:

their intimacy is witnessed by william carey, who we notice is
now drinking heavily, drowning his jealous sorrows..

elsewhere:

sir thomas boleyn is dancing with his wife, lady elizabeth. he
hisses through a fixed smile..

                    sir thomas
       for god's sake, it's the wedding of our
       youngest child attended by the king of
       england and the greatest lords in the
       land. would a smile be too much to ask?

                    lady elizabeth
       what's to smile about? i'm a mother with
       one child on his wedding day looking
       like he's been condemned to death.

 he indicates george, who dances with jane parker..

                    lady elizabeth
       another banished abroad, in disgrace.
       and a third whoring in public with an
       adulterer.

                    sir thomas
       for the moment she's happy.

sir thomas watches mary who dances with the king..

                    lady elizabeth
       but will she be happy when he leaves
       her? because you know that's how it will
       end.

                    sir thomas
       only god knows how anything will end.

                    lady elizabeth
       god..? he turned his back on all this a
       long time ago.

sir thomas stares coldly at his wife. he applauds as the dance
comes to an end.


                                                     (continued)

     in another corner:

     mary and the king also clap. henry whispers sexily in mary's
     ear. she laughs. then henry is called to one side...

     mary is momentarily left alone. she looks up to see william
     carey standing in front of her, swaying slightly.

                         william
            you're in love with him, aren't you?

                         mary
             illiam, you're drunk.

                         william
            how is it? with him?

     mary stares - suddenly hard - punishing him.

                         mary
            he pleases me. is that what you want to
            hear?

                         william
            what does he do to you? tell me. i want
            to know..

     mary pulls away. but carey pulls her roughly to one side. henry
     sees this from across the room..

                         william
            i know you look at me with contempt.
            but i had no choice. your father
            insisted i stand aside. what was i
            expected to do?

                         mary
            say `no', husband.
                   (a beat)
            that was all you had to do.

     mary pulls her arm away, and goes. she walks across the room,
     visibly shaken, and joins the king.
