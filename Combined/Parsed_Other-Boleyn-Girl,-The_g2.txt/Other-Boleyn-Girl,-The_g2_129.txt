131                                                            131
      the entire boleyn family is assembled. anne paces up and down.
      mary is with her children..

                          anne
             wolsey promised the king his verdict.
             instead he has humiliated him.

                          sir thomas
             but they are continuing with the trial.
             and the bishops will still find in the
             king's favour.

                          anne
             yes. but without the pope's blessing,
             the result will seem hollow.
                     a frustrated gesture)
             if only the king would take matters into
             his own hands.

                           ady elizabeth
             and do what? his only option would be
             to reject the catholic church? and his
             faith would never allow it.

                          sir thomas
             nor his good sense. breaking with rome
             would isolate england politically. leave
             us at the mercy of the protestants.

                          anne
             but the alternative is leaving this
             country without an heir. failing in his
             duty as a king. and risking civil war.

      anne stops thinks..

                          anne (cont'd)
             s
              omehow i need to make him understand
             that it is a fair price for a legitimate
             heir.

      anne looks at mary..


                                                        (continued)

                          anne (cont'd)
             one he could hold in his arms..

      anne's face: an idea forming..

                          anne (cont'd)
             a strong, rosy-cheeked boy..

      mary looks up. sees all eyes staring at her..

                           mary
                     (becoming suspicious)
             what?
