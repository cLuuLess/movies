     henry slowly comes to, to find himself staring at a number of
     faces. a physician, sir thomas boleyn, the duke of norfolk, one
     or two courtiers, and finally, anne..

                           physician
              it's a miracle, majesty, you have no
              broken bones..

     henry flinches in agony, tries to move..

                           sir thomas
              my daughter anne is here. would like to
              apologise.

                            enry
                     (recoils, his pride hurt)
              no! get her away from me!

     anne opens her mouth, wants to protest, but is hastily ushered
     out of the room.


                                                         (continued)

                    henry
       and who are you?

                    mary

henry looks her up and down..

                    henry
       you've been here all week-end?

                    mary
       yes, your grace.

                    henry
       really? how could i have overlooked you?

                    mary
       next to anne, it's easy to do.

                    henry
       nonsense.

henry sits up, takes h better look. intrigued.
                     a

                     enry (cont'd)

                    mary
       yes, your grace. to william carey.

                     enry
       from wolsey's office?

                    mary
       yes, your grace.

                    henry
       then why haven't i seen you at court?

                    mary
       because i have persuaded him to spend a
       year or two here first. we have a small
       manor and some land. nothing much. but
       enough to start a family.

                    henry
       a charmed life in the country? away from
       it all?

                    mary
       yes.

            and duty called.

     henry looks at mary, then..

                         henry
            you don't think he'll miss court?
                    a beat)
            a young, ambitious man?

                         mary
            he says not, your majesty.

     mary lowers her eyes..

                         mary
            but, if he ever changed his mind, i
            would always support him.

     henry stares at mary.

                         henry
            well said.
