      int. court - day
118                                                            118
      a hall filled with lawyers and ambassadors from both sides.
      arguably the grandest, most significant divorce proceedings in
      history.

      anne watches from a distance as henry talks to cardinal wolsey.
      then henry turns. he walks towards anne.

                          henry
             the queen has insisted a papal
             representative be present at the trial.
             but wolsey has assured me the trial will
             proceed for appearance sake only. we
             have our verdict.

                          anne
             then what troubles you?

                          henry
             one or two friends have refused to lend
             their support. among them, thomas more.
                    (a beat)
             and then there's the small matter of my
             conscience.

                          anne
             why? you have justice on your side.

      henry stares, conflicted..

                          henry
             do i?

      anne strokes his head. pacifying him. but the look on her face
      tells us - this is getting harder and harder.
