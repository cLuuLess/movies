     a small, precious-looking gift box sits on a table.

                          ervant
            from the king, madam.

     anne looks at the box. her heart misses a beat. it carries the
     unmistakable royal seal.

                          anne
            open it.

     a servant stares..

                         anne
            i said `open it.'

     the servant opens it. other servants crane their necks, stand on
     tiptoes. inside is a large pearl pendant. the servant gasps.
     anne, too. covers her mouth. it's beautiful..

     but from somewhere, she manages to find the strength..

                         anne
            now close it again. and send it back.

     the servant stares in disbelief..

                         anne (cont'd)
            you heard me.

     the servant bows, and leaves, taking the box. anne watches, a
     look of mischief in her eyes. she's up to no good.
