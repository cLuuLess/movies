      int. anne's cell - day
198                                                            198
      anne looks out through a narrow window. her intense, fearful
      eyes flit and dart..

                          anne
             they're letting the crowds in.

                          mary
             it's all right. you will be spared. the
             king as good as gave me his word.

                          anne
             the king saw you?

                             mary
             yes.

      anne manages a rueful smile..

                          anne
             we all made a mess of that, didn't we?
             we all underestimated little mary.

      anne looks at mary..

                          anne
             i don't think he ever stopped loving
             you.

                          mary
             that's not true.

                          anne
             it is. he never loved me in the same
             way. and deep down you know it.

      mary averts her eyes..

                          anne
             you should have been queen. you even
             gave him a son. but instead all this has
             happened because..
                    (a beat)
             because i couldn't bear to be the other
             boleyn girl.

      anne shrugs..

                          anne
             and now look?

      the sound of approaching footsteps. anne looks at mary, suddenly
      frightened..



                                                        (continued)

             h




             s




                                                             113.


                          anne
             hold me..

      the two sisters fall into an emotional embrace as the jailor's
      keys turn in the lock..

                          anne
             you'll look after elizabeth?

                          mary
             it will be all right. trust me.

                          anne
              he couldn't ask for a better moth...
                    (breaks down, composes
                     herself)

      mary hugs anne tight..`sssshhh'.

                          mary
              e will spare you. i am sure of it.

      anne takes a deep breath. tries to look serene..
