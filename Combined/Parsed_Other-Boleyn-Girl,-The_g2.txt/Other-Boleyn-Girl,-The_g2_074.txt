     int. greenwich palace - that night
76                                                              76
     a dinner at court. henry is at one end, in serious conversation
     with foreign ambassadors. presently, at the other end of the
     table, loud laughter.
     h
      enry looks up, then returns to his conversation.

     it's not long before another loud gale of laughter in the corner
     of the room. henry looks up again. then returns to his
     conversation.

      resently, a third roar of laughter at the other end. this time,
     henry loses patience..

                         henry
            what's the noise? i can hardly hear
            myself think!

     at the other end, a courtier gets to his feet..

                         brandon
            it's mistress boleyn, your majesty. her
            stories about life at the french court.
            they are particularly amusing.

     henry's expression changes. the room falls silent..

                         henry
            i'm only aware of one boleyn girl and
            she is lying-in with a certain child in
            her belly!


                                                         (continued)

sir thomas boleyn gets to his feet..

                    sir thomas
       it's my elder daughter, anne, your
       majesty. she has returned to court.

                    henry
       what? that awful girl, thomas? the one
       that almost killed me?
              (a beat)
       you allowed her back?

                    sir thomas
       the time abroad has done her good, your
       majesty. i'm certain you'd find her much
       improved.

                      henry
       really..?

henry looks down the table..

                    henry
       well, come on. where are you, other
       boleyn girl? show your face.

anne slowly gets to her feet. henry looks up. when he sees
anne's face, his face falls..

anne is a woman transformed. gone are the simple clothes, puppy
fat and lack of confidence.

anne has become a glorious, head-turning siren; dressed in
daring french clothes.

 er hood is half-crescent, and reveals the hair. her neckline
plunges sexily. her sleeves are long and loose, offering daring
flashes of arm and elbow..

like every other red-blooded man in the room, henry is utterly
mesmerised. speechless..

                    henry
       so? what is so amusing, anne? perhaps we
       might hear and judge for ourselves?

anne dark, intelligent eyes stare back at henry. suddenly, all
sound fades, and the world shrinks around them: it's as though
they are the only two people in the room..

                    anne
       i was just giving my thoughts on the new
       french king.

                      henry
       which are..?


                                                  (continued)

                    anne
       that for someone with such great wealth,
       and power..he has surprisingly little
       authority as a man.

                    henry
       hah!

                    anne
       and is so consumed by one particular
       rivalry he can barely think.

                    henry
        eally? and who is this rival?

                    anne
       a neighbouring king, who's name one is
       forbidden to mention at court. whose
       reputation haunts him in his thoughts
       and dreams.

 ipples of laughter, as people guess..

                    anne
       whose armies and navy thwart his every
       endeavour. whose physical and
       intellectual endowments are known far
       and wide.

 enry laughs too. enjoying this..

                    anne
       in order to restore his confidence, this
       french king spends a fortune on anything
       that glitters, on building of castles
       with large towers..

anne artfully gestures the phallic implications..

                    anne
       but these symbols of wealth and virility
       fail to convince. talk among the ladies
       at court in france suggests..
a
anne stops herself...

                    henry
       what?

                    anne
       that in this department too, the king
       has his shortcomings.

anne's gesture, (discreetly wiggling her small finger). henry
stares for a moment. a deathly silence. has she gone too far?



                                                    (continued)

     then henry smiles. delighted. dogs bark in bewilderment. soon
     everyone in the room laughs too.

      xcept for the seymours, (sir john and his sons, edward and
     thomas), who glower, mute, at the end of the table beside their
     sister jane..
