      a magnificent winter party to celebrate anne's pregnancy. the
      river thames is frozen over. it's a lavish spectacle.

      jousting on ice-skates, bear-baiting with dogs, musicians, skate-
      dancing, sledges and fire-eaters and muscovite tumblers.

the king threads his way through courtiers and entertainers.
wherever he goes, people stop their conversations, bow in fear.
inimidated.

anne, visibly pregnant, sits on a throne. alone. she looks
drawn, frightened, and tired. an unmistakable echo of queen
katherine at the masked ball earlier.

                     eorge
       and so, it's come to this. our sister is
       with child, and all england's fate is in
       the balance.

 eorge indicates anne..

                    george (cont'd)
       if it's a boy, the king will have been
       vindicated in getting rid of his first
       wife, and his authority will be
       unassailable. but if it isn't. or if,
       god forbid, she miscarries.

 eorge indicates henry, who's face is also drawn, dark,
malevolent, suspicious. barely recognisable.

                    george
       the king will have to move swiftly to
       silence his enemies. he will claim
       innocence. that he was corrupted. anne
       will swiftly be replaced as queen, by
       someone more `acceptable'.
              (a beat)
       and we boleyns will never be able to
       show our faces at court again.

                    mary
       that's no bad thing.

mary shudders to herself. holds her children protectively.

                    mary
       anyone with any sense would have run
       away from this hell-hole already. as far
       as they could go.

        ike the wise william stafford.

mary turns...

                    mary
       what?

                    george
       you didn't know? sold up and went. left
       for the country. just like that. gone to
       live in some place called..

                          george
             where he grew up, apparently. did you
             know he came from a better stable than
             all of us? his grandmother was a
             beaufort, cousin to the king. and he
             never mentioned it.
                    (shrugs)
             who'd have guessed?

       eorge shrugs, and skates off with francis weston. we pull back
      to reveal they are being watched by jane parker..

      ..who looks drained. lonely. worn out by the humiliation of her
      failed marriage and the agony of unrequited love.
