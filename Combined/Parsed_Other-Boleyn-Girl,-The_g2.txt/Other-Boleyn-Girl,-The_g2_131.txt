      henry walks towards anne. and bends so as not to frighten the
      boy..

                            henry
             who's this?

      anne smiles, maternally strokes the boy's hair..
                           a
                            anne
             go, on..

                          young henry
             my name is henry.

                          henry
             is it, now? a fine name.
                    (raises eyebrow)
             and how old are you?

                           young henry
             four, sir.

      reverse angle: to see mary watching helplessly from inside the
      palace. tears are streaming down her face. lady elizabeth
      appears, and puts her arm round mary's shoulders in comfort..

      outside: in the gardens, young henry and his father continue to
      get to know one another..

                          young henry (cont'd)
             is that sword real?

                          henry
             i think so. would you like to see it?

      henry draws it, and shows the boy, who's eyes widen in
      excitement..

                          henry
             now, `on guard'.

      henry and young henry begin to play fight. as they do, our
      camera slowly, slowly pulls back to reveal..

      the scene is being watched by:

      mary, her nose pressed against a window in the palace, as she
      continues to watch henry play with her son..
