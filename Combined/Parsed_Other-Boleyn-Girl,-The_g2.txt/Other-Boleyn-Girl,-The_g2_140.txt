      musicians play in the corner, struggling to drown out the sound
      of the protesters.

a party is in progress. anne, the bride, is at the centre of
proceedings, visibly pregnant and finally queen. but it has
brought her no peace. the cacophony from outside visibly
troubles her. mary stands by her side. maid of honour.

                    anne
       did you hear? on the way to the church?
       they were calling me a witch.

                    mary
       all that will die down as soon as they
       get to know you.

                    anne
       but what if it doesn't? what if they
       hate me forever?

                    mary
       they won't. they will see how much the
       king loves you, and follow.

                    anne
              (haunted, hollow)
       how much the king loves me?

anne shoots an anxious look over at henry, who is with cromwell,
in the corner, lost in serious conversation..

                    mary
        ister, i wonder if you've given any
       thought..to the matter of my returning
       to the country. with the children.

anne's face: her expression changes. suddenly fearful.

                    anne
       what? no! i need you here more than
       ever. besides, as the queen's sister,
       you can't live alone out there like some
       gypsy. we need to make you a proper
       match.

 earing this, the passing william stafford freezes..

                    anne
       what about the duke of suffolk?

anne indicates an ugly, fat courtier..

                    anne
       all the ladies at court are mad for him.
       or lord fardingly.
               indicates an old courtier,
               in his 60's)
       marry him and you'd own half scotland..
