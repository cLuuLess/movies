      mary stands in front of the door, protectively holding her
      children. a flicker of panic passes behind her eyes. what is she
      doing? she knocks.

                          young henry
             who lives here, mother?

                          mary
             someone.
                    (clears throat)
             a friend.

       o answer. mary knocks again. still no answer. mary hesitates,
      then tries the door. it opens..
