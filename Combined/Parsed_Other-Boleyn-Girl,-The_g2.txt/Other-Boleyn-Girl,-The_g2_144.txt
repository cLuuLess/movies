      int. anne's bedroom - night
146                                                            146
      mary watches from a distance, as sir thomas and norfolk tell the
      king. henry staggers from the disappointment, as if he had been
      delivered a blow..

                          sir thomas
             she has named her elizabeth. after your
             mother.

                          henry
             is the child healthy?

                          sir thomas
             perfectly, sir.

      henry stares, hollow-eyed. finally..

                           enry
             well, if we can have a healthy daughter,
             we can have a healthy son.

      henry turns, and without a word, pushes past everyone, and
      leaves. anne is left alone, her heart breaking..

      mary stares at anne. a stab of compassion. not long ago the same
      thing happened to her. hoping to console anne, mary hands her
      beautiful new baby over to her...

      ..anne takes the baby in her arms. filled with love for
      something that will almost certainly mean her destruction.

      her shoulders shake with tears.
