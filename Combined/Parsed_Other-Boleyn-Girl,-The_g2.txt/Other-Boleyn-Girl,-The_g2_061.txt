     a blindfolded mary is led through doors by sir thomas..into a
     suite of grand, unfurnished rooms, the most prestigious
     accommodation at court..

                         sir thomas
            now open!

     mary removes her blindfold. she gasps in disbelief, turns 360
     degrees, staring at the size, and grandeur of the location..

                         sir thomas
            there's more. thanks to you, i am to
            become an earl. your brother a viscount.

      eorge smiles at mary, who's eyes widen..

                         sir thomas (cont'd)
            in addition, we have received a number
            of new grants and estates.
                    pointedly, to lady
                    elizabeth)
            so our debts are paid off.

     but lady elizabeth remains granite-faced..

                         lady elizabeth
            just be aware. these `gifts', this
            `favour' can go as swiftly as it comes.
            these rooms belonged to the duke of
            buckingham. once the king's closest
            friend. now his head rots on a spike..

                         sir thomas
            because he committed treason.

                          ady elizabeth
            but what is `treason'? it's anything the
            king or his lawyers decide it to be.
            anything that offends him, or causes him
            displeasure.
                    a beat)
            and can you assure me we'll never do
            that?

     lady elizabeth turns and walks out. mary looks anxiously at sir
     thomas, who gestures dismissively..

                         sir thomas
            pay her no heed..
