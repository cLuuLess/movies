      mary sits at the dinner table with her husband, william carey,
      who's health has deteriorated. he drinks heavily. a shadow of
      his former self.

      he stares at the baby..
                           w
                          william
             have you christened the child?

                            mary
             henry.

                            william
             i see.

      a painful smile..

                          william
             and is he to take my name? or is he to
             be a fitzroy or some other sign that he
             is a royal bast...

                          mary
             he is to be henry carey.

                            william
             i see.

      a silence, then..

                          william
             well, then, here we are.

      william stares at mary. clearly still in love with her.

                          william
             i could pretend none of this ever
             happened. start again.
                    (a beat)
             if you could.

      mary's face. manages a brave smile.
