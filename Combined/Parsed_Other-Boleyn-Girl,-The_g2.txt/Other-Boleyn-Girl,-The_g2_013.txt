     anne is being dressed by maids. hearing the commotion outside,
     she rushes over to the window to see the approaching riders.

     anne looks out of the window. scans the approaching riders until
     she finds the king..

                           anne
            there he is!

     the young henry tudor is a dazzling, magnetic, intensely
     glamorous and handsome figure. a total contrast from the
     bloated, bearded figure of his later years.

                         anne
            you think he will like me?

                         mary
            of course, sister. how could he not?

     anne turns to face mary. the two sisters embrace tightly.
