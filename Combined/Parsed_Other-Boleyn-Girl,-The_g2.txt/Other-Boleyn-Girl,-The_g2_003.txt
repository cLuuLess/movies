    int. mary's bedroom - day
3                                                                    3
    mary, ten years older, and grown into a heavenly bride is in her
    room, surrounded by maids and seamstresses making final
    adjustments to her dress. a knock at the door.

                        anne
           may we come in..?

    anne and george enter. george lets out a low whistle..

                        anne
           look at you..! younger than me. more
           beautiful than me. married before me.
                  (a beat)
           i am eclipsed. i am just the `other
           boleyn girl.'

                        mary
           hardly.

                        george
           no, is this it? this is the end of the
           unholy trinity?

    george extends her arms, wraps them around his two sister. an
    intimate moment.

                        mary
           no, george. never. i'll be married,
           that's all..
                  (a beat)
           apart from that - it won't change a
           thing.

    the three of them hug together, tightly..
