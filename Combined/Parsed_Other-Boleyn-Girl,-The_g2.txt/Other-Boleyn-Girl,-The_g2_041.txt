     an incense-filled royal chapel. the archbishop is giving mass,
     in latin, for the royal household.

      he king sits at the front, on the left. with the men. the
     ladies are separated, as is traditional, and sit on the right.

     henry is lost in prayer. it's not long, however, before he turns
     to look at mary.
