      mary follows stafford out to the stables where freshly watered
      and fed horses are waiting..

                          mary

                           tafford
             continues to be promoted. as does your
             father. i lost track of their latest
             titles.

      stafford smiles. mounts his horse..

              ow is your husband? i heard he was
             unwell.

                            mary
             he is.

                            stafford
             i'm sorry.

      stafford stares at her. their eyes meet. stafford opens his
      mouth, for a moment it looks as if he's about to finally declare
      his feelings, then..

                            william (o.s.)
             mary..!

      william carey's voice calls out from inside. stafford's
      expression changes. now's not the right time.

      he kicks his horse, and rides off.
