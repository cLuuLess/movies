     int. mary's room - night
96                                                                96
     the duke of norfolk, sir thomas, and george boleyn arrive in
     mary's bedroom, and stare anxiously as the labour begins in
     earnest..

                           sir thomas
              does the king know?

                                                          (continued)

                                                        64.


                    george
       he's on his way.

anne, who overhears this, surreptitiously adjusts her dress.

mary screams in agony. the labour is well and truly under way.
medically, it's a primitive, brutal affair..

no comprehension of sterilisation. midwives have dirty hands.
physicians use rusty, blood-stained instruments..

presently: the king arrives with several courtiers..

                    sir thomas
       any moment, your grace.

but the king hasn't heard. he has seen anne. suddenly, it's as
if all sound, all vision disappears, except for anne. he stands
beside her..

all around them the violence and dramatic activity of the birth
unfolding; but for all their connection with it, henry and anne
might as well be in a rose garden..

                    henry
       anne..

anne stares ahead at mary's bed..

                    henry
       anne, i love you..

                    anne
       your grace, this is not the time..

                    henry
       i love you anne. i cannot stop thinking
       about you. i cannot eat, i cannot
       sleep..

                    anne
       but how could i ever trust you?

norfolk cranes his neck to listen..

                    anne
       when i have seen how you have betrayed
       first your wife. and now my sister.

henry takes anne to one side...

                    henry
       i vow from this moment forth i will
       never lie with my wife, or speak to your
       sister again. i will do anything you
       ask..


                                                  (continued)

mary's contractions build. birth is imminent. physicians and
midwives work to deliver the baby. anne thinks, then..

                    anne
       then don't acknowledge the child.

henry is thrown..

                    henry
       what?

with a blood-curdling scream, mary finally gives birth. sir
thomas and norfolk crowd into the room, anxious to see..

                    physician
       a boy!

sir thomas turns towards henry, beaming with happiness..

                    sir thomas
       it's a boy, your majesty. a strong,
       healthy boy.

henry's face: a boy? his eyes fill with emotion. this is what he
has waited for. a son.

anne notices his conflict, and prompts him again..

                    anne
       what my sister has given you, i could,
       too.

henry looks at the baby, then turns to face anne. his eyes are
full of conflict, then..he silently nods.

anne's face breaks out in a smile..

                    anne
       very well.

then, in front of everyone, not caring how inappropriate it is,
henry falls to his knee, takes anne's hand and kisses it.

the audible sound of gasps. mary watches in horror as henry
falls to his knees and kisses anne's hand..
                     m
                    mary
              (a dagger in her heart)
       henry..?

henry gets to his feet, then turns and walks away without
looking in the direction of mary or the baby.

                    mary (cont'd)
       my lord..?

mary stares after the king, but he does not turn around.

                                                     (continued)

     instead, mary's eyes meet anne's.

     anne's eyes stare back. the ultimate moment of revenge.

       barely perceptible smile of satisfaction, then anne turns and
     goes.

     the midwives and physicians stare at one another, visibly
     embarrassed by what they have just witnessed.

     the clearing of throats, averting of eyes. then they get on with
     their work to the sound of the mary's cries..
