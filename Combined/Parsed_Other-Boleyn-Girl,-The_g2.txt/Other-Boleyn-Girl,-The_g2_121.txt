      int. court - boleyn house - night

      the entire boleyn family is assembled. sir thomas, lady
      elizabeth, the duke of norfolk, george and, at the centre of
      proceedings, anne herself.

      the atmosphere is tense. presently, the door opens, and mary
      enters the room. in widow's weeds. all eyes on her. and her
      children. a sharp intake of breath, a ripple of shock at the
      state of them. in simple country clothes. mary curtseys..

                            sir thomas
             mary.

       n awkward silence. mary holds her children's hands..

                          sir thomas
             we're so sorry.
                     clears throat)
             about your husband..
