      a roar of the crowd. anne, wearing a shawl of white ermine, is
      violently jostled and spat at as she's marched across tower hill
      to the scaffold. she shoots mary an anxious look across the
      crowds..
      m
      mary shoots a signal, "don't worry." anne climbs the steps, and
      faces the crowds. finally the jeers subside..

                          anne
             i...i come here to die...a loyal
             subject..

      more spit, jeers and abuse. mary stands on tiptoe, cranes her
      neck. anxiously scans the crowds for the guards that will free
      anne..

                          mary
             come on..

                          anne
             ..i..i do not blame the king. never was
             there a more just or goodly lord..

      presently, mary sees two soldiers pushing through the crowds
      towards her. her heart leaps..

                          anne
             ..i beg god's forgiveness and his
             mercy..

      anne looks up to see the soldiers reaching mary, and handing her
      a letter. anne smiles in relief. mary opens the letter and
      reads..

             "madam..."
