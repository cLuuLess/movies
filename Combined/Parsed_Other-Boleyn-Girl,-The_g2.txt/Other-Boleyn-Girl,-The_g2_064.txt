     int. mary's bedroom - court - day

     mary lies in her bed, watching with a forlorn expression as
     midwives and maids prepare the apartment for lying-in.

      apestries with soothing biblical images are hung on the walls.
     curtains are drawn for darkness. a large crucifix is placed in a
     corner.

     as each tapestry is hung, the room becomes darker...

     ..and darker.

     ..and darker.

     mary cranes her neck to remain in sunlight for as long as
     possible, but before long..

     ..her face slips into darkness, and the room into total silence.
     and effective imprisonment.
