     mary wakes up. she gets out of bed. she goes to the window and
     draws the curtains.

     then mary looks down, and gasps. the floor has fresh drops of
     blood on it.

     mary goes to her bed, and rips back the sheets. her eyes widen
     in horror. there is blood all over the sheets.

                                                       (continued)

     mary covers her mouth. lets out a loud cry. the sound of
     approaching footsteps as servants come running..
