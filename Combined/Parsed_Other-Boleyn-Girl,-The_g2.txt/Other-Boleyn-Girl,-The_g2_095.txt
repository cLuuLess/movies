     int. sir thomas's study - night
97                                                               97
     `crash', sir thomas and norfolk burst into the study, angrily
     slamming the door closed behind them. anne is inside.

                         norfolk
            damn you! three years we've been working
            on this! not a single detail was left to
            chance! and now, in the moment of our
            greatest glory..

     norfolk stares at anne..

                         norfolk
            all i can say is you'd better have a
            plan. and it had better work.

     anne stares back defiantly..

                         anne
            or what...uncle?

                         lady elizabeth
            stop it! both of you. what shall we do
            about mary? and the child? or have we
            forgotten them already?

                         anne
            mary should go back to her husband.

     not a flicker of emotion on her face.

                         anne
            she has been inconvenienced long enough
            by this family.

                          ady elizabeth
            fine. then you can be the one to tell
            her.

      ady elizabeth stares at anne..



                                                       (continued)

                          lady elizabeth
             i think you've earned that privilege.

      lady elizabeth turns and walks out. anne's smile fades.
