      int. anne's bedroom - night

      `haaarrggh', anne bolts awake in the middle of the night. her
      face is pale. she is covered in a thin film of perspiration. she
      flinches in pain. holding her stomach..

      immediately doors open, and several servants and ladies appear.
      but anne composes herself.

                          anne
             i'm fine, thank you.
                    (visibly paranoid)
             just a bad dream.

      reassured, the servants fill anne's glass with water..

                          anne
                    (flinches as she speaks)
             but fetch my brother and sister, will
             you?

      the servant bows, and goes. as soon as anne is left alone, she
      slowly looks down, and pulls back the bedsheets..
      w
       hen anne sees what lies beneath, she howls in horror.
