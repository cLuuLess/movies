      henry walks through corridors arm in arm with jane seymour,
      followed closely by the seymour brothers, sir john seymour and
      the ever-surviving duke of norfolk..

      henry turns a corner, then stops in his tracks when he
      sees...mary waiting outside his privy chamber, restrained by
      guards. seeing the king, she curtseys deeply..

                           henry
             mary..?

      the seymour brothers draw their swords, but the king's dog runs
      excitedly towards her. henry gestures for the seymours to sheath
      their swords..       h
                            enry
             leave us.

      the seymours leave. the duke of norfolk hesitates..

                           henry
             all of you!

      into..
