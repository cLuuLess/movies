     int. norfolk's study - court - day
55                                                              55
     the duke of norfolk's dogs are eating breakfast out of bowls by
     the fire. slurping hungrily.

     the entire family is gathered. sir thomas, lady elizabeth. also
     present is william carey.

                          norfolk
            well..?

     mary stares at her husband..

                         norfolk
            did he have you?

     mary's eyes burn..

                          mary
            yes.

                         norfolk
            more than once?

     mary stares daggers..

                         norfolk
            you'd better get used to talking about
            it. once you sleep with the king, it's
            not a private matter any more.

                         mary
            yes. more than once.

     william carey's face: a flicker of pain..

                         norfolk
            so he was satisfied?

                         mary
            i believe so, uncle.

                         norfolk
             ood. this is where our work begins.
            it's one thing to catch the king. quite
            another to keep him.

     norfolk turns to sir thomas, ignoring mary as though she were a
     piece of livestock..

                         norfolk
            i want you to keep her spotless, hair
            washed every day. she must read all the
            latest books and be able to venture and
            defend an interesting opinion. she must
            know her music, must be energetic and
            entertaining - in company and in bed.
            that's how he likes his women. and if
            ever she's in any doubt as to how to
            conduct herself, or what to do next -
            she should simply watch the queen. that
            woman kept him from straying for eleven
            years. and the effort almost killed her.

      ut sir thomas has not heard. he is distracted. he watches from
     a palace window as, in a stableyard down below..

     george and francis weston return from riding together. the sound
     of laughter as they dismount, and hand their horses to the
     stable-boys..

     sir thomas watches as george and francis walk back to the palace
     together. there's something in their manner, the intimacy
     between them..

     sir thomas's smile fades.
