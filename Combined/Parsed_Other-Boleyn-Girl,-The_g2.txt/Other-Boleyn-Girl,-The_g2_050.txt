52                                                             52
     `thump', the doors open, and mary is carried into the king's
     apartments. henry fusses, brings water. opens windows.

                          enry
            go! leave us! go!

     sir thomas bows to the king, shoots mary meaningful look, `don't
     fail me', and retreats. henry closes the doors. he and mary are
     left alone.

     henry makes her comfortable.

                         mary
            thank you, your grace.

                         henry
            `henry', please. the first rule of this
            room, is to leave `your grace's' and
            `your majesty's' outside.

      enry looks up..

                         henry
            is there anything i can bring you?

                         mary
            no.

                         henry
            nothing to increase your comfort or well-
            being?

                         mary
            you might ask your servants to bring me
            some water.

     henry goes to get water himself..

                    henry
       there. there are no servants.

mary's eyes widen. the king of england brings her a drink! mary
takes a sip of her drink and watches as henry goes behind a
screen and begins to remove his costume. his mask.

mary notices a mirror, and watches in the reflection of the
mirror how henry removes the costume and status of king and
becomes a man. private.

 enry visibly unwinds, his facial muscles relax. he breathes out
deeply. his face becomes softer. more gentle. then he puts on a
comfortable robe, and emerges from behind the screen.

henry goes over to a pile of cushions, and flops down - and
smiles at mary.

                    mary
       so, this is it? this is where the king
       of england sleeps?

                    henry
       and reads. and writes. and finds a few
       moments each day...
              (gestures)
       ...for himself.

henry smiles at mary..

                    henry (cont'd)
       you look surprised?

                    mary
       i am. i suppose it's more..

mary looks at the bed, the books, the pages of writing on the
desk..

                    mary
       ..simple than i imagined.

                     enry
       there's no need for show. i am only ever
       here alone.

                    mary
       and yet you invite me here?

                    henry
       because i trust you.

                    mary
       you hardly know me.

                    henry
       a man in my position develops an
       instinct.
               a beat)
       you would never lie, could never lie to
       me.

mary smiles, admitting he's right.

                    mary
       no.

                    henry
       i also sense...that you might relish an
       opportunity to be yourself, too.

                    mary
       yes.

                    henry
       well, here you only say what you like,
       do what you like.
                    m
                    mary
       very well.

mary smiles. stretches out her legs. relaxes..

                    mary
       i'd like an apple, please..
              (can't believe she's saying
               this)
       ..henry.

henry jumps to his feet, brings mary an apple. mary laughs,
`thank you'. bites into the apple..

                    mary
       now it's your turn.

                    henry
       what?

                    mary
       to say something, or do something you
       couldn't outside.

                    henry
       there are many things i cannot admit to
       in public. sadness, for example. and
       loneliness.

                    mary
       but when you are loved as much as you
       are? how can you be lonely?



                                                  (continued)

                         henry
            do you not know what it is to be lonely
            in a marriage?

                         mary
            yes. i do now.

                          enry
              married my brother's widow because my
            father ordered it. as a duty. to keep
            the alliance with spain. and she is a
            remarkable woman. and wife.

     henry looks at mary..

                         henry
            but i never looked at her or longed for
            her the way i do you.

     henry reaches out. their hands meet..

                         henry
            imagine how different it might have
            been. for both of us..had we been able
            to chose for ourselves..

     henry leans forward and they kiss. gently at first. mary
     resisting. then harder..

      ensing this, the king picks mary up and leads her to the
     canopied bed, and lays her down..

     they begin to make love. as radical a contrast to the scene with
     william carey as it is possible to imagine..

     mary's eyes open. she gasps. her hands grip the sheets..
