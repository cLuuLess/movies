     a large dusty yard, where knights train for combat, and practise
     their fighting skills. mary is with george, who is putting on
     his armour..

                         george
            not noticed her? jane parker? of course
            i have. how could i not? she looks like
            a goat.

                         mary
            well, she likes you, and asked me to
            give you this..to remember her by.

     mary hands over a handkerchief..

                         george
            ugh. well say you haven't seen me. or
            that you forgot.

     george hastily gives it back..

                         george (cont'd)
            there is something about that woman that
            makes me feel...
                   (he shudders)

     george gets to his feet, indicates to his male courtier friend
     that he is coming..

                         mary
            and our sister? any word?

                                                       (continued)

                         george
            anne? you know she took being upstaged
            by you very badly.

                           mary
            yes, i know.

                         george
            and no amount of interventions on my
            behalf would make her believe you hadn't
            done it intentionally.

                         mary
            but you know i would never do anything
            like that.

                           george
            i know.

     george finds his helmet, puts it on..

                         george (cont'd)
            just give her time. she'll come round.

     mary watches george go to join the other male courtiers.
