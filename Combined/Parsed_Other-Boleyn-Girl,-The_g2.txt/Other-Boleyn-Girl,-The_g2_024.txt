     henry weaves skilfully through low-hanging branches. he looks
     over his shoulder, anne follows, close behind..

     sharp branches tear at henry's face. some draw blood. behind
     him, several other courtiers suffer lashes from the branches,
     and pull up. but not anne. she kicks her horse harder. seemingly
     impervious to the whipping branches..

                           anne
            hah!

     ahead, the deer darts and weaves. the hounds give chase.
