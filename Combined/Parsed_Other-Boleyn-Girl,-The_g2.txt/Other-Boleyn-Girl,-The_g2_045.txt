     back at court: the service ends.

     everyone in the royal household filters out of the church. but
     it's a very different atmosphere to when they entered..

     the extent of henry's affection for mary is now public knowledge
     evidenced by..

     ..the attention sir thomas and norfolk now receive from cardinal
     wolsey and thomas cromwell, and the way in which queen katherine
     and her spanish ladies are being neglected.

     mary allows herself a private smile of satisfaction. surprised
     at how good it feels. to be the number 1.
