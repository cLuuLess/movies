      several maids are assembled, fussing over mary. transforming her
      from penniless country widow to sophisticated courtier again.
      a
      anne enters, (unseen by mary), and ushers everyone out. she
      takes the brush from the departing servant, and continues to
      brush mary's hair.

                          anne
              uch beautiful hair.

       earing anne's voice, mary freezes.

                          anne
             thank you for coming.

      mary looks up. notices anne's hands are shaking..

                          anne
             i hate how this matter has come between
             us. i wanted to come to see you after
             your daughter was born, and again when
             your husband died, but..

                           mary
             it's fine.

      mary pulls away. raises her hand..

                          mary
             leave me. please..?

      anne stares at mary, her lips trembling..

                          anne
             i'm frightened, mary. what have i done?

      mary turns away. avoids anne's eyes.
