      int. anne's cell - day
196                                                               196
      the doors to anne's cell open. anne looks up. in the doorway is
      mary. mary stares at anne..

      anne's appearance is shocking. she looks ten years older.
      haggard and lined by stress.

      anne puts on a brave face, stares back at mary.

                          mary
             oh, anne..

      the two sisters walk towards one another, and embrace. tight.
      tears run onto each other's shoulders..

                          anne
             how has it come to this?

                          mary
             ssshhhhh.
