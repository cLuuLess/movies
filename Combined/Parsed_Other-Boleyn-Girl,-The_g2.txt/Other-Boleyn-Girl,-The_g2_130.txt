      int. corridor - day
132                                                            132
      henry, along with thomas cromwell and several of his lawyers are
      walking along a corridor. they turn a corner, then stop.

      henry freezes. he's seen something. and the impact of it has
      made him stop in his tracks.

      reverse angle to reveal:

      in the gardens outside, are anne and young henry, playing.

      the king's face: it's as if all sound goes silent. he stares,
      transfixed, at the boy. he hears nothing except young henry's
      laughter. he sees nothing except young henry's golden locks.

      mary watches from a distance, her heart cracking as henry
      dismisses cromwell and the lawyers, and goes out to join anne
      and young henry.

       t seems to have a profound affect on him..
