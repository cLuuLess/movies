      the door flies open. anne is reading, alone. she looks up to see
      henry, his eyes ablaze..

                          henry
             now you will give yourself to me.

      anne looks up..

                          anne
             i thought i had made myself clear. until
             we are married, there is no questi..

                          henry
             silence! enough of your games!
                    (tearing at her dress)
             i have torn apart this country for you,
             gone against every principle in my
             heart, i've endured the doubts and
             counsel of good men and silenced them
             with the axe...just to be with you..

      henry tears her dress. he forces himself on top of her.

                          henry
             now prove to me it was worth the
             sacrifice.

      he pushes her back against a table, slamming her down, and
      enters her roughly. anne cries out in pain..

                          anne
             stop, you are hurting me..!
