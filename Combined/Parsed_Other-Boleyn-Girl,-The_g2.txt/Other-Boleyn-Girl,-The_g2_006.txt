    sir thomas and lady elizabeth stand in a corner, watching the
    party continue. elizabeth's face darkens..

                         ady elizabeth
             don't like it. it would cost a fortune
           to make our house fit for a royal visit.
           money we don't have.

           and what if thedy elizabeth(cont'd)
                        la king doesn't like her?
           or if she sleeps with him but gives him
           a girl?

                        sir thomas
           and what if you were to look on the
           bright side? just once?

    an ominous clap of thunder outside..

                        sir thomas
           risk nothing, you gain nothing.

     ady elizabeth stares at her husband..

                        lady elizabeth
            hen was it that people stopped thinking
           of ambition as a sin, and started
           thinking of it as a virtue?

                        sir thomas
           easy for you to say. you've had power
           and wealth all your life.

                        lady elizabeth
           until i married you, thomas. and i was
           happy to give it up.

    lady elizabeth turns, and walks back inside.
