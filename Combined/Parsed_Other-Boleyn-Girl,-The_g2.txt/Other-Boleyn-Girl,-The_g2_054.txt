     `slap', henry spreads out a huge architect's drawing of a
     magnificent ship on a table. he sits with sir thomas boleyn and
     the duke of norfolk.

                         henry
            the biggest warship in the fleet. thirty-
            two guns and two hundred feet long, and
            with your permission thomas..
                   (we notice sir thomas's
                    clothes have become more
                    expensive, grander)
            ..i'd like to name her after your
            daughter. the "mary boleyn".

     sir thomas looks up in disbelief..

                         sir thomas
            majesty! i'm...i'm speechless..

                    henry
        onsense. she's an angel. it's the least
       she deserves. and if there's anything
       else i can do for you, my friend..as an
       expression of my gratitude..let me know.

sir thomas's tails off. thinking..
                     s
                    sir thomas
        s it happens..there is one thing.

                    henry
       name it.

sir thomas has clearly not stopped thinking about what he saw
between george and francis weston..

                    sir thomas
        ur son, george. he's of an age now..

                    henry
       you want me to make him a match?

sir thomas bows. deadly serious..

                    sir thomas
       yes, your majesty.

                    henry
       do you have anyone in mind?

                    sir thomas
       there is one lady, sir..

                    henry
       go on..

                    sir thomas
       who i fear is too high-born for us. and
       following the unfortunate matter between
       anne and henry percy, i didn't want my
       children to overreach themselves again..

                    henry
        verreach themselves?

henry can't help smiling..

                    henry
       one is currently in the king's bed. if
       they are good enough for me, i suggest
       they're good enough for anyone else.
       so..
              (gestures)
       who is it?

over this: we hear george's distraught voice..
