     ext. palace - day
 7                                                             37
     mary and william ride through london streets escorted by
     servants bringing their belongings. they approach whitehall
     palace. armed guards slowly open the gates.

     mary's face: as the heavy gates open. she shoots a last look at
     the `free' world outside. then, she rides through the palace
     gates.

     `clank', the heavy doors shut behind her.

     the outside world has been totally sealed off. faces appear at
     palace windows, staring down at the `new arrivals'.

      mong them: is henry himself. he stares out of the window. sees
     mary. then he lets the curtain fall.
