      his private room. his sanctuary. where he took her before. the
      room to which only mary seems to have had access..

                          mary
             your majesty..
                    (falling into a deep curtsey
                     as henry closes the door
                     ensuring their privacy)
             i understand my family has offended you.
             but having taken my brother today, i beg
             you to spare my sister.

                           henry
             oh, mary...




                                                        (continued)

                    mary
       i realise you must replace anne as
       queen.
              (a beat)
       but must she die, too?

                    henry
       she has been tried and found guilty.

                    mary
       you could send her away.

                     enry
       i am bound by the law.

                    mary
       you could send her to a nunnery. no one
       would know.

                    henry
       anne? to a nunnery?

henry almost manages a smile.

                    mary
       there is precedent, my lord. louis of
       france did it, too. when his wife could
       not conceive.

                    henry
       the french queen was a blameless woman.
       your sister a witch.

                    mary
       i understand anne has offended you. i
       ask only that if there is any regret you
       might..feel yourself.

                     enry
       what?

                    mary
       for your part in the matter..

mary treads delicately. realising the very suggestion is
treason.

                    mary
       ..does not unduly colour your thinking.
       killing anne will not make it go away.
              (a beat)
       it would only make it worse.

 enry stares at mary..

                    henry
       how could i have made that mistake?

                                                  (continued)

      suddenly his eyes are full of regret. and sadness.

                          henry (cont'd)
             choosing her over you?

       enry thinks. a long silence.

                          henry
              o. i will reflect on the matter.

      mary falls on one knee. kisses his swollen, bejewelled hand in
      gratitude. henry stares, watching her as she goes.
