      int. great court - tower of london - day
184                                                            184
      anne is led into a great courtroom lit by flickering torches,
      and filled with fifty or sixty of the country's most powerful
      noblemen. anne walks to the centre of the room, surveying her
      `jurors', noting that they have remained seated..

                          anne
             it is a sad day for england when the
             nobles do not rise for their queen.

                          norfolk
             and even sadder when that same queen is
             charged with adultery and incest.

                          anne
             charged is different to convicted,
             uncle. or is it not? in this court?

      deathly silence. the clearing of throats. then with much chair
      scraping, the nobles reluctantly get to their feet..

                          norfolk
             master cromwell, read out the
             indictment..

      cromwell gets to his feet..

                          cromwell
             the charge is that in the twenty-eighth
             year of the reign of our sovereign
             henry, king of england, his wife, the
             queen, being seduced by the devil, did
             knowingly commit adultery, high treason
             and offences against god.

                          norfolk
             how do you plead?

                          anne
             not guilty, my lord.
