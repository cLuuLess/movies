     the thunder of horses' hooves. a huge cloud of dust.

     the royal standard flutters in the wind. beneath it, a soldier
     in the king's uniform, riding hard, dirt kicking up in his wake.

     the soldier is flanked by a dozen other of the king's soldiers,
     who lead a coloumn of fifty or more riders..

     it's like an army. a legion riding into battle. but it's not,
     this is just the king of england going away for the week-end.

     behind the advance party, is the king himself, (30's), handsome,
     in his prime, surrounded by a dozen or so of his closest
     courtiers, (among them the duke of norfolk), a grand, tough,
     intimidating lot.

     behind them, comes the king's confessor, a priest with a large
     ornate crucifix, a small library of religious books..

     then, in a riot of colour, come the musicians, the fool and the
     players, led by the master of the revels.

     behind them, come the squires and pages, carrying the king's
     weapons, his jousting kit, his swords, his armour, his lance,
     etc.

     then come the animals: falcons, in cages, and the hunting
     hounds, beagles and pinchers, barking in excitement, and an
     assortment of fresh horses for travelling, and hunting.

     and finally, bringing up the rear, another unit of armed guards,
     and a second standard bearer..
