     ext. hever castle - stable yard - day

     the following morning..

     thirty or more riders, stable-boys and horses are gathered. to
     one side, a deafening pack of deer-hounds, (wire-haired
     lurchers), barking frantically.

      t's a scene of great activity, excitement, and anticipation.

     the master of the horse helps henry mount his steed - the
     biggest and most glamorous stallion of all, with wonderful,
     ornate saddlery.

       number of other ladies are also going hunting, and we notice
     they ride pillion, (ie), riding on the same horse as their men,
     sitting behind them, holding onto them..

      inally, anne comes out. the king turns..

                         henry
            good morning, anne.

     anne curtseys deeply..


                                                       (continued)

                         anne
            good morning, your grace.

                         henry
             ho will you be riding with?

     it's clearly an invitation. he indicates there is room for anne
     on the back of his saddle. but anne fails to read the signal.

                         anne
            on my own your grace.

                          henry
            your own..?

     a stable-boy leads out her horse.

                         anne
            they have invented a new saddle which
            allows ladies to ride on their own.

     anne skilfully mounts the horse, and sits upright..

                         henry
             ut with no man to hold onto? how will
            you stay on the horse?

                         anne
            why? the same way you hold onto yours,
            your grace.

     a flicker behind henry's eyes. it's the first wrong move anne
     has made.

                          henry
            we'll see.

      enry yanks the reins on his horse..

                          henry
            let's away!

     anne shoots a look at mary. then follows.
