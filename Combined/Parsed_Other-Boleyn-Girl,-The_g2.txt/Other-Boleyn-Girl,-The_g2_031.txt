     william stafford watches from the doorway as the duke of
     norfolk, william carey and sir thomas smile delightedly, staring
     at mary..

                         norfolk
             ou're to pack and leave first thing in
            the morning.

     mary shoots a desperate look at her husband..

                    norfolk
       the king himself has secured you a
       position in the queen's household.

                    mary
        ut i don't want to go to court. nor
       does my husband.

silence.

                      sir thomas
           ell her.

william carey clears his throat. avoids mary's eyes..

                    william
       the king has also offered me a position.
       as gentleman of the privy council.

                      mary
       what?

                    sir thomas
       y'hear that? gentleman of the privy
       council! attending to the private and
       personal needs of his majesty himself!
       that's the inner sanctum!

mary's shell-shocked, lost for words..

                    mary
       but what about our future? here in the
       country?

                    norfolk
       put it out of your mind. from now on
       your home is at court.

                    mary
       william, please! don't you understand
       what this means?

mary stares imploringly..

                    mary
       they will separate us. put me in
       different accommodation. where the king
       can always...find me.

william carey averts his eyes..

                    norfolk
       happily your husband understands the
       value of such an opportunity.
              (a beat)
       for us all.

                         mary
            what about anne? couldn't she go
            instead?

     sir thomas's expression darkens. a flicker of pain.

                         sir thomas
            the way that girl behaved this week-end,
            she can count herself lucky she still
            has a home.
