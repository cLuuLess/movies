     mary and anne enter the bedroom. a sea of candles. mary stares
     at the bed. a child. suddenly terrified.

                         anne
            are you nervous?

                         mary
            a little.

                         anne
            you'll tell me everything in the
            morning?

                         mary
            i promise.

                         anne
            no details spared?

     the two sisters hug tightly. visibly emotional.






the door opens, and william carey appears in the doorway. anne
curtseys, gives mary a last `good luck' kiss, then goes.

mary stares at her husband.

                    mary
       hold me a moment?

william carey envelops mary with his arms..

                    mary (cont'd)
       i'm so lucky to have a man who is
       content with what he has.

mary looks at him..

                    mary (cont'd)
       you are, aren't you?

william carey smiles, looks at his gorgeous bride..

                    william
       i am the luckiest man in the world.

william reaches for the wine..

                      william (cont'd)
       drink?

mary shakes her head. but william tenderly insists..

                    william (cont'd)
       you should. it will hurt less.

mary nervously drinks..

                      william (cont'd)
       lie back.

mary lies down. then she lifts up her nightdress. william pulls
down his trousers.

mary extends her hands. inviting him to join her. william slowly
lowers himself on top of her. he enters her.

mary smiles, in anticipation of pleasure. a side to her one
might not have imagined.

but one or two strokes later, and william's knuckles whiten, his
face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her.

mary looks up. surely that wasn't it?

                      william (cont'd)
       thank you.



                                                  (continued)

  


                                                                9.


     william rolls over. mary stares. soon william snores
     contentedly. mary is wide awake. confused.

      aybe this is how it's meant to be.

                                                   fade to black:
