     int. mary's room - lying-in - evening
70                                                             70
     the king is visiting mary. he sits by her bed. they hold hands
     and are talking intimately.

     pull back to reveal:

     this is being watched by the duke of norfolk, and sir thomas
     boleyn. norfolk's face is dark and brooding..

                         norfolk
            for the moment he's still visiting mary.
            but for how long? the queen will soon
            have his head spinning with pretty
            little spanish things. not to mention
            the seymours with that girl of theirs.

     norfolk looks up...

                         norfolk
            what we need is someone from our family
            who will keep the king focused on mary,
            reminding him of her while she is
            absent.

     sir thomas is about to speak, then changes his mind.

                         norfolk
            what? speak..

                         sir thomas
            it's just...i was going to suggest anne.

                         norfolk
            you couldn't control that girl last
            time. what makes you think it would be
            any different now?

                         sir thomas
            i've had favourable reports from the
            dowager queen in france. it seems she is
            quite changed.
