     int. royal chapel - day
 5                                                               45
     in the royal chapel: the archbishop solemnly performs the
     eucharist, breaking bread and making wine from blood..

     but, in full view of all those in the chapel, the king continues
     to stare at mary.

      inally, she looks up. their eyes meet. mary blushes, averts her
     gaze. but then, for the first time, she reciprocates. and looks
     back.

     this is witnessed by the queen, and further back, by the duke of
     norfolk and sir thomas boleyn.

     everyone is pretending to focus on the mass. but none of them
     can concentrate..
