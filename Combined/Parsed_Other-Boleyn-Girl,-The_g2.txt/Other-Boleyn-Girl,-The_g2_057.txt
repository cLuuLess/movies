     henry and mary make love. two people giving everything of
     themselves..

     hours later: they lie together, enveloped in one another's arms.
     mary is awake. the king asleep in her arms. she lovingly strokes
     his hair. watches him breathe.

     her face is glowing. content. and the look in her eyes tells us
     more eloquently and unequivocally than any sonnet..
