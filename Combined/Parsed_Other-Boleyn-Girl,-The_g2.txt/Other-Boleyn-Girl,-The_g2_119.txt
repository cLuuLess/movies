      `crash', the door flies open. sir thomas and norfolk burst in.
      anne is in the bath. she covers herself..

                          sir thomas
             `mary talbot'.

                          anne
             who?

                           sir thomas
             mary talbot!! the girl that married
             henry percy. it seems she has petitioned
             the king, demanding a divorce from her
             husband( on the grounds..
                     he can hardly bring himself
                     to say the words)
             ...that his prior betrothal to you was
             actually..
                    (his knuckles whiten)
             ..consummated.

      anne's eyes widen in horror..`what?'

                          sir thomas
             i knew this would come back to haunt us!

                          anne
             i must go to the king.

                          sir thomas
             no! he doesn't want to see you! or hear
             a word from your lips! he's far too
             angry.
                     a beat)
             it seems the only boleyn he will speak
             to, the only person who's testimony he
             will trust in this matter..
                    (a beat)
             ...is mary.

      anne's face. a dagger in her heart.
