      anne stands by a window, staring out. her hands wringing with
      anxiety. mary is in another corner, tending to baby elizabeth..
                           a
                            anne

             you.

      anne reaches for mary's hand. their hands touch. briefly. then
      mary pulls away her hand, still not quite ready to forgive..

      and goes to tend to the crying baby elizabeth..
