     int. henry's apartment - day
62                                                             62
     shooting through a half-open door..

     sir thomas and the duke of norfolk are having a private audience
     with the king. sir thomas whispers something in henry's ear..

     (we do not hear the words - we do not need to).

     henry's face breaks out in a smile. he delightedly shakes sir
     thomas's hand. over this: the sound of a voice..

                         sir thomas (o.s.)
            keep them shut...still shut..
