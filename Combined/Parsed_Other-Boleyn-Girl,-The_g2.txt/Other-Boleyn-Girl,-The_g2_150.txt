      int. anne's bedroom - day

      sir thomas boleyn, norfolk, george boleyn and mary are watching
      intently as anne is being examined by several physicians.

       nbearable tension. finally a physician straightens, turns to
      face the family..

                          sir thomas
             and..?

      the physician's face: he nods.
