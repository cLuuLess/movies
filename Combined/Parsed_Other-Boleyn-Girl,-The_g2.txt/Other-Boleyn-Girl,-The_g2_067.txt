     an archery competition is in progress. but henry pays no
     attention. he sits listlessly to one side. ill-tempered and
     missing mary.

      mong the guests are sir john seymour and his children. they
     notice the king, all alone. they talk among themselves.

     sensing an opportunity, sir john seymour advances, and presents
     his pretty daughter jane to the king.

     the duke of norfolk, (never far away), notices how modestly and
     demurely young jane seymour flirts.

     she has been well trained.

     but she makes no impact on henry. he waves the seymours away.
     not remotely interested.

      or the moment.
