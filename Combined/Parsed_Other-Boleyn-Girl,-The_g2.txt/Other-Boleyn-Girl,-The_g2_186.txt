      int. courtroom - day
188                                                              188
      anne watches on as each lord takes it in turn to get to his
      feet, and deliver his verdict. first cromwell, then the
      seymours, then henry percy..

      the verdicts rain down on anne, `guilty, guilty, guilty', going
      round the courtroom, until they reach the duke of norfolk. anne
      meets the eyes of her uncle..

                          norfolk
                    (unflinching)
             guilty.

      norfolk stares at anne. not a hint of compassion..

                          norfolk
             in which case, the burden falls on me to
             pass sentence.
