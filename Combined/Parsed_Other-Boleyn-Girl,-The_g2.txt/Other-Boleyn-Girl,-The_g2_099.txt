      mary is leaving court. pale. weak. her belongings have been
      packed into boxes. ahead of her, the baby is being carried by
      midwives, led by william stafford.

      mary walks across a courtyard, then stops in her tracks.

       ver by the stables: the king and anne are mounting horses to go
      riding together. henry lifts anne up into the saddle behind him,
      (how she has learned!). anne holds tight, her arms wrapped
      around his waist..

      at that moment, anne looks over and sees mary. their eyes meet.
      they stare for a beat, then..

      anne kicks henry's horse, `hah!', and they ride out. galloping
      into the distance.

      mary's face: fighting to hold onto her dignity. william stafford
      watches her, his eyes burning with sympathy.

      reverse angle: to reveal, this is all being watched by queen
      katherine, from a palace window above..

      queen katherine turns, and coldly lets the curtain drop..
