     the entire boleyn family is nervously assembled outside the
     house, (which we notice has been transformed at great cost. huge
     marquees in the gardens. fountains. additional staff. smart
     uniforms. new extensions to the stables and kitchens).

     mary is discreetly hidden, among the crowds. anne is pride of
     place. visibly nervous. sir thomas and lady elizabeth are beside
     her. the proud parents.

     everyone bows deeply in deference as the king arrives.

                         sir thomas
            your majesty, you are most welcome.

     the king dismounts athletically. his dogs are unleashed, bark
     excitedly..

                         henry
            sir thomas.
                    kisses hand)
            lady elizabeth..

     a servant in stiff, new uniform, with trembling hands, brings
     wine on a tray. henry takes a glass..

                         sir thomas
            may i present my son, george.

     george, visibly nervous, bows deeply from the neck. but henry's
     attention has been caught by a beautiful woman behind george..

                                                       (continued)

                         henry
                   (while staring at mary)
            your uncle tells me i should have you at
            court. should i?

                         george
            it would be a great honour, sir.

     mary dutifully, modestly averts her eyes..

                         sir thomas
            and our daughter, anne.

      enry turns to see anne.

                          enry
            no one said anything of a daughter.

     anne curtseys deeply...

                         henry
            had we known, we might have come sooner.

                         anne
            your majesty..

                         sir thomas
            perhaps you'll allow anne to show you
            around our modest house?

                            henry
            a pleasure.

     anne offers henry her hand. he takes it, then leads anne away.
     mary shoots anne a look, `good luck'.

     anne leads the king through the house. she is followed at a
     distance by sir thomas boleyn. and watched by mary and george
     from a gallery above..

                         anne
            here is the library.

            charming.

                            henry
            lovely..

     henry looks up, his eye having been caught by something..

                           henry
            what's that?

     henry points at an emblem above a doorway..

                           anne
                falcon, your grace.

                         henry
            i can see that. but what's it doing
            there? more to the point..
                   (turns 360)
            ..not just there, but in every corner in
            the house?

            perhaps because falcons are vaguely
            associative with field sports - field
            sports with aristocracy - and in the
            absence of a genuine coat of arms..
                   (shrugs)
            ...a man with ambition will do the
            strangest things.

     henry is delighted by anne's candour..

                          enry
            that's a sharp tongue you have.

            i wonder what it might say about me
            behind my back?

                         anne
            oh, his majesty has nothing to fear from
            me. unless he fears an excess of
            compliments.

     henry smiles, visibly charmed..

                         henry
            really? and what would they be..?

     watching from above, mary smiles to herself, "well done, anne",
     as henry and anne continue down a corridor..
