      a darkened room. anne screams out. she is in the middle of
      giving birth. with a bone-chilling scream, a head appears..

                          midwife
             and again, one more..

      anne pushes again. mary holds her. anne howls in agony. her
      nails dig into the sheets. a last, primal, blood-curdling roar
      of pain..

                          midwife
             it's done, your majesty..!

                            mary
             well done...

      physicians and midwives swarm around the baby. anne, despite
      having lost a great deal of blood, tries to sit up..

                            anne
             and..?

                            mary
             it's a girl!

      mary takes the child from the midwife, holds it for anne.

                          mary
             a beautiful, healthy girl.

      anne is overcome by maternal love, but realises what this will
      mean. she stares at the baby. fear filling her eyes..

                            anne
             a girl?
