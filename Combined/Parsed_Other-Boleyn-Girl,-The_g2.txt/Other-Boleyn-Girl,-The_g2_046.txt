     mary lies in bed, in a room covered in flowers. she admires a
     beautiful necklace in a box, and a handwritten letter from the
     king. we can see from mary's face how much she likes it.

     presently, urgent `knock', `knock', at the door. mary's eyes
     widen in excitement. the king?

     she hurriedly closes the necklace's box. tucks the letter away
     in a drawer.

     she gets out of bed. anxiously straightens her hair, then goes
     to the door, to find..

     george, her brother, who bursts in..

                         mary
            george? it's the middle of the night.

        he's married henry percy!

                     mary
               (horrified)
       what?

                    george
       in secret. without telling anyone!

mary's face falls..

                      mary
       oh, no...!

                    george
               tailing off)
       you don't look pleased.

                    mary
       why would i be pleased?

                    george
       it would make her the future duchess of
       northumberland. our sister!

                    mary
       but they'll never allow it, don't you
       see? he's already precontracted to mary
       talbot, and if word of the consummation
       gets out her reputation will be ruined..

mary pulls back her sheets..

                    mary
       ...i have to tell father. before it's
       too late..

                      george
       what?

george watches mary go to the door..

                    george
       mary..! wait! come back!
