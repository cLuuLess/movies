      anne and mary are together. anne is combing her hair. strands of
      it come loose in her hands. her eyes are hollow with stress. her
      skin pale and covered in a film of perspiration..

                          anne
             i struck him today. what am i doing? i
             am destroying this all on my own..

      anne looks left and right. makes sure no one is within earshot.
      goes to check outside her door, then returns..

                          anne
             i can't sleep at night! and without
             sleep i cannot think!

                          mary
             oh, anne..

                          anne
              nd it's getting more and more difficult
             to arouse him. some nights he cannot do
             it...at all. i have to resort to ever
             more disgusting...then he hates himself
             in the morning...hates me even more for
             what i made him do...

      anne eyes stare. she rocks back and forth..

                          anne
             it's slipping away, mary. i can feel it.

      mary takes anne's hand. envelops it in hers.
