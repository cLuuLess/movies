     spanish. surrounded by other ladies in waiting, (mostly high-
     born, spanish, and the queen's age). a servant announces..

                    queen katherine
       really? but i was not expecting anyone.

                     ervant
       appointed by...his majesty the king.

                    queen katherine
       by my husband? really?

the air crackles with tension. it's school bullying.

                    queen katherine
       well, then she must be some kind of
       gift. he must have seen in her some
       special talent that would please me.
       tell me. what special talent is it that
       you have?
               with icy contempt)
       apart from your obvious youth and
       beauty?
t
 errified, mary stammers..

                    mary
       i...i..

        oetry, perhaps?

                    mary
       n-no..

                    queen katherine
       or dressmaking?

                    mary
       i..i..

                    queen katherine
       music! that's it! you compose? or sing?

                    mary
        ..i'm afraid not. your majesty.

                    queen katherine
       come, you're too modest.
               turns to a musician)
       signor vasquez.

the spanish guitarist obliges by starting to play a well-known
tune of the period..

                    mary
       no..really..i beg you, your majesty.

                         queen katherine
                   (barks, suddenly terrifying)
            i command you to sing!!!

     mary flinches. blushing deeply, her skin glowing with
     perspiration and terror, she begins to sing..

     normally she sings well. but her voice now is strangled with
     fear. mary stands rigid, her knuckles whiten, nails digging into
     her hands, drawing blood.

     finally, mary finishes. the room is silent. all eyes on
     katherine, who stares coldly. a formidable adversary.

                         queen katherine
            bravo! a nightingale!
                   (the cruel satisfaction of
                    victory)
            welcome at court!
