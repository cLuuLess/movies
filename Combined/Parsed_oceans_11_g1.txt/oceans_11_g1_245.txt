int. interrogation room
284
bruiser throws a mean left hook across danny's face as
the door swings open and benedict steps in.  bruiser sees
him and steps away, toweling off his bloodied knuckles.
benedict studies danny:  the man is a bloody mess, head
rolling, eyes puffed up.
benedict
wake him up.
the goons step in, slap danny alert.  at last, danny
recognizes benedict in the room.
danny
(a little punchy)
heya, benedict... how's the other
fight going?
benedict keeps his cool.
benedict
did you have a hand in this?
(beat)
did you?
danny
did i have a hand in what?
benedict scrutinizes danny:  is he bluffing?  he looks at
bruiser, then danny again, and decides:  no.
benedict
get him out of here.
as the goons scoop him up and drag him out, danny catches
bruiser's eye for just a moment.  and barely winks.
