a tailor fits saul for the finest suits tishkoff's money
can buy.  as saul smoothes out a coat sleeve...
saul
this is nice material.
danny
it's armani, saul.
saul
it's very nice.
saul's not fooling anyone:  he's scared, right down to
his florsheims.  danny nods to the tailor:  "give us a
moment."
danny
saul, you sure you're ready to do
this?
saul turns away, and when he faces danny again, his
entire aspect has changed:  his features stone, his eyes
icicles.
saul
if you ever question me again,
daniel, you won't wake up the
following morning.
they exchange a long, fierce glance; saul's eyes never
waver.
danny
you're ready.
danny signals tishkoff:  let's pay, and saul immediately
slumps into his old self.  to a mirror, he practices...
saul
hello.  my name is lyman zerga...
(this time a little
 deeper)
my name is lyman zerga...
