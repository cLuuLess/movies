scientists demonstrate the pinch, a lithium wire in a
glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator.
basher (v.o.)
a pinch is the equivalent of a
cardiac arrest for any broad-band
electrical circuitry.  or better
yet:  a pinch is a bomb... but
without the bomb.  every time a
nuclear weapon detonates, it
unleashes an electromagnetic pulse
which shuts down any power source
within its vicinity.  that tends
not to matter in most cases
because the nuclear weapon
destroys everything you might need
power for anyway.  now a pinch
creates a similar electromagnetic
pulse, but without the headache of
mass destruction and death.  so
instead of hiroshima, you get the
seventeenth century.
