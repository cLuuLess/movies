benedict
they're very beautiful.  a gift.
saul stares at him:  none of your fucking business.
benedict
can you lift them out, please?
saul lifts the velvet tray out of the case, and benedict
pats down the case's interior.  saul replaces the tray.
benedict
alright, mr. zerga.  i acknowledge
that the case does not contain any
dangerous or illicit material.  i
further agree to take custody of
your case for a twenty-four hour
period to store in our secured
vault.  while i cannot permit you
to accompany the case to the
vault...
saul
why not?
benedict
insurance, for one.  security,
another.  and i don't trust you.
there is a knock at the door, and walsh the casino
manager enters.  he speaks low in benedict's ear.
walsh (manager)
i put two plainclothes on ocean.
he's at the keno bar now.
walsh nods, and benedict turns back to saul.
benedict
mr. zerga, this is mr. walsh, my
casino manager.  if you will allow,
he will arrange for your briefcase
to be stored inside our vault while
you watch on a security monitor.
(beat)
those are my terms.  yes or no?
saul and benedict eyeball each other.
saul
you leave me no choice.
saul unlocks the cuff from his wrist.
