at the bar, rusty orders a double.  he needs it.
bartender
(shouting over music)
how's the game going?!!
rusty
it's been the longest hour of
my life.
bartender
what?!
rusty
(at the same volume)
i'm running away with your wife.
the bartender, not able to hear him, smiles and flashes
a thumbs-up before moving away.
bartender
cool, man!
behind the bar two go-go dancers writhe behind red-light-
district windows, and rusty catches his own fatigued
expression in their reflection.  then, out the corner
of his eye, he catches sight of a man passing through
the pulsating crowd.  someone familiar to him.  he
follows.
