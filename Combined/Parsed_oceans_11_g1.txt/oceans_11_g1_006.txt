... and his wingtip lands squarely on plush red
carpeting.
as we pull up to danny's face and spin around him, we
hear, then see the buzz of a casino floor:  the hum of
conversation, the ding-ding-ding and thunk-thunk-thunk
from the slots, the brisk whir of shuffled cards.
and to danny, it's a hearth and fire and a comfy chair
and a snifter of brandy.  he's home.

danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for
someone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- but
without success.  he turns his attention back to his
cards, and the cards of the dealer.
nine-ten.  stay.  dealer -- seventeen.  danny wins.
king-four.  dealer shows a six.  stick.  dealer busts.

quickly hides his astonishment.
frank
i beg your pardon, sir.  you must
have me confused with someone
else.  my name is ramon.  see?
he taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is
the most african-looking ramon you've ever seen.  a pit
boss circles close by and glares at them both.
danny
my mistake...
(collecting his chips,
 doubled)
table's cold anyway.
frank
you might try the lounge at the
grand, sir.  it gets busy around
one.
danny
(as he goes)
thanks.
