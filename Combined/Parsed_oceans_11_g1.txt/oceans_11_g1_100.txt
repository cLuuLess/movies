flashback - int. vegas sewers - that afternoon

a cabal of city engineers investigates subterranean fuse
boxes, and basher tails them, hiding near a waterfall of
effluent.
basher (v.o.)
they did exactly what i planned to
do.  only they did it by accident.
now they know their weakness.  and
they're fixing it.
an echoing footstep draws the attention of the city
engineers, and basher retreats into the waterfall.
