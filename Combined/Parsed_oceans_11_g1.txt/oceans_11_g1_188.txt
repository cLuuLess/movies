saul's briefcase inches closer to falling off the cash cart,
which of course would trigger the floor sensor and terminate
this heist here and now.  yen's hand stretches farther out to
grab it, pushing up just a little more on the false lid
until...
... the briefcase tumbles toward the floor...
... but not before yen snags the handcuff chain attached to
it and swings it round.  he's got it.  that threat over, he
throws open the cash cart lid and takes the biggest breath
of his life.
