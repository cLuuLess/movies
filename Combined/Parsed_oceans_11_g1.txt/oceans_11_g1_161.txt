linus immediately reaches up to the elevator's ceiling,
rips down its panel to reveal a trap door.  as he starts
to push it open...
... a hand yanks it free from above.  it's danny.
danny
you didn't really think i was
gonna sit this one out, did you?
linus
what, didn't you trust me?
danny

he reaches down and pulls linus, wide-eyed, up to the
roof of the elevator.
