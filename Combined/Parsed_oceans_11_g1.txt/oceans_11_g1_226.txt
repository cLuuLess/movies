ext. bellagio casino - night

the white van (now clean of the "nevada telecom" sign)
idles before the bellagio, its windows tinted, the
driver's identity inscrutable.  it is swarmed by
security, but they maintain a wide perimeter.
rusty (v.o.)
your guards will load the bags
into the van's rear.  if anyone so
much as approaches the driver's
door, we blow everything.

the guards carry out the money and load it into the van's
rear.  there, they find a video camera mounted within the
back seat of the van monitoring them.  still they cannot
catch a glimpse of the driver.  they close the van doors.

the white van departs the valet station in front,
clandestinely shadowed by five sedans.  meanwhile, behind
the casino, a swat van arrives and unloads its squad.

now what?
rusty (v.o.)
now, when i get word that the van
hasn't been followed, that the
money is secure, my men will exit
the building, and once their
safety is confirmed, you'll get
your vault back.
