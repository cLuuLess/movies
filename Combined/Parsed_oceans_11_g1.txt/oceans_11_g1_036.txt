a waiter serves coffee to rusty and saul.
rusty

at the track, saul.
saul
a man shouldn't drink on the job.
rusty
(re:  race)
who we rooting for here?
saul
number four.
there's the bell; the electronic rabbit is released and
the dogs break out of the gate.  from this point on
saul's eyes never leave the race.
saul
you gonna ask me?  or should i
just say no and get it over with?
rusty
saul, you're the best there is.
you're in cooperstown.  what do
you want?
saul

got wall-to-wall and a goldfish,
i'm seeing a nice lady, she works
the unmentionables counter at
macy's.  i've changed.

they watch the race.
rusty
that your hound way in the back
there?
saul
he breaks late.  everyone knows
this.
on the track:  the dogs are now coming around the back
stretch, and the crowd on the bleachers rises, cheering.
saul
you gonna treat me like a grownup
at least?  tell me what the scam
is?
under the noise:  rusty leans in and whispers in saul's
ear.  saul's eyes widen, then glaze over as all around
him people are standing and shouting.
rusty places an envelope in saul's lap, then gets up and
walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish
line... last by several lengths.
saul considers his options.  in one hand:  a fan of
losing tickets.  in the other (courtesy of rusty):  a
ticket to las vegas.
danny (v.o.)
and saul makes ten.
