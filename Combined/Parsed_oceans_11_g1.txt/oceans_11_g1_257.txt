ext. front gate - minimum-security prison - day
297
superimpose:  three to six months later.
the great metal gate opens once more, revealing danny
ocean in its frame again, ready for release.
he looks forward -- no one's there to greet him, and the
view of new jersey looks no brighter than it did before.
he takes his first step into free america...
... to discover rusty leaning against the prison wall.
beyond him sits his second-hand mercedes from l.a.
rusty
looking for someone?
danny
thirteen million and you drive
that piece of shit cross country
to pick me up?
rusty
hello to you, too.
they shakes hands.  rusty looks danny over.
rusty
your hair's grayer.

danny
your eyes got closer together.
(beat)
how's life?
rusty
life... is a roomful of pillows.

moving with danny and rusty toward the mercedes, together
again.
rusty
where do you want to go first?
danny
to a phone.
rusty had anticipated this.
rusty
i stopped and picked up your
personal effects, put them in the
back seat.
danny
my what?
danny gets to the passenger door and looks in to see tess
sitting in the back.  she smiles at him.
danny
(smiling back,
 then)
i'm not sure these belong to me.
tess
sure they do.
danny and rusty get in.  danny kisses tess.  rusty starts
the car.
danny
we need to find rusty a girl.
rusty
there's a women's prison just down
the road...

he drives off.  in the back, danny takes tess's hand in
his.  notices a silver wedding band on it.
danny

tess

danny

tess

as they drive away...
... another car starts its engine begins to follow.  at
the wheel:  benedict's goons.
