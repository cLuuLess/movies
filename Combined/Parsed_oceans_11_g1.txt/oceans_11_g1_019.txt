int. library tower - 40th floor corridor - night
19
lights out on the 40th.  engraved brass announces:  j.a.
kuehn & associates, architects.
two flashlight beams strafe wood-paneled, elegant
offices:  danny and rusty on late-night reconnaissance.
as danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints, rusty
passes the time switching papers from a desk's in box to
its out box.
at last, danny finds the right set of blueprints and
drapes it across the desk; we, however, never see it.
danny
the vault at the bellagio.
a beat as rusty scans the document, then another
underneath it.
rusty
if i'm reading these right -- and
i think that i am -- this is
probably the least accessible
vault ever designed.
(beat)
oops.  actually, you know what,
i'm wrong.  it's definitely the
least accessible vault ever
designed.
danny
yep.
rusty's brow furrows just a little.

rusty
you said three casinos...
danny
(flips to next
 blueprint)
these feed into the cages at both
the mirage and the m.g.m. grand.
(tapping vault)
but every dime ends up here.
rusty
the bellagio, mirage, and... these
are terry benedict's places.
danny
yes, they are.  think he'll mind?
rusty
more than somewhat.
20
at 40th floor elevator bay
20
no ding.  the elevator just arrives.  its doors part to
reveal a security guard within, here to make his tour; a
large fellow, he has to duck to exit.
21
back with danny and rusty
21
as danny rolls up the set of blueprints, rusty considers
the plan (which, in our absence, danny has pitched him).
rusty
you'd need at least a dozen guys,
doing a combination of cons.
danny
like what, you think?
rusty
well, off the top of my head, i'd
say you're looking at a boesky, a
jim brown, a miss daisy, two
jethros, and a leon spinks.  oh,
and the biggest ella fitzgerald
ever.
(beat)
where do you think you're gonna get
the money to back this?

danny
as long as we're hitting these
three casinos, we'll get our
bankroll.  terry benedict has a
list of enemies.
rusty
but does he have enemies with
loose cash and nothing to lose...
(smiles, realizing)
aha.
danny
(smiles, too)
aha.
rusty
reuben.
22
moving with security guard
22
as he approaches danny's and rusty's voices...
23
back with danny and rusty
23
danny
so...
rusty
so, here's what i think:  you
should take this plan, kick it
around for a week or two.  sleep
on it.  turn it over in your head.
then:  never bring it up to me
again.
danny
uh-huh.  so what are you saying?
rusty
i'm saying:  this is like trying
to build a house of cards on the
deck of a speeding boat.
danny
really?  i thought it was much
harder than that --
suddenly the security guard's flashlight beam hits them
square in the eyes.  danny and rusty put their hands up
to block the light.
danny
jesus, oscar, lower it a little,
will ya?

security guard
sorry.
(lowers beam)
you two done up here?  find what
you wanted?
danny
yeah, thanks.  you mind if we
borrow a couple drawings for the
night?  make some copies.
security guard
whatever you need.
danny withdraws his money clip, peels off a couple
hundreds, and buries them in the security guard's hand.
danny
'preciate it.
24
at 40th floor elevator bay
24
danny and rusty wait for an elevator.  when its doors
open, rusty stops danny from boarding.
rusty
i need a reason.  and don't say
money.
(beat)
why do this?
danny
why not do it?
rusty stares at him:  enough bullshitting around.
danny
because yesterday i walked out of
the joint wearing my entire
wardrobe and you're colddecking
teenbeat coverboys.
(beat)
because the house always wins.
you play long enough, never
changing stakes, the house takes
you.  unless, when that special
hand comes around, you bet big.
and then you take the house.
a beat.  rusty smiles.

rusty
you're been practicing that
speech, haven't you?
danny
a little.  did i rush it?  it felt
like i rushed it.
rusty
no, it was good.
they step aboard the elevator.  as the door closes:
rusty
i wonder what reuben will say?
danny and rusty look at each other.

tishkoff (v.o.)
you're out of your goddamn minds.
