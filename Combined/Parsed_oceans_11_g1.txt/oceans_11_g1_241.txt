carried through the bellagio casino, held by the swat
leader leading his men out (now eight in all), and at

it's rusty, in full regalia, leading livingston, turk,
saul, frank, basher, yen and linus out of the casino,
each dressed as a swat member, each carrying a duffel bag
with nearly $20 million dollars inside.
as we pass each man, under the hum of the casino, we see:
