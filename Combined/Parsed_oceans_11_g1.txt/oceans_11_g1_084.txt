rusty and linus watch the entrance:  no one enters.
linus
give him another ten seconds.
around the corner comes benedict, carrying his black
portfolio.
linus
as i said:  a machine.
rusty
and that portfolio contains the
codes to all the cage doors?

linus
two minutes after they've been
changed, he's got 'em in hand.
(beat)
i'll tell you:  you guys picked
a helluva target.  he is as smart
and ruthless as they come.  the
last guy caught cheating here,
benedict not only sent him up for
ten years, he got the bank to
seize the guy's home and
bankrupted --
rusty
-- his brother-in-law's tractor
dealership, i heard.
linus
he doesn't just go after your
knees, he goes after your
livelihood.  and everyone-you-
ever-met's livelihood.
rusty
you scared?
linus
you suicidal?
rusty
only in the morning.
(beat)
now what?
linus
now comes the girl... if she comes
in after he does, that means
they're in a snit.
rusty
where's she come from?
linus
the museum downstairs.  she's the
curator there.  wait... here she
is.  you'll like this.
rusty looks up as...
... a beautiful woman (the one danny saw on benedict's
arm in the new york times photo) appears.  elegantly
dressed, a knockout, she moves very much in her own
private space.  and rusty's face just about drops at the
sight of her.

 about this, very
 certain and very
 upset)
her name is tess.
