ext. paradiso hotel (on strip) - day
112
just down the block from the terry benedict trinity
stands (for a few remaining moments) the edifice of the
paradiso, reuben tishkoff's bankrupted hotel-casino.
a crowd has gathered to witness its destruction:  terry
benedict, for one, his finger on the button and his face
in the spotlight; tess another, standing (near)by her
man; danny, too, hidden within the masses, eyes fixed on
his ex; and linus, who keeps a steady bead on danny.

... and here's reuben tishkoff,
former owner of the paradiso, come
to bid farewell to his fabled
resort and wish terry benedict all
the best with his future plans for
the property...
terry greets reuben before the tv cameras and newspaper
reporters, and everyone's smiling and shaking hands, but
behind those smiles and under their breaths...
benedict
good to see you.
reuben
go shit in your mouth.
tess, her eyes roaming the crowd, finds a pair staring
back at her:  danny's.  she holds his glance a moment --
long enough for both linus and benedict to notice --
before turning away, to...
... benedict, who puts his public smile back on and steps
up to a podium alongside mike tyson and lennox lewis, and
together they all put their hands on "the plunger" and
benedict leans into a microphone...
benedict
i hope there's as much dynamite in
the paradiso as there will be in
this saturday's fight.
... and -- whoomph -- the plunger comes down and -- write
your own onomatopoeia here -- the paradiso implodes.
reuben wipes a tear from his eye.
reuben
g'bye, honey...
