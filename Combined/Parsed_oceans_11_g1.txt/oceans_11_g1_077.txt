int. limousine - day
91
saul's dressed completely (and immaculately) now in
armani, with his hair slicked back, a brief moustache on
his lip, and impenetrably dark glasses riding the bridge
of his nose.  he continues to practice, his accent even
deeper now and specifying no geographic origin -- could
be scottish, could be israeli...
saul
my name is lyman zerga... my name
is lyman zerga...
danny passes him an envelope full of $100 bills.
danny
there's a little over twenty grand
there, saul.  try to make it last.
saul pats down his pockets for something he can't find...
saul
you seen my...
danny
(handing him rolaids)
bought you a fresh roll.
the limo pulls to a stop, and outside there is a flurry
of footsteps before saul's door swings open, and turk and
virgil (both costumed as bodyguards) stand waiting for
him.
virgil
mr. zerga, we're here.
danny
good luck, lyman.
saul
(hesitates, then gets
 out)
luck is for losers.
