turk and virgil are still wrestling as the trio appears.
danny, basher and yen pile in the back...

danny
wait a minute.
turk brakes, and they're not.
danny
where's linus?
everyone realizes:  he's not here.  just then:
sirens and alarms and lights come to life.  uh-oh.
danny spins to look out the back of the van, basher by
his side.  his eyes scan the compound, then:
danny
there he is.
danny's pov
of the lab, and its beveled-glass stairwell.  linus
scrambles up its steps, a flight ahead of a duo of chasing
guards.  as he ascends out of sight...
danny shifts his focus to -
danny's pov
the other side of the building, and two more guards
arriving on the roof and moving toward the staircase:
linus will be trapped.
back to scene
danny, basher, and yen squat side-by-side-by-side,
watching all this.  yen makes a colorful observation about
linus's predicament; of course, no one understands it.
virgil (o.s.)
one of us should help him.
basher
(who speaks danny's mind)
then there'll be two of us who
need saving.
danny
he knows where we are.

danny's pov
both sets of guards appear on the rooftop, and find no
linus between them -- he's disappeared.
turk (o.s.)
where'd he go?
back to scene
danny and basher slowly turn:  turk and virgil crouch
inches behind them, wanting to spectate as well.
turk
(off danny's look)
what?
(then, realizing their
 goof, to his brother,
 remonstratively)
would you -- shouldn't someone be
behind the wheel?
crash!
