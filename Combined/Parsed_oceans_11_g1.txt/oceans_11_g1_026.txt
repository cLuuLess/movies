close on a souped-up tractor-wheeled monster truck, its
engine roaring before a starting line, itching to cross
it.  now take a step back...
that souped-up monster truck stands a foot-and-a-half off
the ground and sprouts an antenna from its back bumper.
it's a remote-controlled toy.
the roaring engine comes from the vehicle next to it:  an
actual monster truck.  both vehicles peer down the track
at a finish line a hundred yards away.  this is a race.
the drivers stare each other down:  turk (behind the
wheel of the truck) and virgil (track-side, remote
control in hand) malloy.  they're nice boys.  really.
peckerwoods, sure, but nice.

i talked to the malloys yesterday.
danny (v.o.)
the mormon twins?
rusty (v.o.)
they're both in salt lake city,
six months off the job.  i got the
sense they're having trouble
filling the hours.
lights flash red-to-yellow-to-green and while the truck
coats rubber on the track, virgil's toy zips to a lead.
it's looking to be an embarrassment for turk until he
jerks his wheel a little and -- ka-thunk -- flattens his
brother's vehicle.
virgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry.
danny (v.o.)
electronics?
