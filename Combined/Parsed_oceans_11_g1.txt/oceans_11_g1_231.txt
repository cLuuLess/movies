closely to the swat frequency.
swat frequency (v.o.)
(leader's voice)
first wave, in!  second wave, now!
(there is running,
 panting, then linus's
 voice, distant and
 panicked)
guys, someone's here!
(leader's voice)
take him down!  now!
a brief spurt of gunfire, then... barrroooooom!
dead silence in the eye in the sky.  slim stares deep
into a monitor's dark pitch.  then...
swat frequency (v.o.)
(leader's voice)
lights!  we need power now!
fat flips the power back on, and on the monitors...
... visions of destruction down below... smoke fills the
vault as two swat members push through it... other swat
members help evacuate the unconscious guards...
benedict
(into intercom)

swat leader (v.o.)

oh, jesus... if there was anyone

benedict

 to slim)

cameras.
