ext. minimum-security prison - front gate - afternoon
5
a sign reads:  "new jersey state minimum-security
correctional facility."  someone has graffitied below it:
"if you were in prison, you'd be home now."
the great metal door opens, and danny stands within its
frame, ready for release.  (if it matters -- and if you
notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.)
he hovers there for a moment, on the precipice of
freedom.  the wind whistles a little on the other side of
the gate, and the view ahead is not pleasant (new
jersey):  life is hard out there.
but danny musters his courage, then takes his first step
into free america...
