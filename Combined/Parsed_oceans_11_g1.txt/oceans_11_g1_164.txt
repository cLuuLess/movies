earlier that night, just after rusty kicked danny off
the job.  as linus watches from inside, deaf to their
conversation, blind to their expressions, danny and
rusty confer.
danny
you think the kid bought it?
rusty
hell, i think reuben bought it,
and he knew we were screwing
around.
(beat)
you sure about this?
danny
(nods)
bobby caldwell threw me into the
pool first time.  least i could do
is give his kid a push.
