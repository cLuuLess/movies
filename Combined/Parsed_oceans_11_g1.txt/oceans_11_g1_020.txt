ext. tishkoff's opulent back yard (las vegas) - day
25
reuben tishkoff, the grimace of a man in mid-movement,
forever cemented on his face, scrutinizes his two lunch
guests (danny and rusty) at his poolside.
tishkoff
are you listening to me?  you are,
both of you, nuts.  i know more
about casino security than any man
alive.  i invented it, and it
cannot be beaten.  they got
cameras, they got watchers, they
got locks, they got timers, they
got vaults.  they got enough armed
personnel to occupy paris.  okay,
bad example...
danny
it's never been tried.
tishkoff
oh, it's been tried.  a few guys
even came close.  you know the
three most successful robberies in
vegas history?

he takes almost three steps before five security men leap
at him and -- freeze frame on his wide-eyed expression of
horror...
tishkoff (v.o.)
number three.  the bronze medal.
pencilneck grabs a lockbox at the
sands.  he got two steps closer to
the door than any living soul
before him.
