mr. ocean, what we're trying to
find out is:  was there a reason
you chose to commit this crime, or
was there a reason why you simply
got caught this time?
danny
my wife left me.  i was upset.  i
got into a self-destructive
pattern.

board member #3
if released, is it likely you
would fall back into a similar
pattern?
danny
she already left me once.  i don't
think she'll do it again just for
kicks.
glances dart between the board members.
board member #1

would do if released?
danny considers.
