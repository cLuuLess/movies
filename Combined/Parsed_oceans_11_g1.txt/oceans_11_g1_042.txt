int. murphy's bar - five minutes later

on a tabletop:  the gucci wallet beside a half-drunk
guinness.  linus enters the front door, cases the joint,
spots the wallet on the table, and danny behind it.
danny
hi, linus.  sit down.
linus
who are you?
danny
a friend of bobby caldwell's.  sit
down.
linus balks, prideful, but sense finds a way, and he
sits.
danny
bobby told me about you.  said you
were the best set of hands he ever
saw.  didn't expect to find you
working wallets on the subway.
linus
that wasn't work, that was
practice.
danny reaches into his jacket and sets a plane ticket on
the table.  he keeps his hand over it.

danny
you're either in or out, right
now.
linus
what is it?
danny
a plane ticket.  a job offer.
linus
you're pretty trusting pretty
fast.
danny
bobby has every faith in you.
linus
fathers are like that.
(off danny's reaction)
he didn't tell you?
(as danny shakes

 his head)
he doesn't like me trading on his
name.
danny
you do this job, he'll be trading
on yours.
linus
what if i say no?
danny
we'll get someone else who won't
be quite as good.  you can go back
to feeling up stockbrokers.
linus considers.  he looks down at the ticket, then at
the wallet.  it's one or the other.
a waitress passes, and danny signals her for his bill.
when his attention returns to linus, the wallet
remains... but the ticket beneath his hand is gone.
linus is reading it.
danny
that's the best lift i've seen you
make yet.
linus
las vegas, huh?

america's playground.
and our main theme kicks in as we...
cut to:

las vegas - aerial view - establishing - dusk

the city looms out of the desert like an infernal
machine, lights flashing, skyline pulsing, a neon
fortress.
one thing in particular catches our eye:  an enormous
billboard with an ad for the upcoming boxing match
between mike tyson and lennox lewis.  below it, a
promoter hands out fliers for strip joints and call
girls.
