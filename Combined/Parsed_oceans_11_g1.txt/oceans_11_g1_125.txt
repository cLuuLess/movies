a white, unmarked van pulls in from the street and races

driver's side, both of them dressed in their bodyguard
suits.
turk
mr. zerga.  a gift from mr. hesse.
turk extends the briefcase to saul, so that they both
clasp the handle, as virgil produces a key, unlocks the
cuff on turk's wrist, transfers it to saul's, clamps it
shut, and hands saul the key.

hotel, the security guards and malloys flanking them.
