moving with benedict and tess, pushing their way out
through the crowd.  a phone is ringing nearby... again
and again...
benedict
you gonna answer it?
tess
i don't have a cell phone.
they keep moving, but the ring pursues them.  finally,
benedict stops, pulls tess's purse from her shoulder and
opens it:  inside, he finds a cell phone, ringing.
tess
it isn't mine.
benedict
see who's on the other end.
she takes the phone, activates it.
tess
hello?
rusty (v.o.)
may i have a word with mr.
benedict, please?
tess looks up, confused.
tess
it's for you.
benedict takes the phone.
benedict
who the hell is this?
on rusty
in the distance, at the arena's exit, unseen by benedict
or tess, on the phone...
rusty
the man who's robbing you.
