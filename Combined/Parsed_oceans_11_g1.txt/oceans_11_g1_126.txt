frank deals blackjack to a full table.  his eyes gaze
past his players to saul, the guards and benedict passing
by.
frank
(as he busts)
lookin' like a bad night for the
house.
moving with benedict as he spies out of the corner of his
eye danny, lurking at a slot machine.  to one of his
guards...
benedict
find mr. walsh.  tell him mr.
ocean's in the west slots.

the guard goes, and benedict continues with saul...
benedict
i'm afraid i can't allow my
private security personnel
inside the casino cages.  i hope
you don't mind...
saul
of course not.
saul turns to dismiss virgil and turk when...
... passing by, on his way to a sports betting window, an
old racetrack denizen happens past this cabal and, worse
yet, happens to recognize saul.
racetrack denizen
saul?  saul bloom, is that you?
saul does his best to ignore the man.  but even benedict
notices:  this guy seems to know lyman zerga.
racetrack denizen
saul, it's me.  bucky buchanan,
remember?  from saratoga.
at last saul turns to face this man, with shark's eyes.
saul
friedrich, gunther.
an order:  dispose of this man.  virgil and turk pick up
the denizen by his elbows and haul him away.
saul
mr. benedict...
(gesturing to the
 cage; re:  his
 briefcase-cuff)
please:  i have never enjoyed the
touch of steel to my skin.
they proceed.

danny sits in a row of octogenarians, all vacantly
dropping $1 coins and pulling levers.  as he watches saul
and benedict disappear into the cage...

ding!  ding!  ding!  ding!  four cherries.  danny smiles,
a big winner, but he's got bigger pots to win tonight.
he steers a neighboring senior citizen (blind as a bat)
to his slot machine...
danny
pops, you won.
... then slips away.
