two guards stand sentry outside the cage door.  virgil
and turk move up with their cash cart, and when virgil
reaches for his keycard... it's gone.
virgil
aw, i think... jesus.  i lost my
card.
the guards frown at him.  a security officer approaches.
security officer
what's going on here?
virgil
i think... jesus!  i lost my
keycard.
security officer
(and this, he knows, will
 get this guard fired)
okay.  leave the cart.  go find
it.
(to one of the
 sentries)
take this cart inside.
the sentry nods, swipes his keycard, and enters with the
cash cart.  turk and virgil hesitate a moment to watch it
enter, then hurry off.
