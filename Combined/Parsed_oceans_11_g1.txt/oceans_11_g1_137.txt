yen tucks himself into the cash cart's hidden compartment
with a slim oxygen tank for company.  meanwhile, rusty
drills virgil and turk...
rusty

turk
not until we get your signal.
virgil
hey.  what do we look like:  a
couple of peckerwood jackasses or
something?
no one responds.
rusty
(turning his attention
 to yen, squeezed into
 the cart)
amazing:  how's it feel?  you
alright?
(as yen nods)
want something to read?  magazine?
from the tangle of limbs, a middle finger protrudes to
show rusty what he can do with a magazine.
rusty
okay.  i'm counting down.  thirty
minutes of breathing time
starts... now.
on "now" a running clock appears on-screen, descending
from 29:59.  it will remain there for the duration of the
pre-pinch heist, jumping at times between scenes.
rusty seals yen inside the cash cart, then gives the top
a tug:  it's shut tight.  as virgil redresses it with the
tablecloth, turk snatches back livingston's penne on the
way to the door.
livingston
you get no tip.
