a tournament-level pool table holds center stage here.
atop its green felt sits a raised, elaborate miniature of
terry benedict's las vegas:  three casinos and hotels
with the strip running between them.
as the eleven surround the table and the model...
danny
gentlemen:  the 14000 block of las
vegas boulevard.  otherwise known
as the bellagio, the mirage,
the m.g.m. grand.  together,
they're the three most profitable
casinos in las vegas...

danny removes the strip from the model.  revealed beneath
is a complex substructure, featuring three tunnels, each
leading from a casino to a single freight-sized elevator
shaft which descends into an enormous vault.
danny
gentlemen:  the bellagio vault.
located below the strip, beneath
two hundred feet of solid earth.
it safeguards every dime that
comes through each of the three
casinos above it.
(beat)
and we're going to rob it.
everyone takes a breath, awed.
linus
smash-and-grab job, huh?
rusty
it's a little more complicated
than that.
danny picks up a remote control and flips on a panel of
tvs.

casinos.
on the monitors:  three montages of black-and-white
security tapes, starting within the three casinos' cages,
moving into the tunnels, then (as the tvs unite in their
images) pushing into the elevator and eventually the
vault.
as the group's glances shoot back and forth from the tv
to the corresponding section of the model, i.e. from a
pov of the tunnel to the miniature tunnel itself...

okay.  bad news first.  this place
houses a security system which
rivals most nuclear missile silos.
first:  we have to get within the
casino cages --
rusty
(indicating)
-- here, here, and here --
danny
-- which anyone knows takes more
than a smile.  next:  through
these doors, each of which
requires a different six-digit
code changed every twelve hours.
past those lies the elevator, and
this is where it gets tricky:  the
elevator won't move without
authorized fingerprint
identifications --
rusty
-- which we can't fake --
danny
-- and vocal confirmations from
both the security center within
the bellagio and the vault below - -
rusty
-- which we won't get.
danny
furthermore, the elevator shaft is
rigged with motion detectors --
rusty
-- meaning if we manually override
the lift, the shaft's exit will
lock down automatically and we'll
be trapped.
danny
once we've gotten down the shaft,
though, then it's a walk in the
park:  just three more guards with
uzis and predilections toward not
being robbed, and the most
elaborate vault door conceived by
man.  any questions?

silence.  for a moment, each man keeps his two dozen
questions or more to himself.  at last, one speaks up...
the amazing yen.  in cantonese.  of course, no one
understands him.  except rusty.
rusty
(in response)
no.  tunneling is out.  there are
richter scales monitoring the
ground for one hundred yards in
every direction.  if a groundhog
tried to nest there, they'd know
about it.  anyone else?
another silence.  either the guys are too dumbfounded by
that bilingual exchange or too numbed by the task ahead
of them to speak.
turk
you said something about good
news...
danny
(smiles, happy
 someone asked)
the nevada gaming commission
stipulates:  a casino must hold in
reserve enough cash to cover every
chip at play on its floor.  as i
mentioned, this vault services
each of the three casinos above
it.  that means:  during the week,
by law, it must hold anywhere from
sixty to seventy million dollars
in cash and coin.  on a weekend,
between eighty and ninety million.
on a fight night, like the one two
weeks from tonight, the night
we're going to rob it, at least a
hundred and fifty million.  without
breaking a sweat.
(gazing about room)
now there are eleven of us.  each
with an equal share.  you do the
math.
moving around the table on ten faces, as everyone does
precisely that, in their heads, except for virgil who
does it on his fingers.  he whistles.
rusty
that's what i said.

everyone seems suitably impressed by their share.
saul
i have a question.
(as danny turns
 to him)
say we do get into the cage, and
through the security doors there,
and down the elevator we can't
move, and past the guards with
guns, and into the vault we can't
open...
rusty
without being seen by the cameras.
danny
(off everyone's
 astonishment)
oh, right.  sorry.  i forgot to
mention that.
saul
say we do all that.  we're just
supposed to walk outta there with
a hundred million dollars in cash
on us without getting stopped?
danny smiles, his broad, sure-of-himself grin, the one
rusty couldn't deny earlier and these guys won't deny
now.
danny
yeah.
saul looks panic-stricken; like that, his ulcer has
flared up, and he pops a rolaid in his mouth.
danny
alright.  here's how we'll begin.
