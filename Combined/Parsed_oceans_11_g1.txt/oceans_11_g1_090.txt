quiet, elegant, tense.  one table is operating only, in
the corner, and at it saul, as lyman zerga, furtively

saul
i don't believe in weakness.  it

this shuts the high roller up fast.  saul looks up from
the table, just perceptibly, to spot terry benedict, on
his way in, right on schedule.  he approaches the pit
boss by the entrance.
benedict

pit boss

the third position.  wishes to
speak with you privately.
benedict
