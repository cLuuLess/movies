ext. bellagio casino - day (super slow motion)
93
terry benedict emerges from a town car and, from his
haircut to his smile to his pant-cuffs, he is effortless
perfection.  he is vegas royalty, yet he denies eye
contact to no man.  he strides into his casino and,
appearing behind a pillar, linus follows him in.
linus (v.o.)
he arrives at the bellagio every
day at two p.m.  same town car,
same driver.  remembers every
valet's name on the way in.  not
bad for a guy worth three-quarters
of a billion.
