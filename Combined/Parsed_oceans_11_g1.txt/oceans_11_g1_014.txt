topher indicates the new arrival:  danny.  rusty looks
as if there's a bad smell in the room.
rusty
what's this?
danny
the bouncer mentioned there was
a game in progress.  i hope i'm
not intruding.
topher
no intrusion at all --
rusty
what was his name, the bouncer's?
danny
i don't remember.
rusty
a card player with amnesia.  this
should be fun.
at table - moments later
rusty deals the next hand.
topher
what do you do for a living,
mr. ocean?  if you don't mind
my asking.
danny
why should i mind?  two cards,
please...
(long beat)
i just got out of prison.
topher
really?
(a glance among the
 other players)
really...
rusty
(half to divert
 attention)
barry, you're showing again.
barry (o.s.)
sorry.

josh
what'd you, uh, go to prison for?
danny
i stole things.
josh
what, like jewels?  diamonds?
a beat, then:
rusty
incan matrimonial headmasks.
looks are exchanged.  everyone digests that.
josh
from a museum?
danny
gallery.
seth
there a lot of money in those?
incan matrimonial...
danny
headmasks.  some.
rusty
don't let him fool you, seth.
there's boatloads.  if you can
move the things...
(finishing his deal)
one card to me.
(to danny, pointedly)
... but you can't.
danny
my fence seemed confident enough.
rusty
if you're dealing with cash, you
don't need a fence.
danny
some people just lack vision.
rusty
probably everybody in cell block e.

now the other players realize.  these guys have a
relationship.  in fact, a criminal one.  and, judging
from their steely glares across the table, not a happy
one.
danny
well, that's all behind us now.
rusty
i should hope so.
danny smiles, icily -- of course, it's not -- then pulls
out his wallet.
danny
i raise you five hundred dollars.
a hush in the room.  danny has thrown down the gauntlet.
he and rusty hold each other's stares.
rusty
guys:  day one:  what's the first
rule of poker?
barry
um, never bet on, uh, on
a ! --
topher
'leave emotion at the
door.'
rusty
that's right.  my friend here just
raised me out of pique.
(beat)
today's lesson.  how to draw out
a bluff.  this early in the game,
that much money, i'm thinking he's
holding nothing better than a pair
of face cards.
(beat)
seth, raise him.
seth
okay.  uh, your five hundred and...
another two?
rusty nods, and seth pushes in his chips.
rusty
tophe...
topher
seven to me.  plus three.  what
the hell.

rusty
indeed.  but be careful you don't
push him too high too fast.  want
to keep him on the leash.  i call.
it's josh's turn.  he hesitates...
josh
what's that to me?  a thousand?
rusty
all you have to do is call.
danny
(off josh's further
 hesitation)
what?  your girlfriend holding
your purse?
that does it.  josh is in.  the bet's to danny.  he
checks his hand, and seth starts to whisper to topher.
danny
contrary to what mr. ryan may say,
seth, i always check my cards
before i make a bet.  but be
cafeful.  i could tell from your
face you're holding three of a
kind or better.
(digging his wallet
 out)
five hundred to call.  and two
grand more.
danny stares rusty down.  the others look a little pale.
rusty
guys, you're free to do what you
like.  it's a lot of money.  but
i'm staying in.  he's trying to
buy his way out of his bluff.
nobody looks too eager to call, but nobody wants to
leave a grand on the table, either.  finally, seth
ponies up, and the others -- not be outdone -- do, too.
rusty
we call.
danny sets down his hand.  four nines.  it's a winner.
the others, jaws dropped, throw in their cards.  for the
first time tonight, rusty blanches.

rusty
shit.  sorry, guys.  i -- i was
sure he was bluffing.
as rusty plummets in the estimation of all the guys
around him, danny rakes in his pot.
danny
thanks for the game, fellas.
(then)
hey, i hate to ask this, but
could you sign something for me?
it's for the guys in the joint.
they just love all your shows.
