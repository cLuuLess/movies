frank stands at attention before linus and benedict.
linus, straddling a desk, takes a beeper off his belt
when it pinches him.  benedict checks his watch:  the
fight's opening bell is growing closer and closer.
linus
thank you for your cooperation,
mr. escalante.
(as frank nods,
 not at all)
or should i call you mr. catton?

frank bristles, tries not to let it show.  linus pulls
out a xeroxed mug shot and bio of him.
linus
you are frank catton?  formerly of
the tropicana, the desert inn and
the new york state penitentiary
system?

linus (cont'd)
(as frank remains
 quiet)
your silence suggests you don't
refute that.
(to benedict)
mr. benedict, i'm afraid you've
been employing an ex-convict.  as
you know, the n.g.c. strictly
forbids...
frank
(under his breath)
goddamn cracker...
linus
(a pause; he can't
 believe he just
 heard that)
pardon me.
frank
(leering at linus,
 simmering)
you heard me.  just 'cause a black
man tries to earn a decent wage in
this state...
linus
that has nothing to do with...
frank
(over him, ranting)
... some cracker cowboy like you's
gotta kick him out on the street.
want me to jump down, turn around,
pick a bale of cotton, won't let
me deal cards, might as well call
it whitejack.
linus
(a beat, then)
i resent your implication that
race has anything to do with this.
(to benedict)
now, as i was saying, the nevada
gaming commission strictly forbids
the employment of the colored...
(whoops)
... i mean...
that does it:  frank attacks linus, lunging at the man,
and as benedict steps in to separate the two...

... linus's hand dips into his tuxedo jacket and
withdraws the vault combination.
frank

benedict
(to linus)
you alright?
linus
(a beat, then)
yeah.
