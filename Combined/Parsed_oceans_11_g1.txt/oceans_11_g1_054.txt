int. bellagio casino - night

following a bunch of balloons -- all congratulating
"happy anniversary!" -- as a delivery boy carries them
through the casino, and just as he's passing an
"employees only" door (complete with sentry and embedded
ceiling camera)...

of his hand and into the camera...
tourist
hey, watch it, bud...
