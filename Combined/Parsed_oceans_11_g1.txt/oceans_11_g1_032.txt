on the pavement.  an explosives cop kneels in front of
him.

cop
and that's all you used during the
event?  nothing else?
basher
are you accusing me of booby-
trapping?
cop
well, how 'bout it?
voice (o.s.)
booby traps aren't mr. tarr's style.
the cop turns; standing behind him, stone-faced, is
rusty, in a dark suit and shades.
rusty
isn't that right, basher?
basher
that's right.
rusty
(flashing badge,
 briefly)
peck, a.t.f.  let me venture a
guess.  a simple g4 mainliner,
double-coil, backwound, quick
fuse with a drag under 20 feet.
(off cop's reaction)
that's our man.  tell me something
else.  have you checked him for
booby traps on his person?  i mean
really checked, not just for
weapons...
the cop looks bewildered.  rusty steps forward, yanks
basher onto his feet, spins him around.  he moves his
hands up and down basher's legs, around his waist, under
his arms.
rusty
will you go find griggs and tell
him i need to see him?
cop
who?

rusty
(loud)
just go find him, will you?
(as cop stalks off;
 under his breath)
how fast can you put something
together with what i passed you?
basher
done.  thirty seconds all right?
rusty
from when?
basher
(as we hear something
 snap from behind his
 back)
now.

moving with rusty and basher

they're hurrying; ahead of them is a wall of squad cars,
a police cordon, and a crowd of onlookers.
rusty
ten seconds?
basher
not quite.  is danny here?
rusty
around the corner.
basher
be good working with professionals
again.
(beat)
okay:  go.
and they both start running.
rusty
everyone down!  get down!  there's
a bomb in the...
and behind them the squad car erupts with a bang!  a
collective scream rises from the crowd, everyone ducks,
cops hit the ground and cover their heads.  rusty and
basher move briskly past them, dodging their splayed legs
like tires on an obstacle course.  by the time the
explosives cop thinks to look around for basher, they've
both disappeared.
