the chinese national circus, currently on tour in the
western united states.  trapeze artists, gymnastic teams,
and trampoline daredevils fly, somersault, spin, and
swing through the air.
a full house applauds every feat.  danny and rusty sit in
the bleachers, surrounded by parents and kids munching on
spindles of cotton candy.  tough guys in toyland.
