ext. billy tim's van and truck dealership - office - day
88
outside a window:  turk and virgil jump up and down on
opposite bumpers of a van, testing its durability.
inside, frank negotiates with billy tim, a cal-
worthingtonesque redneck car dealer, who half-pays
attention to him, half-frets over the malloys outside.
billy tim
i'm sorry:  eighteen-five each is
the best offer i can make you.
frank
(playing a bit of
 a dandy)
oh, i understand perfectly.  they
are beautiful vans.  well, i thank
you for your time, mister...?
billy tim
denham.  billy tim denham.
frank
yes, denham, like a jean.
(they shake)
you know:  you have lovely hands
-- do you moisturize?
billy tim
i'm sorry?

frank's not letting go of the man's hand, the object now
is to force billy tim into lowering his price just to get
frank out of his office.
frank
i swear by it.  i try all sorts of
lotions.  i went through a
fragrance-free period last year,
but now i'm liking this new brand
fortified with rose hip.  my
sister, you know, she uses the
aloe vera with the sun screen
built in...
billy tim
(just can't get
 his hand back)
uh-huh.  you said you'd be willing
to pay in cash?
frank
i did.  you know:  they say
cinnamon is wonderful for your
pores.  read that on the internet.
and that ideally you should be
wearing gloves to bed, but i find
that would interfere with my
social agenda.  problem is:  i get
a reaction to camphor so i can't
use traditional remedies...
billy tim
if you could pay cash, i could
probably drop the price a little.
to, say, seventeen...
(as frank squeezes
 a little)
... sixteen each.
frank
(big smile)
that would be lovely.
