see, the kind of people you steal
things from, they have insurance
to compensate them.  they get made
whole again.  i had to leave new
york to get away from what
happened.  how do i get my five
years back, danny?
danny
you can't.  but what you can do is
not throw away another five years.
tess
you don't know anything about --
danny
(leaning in)
listen, you don't love me anymore,
you want to make a life with
someone else?  fine, i'll have to
live with that.  but not him.
tess
spoken like a true ex-husband.
danny
i'm not joking, tess.
tess
i'm not laughing.
(beat)
you have to admit there's a
conflict of interest when you give
me advice about my love life.
danny exhales and leans back.

danny
yes.  but that doesn't mean i'm
wrong.
she looks at him, and maybe part of her knows that he
isn't.  she looks down at his ring, somewhat wistful.
he sees her looking at it.
tess
do you remember what i said to you
when we first met?
danny
you said:  you better know what
you're doing.
tess
do you?  now?  because -- truly --
you should walk out the door if
you don't.
danny
i know what i'm doing.
benedict
what are you doing?
terry benedict is hovering over them, fresh from his
meeting with saul.
danny
catching up.
tess
terry, meet my ex-husband...
danny
(extending his hand)
danny ocean.
benedict
(taking it)
mr. ocean.
(to tess)
forgive me for being late.  a
guest required my attention.
tess
danny was just walking through the
restaurant and spotted me.
benedict
is that right?

danny
i was shocked myself.  imagine the odds.
benedict
'of all the gin joints in all the
world...'
(beat)
you've been in prison until
recently, isn't that right?  how
does it feel to be out?
danny
about the same.  everything you
want is still on the other side.
benedict
there's the human condition for
you.
tess
terry, danny was just about to...
danny
i just wanted to say hello.  for
old time's sake.
benedict
stay for a drink, if you like.
tess
he can't --
danny
(simultaneously)
-- i can't.
an awkward silence.  benedict takes tess's hand in his.
benedict
well, then i don't imagine we'll
be seeing you again, mr. ocean.
danny
you never know.
benedict
i know everything that happens in
my hotels.
danny
so i should put those towels back.
benedict
the towels you can keep.

tess

danny goes.  when he's out the door...
tess

benedict
(like lightning)
don't be.

moving with danny as he exits, his fingers snapping, he
saw the mist in tess's eyes just now, he knows he's got a
fighting chance with her, but what he does not know is...
... linus is tailing him, ten steps back.  he stops,
glances back at the restaurant quizzically, then
continues following danny.
