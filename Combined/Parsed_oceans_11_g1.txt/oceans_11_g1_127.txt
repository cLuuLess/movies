linus stands dressed in a sharp, conservative suit -- a
far cry from the threadbare thief in chicago.  rusty
circles him, inspecting.
rusty
where you gonna put your hands?
linus clasps them.
rusty
no...
linus goes for his pockets.
rusty
not the pockets, either.  and
don't touch your tie.  look at
me...
linus does.
rusty
that how you gonna stand?
linus shifts his balance.
rusty
wrong again.  i ask you a
question, you have to think of the
answer, where you gonna look?
linus looks down.
rusty
death.  you look down, they know
you're lying --
linus looks up.

-- and up they know you don't know
the truth.  don't use three words
when one will do, don't shift your
eyes, look always at your mark but
don't stare, be specific but not
memorable, funny but don't make
him laugh, he's gotta like you
then forget you the moment you've
left his sight, and for god's
sakes whatever you do, don't under
any circumstances --

rust, can you come here a sec?
rusty
(wandering off)
sure thing.
linus is left utterly bewildered, a thousand commandments
to remember and fifteen minutes to remember them in.
