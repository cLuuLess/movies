ext. alley/vacant warehouse - early morning
292
the swat van rounds a corner and ducks inside the
warehouse.
three-and-a-half seconds pass.
and the eight swat members reappear, now all in suits,
perfectly pressed, and with grins on their faces and
change in their pockets, they begin their victory stroll,
single-file and sloppy... right down the...
293
strip - moving with them
293
turk, livingston, frank, basher, yen, saul, linus and
rusty march down the strip single-file, and when they
come to an intersection...
... virgil and reuben, also in suits, fall into stride
for a victory lap in front of the bellagio fountains.
then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into
different hotels or grabbing cabs, until there are only
two left:  rusty and linus.
they take each other in, shake hands, and part.
