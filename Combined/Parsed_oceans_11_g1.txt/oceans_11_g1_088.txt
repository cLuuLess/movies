int. bellagio art gallery - day

the painting hangs under a portrait lamp on a wall
between a van gogh and a monet.
at a distance, admiring it, are tess, the seller and the
seller's aide-de-camp.  a staff photographer and other
personnel mill nearby.
off to the side, in a sharp blazer, tess stands
transfixed by the painting.
tess
he painted it in the summer of
1912, after the break-up with
fernande olivier.
seller
she must have put him through
hell.
tess
you can see the conflict.  he
makes her both erotic and
grotesque.  he's hopelessly drawn
to her, and yet she drives him
crazy.
aide-de-camp
(checking his watch)
mr. santaniello has an early
flight.  do you think mr. benedict
will be late?
tess
mr. benedict is never late.
just then the double doors to the gallery swing open, and
terry benedict enters, right on time.

he is elegant, beaming, commanding.  all that's missing
is a blare of trumpets.
benedict
am i late?
tess
not at all, mr. benedict.
(greeting him)
allow me to introduce to you mr.
jean santaniello.
benedict
(to seller)
mr. santaniello, i apologize if i
kept you.  i had to iron out a few
issues with my fight promoter.  i
gave him an unlimited budget, and
he exceeded it.
seller
i understand it's going to be a
hell of a fight.
benedict
we hope.
tess angles benedict toward the painting.
tess
here it is.
benedict moves toward the painting, and as he does he
catches tess in his glance, and his smile deepens.  then:
benedict
magnificent!  i've been following
her for fifteen years now.  at
last i've made her a home.
(to tess)
all the arrangements and so
forth...
seller
done.  she's yours.
benedict
not mine.  she belongs to everyone
who comes into my hotel.  isn't
that right, ms. ocean?

tess
yes, mr. benedict.
benedict
she's lovely, isn't she?
(as the seller is
 confused; benedict
 specifies painting)
i can't be the only one who was
after her.
seller
you're the only one who met my
price.
benedict
ah, but this... you can't put a
price on beauty.  but i shouldn't
philosophize.  i own casinos,
after all.
aide-de-camp
can we get a quick shot?  mr.
santaniello has a plane to catch.
benedict
of course, of course.
tess understands:  she is not to be part of the photo.
benedict and the seller pose together and...
flash!
