     int. toyota - night

     brill drives along a high fence surrounding acres of
     empty warehouses, docks and rust-bitten fences. he's
     still on constant alert - looking for sign of their
     presence.

                        brill (cont'd)
            the nsa's been in bed with the
            entire tele-communications industry
            since the 40's. they've infected
            everything: banks, computers,
            phones, mail, name it.
               (stopping the car near
                the gate)
            the more technology we buy into,
            the easier it is keeping tabs on us.
            it's a brave new world.
               (handing dean the keys)
            at least it better be.

                        dean
            how do you know so much?

                        brill
            none of your business.

                        dean
            you used to work for 'em, didn't you?

                        brill
            i was a traffic analyst.

     dean gives him a look that says, "i don't know what
     that means".

                        brill (cont'd)
            i intercepted phone calls.

                        dean
            how'd you get around the tap orders?

                        brill
            they can tap anything as along as
            it's an airwave intercept.
            cellulars and pagers your kid can
            do.
               (driving through)
            hard-line calls we'd pick off the
            relays as they were being fed into
            ground cables or fired up to the
            sats. we'd suck in everything. all
            foreign, most domestic.
               (dean re-closes the gate)
            domestic was my group. druggies,
            radicals, loud-mouths. anyone we
            wanted.

                        dean
               (climbing back in)
            how'd you have the manpower to--

                        brill
               (driving again)
            meade has 18 underground acres of
            computers. they scan every
            phonecall for target words like
            "bomb" or "president". we red-flag
            phone numbers or voice
            prints...whatever we wanted. when
            the computers found something, it
            was bounced to comparative analysis.

                        dean
            jesus.

                        brill
            that was twenty years ago. with
            digital? they can suck a salt grain
            off a beach.

                        dean
            why'd you leave?

                        brill
            it was '72. i figured we had enough
            problems without monitoring a
            berkeley kid's class schedule. so i
            sold my story to ramparts and split.

                        dean
            they come after you?

                        brill
               (shrugging it off)
            well...there'd be too much
            disclosure to prosecute me. so they
            ruined my records and made sure i'd
            never hold a real job again.

     the pick-up stops by a long two-story warehouse.

                        brill (cont'd)
            what do you think?

                        dean
            looks like detroit.

                        brill
            welcome to santa's workshop.
