     brill drives. dean thinks.

                        dean
            what if we hand deliver to their
            homes or office?

                        brill
            the area's wired for surveillance,
            they'll be looking for those moves.

                        dean
            well how do i know what they're--

                        brill
            i know. i know what they're looking
            for and i'm telling you.

     the car radio is playing a newscast...

                        newscaster (o.s.)
               (from the radio)
            --after which, senator albert will
            address a fund-raiser at boston
            university.

                        dean
            what if we put it on the internet?

                        brill
            have you seen how fuckin' slow the
            net is? it'd take ten minutes to
            unload enough video so that people
            know what they're seeing, and it'd
            take the nsa maybe 40 seconds to
            see it coming down and shut down
            the access.

                        newscaster (o.s.)
               (from the radio)
            --this will be the last stop on the
            senator's eight-city tour before
            the senate votes on tuesday.

                        brill
               (reconsidering)
            but maybe if there were no phone
            line--

     dean has started listening to the radio...

                        brill (cont'd)
            what if we transmitted it over
            cellular?

                        dean
            listen--

                        brill
            nah, they'd shut down the pin number.

                        dean
            what if--

                        brill
            if they couldn't do that, they'd
            shut down the whole system, all the
            relays.

                        dean
            what if--

                        brill
            they've done it before. takes maybe
            two minutes.

                        dean
            what if--

                        brill
            what if what?

                        dean
            what if we just fucked with 'em?

                        brill
               (pause)
            how?

                        dean
            same way they did with you and me.
            we take their biggest guy and turn
            him into one of us.

                        brill
            reynolds.

                        dean
            no.

                        brill
            who?
