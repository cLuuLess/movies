     a tall ladder leans against a dead oak. zavitz sweats
     and climbs to a branch where a platform's been built
     supporting a large phony bird's nest. he lifts away the
     nest, revealing--

     --two microphones and three motion-activated digital
     video cameras and recorders. zavitz checks the cameras'
     viewfinders to see--

     --time-coded views - wide, medium and close of a
     squirrel's nest containing three newborns. the parents
     are nowhere to be seen.

     zavitz eyes the recorders. the video disks are spent.
     he ejects and pockets them, replacing them with fresh ones.
