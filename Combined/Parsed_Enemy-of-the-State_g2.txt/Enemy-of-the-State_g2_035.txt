     int. kitchen - night

     the kitchen is in the midst of a remodel. a wall-
     mounted tv is showing "crossfire", where the two hosts
     are mediating a battle between two senators.

     stacy watches the show with one eye, cooks with the other.

                        senator tasken (tv)
            laws service society and they need
            to be flexible to meet changing
            demands. we've got to be able to
            deal with a terrorist threat before
            it occurs.

     dean enters...

                        dean
            hey.

                        stacy
            this guy's a fat-assed rotarian gasbag.

                        dean
            uh-oh.

                        stacy
            listen to him.

                        senator tasken (tv)
            this is no longer a theoretical
            problem, it's a reality. turn on
            the news. bombings, hostages--

                        dean
            he's got a point.

                        stacy
            bobby!

                        dean
            not a very good one, but--

                        stacy
            so you tap everyone's phone? you
            use computers to probe financial
            records? new search and seizure laws?

                        dean
            just for the criminals.

                        stacy
            we won't suspend the civil rights
            of the good people.

                        dean
            right.

                        stacy
            you should take this seriously.

                        dean
            i think you're taking it seriously
            enough for both of us.

     he kisses her. a good one.

                        stacy
               (softer)
            you're a lawyer. don't you care
            what's going on around you?

                        dean
            something bad happened tonight.

                        stacy
            what?

                        dean
            i saw a man die.

                        stacy
            what do you mean?

                        dean
            in front of harrison's, he got hit
            by a bus. i knew him. the firm did
            some pro bono work for his
            organization a few years back.

                        stacy
               (beat)
            i'm sorry.

                        dean
            the thing is, when i saw him, it
            seemed like he wanted to tell me...
               (beat)
            ...he was upset about something and
            he said...
               (beat)
            doesn't matter now.  i'm gonna wash up.

                        stacy
            what'd you buy at harrison's?

                        dean
            a toaster. and no terrorist talk at
            dinner. you're spookin' the kids.

     dean heads upstairs...
