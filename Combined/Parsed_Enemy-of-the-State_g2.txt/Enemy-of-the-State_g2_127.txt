     int. chevy - continuous

     dean and brill, windblown but alive, remove shards of
     glass. brill eyes the road behind him.

     empty.

                        brill
            we lost 'em.

                        dean
            that wasn't so hard.

                        brill
            fuckin-a.

                        dean
            let's not do the tire thing anymore,
            okay?

                        brill
            yeah, i can see where that'd--

     he stops talking.

     he hears rotor thumps as a black helicopter appears
     over a fog-laced hillside, swooping down.

     brill floors it. the helicopter drops in closer as
     brill swerves back and forth while taking a curve at 70-
     plus on flapping tires. a helicopter sharp-shooter aims
     with an m-16.

     a spray of high-powered slugs suddenly rip into the
     chevy's hood. the engine starts knocking.

                        brill
            these guys are incredibly persistent.

                        dean
            tell me about it.

     the road straightens. up ahead, a tunnel.

     more bullets slice the hood. radiator fluid starts
     hissing. the chevy starts dying.

     brill stomps the pedal, squeezing out every last kick
     of horsepower.

     rubber flaps. tires shred. steam hisses. bullets fly.

     the helicopter swoops in lower and lower for the kill shot.
