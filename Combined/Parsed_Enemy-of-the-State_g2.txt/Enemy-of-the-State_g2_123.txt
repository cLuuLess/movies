     ext. docks - dawn

     dean sits alone, smoking a cigarette, and watching
     norfolk rise from dawn's fog.

     in the distance we see brill coming down from the
     warehouse toward dean.

     he stands behind dean for a moment before...

                        brill
            that is one ugly sunrise.

                        dean
               (pause)
            it really is.
               (pause)
            did you find anything?

                        brill
            yeah.
               (beat)
            take a walk with me.

     dean gets up and joins brill. the two of them start in
     the direction of the second warehouse.

                        brill (cont'd)
            remember when senator hamersley
            died in an accident up near shenandoah?

                        dean
            yeah.

                        brill
            the nsa killed him.

                        dean
            jesus. do you have proof?

                        brill
            well, actually, you have proof.
            could you walk a little faster please.

                        dean
            what's going on?

                        brill
            they're here.

                        dean
            who?

                        brill
            them.

                        dean
            where?

                        brill
            here?

                        dean
            here?!

                        brill
            in the warehouse. they're hiding in
            a duct on the third floor. when we
            go back inside, they're gonna kill
            us. when they notice that we're
            moving toward the car, they'll come
            running out of the building.

                        dean
            'kay, well, could you walk faster,
            please.
