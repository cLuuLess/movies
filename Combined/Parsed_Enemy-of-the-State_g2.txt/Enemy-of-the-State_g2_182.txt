     int. the apartment

     jones is trying to pry the door open with his fingers.
     no use.

                        technician
               (over radio)
            get outa there, guys!

     while jones continues on the door, davis runs to the
     window.

     throughout this, hicks will stand in the middle of the
     room and, simply, oddly, stare at the mantle over the
     fireplace.

                        davis
            goddamit!

     hicks smiles...and now he starts laughing a little...

                        jones
            what's so fuckin' funny?

     hicks motions to a framed picture over the fireplace.

                        hicks
            it's over. we've been fucked with
            our pants on.

     the framed picture is of senator sam albert and christa
     hawkins.

                        hicks (cont'd)
            we broke into her condo.

     door wood explodes inward. the two cops roll in
     crouched positions, weapons drawn.

                        cop #1
            police! freeze!

     hicks doesn't move, davis freezes like a deer in
     headlights, jones stares with cold, dead eyes.

                        cop #2
            drop the weapons! now!

     two more cops arrive. jones and davis drop their guns.

                        cop #1
            on the ground! now! face the floor!

     they do so. cops three and four go room to room making
     sure no one else is lurking. in the bedroom, they find
     the briefcase. inside the briefcase--

     --listening bugs, installation equipment and
     compromising photos of the senator with christa.

                        christa (o.s.)
            oh my god! what's going on?!

     back in the living room, christa has walked through the
     broken-in apartment door to see jones, hicks and davis
     lying on the floor at gun point.

                        cop #2
            ma'am, is this your apartment?

                        christa
            what happened?!

                        cop #1
            would you step out in the hallway
            for a moment, ma'am.

                        christa
            oh god.

                        cop #2
            please. we'll be right with you.

     christa backs slowly out of the apartment and into--
