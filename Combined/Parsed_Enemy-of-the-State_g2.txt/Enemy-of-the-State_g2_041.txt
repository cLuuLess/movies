     int. nro, keyhole-12 lab - continuous

     a massive, dark place growing with monitors and tech.

     super: national reconnaissance organization, chantilly,
            virginia

     names of world regions are posted above endless monitor
     screens displaying live, digital-image feeds of earth
     coming in from the keyhole-12 spy satellites. every
     populated area of the planet is covered here. analysts
     attend the many feeds.

     a poster reads:

                     the keyhole '12' series
                 making the world an honest place

     on another poster, a man's running shadow in a target
     bulls-eye with a caption reading:

                    you are a security target

     beneath a sign reading u.s. north-east coastal region,
     an analyst reviews time-coded, digital sat videos of
     washington, d.c. as seen from space, the capitol
     appears to be nothing more than a greyish mass. the
     analyst keys commands into his system.

     close on monitor - the overhead sat view of washington
     moves in closer, soon streets are discernible, then
     cars and buses - then an accident in an intersection
     with flashing ambulance lights and a bus. a body lies
     twisted in the street - it's zavitz.

     the analyst enters additional commands. the zavitz/bus
     accident freezes, then plays in reverse as if recorded
     by the eye of god.  the scene continues reversing,
     following close on zavitz as he back-tracks into
     harrison's department store.
