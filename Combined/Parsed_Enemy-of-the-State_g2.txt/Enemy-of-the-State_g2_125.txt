     ext. the second warehouse - continuous

     dean and brill are kneeling beside the chevy, letting
     the air out of the tires.

                        brill
            empty 'em 'till they're almost flat.
            and turn your head. there might be
            some debris flying your way.

                        dean
            why?

     and with that, the first warehouse explodes, sending a
     fireball of debris in all directions.

                        dean
            what the fuck?!

                        brill
            they shouldn't have come without
            calling first.

     brill jumps into the chevy, turns the key and the
     engine ignites. dean leaps in. brill stomps on the gas
     and tires screech. the chevy hurtles through the
     warehouse toward a shut garage door. brill clicks a
     remote. the door rises.

     outside the warehouse - the chevy roars outward,
     screams around a corner, then speeds down a road lined
     with warehouses.

     dean looks down an intersecting road to glimpse a
     saturn sedan gaining on a parallel road.

                        brill
            where's your gun?

     they pass an area with no warehouses. the saturn turns,
     heading straight at them.

                        dean
            back at the warehouse.

     the saturn pulls on the road behind them. the man in
     the saturn leans out and fires an assault rifle. the
     side window by dean's head shatters.

     brill one-hands the pistol and checks the load.

                        dean
               (re: the pistol)
            gimme that.

                        brill
            you sure?

                        dean
            you're driving.

                        brill
            those are feds.

                        dean
               (taking the pistol)
            i didn't see a warrant. did you see
            a warrant?

     the chevy enters a narrow lane, the saturn right behind.
     with the chevy's tires flat and flapping, the saturn
     hugs their rear. dean looks back again as the rifleman
     fires--

     the rear window explodes. dean pops up and fires three
     quick, well-placed rounds.

     the saturn swerves and drops back. brill's impressed.

     dean looks forward to see an exit road blocked by an
     iron cross-bar. brill, unfazed, pushes the chevy faster.
     beam or no beam, he's going through.

                        brill
            think we let out enough air?

                        dean
               (realizing)
            oh my god...

     brill and dean hit the deck as the chevy's hood scrapes
     just under the beam. the windshield frame takes the
     full impact. the beam slices through steel and glass,
     decapitating the car. they emerge on the other side
     minus roof and windows as--

     --the saturn screech-stops inches from the beam and
     debris. a man leaps out, shoulders his rifle and aims--

     --but the chevy disappears around a building.
