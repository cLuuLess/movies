     int. zavitz apartment - continuous

     jacket on, ready to leave, zavitz sits at his computer
     finishing a transfer. a tone beeps as a computer time
     graph sweeps to 'finished'. the screen reads: transfer
     complete.

     there's a knock at the door...

     ...zavitz looks over.

                        zavitz
               (pause)
            yes?

                        man's voice (o.s.)
            federal express for 'zavitz'.

                        zavitz
            federal express?

                        man's voice (o.s.)
            for daniel zavitz. i just need a
            signature.

                        zavitz
               (beat)
            how'd you get in the building?

                        man's voice (o.s.)
            the door was open, sir. i just need
            a signature.

     zavitz disconnects a video digitizer, removes a game-
     cartridge containing the digitized video...

     ...and inserts it into a gameboy.

     he steps to the door and eyes the peep-hole.

     zavitz pov: a fish-eye view of a fed-ex man, jones,
     looking bored.

                        zavitz
            can you tell me who it's from?

                        jones
               (checking label)
            micro-tel electronics. sunland.

                        zavitz
            can you--would it be possible to
            leave it by the door?

                        jones
            not without a signature.

                        zavitz
               (stepping to the window)
            all right. okay. just give me a minute.

     zavitz pov: two dwp installers hovering in a bucket
     across the street. down below, a cargo van with a
     multiple roof antenna is double parked near a fed-ex
     van. then--

     --through a street window's reflection, zavitz sees his
     building's front entrance. several tenants are being
     prevented from entering by two men, plain clothes, one
     with a radio communicator pressed to his ear.

     shit.

     zavitz backs from the window, seized by panic. he grabs
     his phone...

     ...dead.

     he picks up his fax line. also dead.

     he grabs the gameboy, goes to a small side window and
     opens it. a ledge snakes around the corner. an athlete
     he's not but there's no choice. he squeezes out.
