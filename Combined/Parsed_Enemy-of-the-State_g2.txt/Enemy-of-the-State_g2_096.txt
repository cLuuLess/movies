     int. ambulance - night

     dean sits in back with a para-medic, covered in soot,
     breathing hard through an oxygen mask as the ambulance
     wails and weaves through traffic. he looks through the
     rear window to see--

     two cars following, keeping pace. off to the side, rfk
     stadium is emptying, a redskins game is over.

     dean rips off the oxygen mask--

                        dean
            tell him to stop the ambulance.

                        paramedic
            whoa there, fella. just take it easy.

                        dean
            tell him to stop the ambulance.

                        paramedic
            now you're a little shaken up, but
            we're gonna get you on your feet in--

     dean whips out his pistol and shoves it in the
     paramedic's face--

                        paramedic (cont'd)
               (to the driver)
            --stop the ambulance.

                        dean
            thank you.
