     int. lobby - continuous

     hicks, jones and davis prepare. all have miniature
     earphones. davis checks his silenced pistol. hicks
     activates a frequency locator. the needle snaps on. he
     looks at davis and jones.

     they're ready.

     all hand signals, no words, as the trio ascend the
     staircase.

     one flight, two. then hicks stops. the needle says
     they're close.

     hicks motions. their target's on two. they move down
     the hall - silent except for a creaking floor and a tv
     show drifting from an apartment.  someone's up at this
     hour.

     they move on. hicks watches the needle as it moves. he
     motions davis and jones to a door. jones puts a
     reverse-viewer against the peep-hole.

     jones's pov: a view of an entryway and living room. a
     light bleeds from an o.s. source. beyond that there's
     no sign of life.

     hicks puts a contact-mic against the door and listens
     to faint conversation somewhere inside, possibly the
     phone call. hicks nods to jones who quickly picks the
     lock while davis eyes the hall.

     after a nervous moment, the door opens and hicks, jones
     and davis enter.
