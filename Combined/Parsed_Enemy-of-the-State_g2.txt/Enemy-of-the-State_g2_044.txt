     int. range rover - night

     dean drives with stacy as eric sleeps in the back seat.
     various hats and souvenirs tell us that they've just
     come from a redskins game.

     they drive in silence for a moment before...

                        stacy
            bobby?

                        dean

            depinto?

            him. how did you--

                        dean

     the range rover pulls into the driveway.
