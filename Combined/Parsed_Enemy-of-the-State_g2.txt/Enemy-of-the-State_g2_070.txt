     int. motel room - continuous

     close on an old color tv. the commercial ends. a
     newscaster returns to deliver the late-night news.

                        newscaster
               (on tv)
            in richmond today, senate majority
            leader sam albert paid a visit to
            promote the ten-billion dollar
            anti-terror bill.

     the newscast cuts to sam albert, late 60's, standing on
     state capitol building steps delivering a speech to
     community leaders.

                        senator albert
               (on tv)
            america is under assault, and this
            time it's from within. the gangs,
            the terrorists, the drug lords, the
            cults...

     pulling away from the tv, we explore the room. dimly
     lit and cluttered with tired furniture.

                        senator albert (cont'd)
               (on tv)
            it's a war like any other war. a
            war with victims and a war that
            requires courage and strength.

     outside the window, a buzzing neon sign flickers red
     and blue. we finally end on dean, sitting on a sagging
     bed, rubbing his eyes...the newspaper with the
     doctored-up photo is sitting next to him.
