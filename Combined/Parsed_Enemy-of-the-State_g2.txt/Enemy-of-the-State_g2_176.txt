     int. police station/dispatch area - night

     spinning banks of reporters manned by police dispatchers.
     we move to one desk where a phone rings.

     an led immediately displays the caller's name; kruger,
     jack, along with his social-security number and date of
     birth.

                        dispatcher
            nine-one-one emergency.

                        old man's voice (o.s.)
            my name's jack kreuger, i'm at 1102
            grambling. i just saw three guys
            break into the condo next door. it
            looked to me like they had guns.
