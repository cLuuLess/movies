     int. helicopter - continuous

     the sharp-shooter lines dean in his sights.

     the pilot keeps pace, dropping closer. the sharp-
     shooter has the shot.

     the chevy reaches the tunnel's opening on sparking,
     screeching wheel rims.

     the helicopter pulls up, missing the hill by inches.

     but not the power lines. the pilot sees them too late.
     the helicopter flies into a web of cables. the upper
     rotor slices neatly off. the helicopter's body rockets
     downward to the road where it bounces and skids like a
     rock on water until it meets an oncoming semi-truck
     head-on.

     blam!
