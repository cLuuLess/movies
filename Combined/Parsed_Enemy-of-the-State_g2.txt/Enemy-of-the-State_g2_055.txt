            mr. dean?

                        dean
            yeah?

                        pratt
               (pulling out a card)
            we'd like to ask you some questions
            about daniel zavitz.

                        dean
            who are you people?

                        pratt
               (handing dean the card)
            i'm an investigator with pro-tech
            security.

                        dean
            i went through this with an
            investigator this morning. if i
            could--

                        pratt
            mr. zavitz was involved in an
            extortion scheme. we believe he
            passed you sensitive materials,
            possibly with your knowledge, and
            we need to--

                        dean
            he didn't.

                        pratt
            we believe he did.

                        dean
            you're wrong.

                        pratt
            we have good reason to believe that
            he passed you--

                        dean
            if he passed me materials, i'd have
            them. i don't.

                        pratt
            we'd like to recover any materials
            mr. zavitz may have given you--

                        dean
            he didn't give me--

                        pratt
            --otherwise we may have to--

                        dean
            otherwise you may have to what?

                        pratt
            we'd rather not--

                        dean
            fuck you. you may have to what?

                        bingham
               (beat)
            we may have to explore additional
            avenues.
