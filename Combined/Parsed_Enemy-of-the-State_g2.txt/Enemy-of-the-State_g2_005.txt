     int. crystal city, virginia, tall office bldg. - day

     a well-appointed big-city law office filled with
     citations of merit and pictures of a wife and child.

     robert dean, a likable young lawyer, sits behind his
     desk with his back to an older man. he stares at a
     commanding view of washington, d.c. as he listens to a
     tired, smoke and whiskey voice.

                        older man (l.t.)
            i don't know how much longer we can
            hold out, mr. dean.

                        dean
            i don't know, either, l.t. maybe
            you guys should get yourself a
            labor lawyer.

                        l.t.
            well that's why i'm here, mr. dean.
            'cause you're a labor lawyer.

                        dean
            good point.

                        l.t.
            last night, larry spinks, he works
            the steel press, he goes to a bar
            with his wife rosalie to have a
            glass of chianti 'cause it's his
            birthday, and these two guys, these
            guido mother-fuckers, they jump him
            when he goes to the bathroom.

                        dean
            l.t., in this office i'd prefer you
            say italian-americans.

                        l.t.
            i'm sorry, mr. dean. but larry's in
            st. lukes now, so i'm a little--i'm
            not myself. the union bosses say
            unless we take bellmoth's offer,
            it'll only get worse.

                        dean
            that's because your union bosses
            are those guido mother-fuckers.

                        l.t.
            i don't under--

                        dean
            the union's trying to railroad you
            into accepting terms worse than
            what you have now.

                        l.t.
            why would the union--

     dean swivels around in his chair and faces l.t.

                        dean
            because they've been paid off by
            bellmoth.

                        l.t.
            mr. dean--

                        dean
            my name's bobby. i'm your lawyer.
            don't do anything 'till i talk to you.

     dean gets up and walks a grateful l.t. to the door,
     calling to his secretary as they go--

                        dean (cont'd)
               (calling)
            martha!

     martha appears in the doorway...

                        dean (cont'd)
            larry spinks, st. lukes. send him a
            case of chianti from the firm. and
            send his wife rosalie some flowers.
