     int. university coffee shop - day

     a place packed with students, computers and teachers.
     dean sits in a corner reading a magazine, but what he's
     really watching is--

     a well-dressed man at the counter, his back to dean,
     ordering a cup of coffee.

     the man glances at dean off the mirror behind the counter.

     brill walks in and joins dean.

                        brill
            albert's primed. we'll let him stew
            for a day and then drop the tape.

     brill looks over at the well-dressed man.

                        dean
            he came in four minutes ago.

                        brill
               (pause)
            c'mon.

     they're about to start for the front door when an
     unmarked police car pulls up in front.

     a rowdy group of frat boys flood in, loud and busy. by
     the time they pass, brill and dean are gone.

     the well-dressed man scans the coffee shop and sees the
     back door swinging shut.
