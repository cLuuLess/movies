                        marshal
            does shaffer look stupid to you?

                        shaffer
            we're not stupid, reynolds.

                        marshal
            the fuck do you have goin' on with
            sam albert?

                        shaffer
            this guy's carrying the flag for
            the damn terrorism bill. you think
            this is the best time to piss him off?

                        marshal
            you have any idea what kind of
            position this--

                        shaffer
            he's carrying the damn flag.

                        reynolds
            we're not doing anything with sam
            albert.

                        marshal
            he thinks we're stupid.

                        shaffer
            he found an nsa sat tracker on his
            motor home today.

                        reynolds
            it's not ours.

                        marshal
            it was pulsing on your sat frequencies.

                        shaffer
            i don't know what's going on, but
            if you people have tripped over
            your own asshole again, you're not
            gonna get any help from us. it's
            ending at your doorstep.

                        hicks (v.o.)
