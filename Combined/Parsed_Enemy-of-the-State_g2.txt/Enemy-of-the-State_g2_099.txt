     int. metro - night

     dean huddles in the back car, panic-breathing, as pratt
     and jones move through the cars searching for faces.

     dean looks for an out. he sees an emergency stop handle.

     he yanks it forward. passengers yell. the brakes lock
     and screech. the train slows. then stops.

     dean opens the door.

     and jumps. he looks around. just black curved track in
     either direction. he starts running.

     then he hears it.

     the horrible screeching of an approaching train.

     trapped.

     on one side, the train he left. on the other, a wall.

     he runs down the track with all that's left.

     pratt and jones reach the open door and see the
     oncoming train bearing down on dean. they duck in as
     the train swishes by.

     dean lays flat between the tracks, his face kissing
     greasy ground as the train screeches over him.

     tons of angry steel are teasing his shirt fabric.

     then it's over. the train's gone. dean's alive.

     he gets up to see pratt and jones leap to the tracks.

                        dean
               (under his breath)
            i hate these guys.

     then he sees an "emergency access" sign beaming in the
     darkness. a god-send. dean runs for it.
