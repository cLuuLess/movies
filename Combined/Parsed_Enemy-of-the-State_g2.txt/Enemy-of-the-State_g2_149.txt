     int. hotel restaurant - morning

     senator albert dines with an aide as patrick approaches,
     a grave look on his face. patrick takes a seat.

                        senator albert
            what happened to you last night?

     patrick reaches in his case and pulls out one of
     brill's listening bugs and hands it to albert who puts
     on his eyeglasses.

                        patrick
            christa found it last night
            attached to her tv. it's a
            listening device.

                        senator albert
            a bug?

                        patrick
            yeah.

                        senator albert
            jesus h.--

                        patrick
            we should everything checked.
            there's a company in cambridge
            called baudmore. they're discreet.

     seated next to albert's table is dean, unnoticed as he
     sips coffee, skims news, and eavesdrops on their
     murmurs with a small, concealed parabolic mic and ear-
     phone.

                        senator albert
            well get somebody down here today.
            i don't know what the hell this is
            all about.
