     dean and rachel on their stroll--

                        rachel
            fuck you. when you needed
            information, i got it. you didn't
            care how.

                        dean
            i did care how.

                        rachel
            this conversation's over.

                        dean
            what're you gonna do, rachel? you
            gonna sit in a bar in baltimore?
            you want your job back? you want a
            life?

                        rachel
            i don't have a life, bobby. i'm in
            love with a married man.

                        dean
            i'm sorry about that.

                        rachel
            what makes you think it's you?

                        dean
            it's not me?

                        rachel
            you're a moron, you know that?

                        dean
            yeah.

     dean smiles...and after a moment, so does rachel.

                        rachel
