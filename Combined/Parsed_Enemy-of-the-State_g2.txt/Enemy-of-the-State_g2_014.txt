     at a computer.

            zavitz, what? you want your old job
            back?

                        alfonso
            tired of chasing squirrels around
            the park?

                        zavitz
            listen--

                        alfonso

            bird feeder out in the yard, but
            the squirrels, they keep taking--

                        zavitz
            turn on cnn.

                        alfonso

            thought since you're the expert on--

                        zavitz
            goddammit, shut the fuck up and
            turn on cnn!

                        alfonso
            alright, i made a joke about
            squirrels, don't get so--

                        zavitz
            do it!

     alfonso clicks his tv to cnn. the hamersley re-cap is
     still on.

                        newscaster (v.o.)
            once again, police at this point
            are calling hamersley's death an
            accident...

                        zavitz
            i was doing motion-activated taping
            up in shenandoah. that's where
            hamersley had his accident. he
            wasn't alone. he met someone. they
            argued.

                        alfonso
            you've got it on tape?

                        zavitz
            clear as day.

                        alfonso
            who else have you told?
