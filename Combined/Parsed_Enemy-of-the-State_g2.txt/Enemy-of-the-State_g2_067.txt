     int. registration desk - continuous 

     a busy night. dean stands at the registration desk
     facing a desk clerk.

                        desk clerk
               (returning card)
            i'm sorry, sir, this card's been
            declined.

                        dean
            it's a brand new card.

                        desk clerk
            maybe it's not connected yet.

                        dean
               (handing him another)
            here, you can use this.

     the clerk runs it through. same result.

                        desk clerk
            i'm sorry.

     he returns the card, embarrassed for dean. dean turns
     to leave...

     ...and stops dead. he stares at the empty floor by a
     pillar.

                        dean
            my suitcase--

                        desk clerk
            sir?

                        dean
            my suitcase is gone.

     dean walks quickly around the area, looking at
     everything and everyone.

                        desk clerk
            i'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.

                        dean
            don't count on it.
