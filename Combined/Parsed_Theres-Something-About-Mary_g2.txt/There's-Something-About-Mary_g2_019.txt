ext. dom's house - day

dom and ted are drinking beer while sitting on dom's front steps.
we see signs of kids everywhere: a tricycle, six-foot basketball
hoop, dolls, etc.

dom's wife comes out and hands them each a cigar.

                        dom's wife
           i thought you guys might like these with
           your beers.

                        dom
           thanks, baby.

she goes back inside.

                        ted
           see, that's what i want. i don't need these
           bimbettes you got me chasing. i want what
           you have. a family....someone to...you
           know...love.

these guys don't usually talk about this crap, and ted gets a
little embarrassed.

                        ted (cont'd)
           it must be great with a wife like that.

                        dom
           each day is better than the next.
                 (beat)
           have you ever been, you know...in love with
           someone?

                        ted
           nah.

                        dom
           never?

                        ted
           well once. mary.

dom sighs.

                        dom
           mary again.

                        ted
           look, i admit it was brief, but it was
           definitely love. crushes don't last twelve
           years.

                        dom
           whatever happened to mary?

                        ted
           i told you, her family moved to miami.

                        dom
           i mean since then.

                        ted
           i don't know.

                        dom
           well why don't you look her up?

                        ted
                 (sarcastic)
           yeah, right.

                        dom
           why not?

                        ted
           because i guarantee she's married and has a
           couple kids. girls like mary don't stay
           single.

                        dom
           what if you're wrong? you just said she's
           the only girl you ever loved, what have you
           got to lose by calling her?

                        ted
           i did try calling her.
                 (sheepish)
           a few years ago. she wasn't listed.

                        dom
           so that was it? one bump in the road and
           you gave up?

                        ted
           i also called unsolved mysteries.

                        dom
           you're kidding? what did they say?

                        ted
           they told me they don't help out stalkers.
                 (beat)
           look, maybe they're right, it's been a long
           time.

                        dom
           i got it--you hire a private eye, fly him
           out there, he follows her around a couple
           days, she'll never know a thing.

ted considers this.

                        ted
           no. no fucking way. that's too creepy.

dom thinks a moment, then snaps his fingers.

                        dom
           wait a second. there's a guy named healy in
           my office who might be able to help you
           out. he's a claims investigator and he goes
           to miami every couple weeks.

as ted thinks about this, we

                                                       cut to:
