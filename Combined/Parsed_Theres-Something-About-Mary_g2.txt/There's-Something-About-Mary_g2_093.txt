int. another bar - night

healy and tucker are bonding over a beer.

                        tucker
           ...so then in '94 i went back to dade
           community college for a semester and when
           the wal-mart cashier job fell through i
           hooked up with the pizza barn.

                        healy
           and you met mary how?

                        tucker
           just dumb luck. i delivered a pie to her
           one night and she answered the door in her
           nightgown--that was it for me. i went home
           that night, shaved my beard, and a week
           later i was laid out in her office with a
           broken back.

                        healy
           how'd you manage that one?

                        tucker
                 (matter-of-factly)
           friend. baseball bat.

                        healy
           nice.

                        tucker
           oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine
           until you showed up.

                        healy
           hey, hey, hey, i'm not the one who started
           telling bald-faced lies about the
           competition--that's crossing the line!

                        tucker
           what line? the day you first laid your oily
           rap on my future wife you started a war!

                        healy
           future wife? get real, man--you're
           nothing more than a glorified brother in
           her eyes.

                        tucker
           why you son of a--

tucker grabs healy by the jacket.

                        healy
           okay, calm down, calm down--the bottom line
           is neither of us are going to get her if we
           don't do something about that headcase
           she's with now.

as tucker slowly releases him, we

                                                       cut to:
