int. mary's apt. - day

mary walks into the living room where we see an old woman, magda,
sitting on the couch listening to a stack of radio scanners.

                        mary
           have you been up all night again?

                        magda
           bet your ass i have. it's an important job,
           neighborhood watch is.

                        mary
           neighborhood watch? is that what you call
           listening in on stranger's phone
           conversations?

                        magda
           these ain't strangers, they're neighbors.
           this only picks up signals in a half-mile
           radius.

                        mary
           meaning?

                        magda
           meaning these are the people you live
           amongst, you got a right to know if they're
           creeps. for instance, did you know there's
           a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?

                        mary
                 (feigning shock)
           you picked that up on the scanner. we gotta
           move.

                        magda 
           i confirmed it on the scanner. i knew
           something was up because puffy used to bark
           like hell whenever he saw him and you know
           puffy only barks at bad people.

magda pats her little dog puffy on the head.

                        mary
           magda, puffy barks at everybody.

                        magda
           that's because there's a lot of bad people
           out there. hey, puffy tried to warn you
           about that steve guy you was seeing--he was
           a fucking asswipe--but you had to find out
           for yourself, didn't you?

                        mary
           okay, you win. now try to get some sleep,
           huh.

mary gives magda a kiss and heads to her bedroom.
