int. bathroom - continuous

                        ted
           one guess.

                        mary's dad
           how the hell'd you get the beans all the
           way up top like that?

                        ted
           i don't know. it's not like it was a well
           thought-out plan.

                        mary's mom
           oh my, there sure is a lot of skin coming
           through there.

                        mary's dad
           i'm guessing that's what the soprano shriek
           was about, pumpkin.

                        mary's mom
           i'm going to get some bactine.

                        ted
           no, please!

suddenly a police officer sticks his head in the bathroom window.

                        police officer
           ho there.

                        ted
                 (humiliated)
           oh god.

                        police officer
           everything okay here? neighbors said they
           heard a lady scream.

                        mary's dad
           you're looking at him. c'mere and take a
           look at this beauty.

                        ted
           no, that's really unneces--

but the officer's already climbing in the window. once inside, he
turns his flashlight on ted and whistles.

                        police officer
           now i've seen it all. what the hell were
           you thinking?

                        ted
                 (frustrated)
           i wasn't trying--

                        police officer
           is that bubble what i think it is? 

mary's parents nod.

                        police officer (cont'd)
           but...how...how'd you get the zipper all
           the way to the top?

                        mary's dad
           let's just say the kid's limber.

the officer makes a face, then rolls up his sleeves.

                        police officer
           well, there's only one thing to do.

                        ted
           no, no, no, i'll be fine. i'll just hang my
           shirttail out and work on it in the
           morning.

                        police officer
           look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.

the officer reaches down and takes hold of the zipper.

                        ted
           no, no, please!

                        mary's mom
           teddy, be brave.

                        warren (o.s.)
           beans and franks!

                        mary (o.s.)
           warren, shhh.

defeated, ted holds his breath and braces for the worst.

                        police officer
           it's just like pulling off a band-aid.
           a-one and a-two and...

                                                       cut to:

                        paramedic
           we got a bleeder!
