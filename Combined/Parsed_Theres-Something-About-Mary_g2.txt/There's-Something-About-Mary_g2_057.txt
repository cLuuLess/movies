int. mary's family room - same

a panicked healy is giving the little mutt mouth-to-mouth now.
then back to the heart, the mouth, the heart, the mouth....

                        healy
                 (quietly, desperately, to puffy)
           come on, man, stay away from the light!

healy resumes blowing into the dog's snout, pumping his chest,
with no results. desperate, he picks up the cheese knife and
quickly slices the wires on two table lamps.

healy grabs the two wires and touches them together like a
defibrillator on the little pooch's chest.

zzzzztttttt - the dog bounces a couple feet off the couch as
sparks fly.

healy takes his pulse again. nothing. he zaps him once more with
the live wires.

zzzzzttttt - still nothing. healy gets to his feet and peeks
into the kitchen. when he turns his back, we see puffy ignite in
flames.

when healy turns back, he's horrified at what he sees. he grabs a
vase of flowers and pours the water on the burning dog.

with this, puffy flinches and comes to, gasping for air!

                        magda
           all i had was some funny bones--how does
           that sound, honey?

healy picks up the stunned pooch and swaddles it in a blanket as
magda enters the room followed by mary.

                        healy
                 (petting dog)
           fine. fine.

                        mary
           here you go.
                 (sniffs)
           what's that smell?

mary hands healy his vodka and as he downs it, we

                                                       cut to:
