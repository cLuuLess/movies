int. prison hallway

the two detectives and an apoplectic ted walk down the hallway.

                        detective franek
           at exactly 10:48 this morning a man was
           apprehended not far from where you were
           arrested. he was identified as an escaped
           mental patient and subsequently confessed
           to the murder that you were being held for.
           lab tests confirmed a fingerprint match on
           the bag.

                        ted
                 (fragile)
           so...i'm free to go?

detective cavallo stops and holds out his hand.

                        detective cavallo
           no harm, no foul?

                        ted
                 (stunned)
           i guess.

still traumatized, ted shakes the man's hand, then mopes toward
the door.

                        detective franek
           by the way, there's somebody here to see
           you.
