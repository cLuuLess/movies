int. providence union insurance company - day

on healy's cubicle - healy's taking his last boxload of crap out
of his cubicle when he spots ted. he tries to duck back in but
ted sees him. healy forces a smile as ted approaches.

                        ted
           what are you doing?

                        healy
           oh, uh, i resigned.

ted picks up a plane ticket off the desk.

                        ted
           miami?

                        healy
           yeah, this insurance business is too slow
           for me. i'm going to go down and try my
           hand at jai alai.

                        ted
           jai alai?

                        healy
           yeah, i don't know why but i always felt at
           home in the fronton.

healy starts walking out of the office and ted follows. healy is
having a hard time looking him in the eye. so he doesn't.

                        ted
           look, uh, i've been thinking about
           everything you told me. 

                        healy
           good good.

                        ted
           well i think you're right, i should look 
           her up.

                        healy
           rollerpig? are you nuts?

                        ted
           but you said she was a sparkplug...?

                        healy

ted sighs and follows healy out the front door.
