int. ted's apartment - night

we pan across the room of unopened boxes to ted laying awake in
bed. we hear head-banger music coming from the apartment next
door. finally ted gets up and walks over to his dresser. as he
flips on a small light we see loose change, a balled-up kleenex, a
few golf tees, and ted's wallet. ted picks up the wallet and opens
it.

ted's pov - inside is an an old high school photo of a smiling
mary.

as ted looks at it, he can't help but smile, too.
