int. bar - night

ted's rolling a little wine around in a glass. he takes a sip,
nods his approval.

                        ted
           thanks, that's great.

the waiter turns to mary.

                        waiter
           madame?

angle on mary - the light, puffy bangs that mary started the
night with are gone, replaced by a glazed, ace ventura-style wave
up front.

                        mary
           thank you.

the waiter pours her a glass and leaves.

                        ted
           now by killer, you mean...?

                        mary
           i mean he murdered someone and did time
           back in boston. the guy's a freak.

                        ted
                 (stunned)
