ext. cumberland, rhode island high school - morning

it's the early 1980's and everyone is arriving at school. we push
through the parking lot crowd to a nervous, lanky kid, ted
peloquin.

                        man's voice (v.o.)
           when i was sixteen years old i fell in
           love...

close on - renise, a tough girl with stringy brown hair and a
shiny forehead, as she turns toward the camera.

                        ted
           hey, renise.

she barely looks at him as he approaches, just drags on her smoke.

                        renise
           hey.

                        ted
           so what's up?

                        renise
           eh.

                        ted
           great. great.
                 (beat)
           so listen, uh, i was wondering if maybe you
           wanted to go to the prom you know, with
           me.

renise looks unenthused.

                        ted (cont'd)
           it's no big deal, whatever i mean, if you
           want.

                        renise
           see, the thing is, i heard a rumor that
           this guy i like was gonna ask me.

                        ted
           uh-huh.

                        renise
           yeah, so...i'm gonna wait and see what
           happens there...but that sounds great,
           yeah.

ted nods, confused.

                        ted
           okay.
                 (beat)
           so is that a yes or a no?

                        renise
           i think i was very clear, ted. if
           everything else falls apart, maybe.

renise throws down her butt and storms off.

                        ted
           i'm gonna hold you to that.
