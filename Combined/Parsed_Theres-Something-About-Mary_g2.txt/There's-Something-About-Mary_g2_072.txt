tucker has a look of concern.

                        mary
           not long at all, but i really like him.
                 (off tucker's look)
           okay, i know he's a little different,
           tucker, but that's what i like about him.
           he's a guy. a real guy. he dresses like a
           dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always
           politically correct and he probably farts,
           too. and that's okay with me.

                        tucker
           that's what you've been looking for--a
           farter?

                        mary
           i've been looking for a guy--not one of
           these south beach pussies.

                        tucker
                 (sighs)
           look, it's just that something about him
           struck me as odd last night. he gave me
           this funny vibe. anyway, i called some
           friends back east. they don't know of any
           architect named patrick healy and he's not
           listed as a harvard alumnus.
