int. interrogation room - day

ted stands as the detectives take a seat across from him.

                        ted
                 (agitated)
           i'm telling you, i did not solicit sex! i
           was just stopping to go the bathroom, next
           thing i know i tripped over something--well
           someone--and, poof, there's cops and
           lights and--

                        detective franek
           okay, calm down, ted, we believe you.
                 (beat)
           the problem is we found your friend in
           the car.

as ted sits back down the detectives just stare at him. finally
ted thinks he gets it.

                        ted
           oh. the hitchhiker.
                 (chuckles)
           that's what this is all about.

ted puts his head in his hands and smiles.

                        ted (cont'd)
           isn't that just my luck--i get caught for
           everything.

                        detective cavallo
           so you admit it?

                        ted
           guilty as charged. i'm not gonna play games
           with you. i could give you a song and dance
           but what's the point? i did it and we all
           know it.
                 (laughs)
           the hitcher himself told me it's
           illegal the irony.

the detectives are surprised by his forthrightness.

                        detective cavallo
           well, uh, can you tell us his name?

                        ted
           jeez, i didn't catch it.

the detectives flinch at his glib demeanor.

                        detective franek
           so he was a stranger? it was totally
           random?

                        ted
                 (confused)
           he was the first hitcher i saw, what can i
           tell you? now cut to the chase, how much
           trouble am i in? 

the detectives look at one another. 

                        detective franek
           first tell us why you did it.

                        ted
           why i did it?
                 (scoffs)
           i don't know. boredom? i thought i was
           doing the guy a favor.

the detectives look at each other.

                        detective cavallo
           this wasn't your first time, was it, ted?
           how many we talking?

                        ted
           hitchhikers? i don't know--fifty...a
           hundred maybe--who keeps track?

finally detective cavallo explodes across the table and starts
wailing on a shocked ted.

                        detective cavallo
           you sonofabitch! you're gonna fry!!!!

                                                       cut to:
