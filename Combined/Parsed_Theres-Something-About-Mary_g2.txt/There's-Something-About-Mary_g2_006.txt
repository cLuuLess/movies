ext. mary' s front door - twilight

ted knocks on the door and mary's gruff dad answers.

                        mary's dad
           yeah? what do you want?

                        ted
           um, hi, i'm ted peloquin. i'm here to take
           mary to the prom.

                        mary's dad
           prom? you're about twenty minutes late. she
           just left for the prom with her boyfriend
           woogie.

ted looks devastated. suddenly the door swings open revealing
mary's mom.

                        mary's mom
           charlie, that's mean. come on in, ted.
           don't listen to mr. wise guy here. he's a
           joke a minute.

                        ted
           oh.
                 (relieved)
           oh, that's a good one.
