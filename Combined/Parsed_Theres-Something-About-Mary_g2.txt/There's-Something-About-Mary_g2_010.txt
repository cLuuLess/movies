int. bathroom - continuous

a whimpering ted huddles in the corner as mary's dad enters.

                        mary's dad (cont'd)
           what seems to be the situation here? you
           shit yourself or something?

                        ted
           i wish.

ted motions for him to close the door and mary's dad obliges.

                        ted (cont'd)
           i, uh...i got it stuck.

                        mary's dad

                        ted
           it.

                        mary's dad

                 (beat)
           oh it. all right, these things happen,
           let me have a look. it's not the end of the
           world.

mary's dad moves closer and puts his reading glasses on.
