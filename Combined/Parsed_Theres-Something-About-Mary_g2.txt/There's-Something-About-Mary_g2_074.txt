           i thought so. anyway, i hope you don't
           think i'm being meddlesome. i just think
           you should be careful with this guy.

                        mary
                 (concerned)
           no no no, tucker, thank you.

           i mean let's face it, mary, you're
           beautiful, you've got money, you trust
           people--i'm just saying, there's a lot of
           psychos out there.

                        mary
                 (small smile)
           i appreciate you looking out for me.
