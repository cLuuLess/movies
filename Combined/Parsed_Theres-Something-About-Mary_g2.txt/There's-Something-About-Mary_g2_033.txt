int. sully's apartment - night

sully is sitting on the kitchen floor in his police uniform, a
ring of white around his nostrils. the room is littered with beer
cans, he has another one in his hand, there's a pile of cocaine
and a rolled-up bill on the breakfast table. the dog and the snake
are in the doorway looking at him with concern.
