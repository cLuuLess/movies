ext. mary's apartment building - day

ted comes out of the building, a broken man. he paces back and
forth on the sidewalk, manic with despair. then he seems to grow
angry. he rifles through his pockets until he finds a slip of
paper.

ted's pov - the paper reads: 'healy's miami address--229 court
street, apt. 43.'
