ext. miami street - day

ted is walking down the street blubbering like a schoolgirl.
everyone he passes stares at him. suddenly mary comes running down
the other side of the street.

                        mary
           ted!

ted stops and looks across the street at her. he wipes his eyes,
hopeful.

                        ted
           what what are you doing here?

                        mary
           you forgot your keys!

she holds up a rabbit foot key-chain.

                        ted
                 (deflated)
           oh. thanks.

they remain across the street from one another.

                        mary
           did you mean what you said back there, ted?

ted starts to well up again.

                        mary (cont'd)
           ted...?

                        ted
                 (looking down)
           i...i just want you to be happy, mary.

                        mary
           but i think i'd be happiest...with you.

ted just stares at her.

                        ted
           you're fucking with me, right?

mary smiles.

                        ted (cont'd)
                 (wiping eyes)
           but but what about steve?

                        mary
           oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun--the guy
           doesn't even drink beer or gamble.

now ted smiles.

                        mary (cont'd)
           get over here.

                        ted
           really?

                        mary
           really.

the beaming ted starts walking across the street. suddenly a bus
whizzes by and smacks ted broadside. he bounces around under the
bus like a rag doll, then finally squirts out the back end and
tumbles to a limp stop.

mary screams and runs toward the body as a crowd begins to gather.

                        mary
           ted, no, no....!

she starts giving him cpr. somebody covers him with a blanket.

just then, another car whizzes over his feet like speedbumps. the
crowd winces.

                        mary (cont'd)
           somebody hold up traffic!
                 (beat)
           come on, ted. come on. tell me you're going
           to be okay.

then ted takes a deep breath and his eyes flutter open.

                        ted
           mary....oh mary, i love you.

mary's smile is as bright as the light from heaven.

                        mary
           i love you too, ted.
                 (beat)
           i think i always have.

as the two lovebirds kiss, a lady calls out:

                        lady
           over here! i found his foot! it was in the
           storm drain!

on the lady as she holds up a severed foot in a cloth.

                        mary
           all right, everyone, let's fan out and look
           for the penis!

as ted reacts to this, we pull up, up, up, and
