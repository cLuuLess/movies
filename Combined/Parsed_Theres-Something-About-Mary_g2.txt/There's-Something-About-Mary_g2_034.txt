int. healy's car - night

healy looks at the phone, concerned.

                        healy
           uh, i'm fine. just wanted to let you know
           i'll have your car back in a couple hours,
           i'm still staking out this girl's
           apartment.

                        sully (v.o.)
           you found my car?!

just then healy notices mary pull up and park. he slides down in
his seat.

on mary - she gets out carrying a bag and approaches the
homeless man, who is still sitting on the sidewalk. she hands him
the bag.

                        homeless man
           thanks, mary.

                        mary
           you watch out for yourself, herb.

as mary bounds up the steps of her building, we

hold on the homeless man as he happily takes a sandwich and soda
out of the bag.
