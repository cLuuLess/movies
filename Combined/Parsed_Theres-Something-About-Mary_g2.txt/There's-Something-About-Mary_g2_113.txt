int. mary's apartment - continuous

ted peeks around the corner and sees a somber mary sitting on the
couch.

                        ted
                 (chipper)
           hey.

mary doesn't look up. ted enters, revealing his gifts.

                        ted (cont'd)
           the flowers are for you and the ball's for
           warren. i had a friend of mine fedex it to
           me--it's signed by tony conigliaro.

mary finally looks up but doesn't smile.

                        mary
           did you hire pat healy to follow me around?

ted tries to hide his horror.

                        ted
                 (lamely)
           what do you mean?

mary picks up a letter off the coffee table and hands it to him.
ted takes a quick look and then drops it on the table.

                        mary
           it's not true...right, ted?

ted clears his throat.

                        ted
           well, funny story there. you see, uh, it
           started out as a uh...yeah...it's true. =

mary stands up.

                        mary
           get out.

                        ted
           wait, hold on, mary--it's not as bad as it
           sounds. i certainly didn't know--

                        mary
           that you put a murderer on my trail?

                        ted
           well yeah, i didn't know much about him. i
           just thought--

                        mary
           what did you think, ted? that you could spy
           on me and trick me into thinking you were
           someone i could...really go for?

mary starts to get emotional.

                        ted
           mary, i swear i wasn't trying to trick you.

                        mary
           then what the fuck did you do it for?

                        ted
           i did it because because i'd never
           stopped thinking about you and if i didn't
           find you i knew my life would never be good
           again.

mary looks away.

                        mary
                 (softly)
           please leave.

                        ted
                 (devastated)
           mary, come on...

                        mary
           go!

                        ted
                 (beat)
           okay.

and so ted does.

                                                       cut to:
