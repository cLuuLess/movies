int. toyota tercel

a determined ted is cruising along the highway in his rent-a-car.
he has a cup of coffee in his hand and a hitchhiker in the seat
beside him. the hitchhiker sits with a large red duffel bag
between his legs.

                        hitchhiker
           thanks for picking me up. 

                        ted
           no prob, i could use the company. i've been
           on the road going on fifteen hours
           straight.

                        hitchhiker
           i know how you feel--i been standing in the
           same spot for the last five hours. you know
           it's against the law to pick up a
           hitchhiker in this state.

                        ted
           that must make it tough.

                        hitchhiker
           sucks. so what's up? you some kind of
           salesman or something?

                        ted
           nah. i'm...i'm nothing.

                        hitchhiker
           oh. well i am.

                        ted
           hm?

                        hitchhiker
           a salesman--that's what i am. i mean, i'm
           gonna be anyway. i'm starting my own
           company--video sales--just as soon as i get
           enough seed money.

                        ted
           'that right? good for you.

                        hitchhiker
           yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea--it's a
           home run. you ever hear of eight-minute
           abs?

                        ted
           the exercise tape? sure, i've seen it on
           t.v.

                        hitchhiker
           two million copies it sold last year. two
           million, man. but not next year--my idea's
           gonna blow them outta the water. get this:
                 (dramatic pause)
           seven-minute abs.

beat.

                        ted
           i see where you're going.

                        hitchhiker
                 (big smile)
           think about it. you walk into a video
           store and you see eight-minute abs and
           right next to it you see seven-minute
           abs--which one you gonna spring for?

                        ted
           i'd go with the seven.

                        hitchhiker
           bingo. especially since we guarantee you'll
           get every bit as good a work-out.

                        ted
           how do you guarantee that?

                        hitchhiker
           well it's the company motto: 'if you ain't
           happy we'll send you the extra minute.'

                        ted
           huh. that sounds great.
                 (beat)
           unless someone else comes out with
           six-minute abs.

ted chuckles, but the hitchhiker just glares at him, unamused.

                        ted (cont'd)
                 (unaware)
           i'm gonna pull over. i gotta take a leak.
