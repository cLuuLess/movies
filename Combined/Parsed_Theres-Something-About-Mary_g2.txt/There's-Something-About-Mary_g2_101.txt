int. mary's apartment - night

as ted and mary enter, we see magda holding up the couch with one
hand and vacuuming with the other.

mary doesn't know what to make of it.

                        mary
           magda, what are you doing?

magda turns off the vacuum and we hear a banging sound coupled
with the o.s. muffled yapping of puffy.

                        magda
           oh, hi hon. just straightening up.

                        mary
           where's puffy?

                        magda
           ah, he was being a pest so i put him in the
           bathroom.

as the o.s. yapping and banging continues, magda picks up the
television and starts dusting the tv stand.

                        mary
                 (to ted, concerned)
           um, ted, i need a moment with magda--would
           you let the dog out of the bathroom.

                        ted
           yeah, sure.

ted walks down the hall, following the yapping and banging sound
until he comes to the bathroom door. the yapping is much louder
now and he notices something that makes him hesitate.

ted's pov - the bottom part of the door is being dented outward
from the force of something battering it from within.

                        ted
                 (calling out)
           uh, mare, what kind of dog is puffy?

                        mary (o.s.)
                 (calling out)
           toy poodle!

ted thinks about this, shrugs, and opens the door.

baring his teeth like a rottweiler, puffy springs at ted's
jugular!
