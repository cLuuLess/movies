           she's a dental hygienist. she'll know what
           to do.

mary's mom comes in and closes the door behind her.

                        mary's mom
           teddy, hon, are you okay?
                 (moving closer, seeing the situation)

           just relax, dear. now, um...what exactly
           are we looking at here?

                        ted
                 (dizzy)
           what do you mean?

                        mary's mom
                 (delicate)

                        mary's dad
                 (gruff)

                        ted
           i think a little of both.

suddenly we hear warren from outside the door:

                        warren (o.s.)
           franks and beans!

ted hangs his head.
