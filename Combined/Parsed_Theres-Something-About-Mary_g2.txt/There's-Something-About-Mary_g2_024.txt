int. sully's apartment - day

this place is modest and clean but it has a direct view of south
beach. healy puts his bags down and looks around.

                        healy
           very nice.

                        sully
           i'm doing okay.
                 (checks watch)
           i gotta get ready for work.

sully ducks into the bedroom and healy looks around the apartment.

                        healy
           okay? with this pad, the killer wheels?
           looks like you really cleaned up your act.

                        sully (o.s.)
           what can i tell you? it's a healthier
           lifestyle down here, and it's easier to
           succeed when your head's clear. those guys
           i worked with back in boston, they were a
           bad influence.

                        healy
           fuckin' animals. hey, what do you say we go
           grab a couple drinks.

                        sully (o.s.)
           not for me, buddy. i don't drink anymore.

                        healy
           yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?

suddenly a huge boa constrictor slithers up on healy's lap.

                        healy (cont'd)
           what the...?!

sully comes back in the room wearing a police uniform.

                        sully
           take it easy, that's bill.

                        healy
           tell bill to get the fuck off!

                        sully
                 (smiling)
           relax, he just ate.

healy just stares at his friend.

                        sully (cont'd)
                 (proudly)
           nineteen months i been sober.

                        healy
           what are you talking about? you were never
           an alky, you were a cokehead.

                        sully
           yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta
           quit the booze, too.

                        healy
           is that right? well good for you, sull, i'm
           proud of you.

healy pops open one of his beers and hands it to sully.

                        healy (cont'd)
           here, just have one of these then.

                        sully
           healy, what i just tell you?

                        healy
           this is a light beer. you can't have a
           light beer?

                        sully
           no i can't.

healy stares at him, baffled.

                        healy
           sully, it's one fuckin' beer for christ
           sakes.
                 (holds up beer)
           ooh, the big bad beer's gonna get ya.

sully stares at the beer, weakening.

                        healy (cont'd)
           i'm worried about you, man. you better
           learn to have a pop once in a while or
           you're gonna fall off the wagon. you're
           being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.

                        sully
           am i?

                        healy
           bet your ass you are. now i don't want to
           hear anymore of your happy horseshit. you
           gotta learn how to bend a little or believe
           me...you're gonna break.

finally, sully takes the beer. he stares at it a moment and then
sips.

                        sully
           jesus, you know what? this shit doesn't
           even taste good to me anymore.

                        healy
           ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. what are
           you, spotting?

healy takes the beer from sully and as he chugs it, we

                                                       cut to:
