ext. driving range parking lot - day

healy is sitting in sully's chrysler lebaron, right next to mary's
honda civic.

he watches the rear-view mirror, and the moment he sees mary
coming out from the driving range, he swings his legs out the door
and starts changing out of his golf shoes. as mary tosses her
golf bag into the trunk, she notices healy tying his shoes. a
second chance.

                        mary
           well, it was nice meeting you, again.

                        healy
           same here again.

                        mary
           by the way, what's your name?

                        healy
           pat healy.

there's an uncomfortable pause...why doesn't this guy ask the
usual questions?

                        mary
           don't you want to know my name?

                        healy
           i already know it, mary.

                        mary
                 (surprised)
           how'd you know that?

                        healy
           it's right there on your golf bag.

healy opens the back door to put away his golf shoes. suddenly,
rolls and rolls of paper come tumbling out. mary bends over to
help healy pick them up.

                        mary
           what are you doing with all these
           blueprints?

                        healy
           some buildings i'm working on.

                        mary
           are you...an architect?

                        healy
           well, just until i get my pga tour card.

mary stares at him, mouth agape.

                        healy (cont'd)
           i'm kidding. yeah, i guess you could call
           me an architect--it's just a job really, a
           way to keep me moving. my real passion is
           my hobby.

                        mary
           what's that?

                        healy
           i work with retards.

                        mary
                 (taken aback)
           i beg your pardon?

                        healy
           you know...
                 (flaps lips with fingers)
           ...the guys who ride the short bus.

                        mary
                 (put off)
           isn't that a little politically incorrect?

                        healy
           the hell with that. no one's gonna tell me
           who i can and can't work with.

                        mary
           no, i mean

                        healy
           --there's this one kid, we call him mongo
           on account of he's a mongoloid. he got out
           of his cage once and--

                        mary
           --he's in a cage?! 

                        healy
           well it's more of an enclosure really.

                        mary
           they keep him confined? that's bullshit!

                        healy
           that's what i said, so i went out and got
           him a leash you know, one of those
           clothesline runners for the backyard. he's
           got plenty of room out there to dig. the
           kid's really blossomed. now i can take him
           to ball games, movies--you know, happy
           stuff.

                        mary
           that sounds like fun.

                        healy
           yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven
           for me.
                 (getting emotional)
           those goofy bastards are just about the
           best thing i have in this crazy old world.
                 (checks watch)
           ooh, hey, i gotta run.

                        mary
                 (won back over)
           look, uh, i was thinking maybe we should go
           have dinner sometime.

healy smiles at this and we

                                                       cut to:
