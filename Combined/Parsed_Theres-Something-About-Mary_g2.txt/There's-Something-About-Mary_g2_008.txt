int. bathroom - twilight

ted dabs his head with a tissue, then moves to the toilet. as he
takes a leak he glances out the window to his left.

ted's pov - two lovebirds are perched on a branch.

ted smiles...

...at the sound of these beautiful tweeties singing their love
song for themselves, for the spring, for ted and mary, and
suddenly they fly away and we...

snap focus

...to reveal mary in the bedroom window directly behind where the
birds were, in just a bra and panties, and just then her mother
glances ted's way and makes eye-contact with what she can only
presume to be a leering peeping tom.

on ted...

...he loses the smile and ducks his head back into the bathroom,
horrified.

panicking now, he hastily zips up his fly and

                        ted
           yeeeooooowwwwww!!!!!!!!!!

ted gets his dick stuck in the zipper!
