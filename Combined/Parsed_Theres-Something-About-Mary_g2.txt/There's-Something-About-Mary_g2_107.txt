ext. scenic pier - miami - day

--ted and mary are walking arm and arm on a scenic pier
where people are fishing. right behind them are magda
and herb (the homeless guy) enjoying one another's
company. ted is on top of the world, feeling good,
looking good-right up until he gets the hook in his
mouth. suddenly he gets yanked out of frame.
