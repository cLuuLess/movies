int. ted's car - day

dom is driving; a bruised and somber ted is in the passenger seat.

                        dom
           you are one lucky sonofabitch, you know
           that?

                        ted
           i am?

                        dom
           didn't they tell you? that hitcher was just
           about to cut your throat when you stopped
           to take a leak. you got a fucking horseshoe
           up your ass, man.

                        ted
           yeah feels like it.

ted grimaces and shifts in his seat.

                        ted (cont'd)
           how the hell did you get here anyway?

                        dom
           flew.
                 (beat)
           told my wife i was going to a promise
           keepers convention.

ted gives him a look.

                        dom (cont'd)
           i hate to ruin your day, ted, but i have
           some bad news for you.

ted sighs.

                        ted
                 (resigned)
           shoot.

                        dom
           remember our friend healy? well, i didn't
           know where to mail his last paycheck so i
           sent my assistant by his mother's
           apartment. turns out there is no diabetic
           mom. landlord said she's been dead for ten
           years.

                        ted
           and this adversely affects me how...?

                        dom
           don't you see?--healy lied to us about
           everything! the landlord said when he got
           back from miami he kept talking about
           falling for some doctor named mary!

ted is stunned.

                        ted
           huh? what? no...my mary? mary wouldn't go
           for him....would she?

dom hands ted a slip of paper.

                        dom
           his address in miami. you know, when you
           think about it, we really don't know the
           first thing about this guy.

finally the implications of this dawn on ted.

                        ted
           jesus christ what have i done?

                                                       cut to:
