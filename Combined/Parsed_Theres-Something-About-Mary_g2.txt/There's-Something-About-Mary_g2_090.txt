ted opens the door and mary is standing there looking as lovely as
ever.

                        ted

                        mary

                        mary
           thanks.

she notices something.

                        mary (cont'd)
           what's that?

                        ted
           hm?

                        mary

mary's pov - a huge load is hanging off of ted's earlobe like a
drop earring.

                        mary (cont'd)

mary leans forward for a closer look. ted is terrified.

                        mary (cont'd)

                        mary
           oh great, i ran out.

before ted can stop her, mary grabs the load off his ear and wipes
it in her bangs.
