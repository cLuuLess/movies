int. mary's living room - night

healy is sitting on mary's couch with puffy spread-eagled
upside-down on his lap, knocked out cold. mary and magda look on
in amazement.

                        healy
                 (baby talk)
           oh, pufferball likes his little tum-tum
           rubbed, doesn't he now?

                        mary
           wow, i've never seen him like this. he
           doesn't usually like guys.

                        magda
           you mean he doesn't like bad guys.

                        healy
           'that right?

                        magda
           he can tell you're an animal nut. you are,
           aren't ya?

                        healy
           truth is i usually get along better with
           animals than with people. in nepal the
           villagers call me 'kin-tan-tee', which
           means 'man who is loved by many animals...
                 (babbling)
           ...who love him a lot, too...and so on.'

magda stares dreamily at healy, smitten.

                        magda
           would you like a glass of tea or something?

                        healy
           you got a brew?

                        mary
           sure.
                 (noticing magda's trance)
           uh, magda, why don't you get some more
           cheese and crackers...?

                        magda
           oh, yeah, of course, dear.

the two women go into the kitchen and healy is left to pet the
motionless dog. suddenly healy notices that the dog is a little
too motionless. healy checks puffy's pulse. he looks at his watch
to time the rate.

                        mary (o.s.)
                 (calling out)
           sorry, pat, out of beer. you like vodka?

                        healy
                 (calling out)
           great.

he starts shaking the dog, but puffy doesn't move. healy goes into
action. he starts pressing on his heart, performing doggie cpr.
one-and-two-and-three, he continues trying to revive him.

                        magda (o.s.)
                 (calling out)
           would you like a little clam-dip, honey?

                        healy
                 (calling out)
           no, thanks.
                 (panicking)
           love a little bundt cake if you have some!
