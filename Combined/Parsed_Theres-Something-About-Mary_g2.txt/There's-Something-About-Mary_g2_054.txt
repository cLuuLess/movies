int. mary's apartment building - hallway - night

healy tiptoes up to mary's apartment door. he peeks through the
mail slot.

healy's pov - puffy is staring at him and growling.

healy reaches in his pocket, pulls out a valium and a doggy treat.
healy shoves the pill into the treat's soft center, examines it,
then thinks what the hell and shoves in another one.

puffy growls louder. healy pops the treat through the mail slot
and listens as the dog devours it. healy looks at his watch, then
sneaks back outside to wait a few minutes for the drugs to kick
in.
