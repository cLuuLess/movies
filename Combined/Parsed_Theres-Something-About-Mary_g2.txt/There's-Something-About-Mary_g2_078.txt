int. mary's apartment - evening

a confused mary and her girlfriends are in the apartment while
magda listens to the radio scanner in the b.g.

                        lisa
           you're not seriously thinking about going
           out with this guy again?

                        joannie
           mary, he sounds like a psycho!

                        magda
           would you hens quit ya cackling and let her
           do what she wants to do. puffy liked him
           and puffy's never wrong.

the girlfriends roll their eyes.

                        brenda
           mary, the guy's full of shit.

                        mary
           what if he's not? what if tucker just made
           an honest mistake?

                        lisa
           what if he didn't?

it's clear that mary is torn.

                        mary
           i don't know how i can bail now, he's going
           to be here any minute.

                        joannie
           well then blow him off when he gets here.

                        mary
           but you didn't meet him. he seems so i
           don't know...perfect...kind of.

                        brenda
           he has a big cock, doesn't he?

mary shoots brenda a look. 

                        magda
           hey hey, what did you say pat's last name
           was?

                        mary
           healy.

magda's eyes almost come out of her head.

                        magda
           i think you better listen to this.

magda turns up the volume on her scanner and we can clearly hear
healy talking on his cellular phone. mary and her girlfriends
gather around.

                        sully (v.o.)
           so where the hell are you, healy?

                        healy (v.o.)
           ah, i got a date tonight with that mary
           girl i told you about.

                        sully (v.o.)
           the sawbones?

                        healy (v.o.)
           yep.

the girls all look at one another.

                        brenda
           we hit the motherlode.

                        mary
           we shouldn't be listening to this.

                        lisa and joannie
           shhh.

                        sully (v.o.)
           she still think you're a fucking architect?

                        healy (v.o.)
           oh yeah.

                        sully (v.o.)
           dumbshit.

                        lisa
           mr. perfect, huh?

mary starts to feel like a fool.

                        mary
                 (edgy)
           turn it up, magda.

                        healy (v.o.)
           hey, watch your mouth--she's a great gal.
           i'm the dumbshit for lying to her.

                        sully (v.o.)
           why didn't you just tell her the truth?

                        healy (v.o.)
           i don't know. i guess...it just seems that
           women today are more impressed by the
           mighty buck than by some schmo who spent
           the last seventeen years scraping by on
           peace corp wages.

the girls all seem moved by this.
