ext. macdonald's drive-thru window - morning

mary waits in the drive-thru lane reading the sports page. finally
the window opens and she is handed a huge bag of food.

pan to healy watching from his car.

                        healy
                 (into mic)
           well, from her figure and her appetite, i'm
           guessing she's either got a bowel disorder
           or we've got a hurler on our hands.
