int. mary's apartment - day

healy and tucker storm into the room and freeze at what they see.

their pov - dom is cradling several pairs of shoes in his arms
and trying to crawl to the door while mary holds him back.

                        mary
           stop it!

                        dom
           just one pair! you owe me that much, you
           heartless bitch!

healy and tucker grab dom and throw him down on the couch.

                        healy
           dom, you're pathetic, fucking over your
           friend ted like that.

                        dom
           what? you fucked him over, too.

                        healy
           he's no friend of mine.

suddenly magda enters from her bedroom. she's holding a half-eaten
banana split. herb, the homeless man, follows after her, sporting
a tom jones and buttoning up his shirt.

                        magda
           what the hell's going on here?

at first no one knows what to say. then:

                        healy
           we're in love with your roommate.

                        magda
           aw, christ, i can't take it anymore. i'm
           gonna pack my bags and go back to my own
           place.

magda heads back into her bedroom and herb follows.

                        mary
           tucker, where are your crutches?

tucker is stumped for a second, then:

                        tucker
                 (british accent)
           interesting query, mary...

healy slaps tucker in the back of the head.

                        healy
           shut the fuck up and tell her the truth.

before he can respond, ted enters.

                        tucker
           well isn't this nice--now we've got the
           whole gang together.

ted can hardly believe dom is there.

                        ted
           dom? what are you?

                        dom
           you stole her from me. now i want her back.

                        mary
                 (rolling eyes)
           woogie and i went out for awhile in high
           school.

                        ted
                 (stunned)
           you're woogie?

                        dom
           dom wooganowski. duh.

                        ted
           but but you're married. you have kids a
           great wife.

                        dom
           if you're so happy with them, please, be my
           guest.

                        healy
           if i may i have a proposal.

everyone turns to healy.

                        healy (cont'd)
           i say none of us leave this room until our
           young mary here stops jerking us around and
           decides once and for all who she wants. now
           mary, i know this is difficult but you
           really will be doing them all a favor to
           tell them the truth about us.

                        mary
           are you crazy? why would i pick you? you're
           a murderer.

healy glares at tucker.

                        tucker
           uh, well...not exactly. you see, i
           exaggerated a little there.

                        mary
           you mean he's not a criminal?

                        healy
           god no!
                 (pleased)
           i'm just a pathological liar!

mary looks at tucker, confused.

                        mary
           tucker...not you, too?

tucker lowers his head and reluctantly nods.

                        tucker
           name's norm. i live up in pompano with my
           folks.

                        mary
           oh jesus...

just then the door opens and brett favre, the packers quarterback
enters, with warren (wearing a walkman) beside him. everyone is
stunned.

                        mary (cont'd)
           brett...?

                        brett favre
           hi, mary.

                        healy
           what the hell is brett favre doing here?

                        brett favre
           we're in town to play the dolphins.

                        ted
           i called him. i told him to pick up warren
           and get over here.

everyone turns their attention to ted.

                        ted (cont'd)
           mary, i found out that your buddy tucker
           there lied to you about brett.

tucker lowers his head.

                        ted (cont'd)
           brett never said anything bad about warren.
           he loves warren...and from what he just
           told me on the phone, he loves you, too.
                 (beat)
           he's the guy you should be with.

                        brett favre
           that's right, mare. and you know i'll
           always be true to you.

                        dom
           aw shit, this isn't fair.

mary manages a smile.

                        ted
                 (to mary)
           i realized something tonight. i'm no better
           than any of these guys. none of them really
           love you...they just fixated on you because
           of how you made them feel. but that's not
           real love...thank you for letting me see
           that. now i can get on with the rest of my
           life.

tucker, healy, and dom scoff.

                        tucker
           oh please...

                        dom
           don't listen to him, mary. it's a ploy.

                        healy
           you are so full of shit, strohman. are you
           going to stand here and tell us that you
           aren't in love with this girl?

ted looks into mary's eyes. she looks vulnerable.

                        ted
           yeah...that's what i'm telling you.
                 (winks)
           see you, mare.

ted looks mary in the eye, then starts for the door.

                        ted (cont'd)
                 (as he passes warren)
           see you, warren.

                        warren
           huh...?

ted lifts the earphones off warren's ear.

                        ted
           see you, warren.

                        warren
           bye, ted.

ted then walks out of the room. they all stand there in silence
for a moment, then dom turns to brett favre.

                        dom
           hey, brett, any chance i can get you to
           autograph one of these pumps for me?

                                                       cut to:
