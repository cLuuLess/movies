int. psychiatrist's office - present day

ted, now in his 30's, lays on his therapist's couch.

                        ted
           ...anyway, school ended a few days later
           and that july her father got transferred to
           florida.

the camera pans up to reveal that the chair behind him is empty.
ted has been telling all this to no one.

                        ted (cont'd)
           it took me half the summer to pay off all
           those bets.
                 (sighs)
           i never did see mary again. that was about
           twelve years ago.

just then the door quietly opens and ted's psychiatrist tip-toes
back into the room and takes his seat. (he has a dab of mustard on
his chin and has forgotten about the cloth napkin tucked into his
collar.)

                        psychiatrist
           uh-huh. interesting.

the psychiatrist notices the napkin and quickly wipes his chin,
then tosses it aside.

                        ted
           anyway, it's not something you exactly
           forget about, but i guess i must've blocked
           it out of my head. then about a week ago
           i'm driving on the highway and i got to
           thinking about mary and suddenly i couldn't
           breathe...i couldn't keep up with the flow
           of traffic anymore i felt like i was
           going to die. i pulled into a rest area,
           parked the car, and just started shaking.

the psychiatrist scratches his chin.

                        psychiatrist
           you know...rest areas are homosexual
           hang-outs.

                        ted
           huh?

                        psychiatrist
           highway rest areas--they're the bathhouses
           of the nineties for some gay men.

ted thinks about this, then glances back at the shrink.

                        ted
           what are you saying?

                        psychiatrist
                 (checking wristwatch)
           oops, time's up. we'll have to delve into
           that next week.

off ted's look, we

                                                       cut to:
