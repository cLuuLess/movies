ext. miami - driving range - day

healy pays for a bucket of balls, then takes his clubs and strolls
jauntily to...

a golf tee next to mary's

healy places a ball on the tee and takes a swing. he tops the ball
and it dribbles about ten yards.

                        healy
           hit a house! bite bite!
                 (to mary)
           haven't swung the wrenches in a while.

mary nods. healy takes another swing and duck-hooks one about
fifty yards. mary addresses her ball, takes a smooth backswing,
and

                        healy (cont'd)
           hey, can you give me some tips here?

she cracks her shot long and straight.

                        mary
           yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.

                        healy
           thanks.

mary tees up another ball and healy puts down his club.

                        healy (cont'd) 
           i'm gonna get a soda, you want one?

                        mary
                 (annoyed)
           no thanks.

healy pulls out a huge wad of change from his pocket.

                        healy
           oh cripes. do you have change for a dollar?
           all i have is these stupid nepalese coins.

                        mary
                 (interested)
           nepal? have you been?

                        healy
           not in months. i don't even know why i
           bought the damn place.

                        mary
           you own a home there?

                        healy
           well...it's just a condo really. right
           outside katmandu.

                        mary
           wow. that's a place i've always wanted to
           go. is it true the mountains are so tall
           you can't see the tops?

                        healy
           not 'til you get about three hundred yards
           from the summit. that's been my experience
           anyway.

she looks impressed. healy looks at his watch. 

                        healy (cont'd)
           you know, i should just get going. i'll
           work on my game next week.

he flips her a coin.

                        healy (cont'd)
           here. spend it on your trip to katmandu.

                        mary
                 (smiles)
           thanks.

healy starts to walk off. mary doesn't know what to do. will she
ever see this guy again?

                        mary (cont'd)
                 (calls after him)
           it was nice meeting you!

healy doesn't answer or turn around. he just raises his hand and
gives her a little wave.

mary shrugs her shoulders. oh well...
