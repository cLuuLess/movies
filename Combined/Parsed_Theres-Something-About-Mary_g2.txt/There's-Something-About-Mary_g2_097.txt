int. mary's apartment - same

we hear the television and see magda dozing on the couch with a
watery cocktail in her hand and the dog puffy at her feet.

suddenly a doggie treat flies through the window, landing on the
rug. puffy snaps to attention and approaches the treat. he sniffs
it, then gobbles it up. another doggie treat lands beside him and
he eats that, too. then another.
