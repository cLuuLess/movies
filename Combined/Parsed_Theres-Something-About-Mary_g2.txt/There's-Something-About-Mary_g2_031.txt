ext. beach bar - day

neighborhood restaurant and bar. after-work crowd. mary and her
friends, brenda, lisa, and joanie are sitting at a table under an
umbrella. lisa reads from the personals column in south beach
magazine.

                        lisa
           listen to this one--'seeking sensitive wasp
           doctor to share candlelit dinners, long
           walks in coconut grove, marriage.'

                        brenda
           what does this girl want, a corpse? you
           gotta be more specific: 'seeking deaf mute
           with three pound cock and trust fund.'

                        joanie
           no, it should be 'a hockey player with
           great pecs.'

                        mary
           ugh, not pecs. sounds like one of those
           guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana
           hammock.

pan to the bar where we see healy eavesdropping on their
conversation.

                        brenda (o.s.)
                 (to mary)
           i suppose you wouldn't like someone with a
           washboard stomach like brad pitt?

back on mary and friends.

                        mary
           i'm just saying i don't mind a guy with a
           bit of a beer belly. it means he's a guy.
           you can have those pretty boys who hang out
           in a gym all day staring at their
           reflections.

on healy

                        healy
                 (quietly into mic)
           a girl after your own heart, ted.

back on mary and friends.

                        joanie
           i can live with those reflections.

                        mary 
           i'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies.
           give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer
           and playing thirty-six holes and still has
           enough energy to take me and warren out to
           a ballgame.

                        joanie
                 (sarcastic)
           jeez, i don't know where you're ever going
           to find a guy like that.

                        mary
           but here's the rub. the guy i'm talking
           about has got to be self-employed.

                        lisa
           you mean, like an architect or something?

                        mary
           architect, yeah.

brenda you mean creative, but not poor.

                        mary
           no, it's not the money. creative, yeah,
           that's good, but it's the freedom i'm
           talking about. see, this guy has to have a
           job he could do anywhere. that way we could
           just up and leave at the drop of a hat.

                        lisa
           and where would you and your beer-bellied
           architect be leaving to?

                        mary
           i don't know. the super bowl, new orleans
           jazz festival...maybe a couple months in
           nepal.

                        joanie
           yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy
           halfway to katmandu.

                        mary
           what's that supposed to mean?

                        joanie
           it means you're too hard on guys.

                        mary
           no i'm not.

                        joanie
           oh come off it, mare. what about
           what's-his-name...steverino? you could've
           at least passed the baton on that one.

the girls laugh.

                        mary
           yeah, steve. steve was all right for
           awhile.

                        joanie
           all right for awhile? the guy's
           good-looking, rich, witty. he was a god.

                        lisa
           at one point you were talking about
           marrying him. come on, why'd you dump him?

mary thinks about this.

                        mary
           i don't know, it was complicated. he's in
           san francisco, i'm in miami.
                 (dodging question)
           besides, magda's psychic dog hated him.

                        joanie
           is that old crab still with you? mary, you
           said you were putting her up for a
           month--it's been a year and a half.

                        mary
           ah, she's okay.

                        lisa
           mary, cut the crap, what really happened
           with steve?

                        mary
           nothing. i mean, you know my brother.
                 (sighs)
           warren.

                        joanie
           what? steve seemed to put up with warren.

                        mary
           i don't want someone who'll put up with
           him. i want someone who will enjoy him, the
           way i do. do you know what he told my
           friend tucker? he said he would've popped
           the question a lot earlier if warren wasn't
           in my life.
                 (beat)
           well he is in my life and i'm goddamn
           lucky to have him. the hell with steve.

everyone is touched by this. then:

                        brenda
           well, that's the last time i blow him
           behind your back.

as the girls laugh, we

                                                       cut to:
