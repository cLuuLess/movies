int. doctor's office - day

ted is splayed out on a table in obvious pain while dr. lalonde,
an old high school pal, palpates his spine.

                        dr. lalonde
                 (smirking)
           so...i see you made the news.

                        ted
                 (angry and embarrassed)
           it wasn't my truck--i was helping out a guy
           in a wheelchair.

                        dr. lalonde
                 (dubious)
           uh-huh. where was he?

                        ted
           out getting coffee.

                        dr. lalonde
           yeah, that's more or less what the others
           said, too. out getting coffee...supposed to
           meet him here...picking up my grandma...

ted turns and glares at him.

                        dr. lalonde (cont'd)
           i'm just saying...they sure made you look
           dumb.

ted sighs. a couple big cracks of the neck.

                        ted
           bob, do you remember mary?

                        dr. lalonde
           who?

                        ted
           mary.

                        dr. lalonde
           from high school mary? yeah, i saw her
           about six months ago at a convention in las
           vegas.

ted sits up.

                        ted
           a convention? how'd you see her at a
           convention?

                        dr. lalonde
           i'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an
           orthopedic surgeon.

the doc sighs, still able to recall the feeling.

                        dr. lalonde (cont'd)
           what a babe...

ted sits up on his elbows.

                        ted
           babe?

                                                       cut to:
