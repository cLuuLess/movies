           then why you going out with him if he's a
           schlep?

                        mary
           come on, magda
                 (sighs)
           it's like that movie harold and maude.

                        magda
           i don't watch the new ones.

                        mary
           this one's almost thirty years old. it's
           about a young kid and an old lady who fall
           in love.

                        magda
           that's exactly why i don't watch 'em
           anymore--it's bullshit! why the hell would
           an old lady go for a young kid?

mary smiles at this.

                        mary
           the point is, love isn't about money or
           social standing or age, it's about
           connecting with someone, having things in
           common kindred spirits.

                        magda
           fuck kindred spirits. my little puffy
           here's gonna tell you all you need to know
           about this guy in about two seconds flat.
           if he starts yapping, he's a loser; if
           puffy's relaxed...well, you got yourself a
           keeper.
