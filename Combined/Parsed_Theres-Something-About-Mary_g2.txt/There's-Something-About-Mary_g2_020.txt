int. providence union insurance company - hallway - morning

ted and dom are walking down a hallway.

                        ted
           i don't know about this, dom.

                        dom
           relax, this guy owes me a big one. a couple
           years ago he got in a jam up in the boston
           office; some bullshit about padding his
           resume--like we haven't all done that.
           anyway, they were going to let him go but
           his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that
           ended up on my desk.

                        ted
           his mother?

                        dom
           yeah, i guess he still lives with her.
           seemed like a sweet lady--got diabetes or
           something--so i went out on a limb and got
           him transferred down to providence.

                        ted
           and you think he could find out her number
           for me?

                        dom
           he'll do better than that. i'll send him
           down to miami on business, you throw him a
           couple bucks on the side, and he'll track
           her down.

ted thinks about this.

                        dom (cont'd)
           just let me warn you--this guy runs a
           little hot, but he gets the job done.

                                                       cut to:
