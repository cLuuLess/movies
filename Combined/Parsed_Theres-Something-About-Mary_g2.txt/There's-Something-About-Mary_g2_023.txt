the dog is catching wind in the backseat and sully hands healy a
packet.

                        sully
           here's the info you asked for.

           thanks.

                        sully
           you should thank me--that girl was not easy
           to find. what'd she scam you out of-some
           insurance dough?

                        healy
           nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track
           down his high school girlfriend.

                        sully
           stalker, huh?

                        healy
           big time.
