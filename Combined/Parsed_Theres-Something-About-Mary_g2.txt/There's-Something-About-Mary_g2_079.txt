int. healy's car - night

healy is parked out front, the phone in one hand, a script in the
other, as he listens to sully read the following words:

                        sully (v.o.)
           but jesus, pat, if she's as special as you
           say, she's going to want to hear about
           the things you did. 

                        healy
                 (dismissing this)
           ahh.
