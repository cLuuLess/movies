ext. rest area - night

the toyota tercel pulls in and parks. ted gets out and walks into
the bushes to whiz.

on ted - as he steps into the dark brush unzipping his fly he
trips over something and falls to the ground.

                        ted
           what the--?

suddenly whoosh, whoosh, whoosh--several huge spotlights
illuminate the area revealing

two dozen frightened men scurrying to pull their pants up all
around him.

                        police officer (o.s.)
           this is a raid!

angle on a startled ted on his knees directly in front of
another man, making it appear that he's been blowing the guy.

reverse angle reveals a dozen police officers holding the
spotlights and moving in for the arrests followed by a camera
crew.

                        ted
                 (deer caught in headlights)
           wait a second, it's not what you think.

a guy with his pants at his ankles jumps on the bandwagon.

                        pants at ankles guy
           that's right! i-i-i was just pissing!

ted glares at him.

                        ted
           no! i was pissing!

                        police officer
           yeah, i'll bet you all were. come on, in
           the truck.

as they grab ted and the others and hustle them away, we

pan to the hitchhiker sitting in the toyota watching the raid
unfold.

the hitchhiker is clearly panicky at the sight of all the cops.

quietly he opens the car door, ducks down, and then sprints away
into the woods unseen, leaving his big red bag behind.

close up of television screen as the bust continues. each of the
men cover their faces as they pass by the camera, except for ted
who is extremely visible. 

                        ted
                 (to cop)
           okay, take it easy, you don't have to push.

reverse angle reveals a shocked dom and his wife watching this
on their television.

                        dom
           oh my god. is that...?

                        dom's wife
                 (matter-of-fact)
           told you he was gay.

back on the television - the cops struggle to get the feisty ted
into a police van.

                        ted
           i was taking a leak!
