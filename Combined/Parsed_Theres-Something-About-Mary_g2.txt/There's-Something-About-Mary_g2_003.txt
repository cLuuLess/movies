ext. suburban street - morning

mary and a muddied ted are walking warren home. warren lags
behind, mumbling to himself. mary notices that ted is limping.

                        mary
           hey, you're limping. did you just hurt
           yourself?

                        ted
           no, it's an old football injury.

                        mary
           oh, are you on the team?

                        ted
           no, a couple of the players and me were
           joking around and, uh, i fell off the
           school.

warren approaches and motions for ted to hop on his back.

                        warren
           piggyback ride?

                        mary
           warren, come on, leave ted alone.

warren pats his back again.

                        warren
           piggyback ride.

                        ted
                 (to mary)
           i don't mind. if you think he can hold me.

                        mary
           oh he can hold you. he weighs
           two-hundred-and-thirty pounds.

                        ted
           a real clydesdale, huh warren?

ted hops onto warren's back.

                        ted (cont'd)
           giddy-up.

warren walks about five feet and stops.

                        warren
           my turn now.

off ted's reaction, we

                                                       cut to:

ext . mary's house - day

muddy sweat is running down ted's face as he struggles up a hill
with warren on his back.

                        ted
                 (straining)
           we're here, warren. you wanna get off?

                        warren
           giddy-up.

ted rolls his eyes and continues toward the front door. mary looks
on, amused.

                        mary
           so who you taking to the prom?

                        ted
           huh?

                        mary
           the prom--you going?

                        ted
           oh, i don't know. i think proms are pretty
           dumb.

                        mary
           'cause i thought maybe you and i could go
           if you weren't already taking someone.

                        ted
           i mean dumb in the sense that they only
           happen once a year.

she smiles at this.

                        man's voice (v.o.)
           from that moment on the guys at school
           looked at me in a whole new light.

                                                       cut to:

close on friend #1

                        friend #1
           you're a fucking liar!
