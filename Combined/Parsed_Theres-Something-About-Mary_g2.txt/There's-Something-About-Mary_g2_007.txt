int. mary's house - twilight
ted nervously enters and sees warren watching t.v. in the den.

                        ted
           hey, warren.

warren doesn't look his way.

just then mary comes down the stairs looking as if the directors
had really taken their time casting this role. ted can't believe
his eyes.

                        mary
           hi, ted.

                        ted
           hi, mary.

                        mary's mom
           poor teddy--he's been getting it both
           barrels from the wisenheimer here.

                        mary
           dad, have you been busting ted's chops?

mary's dad shrugs.

                        mary (cont'd)
           warren, did you say hi to ted?

                        warren
                 (not looking up)
           'bout ten times.

                        ted
           hey, warren, i think i know where your
           baseball is.

this finally gets warren's attention.

                        warren
           you seen my baseball?

we see ted discreetly pull a brand new baseball out of his pocket
and palm it in his hand.

                        ted
           well, if it's a big white one with red
           stitching, i think i saw it right behind
           your ear ..

ted is reaching behind warren's ear when suddenly warren takes a
swipe at him, knocking him to the ground.

                        mary
           warren!!!

ted hits his head on the coffee table.

on the baseball - as it rolls under the couch, stopping right
next to the other missing ball.

back to scene - in a split second, warren is up like a cat and
dives onto ted. as mary and her parents scream, ted manages to
free himself from the disabled man's clutches and gets warren in a
headlock.

                        mary's dad
                 (to ted)
           what the hell are you doing?!

                        mary's mom
           teddy, let him go!

                        ted
                 (out of breath)
           i'm trying...tell him to...calm down.

the family jumps on warren and finally break it up.

                        mary's dad (cont'd)
                 (to ted)
           jesus christ, guy, what the hell were you
           doing?!

                        ted
           i was playing a trick. i-i-i had a
           baseball.

                        mary's mom
           what baseball? where's a baseball?

ted looks around but there's no ball in sight.

                        ted
           there was a ball i had a honest.

as mary helps ted up, we see that his shirttail is out and his tie
is hanging off. mary's parents lead the frothing warren back to
the couch.

                        mary (to ted)
           i'm sorry. i should've told you, he's got a
           thing about his ears.

                        ted
           oh. okay. i gotcha.

                        mary
           are you all right?

                        ted
           oh yeah.

                        mary's mom
                 (to mary)
           honey, now you're all wrinkled.

mary looks down and frowns.

                        mary
           ted, will you just give me one more minute?
           i have to iron this thing.

ted starts to tuck his pants in as mary and her mother head back
up the stairs. mary's dad and ted are left alone. and warren.

ted rubs his head, sees a spot of blood.

                        ted
                 (to mary's dad)
           may i use your bathroom?
