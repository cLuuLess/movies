int. ted's hotel bathroom - same

ted has a newspaper splayed out on the counter (open to the bra
ads) as he furiously flogs the dolphin (chest-high side view.) we
see some balled-up tissue nearby. after several frantic strokes,
he takes a deep breath and slowly and loudly exhales, clearly
having completed his mission.

he draws a few more breaths, picks up a face cloth, and goes to
clean up.

but something's missing: the load. ted looks down, checks his
hands, pants, shoes, looks in the sink, finally glances at the
ceiling, with no luck.

the load is missing!!!!

that's when the doorbell rings. ted couldn't look more horrified.
as he buckles his pants, he makes a last, panicky reconnaissance
of the area. the doorbell rings again and ted reluctantly goes to
answer it.
