int. architecture exhibit

mary and healy walk through the exhibit area. mary scans the room
for her friend. healy's face is ashen.

                        mary
           i know he's around here someplace.

                        healy
                 (chipper)
           what say we get outta here and go crush a
           bucket?

                        mary
           we just got here thirty seconds ago. isn't
           this stuff great?

mary points to an architectural model.

                        mary (cont'd)
           is this one art deco or art nouveau?

                        healy
           deco.

                        mary
           would you call that a portico or a
           vestibule?

                        healy
           that...? vestibule.

                        mary
           how about--?

                        healy
           when you look at architecture, try not to
           concern yourself with the pieces--look at
           the building in its totalitarianism.

mary gives him a look. suddenly, healy draws a couple of invisible
sixshooters at her.

                        healy (cont'd)
           stone crab time! come on, let's get outta
           here, goofy.

he turns to go but mary notices something o.s.

                        mary
           tucker!

mary leads healy over to her friend tucker, a
distinguished-looking man in his fifties. healy looks like a dog
that's being dragged to the vet. mary and tucker embrace.

                        tucker
                 (still hugging)
           come on, like you mean it.

mary laughs and hugs tucker tighter. then:

                        mary
           tucker, this is my friend pat healy.
           healy and tucker shake hands.

                        tucker
           pleasure to meet you, patrick.

                        healy
           same here.

                        mary
           pat's an architect, too.

                        tucker
           hey, no kidding? where are your offices?

                        healy
                 (keeping cool)
           mainly i work out of boston. 

                        tucker
           boston, huh? did you get your degree up
           there?

                        healy
           yes yes, i did get my degree up there.

                        tucker
           harvard?

                        healy
           you bet.

                        tucker
                 (pleased)
           did you study under kim greene?

                        healy 
           among others.

                        tucker
           kim and i are close friends!

                        healy
           well, i'll tell her i ran into you.

                        tucker
           you mean him.

beat.

                        healy
           well...that's debatable.

healy makes a hand-gesture to imply that kim's sexuality is in
doubt.

                        tucker
           really? but he's been married for twenty
           years--they've got six kids.

                        healy
           nice smokescreen, isn't it?

tucker can hardly believe his ears.

                        mary
           pat does projects all over the world.

                        tucker
                 (impressed)
           where would i have seen your work?

                        healy
           have you been to
                 (thinking hard)
           let's see--santiago, chile?

                        tucker
           absolutely! i was there twice last year.
           which building is yours?

                        healy
           do you know the...soccer stadium?

                        tucker
           did you build the estadio olympico?

                        healy
           no...just down the street, the amigo tower.

                        tucker
           i'm sorry, i'm not familiar with it. what
           style?

                        healy
           uh, sort of nouveau deco...with a big
           vestibule. check it out next time you're up
           there.

tucker starts to look a little suspicious.

                        tucker
           you know, i really should take your card.

                        healy
                 (noticing something)
           oh look, it's doob! will you excuse me a
           minute, tucker?

healy drags mary across the room toward a man who's looking at an
exhibit.

                        healy
                 (to man)
           dooby, you old sheep-fucker! how the hell
           are ya?

                        man
           my name's mel.

                        healy
           oh, sorry. anyone ever tell you you look
           just like jim dubois?

                        man
           the sheepfucker?

healy shrugs and the man walks away angrily.

                                                       cut to:
