ext. driving range - day

ted and his friend dom are blasting a couple buckets.

                        dom
           gay? he said you were gay?

                        ted
           he implied it.

                        dom
           well you're a writer, and a lot of
           writers are gay. look at truman capote.

                        ted
           yeah, but he was successful.

                        dom
           let me ask you this: when you smoke a
           cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?

ted appears to think about this.

                        ted
           come on, that wouldn't make me gay.

                        dom
           i'm going to fix you up with my new
           assistant.

                        ted
           what's he like?

dom laughs, then watches as ted hits a ball.

                        dom
           you're leaving it out. finish your swing.
                 (beat)
           you're going to like this one--she's half
           asian, half american.

                        ted
           good-looking?

                        dom
           i just told you, she's half asian. half
           american. they're all good looking. you
           could mate don rickles and yoko ono and
           they're going to have a gorgeous kid. it's
           a foolproof combo.

ted thinks about it.

                        ted
           what's the point? let's face it, dom, i'm
           in a slump.
                 (sighs)
           lately i've been feeling like...well...like
           a loser.

                        dom
           loser? you?

ted shrugs.

                        dom (cont'd)
           give me a break. remember five years ago,
           when your kidneys failed? if you were a
           loser would they have been able to find a
           donor with an exact tissue match? what are
           the odds of that, one in a million?

                        ted
           oh, so i'm lucky because my brother got
           killed in an explosion?

                        dom
           i never said that. i'm saying your lucky
           those kids found his kidneys.
                 (beat)
           besides, your brother jimmy never gave a
           shit about you.

ted gives him a look.

                        dom (cont'd)
           you know, you're a real glass-is-half-empty
           guy. you got a fucking guardian angel, man.

ted manages a small smile. just then, ted's cell phone rings.

                        ted
           i gotta take this, it might be my boss.
                 (flips phone open)
           ted here.

                        garbled voice
                 (on phone)
           you're a cocksucking motherfucking piece of
           puke!

whoever it is hangs up. without reacting, ted closes the phone and
puts it back in his pocket.

                        ted
           yep.
