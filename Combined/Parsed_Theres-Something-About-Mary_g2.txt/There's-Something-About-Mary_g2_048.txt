a buckled-over ted limps into dom's office with a crazed look on
his face.

                        ted
           mary's a babe!

                        dom
           what?

                        ted
           my mary--she's not in japan, she's single,
           and she's got no rugrats. she does have a
           little gambling problem, she plays the
           football cards a bit too much, but she's a
           babe, a surgeon babe!

                        dom
           huh? but why did healy?

                        ted
           well think about it.

ted folds his arms.

                        dom
           no you mean...?

                        ted
           uh-huh.

                        dom
           the lazy fuck just didn't bother to look
           her up.

                        ted
                 (nodding)
           that sneaky prick was probably practicing
           his jai alai.

dom shakes his head. then:

                        dom
           well then you've got to call her, man.

                        ted
           fuck calling her. i'm going down there.
