ext. collins avenue - day

healy waits alone on a corner carrying one bag and a rack of
beers. suddenly a '89 chrysler lebaron convertible with a great
dane in the back screeches to a halt in front of him. the driver,
sully, is a muscular, well-groomed man in his thirties.

                        sully
           healy you dog!

                        healy
                 (checking out car)
           fucking sully! look at you!

                        sully
                 (boston accent)
