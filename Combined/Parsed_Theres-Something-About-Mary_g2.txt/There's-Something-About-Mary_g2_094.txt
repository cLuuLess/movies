ext. driving range - night

ted and mary are eating corndogs at the snack bar.

                        mary
           you hit the ball pretty good for a
           fourteen.

                        ted
                 (shrugging)
           no short game.

she smiles.

                        mary
           we should play some time...i mean, if you
           can afford to lose some money.

                        ted
                 (smiling)
           what are you?

                        mary
           twenty-two.

                        ted
           bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a
           one-iron--don't sandbag me, lady.

mary smiles coyly.

                        mary
           okay, sometimes i'm a nineteen.

                        ted
           that's more like it.
                 (to counter-man)
           two more nitrate-sicles please.

                        counter-man
           you got it.

mary is amused by this.

                        mary
           nitrate-sicles--i like that.

                        ted
           i say they should put more meats on a
           stick, you know? they got a lot of sweets
           on sticks--popsicles, fudgesicles,
           lollipops--but hardly any meat.

                        mary
           i agree there should be more.

the counter-man hands each of them another corndog.

                        ted
           you know what i'd like to see? meat in a
           cone. you could put corned beef hash in a
           cone, or chopped liver.

                        mary
           i like it. and think of the
           toppings--cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly

                        ted
           not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.

they smile at one another.

                        mary
           it's too bad you don't live down here, ted.

                        ted
                 (pleased)
           yeah?

                        mary
           we've got a lot in common.

ted takes a chance.

                        ted
           well...why don't you move back?

                        mary
           ah, my roots here are too deep. i love my
           practice, the people i work with, warren's
           got a nice thing going
                 (joking)
           why don't you just move down here and marry
           me?

mary smiles and ted laughs...perhaps a little too hard.
