ext. parking lot - day

they walk across the lot toward healy's car.

                        ted
           all the same, i still want to call her. i
           know it sounds crazy--mary sure has a lot
           of troubles in her life--but, i don't know,
           maybe i can help her out.
                 (sighs)
           the poor thing's had it tough--she's in a
           wheelchair for godsakes.

                        healy
           it's a goddamn bunion. it'll heal.

                        ted
           oh. i thought
                 (beat)
           that's not it anyway. i know this doesn't
           make any sense to you, but i just can't
           turn it off that fast. i still feel
           something for her.

healy comes to his car and puts his stuff in the trunk.

                        healy
           okay, tell you what: i'll get her number
           for you just as soon as she gets back from
           japan.

                        ted
           japan? what's she doing in japan?

                        healy
           you've heard of mail-order brides? well
           they go that way, too.

ted is devastated. 

                        ted
           mary's a mail-order bride?

                        healy
           fetched a pretty penny, too. don't forget,
           it's the sumo culture, they pay by the
           pound there. sort of like tuna.

off ted's look, we

                                                       cut to:
