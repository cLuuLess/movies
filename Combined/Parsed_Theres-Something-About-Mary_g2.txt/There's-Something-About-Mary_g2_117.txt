                        mary
           woogie? what are what are you doing here?

reverse angle reveals dom sitting on her bed.

                        dom
           did you get my letter, mare? the one about 
           ted?

                        mary
           you sent that?

                        dom
           uh-huh. i was worried about you.

                        mary
           well...thank you. but...you know you're not
           supposed to be within four hundred yards of
           me.

                        dom
                 (excited)
           that's what i want to tell ya. i've been
           through two years of extensive
           psychotherapy and you know what? you were
           right--i needed help.

                        mary
                 (cautious)
           that's great, woogie, i'm happy you're
           better--you seem...good--but...you put me
           through quite an ordeal, you know.

dom nods aggressively.

                        mary (cont'd)
           i had to move, go to court, change my last
           name--you stole all my shoes!

dom stands up.

                        dom
           look at me.

mary turns her head.

                        dom (cont'd)
           look at me, mary. on my mother's soul, on
           god above, on everything that is holy to
           me, i did not steal your shoes.

                        mary
           woogie, i caught you red-handed.

                        dom
           all right, i did, but i was in a weird
           place then.

he approaches her.

                        dom (cont'd)
           give me a break, mare, i was nuts!

mary backs into the living room.
