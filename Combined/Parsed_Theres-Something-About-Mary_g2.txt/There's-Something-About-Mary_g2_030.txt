ext. special ed. center - morning

mary's brother warren is wearing a walkman as he plays catch out
front with a special ed teacher while several other
mentally-disabled patients entertain themselves.

mary pulls up, gets out, and starts handing out egg mcmuffins.

                        mary
           get in line. one at a time.

a fat patient, gary, approaches.

                        gary
           can i have two, mary?

                        mary
           yeah, you can have two halves, just like
           everyone else.

                        gary
           thanks.

gary takes his and walks off. a couple more patients and then
bucktoothed freddie steps up to her.

                        freddie
           will you marry me, mary?

                        mary
           oh yeah, pretty boy? and what about
           dolores?

mary points to another patient staring bashfully at freddie.

                        freddie
           would you marry us both, mary?

                        mary
           yeah, that'd be a good deal for you,
           wouldn't it?

freddie moves off and fat gary is back, trying to be
inconspicuous.

                        mary (cont'd)
           wow, this is weird. there was somebody who
           looked just like you here a minute ago.

mary smiles and hands gary another mcmuffin.

close on healy.

                        healy
                 (into mic)
