montage of ted and mary falling in love

--ted and warren are at the top of a giant water slide
warren motions that he has decided this is not for him.
ted shoots him a look that makes warren feel like a
sissy. convinced it's not too dangerous, warren
decides to go for it and ted follows.

--at the bottom of the slide ted splashes into the huge
pool of water, laughing, having a blast. then he looks

around...no sign of warren. concerned, ted dives
underwater and a moment later resurfaces clutching a
gasping warren.
