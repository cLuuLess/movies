ext. the hot club - day

ted and dom are having a beer and a dog.

                        ted
           that's it, i'm making an oath. i'll never
           procrastinate about anything again. life is
           too fucking short. 

                        dom
           hey, look on the bright side--

                        ted
                 (interrupting)
           what's that, dom? what's the bright side?

                        dom
           well...at least now you know.

                        ted
           i think it was better when i didn't. it was
           kind of inspiring to know there was someone
           so pure in the world.

as ted dwells on this, dom bursts out laughing.

                        ted
           what's so funny?

                        dom
           i'm sorry, it's just that you're taking
           this all wrong, pal. don't you see? you're
           liberated. i feel liberated. i mean here
           you've been in therapy thinking you blew it
           with the greatest girl ever, and it turns
           out that getting your dick stuck in your
           zipper was the best thing that ever
           happened to you! 

ted flinches at this.

                        ted
           wait a second, i never told you that.

                        dom
           christ, ted, i was only four towns away. 

ted thinks it over.

                        ted
           maybe you're right. i should look on the
           bright side. i mean, i've still got my
           health...
                 (checks watch)
           i'm out of here. i've got to get up at six
           a.m. to move my boss's brother into his
           apartment.

                        dom
           what? on your day off? do you even know
           the guy?

                        ted
           never met him.

                        dom
           jesus, ted, you've got to finish that damn
           novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.

                        ted
           amen to that.
