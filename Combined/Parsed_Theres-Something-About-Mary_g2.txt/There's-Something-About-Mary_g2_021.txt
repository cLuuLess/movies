int. healy's cubicle - morning

ted is seated inside a small cubicle across the desk from patrick
healy, a shaggy-looking guy in a mis-matched three-piece suit.
healy looks more like a used-car salesman than an insurance
investigator.

                        healy
           so, dom tells me you're looking for some
           lady-friend you knew in high school.

                        ted
           uh-huh.

                        healy
           any idea where i might start looking?

                        ted
           she moved to miami beach twelve years ago.
           i checked directory assistance down there
           and she's not listed. she might've moved
           ten times since then.

                        healy
                 (skeptical)
           all you want is a phone number?

                        ted
           well, i know you're busy

                        healy
           don't play games with me, ted.

                        ted
           i don't know, maybe you could poke around
           for a half day and see if she has five kids
           and a labrador.

                        healy
           i don't buy it.

                        ted
           you don't buy what?

suddenly healy is in his face.

                        healy
           ted, i'm the kind of guy who shoots from
           the hip. now i want you to level with me:
           did you knock this skirt up?

                        ted
                 (indignant)
           no.

                        healy
           she's blackmailing you, right?

                        ted
                 (more indignant)
           no.

                        healy
           you want her dead, don't you?

                        ted
           you can't be serious.

                        healy
           do you really expect me to believe this is
           a straight stalker case?

                        ted
           i'm not a stalker ! she's a friend of mine.

                        healy
           sure she is. that's why she got an unlisted
           number and you haven't heard squat from her
           in a dozen years. oh you're good, ted.
           you're a real piece of work.

                        ted
                 (stands)
           look, let's forget it. let's forget the
           whole thing.

                        healy
           i get one hundred a day plus expenses.

                        ted
                 (laughs at healy's nerve)
           you get fifty a day, period. it's a
           business trip, they'll pay for your
           expenses.

healy thinks about it. 

                        healy
           okay, ted, i'll do it. but if this chick
           turns up with a toe tag, i'm rolling over
           on you.

                                                       cut to:
