int. mary's apartment - same

mary is skipping around the apartment while magda sits on the
couch.

                        magda
           don't bet on it. last time i had a pap
           smear the guy needed leather gloves and an
           oyster shucker.

                        mary
           so maybe i could find a nice gentleman to
           take you to the movies.

                        magda
           knock it off, pollyanna, just 'cause you're
           in love doesn't mean everyone else has to
           be.

                        mary
           love? come on, i wouldn't call it love.

                        magda
           oh no? i ain't seen you beaming like this
           since you broke ninety on the blue monster.

back on healy - he's reveling in it all.

                        mary (v.o. )
           well i am pretty psyched. i ran into a
           guy today i hadn't seen since high school.

healy loses the smile and sits up.

                        magda (v.o.)
           an old flame?

                        mary (v.o.)
           kind of. ted peloquin--one of the sweetest
           guys in the world.

healy turns up the volume.

on mary

                        mary (cont'd)
           he was so shy and clumsy...i had a major
           crush on him.

back on healy as he nearly puts his head through the roof. he
grabs hold of the steering wheel and pounds his head on it.

                        healy
           no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                        mary (v.o.) (cont'd)
           we're gonna go out tonight. oh, that
           reminds me, i've got to call
           what's-his-face and cancel.

on mary

                        magda
           do i sense a chill in the air?

mary sits down.

                        mary
           oh, magda, i let my head get in the way of
           my love life. i always pick guys on what i
           feel in here.
                 (pats heart)
           but with this pat guy my head kept saying
           &quot;grow up, mary. you have a lot in common
           with this one, you'll grow to feel
           something for him.&quot; but it never happened.

on healy - he couldn't look more crushed. suddenly his cellular
phone rings. he stares at it for two, three, four rings.
panic-stricken. then he answers it.

                        healy
                 (jovial voice)
           hey, patty-boy here. sorry i missed ya, but
           i'm out rustling up some champagne and
           roses in preparation for the greatest
           birthday of my life. hope you and yours are
           having a good day, too.

healy makes a beep sound and then holds his breath.

on mary - she stares at the phone, feeling cornered.

                        mary
           uh, hi pat, it's me, mary. just wanted to
           say i'm...looking forward to tonight.

she hangs up.

                        magda
           you vicious bitch, how do you sleep at
           night?

                        mary
           i can't do it--i just found out it's his
           birthday.
                 (sighs)
           i guess i've gotta cancel on ted.

on healy - he blows imaginary smoke off an imaginary gun. then
he sits back and smugly listens to her dial the phone. but then he
hears something that concerns him--a knock on the door and the dog
yapping.

on mary - she puts down the phone and answers the door. it's
tucker, the architect.

                        mary
                 (surprised)
           tucker...come on in.

back on healy pulling his hair out. he's on an emotional roller
coaster heading downhill.

                        magda (v.o.)
           well look who's here.

back to mary's apartment - tucker is carrying an unopened bottle
of scotch and absently flicking the yapping pooch off his ankles.

                        tucker
           there she is--i brought you a little
           thirst-quencher, mag.

                        magda
           oh, you are sweet.

                        tucker
           no, i'm not. i just want to get you-drunk
           so you'll pass out and i can have my way
           with mary.

everyone laughs.

                        mary
           can i pour you one?

                        tucker
           thanks, but i've got to be going.
           unfortunately, doc, this isn't a social
           visit.

tucker's tone shifts and mary grows concerned.

                        mary
           what's up?

                        tucker
           well...i've got a little more news about
           your friend healy.

mary seems relieved.

                        mary
           i know what you're going to say, but he
           already told me everything. i know he's not
           an architect.

tucker pulls out a piece of paper.

                        tucker (cont'd)
           i think you'd better sit down.

                        mary
           tucker, i appreciate you doing all this,
           but i'm really strapped for time here and--

                        tucker
           mary, the man's a killer.

on healy - he can't believe his ears.

back on mary - as she lowers herself onto the couch.

                        mary
                 (stunned)
           what...?

                        tucker
           i've got a friend in the boston police
           department. he faxed me this this morning.
           i'll just give you the highlights.
                 (reading from rap sheet)
           after a short stint as a petty thief,
           patrick r. healy graduated to armed robbery
           by the age of fourteen. at sixteen he
           committed his first murder--a pretty
           teacher's aid named molly pettygrove. he
           was incarcerated until age twenty-two when,
           despite a grim psychological profile, the
           state was forced to release him. in his
           mid-twenties and again in his early
           thirties he was suspected of homicides in
           the states of utah and washington.
           unfortunately, the bodies were so badly
           decomposed that there wasn't enough
           evidence to hold him, and on and on and so
           forth and so on.

mary looks like she's going to throw up.

on healy - he listens intently, his face ashen.

                        mary (v.o.)
           holy shit...

                        magda (v.o.)
           puffy, get over here.

we hear the pitter-patter of the dog's nails on the floor, then a
loud thump followed by a yelp.

on mary

                        mary
           magda!

                        magda
           the little shit lied to me about that guy!

mary picks up the startled dog and pets him.

                        mary
                 (growing emotional)
           i can't believe this is happening. i'm
           supposed to be meeting him in an hour.

                        tucker
           okay, just calm down. it's going to be
           okay.

tucker puts his arms around her.

                        magda
           why you two never hooked up is beyond me.

mary looks fondly at tucker.

                        mary
           magda's right, i'm so lucky to have you in
           my life.

                        tucker
           don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give
           me a big head.
                 (smiles)
           the important thing, doctor, is you've got
           to distance yourself as much as possible
           without pissing this psycho off.

                        mary
           yeah, yeah. okay, i think i know what to
           do. i'll call him right now.

back on healy - he looks stunned. his cellular phone rings. he
stares at it, then picks it up.

                        healy
           hi, i'm out drinking champagne and
           roses...and i'm really happy. leave a
           message. beep.

                        mary (v.o.)
                 (nervous)
           uh, hey buddy. oh boy, am i pissed. you're
           not going to believe this--well, you'll
           believe it, there's no reason not to--but i
           just got beeped for emergency surgery.
           well, um, sorry, but i'm going to have to
           bail on you.

as we hear a click, healy stares at the cell phone, seething.

                                                    dissolve to:
