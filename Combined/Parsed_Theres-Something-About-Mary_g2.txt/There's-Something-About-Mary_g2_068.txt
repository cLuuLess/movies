int. mary's office - same

mary walks into her office and sees tucker seated at her desk.
(shot from behind tucker so we only see the back of his head.)

                        tucker
           what's up, doc?

                        mary
           tucker, you look different some how. did
           you do something with your hair?

mary's pov - tucker's got two tongue depressors under his upper
lip making him look like a walrus.

                        tucker
           the teeth, the teeth. i got 'em capped.

on mary - smiles.

                        mary
