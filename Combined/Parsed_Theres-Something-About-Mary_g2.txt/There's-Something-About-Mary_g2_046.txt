ext. providence apartment - 7:45 a.m.

a profusely sweating ted has a dresser on his back and eeks his
way toward the front door as his boss's disabled brother catches
up to him in a wheelchair. (the man is a quadriplegic who needs to
use a mouthpiece to operate his chair.)

                        boss's disabled brother
           hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to
           scratch that thing, huh?

                        ted
                 (straining)
           what?

                        boss's disabled brother
           you heard me. you already put a fucking
           nick in my piano.

                        ted
                 (biting tongue)
           i'll try to be more careful.

                        boss's disabled brother
           s'matter with you? you look like you're
           fading.

                        ted
           the thing's kind of heavy.

                        boss's disabled brother
           heavy? heavy?! what i wouldn't give to know
           what heavy feels like, you insensitive
           prick.

                        ted
           no, i just meant...

                        boss's disabled brother
           yeah yeah. i'm going to the corner to get a
           cup of coffee.

the boss's disabled brother bites into the mouthpiece and zips
away up the sidewalk. ted takes a step. rests. a step. rests.

                        assertive woman's voice
           hey you!

ted glances back toward the street to see a t.v. news reporter
from the channel 7 i-team rushing toward him with a news crew on
her heels.

                        t.v. news reporter (cont'd)
           do you know that you're parked in a
           handicapped spot?
