ext. mary's apartment building - same

mary and ted, still sitting on the stoop. mary seems a little
reflective.

                        mary
           ... and then it was all over.
                 (sighs)
           we haven't spoken since.

                        ted
                 (sincere)
           wow. that's too bad. he sounds almost
           perfect.

                        mary
           yeah...almost.
                 (beat)
           you want to come up and watch sportscenter?

                        ted
           uh no. i think i'm gonna get out while
           i'm ahead.

mary looks a little disappointed.

                        mary
           ted...you're not that far ahead.

                        ted
           look, mary, the truth is...i'll be in town
           for a while now but i don't think we should
           see each other for a few weeks.

                        mary
                 (alarmed)
           why not?

                        ted
           well...to be honest....i'm really crazy
           about you and it's making me nervous and
           when i get nervous i'm not myself and i'm
           afraid i'm going to doing something really
           dumb before we get started so i think i
           should just lay back until i regain my
           composure.

mary sort of smiles.

                        mary
           that's really sweet, ted, but you should
           save it for one of your books.

                        ted
           all right, let's go.

ted jumps up and starts up the stairs two at a time.
