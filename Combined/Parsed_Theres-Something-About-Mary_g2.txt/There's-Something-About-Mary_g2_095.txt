ext. mary's apartment - night

ted and mary are sitting on her front stoop smoking a bone.

                        mary
           so you're a writer?

                        ted
           trying to be.

                        mary
           well good for you. i bet it works out for
           you.

                        ted
           we'll see. if it doesn't, what the hell, at
           least i gave it a shot.

                        mary
           that's right. and the good thing is you can
           do it anywhere.

                        ted
           what about you, mare? how the hell'd you
           manage to stay single?

                        mary
           i don't know...my friends think i'm too
           picky. i think i'm just a weirdo magnet. i
           did come close once--just last year, in
           fact. there was this guy he lived in san
           francisco.

angle on the corner of building. we see healy and tucker spying
on them from the shadows.

                        tucker
                 (whispering)
           that stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!

                        healy
           fucking sickening.

healy and tucker duck back into the alley.
