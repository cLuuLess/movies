tucker pulls the tongue depressors out of his teeth and laughs. he
stands up, and when mary tries to squeeze past him he gives her a
kiss on the cheek.

                        tucker
           you ever been laid in this office?

mary pushes past him.

                        mary
           behave yourself, tucker.
                 (smiles)
           come on, what are you doing here?

she sits in her chair and leans against her desk.

                        tucker
