a concerned mary, her mom, dad, and warren are huddled outside the
bathroom.

                        mary
                 (knocking gently)
           ted, are you okay?

                        ted (o.s.)
                 (pained)
           just a minute.

                        mary's mom
           he's been in there over half an hour.
                 (whispering)
           charlie, i think he's masturbating.

                        mary
           mom!

                        mary's mom
           well he was watching you undress with a
           silly grin on his face.

                        ted (o.s.)
                 (pained)
           i was watching the birds!

they all look at one another.

                        mary's mom
           charlie, do something.

                        mary's dad
