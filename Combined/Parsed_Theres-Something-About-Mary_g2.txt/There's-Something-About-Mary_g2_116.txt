int. sully's apartment - continuous 

ted enters and immediately reacts to the stench.

reverse angle reveals that the place is a fucking pig-sty. dog
shit is everywhere, flies fill the room, a mouse scampers across
the carpet.

                        ted
           hello...?

no answer. suddenly he hears someone out in the hall, so he ducks
behind the door.

healy and tucker enter the apartment and stop in their tracks when
they see the mess.

                        healy
           ho-ly shit.

                        tucker
           hey, this is a pretty nice place.

                        healy
           sully...! what the fuck happened here?!

again, no answer. suddenly ted slams the door shut and grabs healy
by the collar.

                        healy (cont'd)
                 (alarmed)
           hey, hey, hey!

                        ted
           surprised?

                        tucker
           hey, buddy, don't do anything rash now.

                        ted
                 (to tucker)
           who the fuck are you?

                        healy
           he's in love with mary, too.

ted releases healy and glares at him.

                        ted
           you fucked me, man? why would you do that?

                        healy
                 (righteous)
           what do you mean 'why'?

                        ted
           answer the question, shitball.

                        tucker
           i think everybody could use a drink.

tucker goes into the kitchen.

                        healy
           look, you asked me to follow your girl
           around, and i did and i started to like
           her, and then i realized i just couldn't in
           good conscience do it.

                        ted
                 (amazed)
           do what?

                        healy
           turn her over to a stalker.

                        ted
           what?! you're calling me a stalker?

                        healy
           that's right--if you weren't you would've
           looked for her yourself!

suddenly they hear a sound and turn to see bill the boa slithering
into the room with a huge, great-dane-size lump in his midsection.

                        healy (cont'd)
                 (sickened)
           oh christ...poor dog.

                        ted
           you're a sick man, you know that?

                        healy
           yeah well fuck you! you just can't stand
           the fact that it was my turn.

                        ted
           your turn?

                        healy
                 (getting emotional)
           that's right, hot shot! my turn. what's
           the matter with me, huh? why can't i ever
           get the great girl? give the big pig with
           the b.o. to healy, right? well i was sick
           of it, man! no more--it was my turn. it was
           time for me...time for me...to be happy.

this is so pathetic that it actually gets to ted. he sits down,
runs his fingers through his hair.

                        ted
           well you didn't have to blow us both out of
           the water. jesus christ, just because she
           found out about you, why'd you have to take
           me down with you?

                        healy
           i don't know what you're talking about.

                        ted
           i'm talking about the letter, asshole.

                        healy
           what? 

ted stares at him.

                        ted
           are you telling me you didn't send mary a
           letter outlining our deal?

                        healy
           why the fuck would i do that? i'd be
           screwing myself.

the guys stare at one another, then tucker comes out the kitchen
with a drink. they turn their attention to him.

                        healy (cont'd)
           you little fuck.

                        tucker
           what?

                        healy
           you fucking prick, we had a deal--you said
           you wouldn't fuck me and i wouldn't fuck
           you until we had this fuck out of the
           fucking picture.
                 (moves in on tucker)
           you crossed the line, man.

tucker backs away nervously. 

                        tucker
           whoa, whoa, you're getting crazy now. why
           would i cross the line--what do you think i
           got no pride?

healy grabs tucker by the neck.

                        tucker (cont'd)
           i swear! i didn't tell her nothing! you
           probably did it yourself, you piece of
           shit.

                        healy
           oh that makes a lot of sense. why would i
           rat myself out?

                        tucker
           like i'm going to try to figure out a guy
           who's idea of courting is blowing farts in
           the chick's face

                        healy
           you were following us?

                        tucker
           don't flatter yourself--i was following
           her, i always do. how the hell you think
           i got rid of mary's boyfriend steve?

this gets ted's attention.

                        ted
           you mean...steve didn't say all that stuff
           about warren?

                        tucker
           are you shitting me--mr. goody-two-shoes?
           he was like a fucking eagle scout. you two
           should be kissing my balls--if it wasn't
           for me, she might've married that schmuck!

ted thinks about this.

                        ted
           the hell with you both--i'm out of here.

ted walks out the door leaving healy and tucker to stare each
other down. just then hal the great dane walks out of the bedroom
with a cereal box stuck on his head. healy does a double-take,
then looks back at the snake.

                        healy
                 (sadly)
           oh...sully.

                        tucker
           look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter,
           and it wasn't me who sent it?

                                                       cut to:
