ext. providence - the hot club - day

ted is sitting alone having a beer when a smiling healy
approaches.

                        healy
           i've got some very, very good news for you,
           my friend.

                        ted
           really?
                 (perking up)
           very, very?

healy sits down and motions for a beer.

                        healy
           i think your life's about to change.

                        ted
           so you found mary?

                        healy
           right there in liberty city. and you were
           right, she's really something.

                        ted
                 (smiles)
           so she hasn't changed?

                        healy
           that i couldn't. say. let me ask you
           something: was she a little big-boned
           in high school?

                        ted
           no, not at all.

                        healy
           well she must've packed on a few pounds
           over the years.

this doesn't dampen ted's enthusiasm.

                        ted
           mary's a little chubby, huh?

                        healy
           i'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half.
           not bad.

ted's smile starts to fade.

                        healy (cont'd)
           but you know, you shit out a bunch of kids,
           you're going to put on a few pounds.

                        ted
           so she's married?

                        healy
           nope. never been.

                        ted
           huh?

                        healy
           four kids, three different guys.

                        ted
           three different guys?

                        healy
           well i'm guessing. there's a black kid, two
           whites, and a midget.

                        ted
           oh my.

                        healy
           hyperactive little fuckers, too. tough to
           keep up with in a wheelchair, i bet.

                        ted
           she's in a wheelchair?!

ted looks completely drained.

                        healy
           don't look so shocked, it's been a long
           time. i bet you've changed a lot over the
           last twelve years, haven't you?

                        ted
                 (shrugs)
           it's just that...mary. i wouldn't have
           thought...

                        healy
           anyway, the good news is i have all the
           information you need. got it from her
           bookie--nice guy. you should definitely
           call her, ted. i mean she's a real
           sparkplug, that one. she seems determined
           to get those rugrats off welfare and with
           your help i'll bet she does it.

ted stands and starts moping away.

                        ted
           thanks, healy. good work.

                        healy
           ted? don't you want the name of the
           housing project?

                        ted
           uh, that's okay.

                        healy
           you sure, big guy? i'll bet she'd love to
           hear from you before her mastectomy!

as ted leaves, healy puts his feet up on the table and sits back.
