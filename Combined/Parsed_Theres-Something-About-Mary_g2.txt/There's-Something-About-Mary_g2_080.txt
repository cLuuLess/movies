int. sully's apartment - same

a disheveled and wired-looking sully is sitting on the couch in
his underwear reading from the same script. there's coke on the
table, dog shit on the floor, and flies everywhere.

in the b.g. we see the great dane sniffing at his empty bowl and
the boa constrictor sprawled out on the floor, barely moving.

                        sully
                 (reading)
           come on, you could tell her about the
           irrigation ditches you dug in sudan, the
           orphan babies who cried in your arms in
           romania...
                 (does a line of blow)
           ...the hope you gave freddie the leper in
           calcutta...

suddenly the dog snatches the page out of his hand and starts to
eat it.

back on mary and friends.

                        joannie
                 (welling up)
           i love this man.

magda folds her arms and gloats.
