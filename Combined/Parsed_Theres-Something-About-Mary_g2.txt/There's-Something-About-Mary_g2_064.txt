int. south carolina prison - day

ted is sitting alone at a table in a small interrogation room.

pullback to reveal that he is being observed through a two-way
mirror by two detectives, franek and cavallo.

                        detective franek
           man, they never look like you'd expect.

                        detective cavallo
           that's probably how he got the victim to
           drop his guard. 

                        detective franek
           where'd they find the body?

                        detective cavallo
           in a big red bag on the front passenger
           seat. all hacked up--fucking gruesome--a
           real psycho, this one.

the detectives enter the room.
