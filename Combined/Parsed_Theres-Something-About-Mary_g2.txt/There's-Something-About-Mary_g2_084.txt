int. healy's car - twilight

a content healy is parked out front of mary's apartment, absently
listening to her spill her guts to magda while he reads the
newspaper.

                        magda (v.o.)
           i'm buying bananas tonight.

                        mary (v.o.)
           why?

                        magda (v.o.)
           back when i was your age i always used to
           make myself a big banana split after sex. i
           think you're gonna need one tonight.

                        mary (v.o.)
           don't get ahead of yourself. you'll
           probably need it before i will.
