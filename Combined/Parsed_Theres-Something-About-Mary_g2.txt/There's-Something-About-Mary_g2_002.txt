ext. another part of the school parking lot

angle on - a pretty girl, mary, climbing off a ten-speed in the
school parking lot. she's athletic and tanned and doesn't have a
bad bone in her body.

                        man's voice (v.o.)
           her name was mary. she'd moved to our
           little rhode island town from minnesota two
           years earlier.

she locks up the bike and starts walking toward the school.

                        man's voice (v.o.)
           mary was very smart, and very cool, and she
           had a faceful of eyes that promised you a
           better life if you could only know her.

as she approaches the camera, we pan to see ted watching her. he's
sitting on a picnic table with two friends.

                        friend #1
           hey, dirtbud, who you going to the prom
           with?

finally ted takes his eyes off mary.

                        ted
           ah, i don't know if i'm even gonna. you
           know, not my style.

                        friend #2
           you have a style?

                        friend #1
           why don't you be a gentleman and ask rosey?

                        ted
                 (perks up)
           who?

friend #1 makes a jerk-off motion.

                        friend #1
           rosey palm, your girlfriend. god knows you
           spend enough fucking time with her.

the guys laugh.

                        ted
                 (out of ammo but doesn't
                  know it)
           yeah, and who are you gonna take, your own
           palm?

his friends stare at him.

                        friend #1
           clever. i like the way you just spun that
           around on me.

friend #2 notices mary talking to her friends.

                        friend #2
           i wonder who she's going with.

                        friend #1
           some guy named woogie.

                        ted
           who?

                        friend #1
           big guy--goes to barrington high school.

this irks ted.

                        ted
           woogie from borrington high? sounds like
           a loser.

                        friend #1
           loser? woogie was all-state football and
           and basketball and valedictorian of his
           class.

                        friend #2
           i heard he got a scholarship to princeton
           but he's going to europe first to model.

this takes the wind out of ted's sails.

                        friend #3
           yeah and he's got a huge cock.

everyone looks at him.

                        friend #3 (cont'd)
           i heard.

suddenly friend #1 notices something.

                        friend #1
           hey, check it out.

their pov - a large, goofy young man with an unfashionable
crewcut comes walking up the street. he's in his early twenties
and though the weather is mild he's wearing earmuffs. he
approaches a group of kids sitting on a car hood.

                        ear-muff guy
           you seen my baseball?

                        car hood kid #2
           no.

the kids watch as the ear-muff guy approaches another group.

                        ear-muff guy
           you seen my baseball?

on car hood kids

                        car hood kid #1
                 (to his buddies)
           this guy must be in the 'tard squad.
                 (to ear-muff guy)
           hey, buddy, come here, i think i know where
           your ball is.

the ear-muff guy heads back to the car.

                        ear-muff guy
           you seen my baseball?

                        car hood kid #1
           yeah, i seen it. that girl over there, she
           has it.

car hood kid #1 points to a busty girl leaning against another car
talking to her large boyfriend.

                        car hood kid #2 (cont'd)
           'cept she doesn't call it a baseball. she
           has another name for it...

                                                       cut to:

on busty girl - the ear-muff guy marches up to her and her
boyfriend.

                        ear-muff guy
           you seen my pecker?

                        girl
           what?!

                        ear-muff guy
           you seen my pecker?

the boyfriend grabs him by the collar.

                        boyfriend
           you son-of-a-bitch, i'll kick your ass!

the boyfriend throws the ear-muff guy to the ground and is about
to pummel him when ted intervenes.

                        ted
           take it easy, smokey.

                        boyfriend/smokey
           this fucking pervert just came on to nance!

                        ted
           all right, just be cool.
                 (under breath)
           he looks like he's not all there, you know
           what i mean?

a crowd starts to gather which only incites smokey more.

                        boyfriend/smokey
           get the fuck out of my way, man!

smokey tosses ted out of the way and moves toward the ear-muff
guy. just then mary shows up and steps between them.

                        mary
           what's going on here?

she bends down and helps the ear-muff guy off the ground.

                        mary (cont'd)
           are you all right?

                        ear-muff guy
           mary, you seen my baseball?

                        mary
           no, i haven't seen your baseball. jeez,
           warren, you know you're not supposed to
           leave the yard by yourself.

                        boyfriend/smokey
                 (to mary)
           you know him?

                        mary
           he's my brother.

                        boyfriend/smokey
           oh.
                 (beat)
           i didn't realize he was...you know...

at this, smokey and his girlfriend reluctantly head toward the
school, along with most of the crowd.

mary turns her attention in the direction ted was thrown.

                        mary
           you okay?

her pov - ted is sitting in a mud puddle. he stands and brushes
himself off.

                        ted
           oh yeah. fine.

                        mary
           thanks a lot, ted.

close on - ted. he can't believe what he's just heard. as mary
helps him up, she turns her attention to warren.

                        man's voice (v.o.)
           that she knew my name blew my mind. some of
           my best friends didn't know my name.
