ext. upscale neighborhood - night

healy is still following tucker in his car. finally tucker stops
in front of a lavish victorian home and gets out carrying a pizza
and wearing a pizza delivery hat.

healy screeches to a sideways stop, jumps out and pounces on him.

                        healy (cont'd)
           you motherfucker, you're a dead man!

tucker drops the pizza as healy slams him into a tree.

                        tucker
                 (cowering)
           okay, pat, take it easy--don't do anything
           stupid.

                        healy
           who the fuck do you think you are making up
           that bullshit about me?!

healy slams him against the tree again.

                        tucker
           whoa, whoa--i don't know what you're talking
           about.

                        healy
           maybe this'll jog your memory.

healy slaps him across the face.

                        healy (cont'd)
           i'll give you a hint--it's got something to
           do with me being a murderer.

healy raises his arm again and tucker tries to shield himself.

                        tucker
           okay, okay, i might've gotten some bad
           information.

healy grabs him by the collar.

                        healy
           that stalker ted got to you, right? you're
           working for him, aren't you, you little
           shit?

                        tucker
           who?

healy throws tucker to the ground and takes off his sport coat.

                        healy
           this is your last chance, you fuck. now
           either you come clean or i'm going to kick
           your ass from here to tallahassee.

healy grabs tucker by the hair and cocks his arm.

                        tucker
           i love her, okay?!

tucker suddenly gets emotional. healy stops and looks at him.

                        healy
           you what?

                        tucker
           you heard me, goddamnit. i...i love her.

healy slowly lets go.

                        tucker (cont'd)
           i'm a phony--just like you, man.

                        healy
           what do you mean?

                        tucker
           i mean i'm a fucking fraud. i'm no
           architect. don't be a putz--who's been to
           santiago twice in a year?
                 (scoffing)
           estadio olimpico--please!

                        healy
           but...but you knew people at harvard.

                        tucker
           i knew shit. the only thing i knew was that
           you were a fake and i made up everything
           else.
                 (sighs)
           my real name's norm. i deliver pizzas.

                        healy
           bullshit!

tucker rolls his eyes and pulls out his pizza delivery badge, with
him pictured beside the name norman plante. as healy let's this
sink in, we

                                                       cut to:
