int. healy's car - night

                        healy
           look, i did all those things for myself.
           i'll be honest with you, i'm a selfish
           prick. i get a high from helping all of
           god's creatures. an honest to goodness
           high.

just then, healy sees a bug on the car window and instinctively
squashes it.

on sully - he has the phone wedged between his cheek and
shoulder as he struggles with the dog to get the script.

sully still can't retrieve the script, nor his next line.

                        sully
                 (winging it)
           that's bullshit, man you, uh, you were on
           the front line. remember the, uh,
           malaria the, uh, typhoon fever that
           vicious strain of genital herpes?

on mary and friends - they flinch at this.

on healy - he stares at the phone, horrified.

                        healy (v.o.)
           uh, sure. i cured a lot of nasty
           illnesses in third-world countries.

on mary and friends - as they let out a sigh.

                        healy (v.o.) (cont'd)
           the bottom line is, i'm not going to use my
           philanthropy as some form of
           currency...especially after what i did.
                 (sighs)
           i lied to this poor girl. lied. man. she
           deserved better.

                        sully (v.o.)
           hey, love will make you do fucked-up
           things.

                        healy (v.o.)
           you said it, mister.
                 (choking up)
           i gotta go.

on sully - as he hangs up the phone and does another line, we

pan to the great dane hal as he looks around for something,
anything to eat. he sniffs at a sock, then a beer bottle, before
finally setting his sights on the boa constrictor bill. bill
glances the dog's way nervously, senses trouble, and wiggles his
way into another room. as hal takes off after the snake, we

                                                       cut to:
