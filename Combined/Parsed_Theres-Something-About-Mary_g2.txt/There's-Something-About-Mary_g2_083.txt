ext. mary's apartment - day

a lovesick healy is mauling mary out on the sidewalk in front
while warren stands off to the side listening to a walkman.

reverse angle reveals a devastated ted and dom watching this
from ted's car.

                        ted
           fuck me.
                 (sighs)
           let's go home.

                        dom
           no! you've gone through way too much to
           back down now. get over there and do
           something--i can't stand watching this.

back on mary and healy as healy starts over-doing it and mary
has to break it off.

                        mary
           whoa, whoa, how's my stomach taste?

healy laughs.

                        healy
           how's my stomach taste, she says.
                 (shakes head)
           hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab,
           mare. sorry i forgot my wallet. i feel like
           a dog.

                        mary
           forget it. it was...fun.

on ted and dom

ted recognizes warren.

                        ted
           holy shit, there's warren.

back on mary. healy, and warren

suddenly we see warren perk up at something.

                        warren
           franks and beans!

on ted and dom

                        ted
           jesus, i think her brother spotted me.

they both duck down in their seats.

back on mary. healy. and warren

                        warren
           beans and franks.

                        mary
           give it a rest, war. you just ate.

                        healy
           aw, leave him alone, he's just got a big
           appetite.
                 (to warren)
           am i right?

healy winks at mary.

                        warren
           huh?

healy reaches over and lifts a headphone off warren's ear.

                        healy
           i said you've got a big app--

suddenly warren sucker-punches healy in the throat.

                        healy (cont'd)
           urrggghh...

                        mary
           warren!

on ted and dom - as they flinch.

                        dom
           attaboy!

back on mary et al - healy holds his throat, clearly in pain.

                        mary
           are you okay?

                        healy (cont'd)
                 (raspy, to mary)
           not to worry. so...see you tonight,
           right? right?

                        mary
                 (cornered)
           sure.

mary watches with a look of concern as healy gets in his car and
drives off.

on ted and dom

ted stares gazily.

                        dom
           well? what are you waiting for?

                        ted
           i don't know what to say.

                        dom
           tell her the truth about healy! blow the
           schmuck out of the water.

                        ted
           are you crazy? i've unleashed a psycho on
           her. she's gonna be fucking pissed.
                 (stares at mary)
           she's even more beautiful than i remember.

their pov - mary and warren start to go in the apartment.

                        dom
           get over there, you pussy! she's leaving!

suddenly dom honks the horn, then ducks down. mary turns around
and sees ted.

                        ted
           you asshole, what are you--
                 (calling out cheerily)
           mary! is that you?

                        mary
                 (squinting)
           who's that?

ted gets out of the car and hustles across the street toward mary.

                        ted
           it is you! it's me...ted. from rhode
           island ted.

finally she recognizes him.

                        mary
           oh my god...ted.
                 (big smile)
           what are you...? i can't believe this. i
           haven't seen you since-- 

                        ted
           yup, that's right. junior prom...kinda.

                        mary
           and did everything--?

                        ted
           oh yeah, healed right up. no visible scars.

mary laughs.

                        ted (cont'd)
           how are you doing, warren?

                        warren
           good, ted. piggy back ride?

                        ted
           i'm gonna take a rain check.

mary is stunned.

                        mary
           i can't believe he remembered you. he never
           remembers anybody.
                 (beat)
           you know i tried to call you for weeks
           after that.

                        ted
           really? i never got a message.

                        mary
           that's weird. i talked to your brother
           jimmy five or six times.

ted is devastated to hear this.

                        mary (cont'd)
           by the way, how's he doing?

                        ted
           he's dead.

                        mary
                 (taken aback)
           oh, ted i'm so sorry to hear that.

                        ted
                 (bitter)
           no, it was a good thing.
                 (off her look)
           i mean, good in that it was very quick.

ted pantomimes an explosion.

                        mary
           oh. so...what brings you down here?

                        ted
           funny story. you see, me and a buddy of
           mine decided to...ah...you know...just
           ...drive down.

she stares at him.

                        mary
           well you look great. are you married, do
           you have kids?

                        ted
           nope, nope--dodged a few bullets.
                 (smiles)
           god, i cannot believe i'm standing here
           with mary jenson.

                        mary
           actually, it's mary brooks now.

                        ted
                 (taken aback)
           oh...are you...?

                        mary
           nope, haven't walked the plank yet.
                 (off his look)
           there was this guy back in college who was
           bothering me...got kind of ugly--a
           restraining order, the whole bit. anyway,
           when i got out of princeton i changed my
           name as a precaution.

                        ted
           jeez...that sounds awful. hey, what do you
           say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up
           on old times?

beat.

                        mary
           didn't we just do that?

ted doesn't know how to respond to this and then she smiles.

                        mary (cont'd)
           i'm kidding. i'd really love to, ted, but
           the thing is i already have plans. how
           about tomorrow night?

                        ted
           mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve
           years.
                 (beat)
           don't make me wait another day.

mary seems touched by this.

                        mary
           tell me where you're staying. i'll pick you
           up at eight.

ted finally smiles and we

                                                       cut to:
