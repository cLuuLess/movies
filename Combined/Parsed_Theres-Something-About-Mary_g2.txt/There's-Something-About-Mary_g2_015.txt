ext. mary's house - night

two paramedics rush ted out the front door on a stretcher. mary
runs alongside him holding a towel on his crotch. while a third
paramedic dabs at his crotch with a towel. mary's mom and dad are
out front along with two firetrucks, four police cars, and a crowd
of about thirty neighbors.

                        paramedic
                 (to mary)
           keep pressure on it!

mary does as she's told.

                        mary
                 (running along)
           ted, i'm so sorry. are you going to be
           okay?

                        ted
                 (irrational cockiness)

he gives her two thumbs up as they slide him into the ambulance.
