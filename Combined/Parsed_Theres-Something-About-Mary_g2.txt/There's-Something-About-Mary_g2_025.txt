int. chrysler lebaron - dawn

healy is on a stakeout. he's dozing. he's been here for hours,
food wrappers litter sully's car. he's wearing walkman-type
headphones which are connected to a radio surveillance microphone
attached to a pair of binoculars.

suddenly music explodes through his headphones--healy's jolted
awake. who threw the grenade? recovering, healy aims the
binoculars toward...

healy's pov - mary's apartment across the street

healy has a clear, unobstructed view into mary's apartment. the
music is coming from mary's clock radio. mary sits up in bed and
shakes herself awake, like someone's just poured cold water over
her. she cranks the music even louder. mary hops out of bed,
wearing only her panties, and though she's a little older now, she
still looks well cast.

close up - on healy - he's become extremely interested in his
work. as much as healy's enjoying the show, he's got a job to
do--he speaks into a micro-cassette recorder:

                        healy
                 (into recorder)

           address, two-niner-eight euclid avenue,

           and labrador, negative. extremely nice ass,
           affirmative.
