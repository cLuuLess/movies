ext. miami street - night

healy and mary are walking home at the end of their date. healy is
eating a big, wild cone of cotton candy and drinking a beer.

                        healy
           that grandmother of yours--she's really
           something.

                        mary
           magda? she's not my grandmother--actually
           she rents the apartment right next to mine.
           her husband passed away a couple years ago
           so she doesn't like to be alone.

                        healy
           and it doesn't cramp your style?

                    mary
               sadly, no. well except for the lint.

                        healy
           lint?

                        mary
           yeah, i think it's that dog of hers running
           around on the rug all day--just makes for a
           lot of lint. look at this...

mary lifts her shirt, revealing a big clump of cotton candy
sticking out of her belly-button.

                        mary (cont'd)
           see? that's just one day.

healy cracks up and then gazes at her. what a babe.

                        healy
           you know, sometimes i wish i could be like
           magda and not go home. i'd like to just
           bounce around for awhile, do a little
           traveling...

                        mary
           why bounce when you have your own condo in
           nepal to go to?

it's clear healy forgot about that one.

                        healy
           ah, i'd sell that. start fresh in a new
           place, quit the architect game, slow things
           down, read more books, see more movies...

                        mary
           you're a movie buff?

                        healy
           try to be. it's tough going with the crap
           they make today. if dumb and dumber's the
           best they've got to offer i say thanks but
           no thanks.

                        mary
           have you seen it?

                        healy
           no. but the boston globe critic jay carr
           hated it.

                        mary
           a fucking moron.

                        healy
           huh. i guess i just wish they made them
           like they used to. you know, something like
           the heartbreak kid...or harold and
           maude.

mary can't believe her ears.

                        mary
           harold and maude is my all-time favorite
           movie.

                        healy
           ouch. come on, don't bust my chops. i know
           it's corny, but i do love it.

                        mary
           pat, i'm not kidding. i really think it's
           the greatest--

                        healy
           --love story of our time.

mary smiles. is this guy for real?

                        mary
           yeah.

                        healy
           wow. i thought i was the only one.

they come to her apartment building and stop. it gets a little
awkward.

                        mary
           so...

                        healy
           yeah...i guess this is it, huh?

                        mary
           i guess.

                        healy
           well, i'll see ya.

healy turns to go but stops.

                        healy (cont'd)
           mary ah, forget it.

                        mary
           what?

                        healy
           no, forget it, it was stupid.

                        mary
           come on, what were you going to say?

                        healy
           nah, really, it was moronic.

she grabs him by the shirt playfully.

                        mary
           just say it.

healy takes a deep breath.

                        healy
           could i feel your bosoms before i go?

mary just stares at him.

                        mary (beat)
           knock yourself out.

healy reaches out and cups her breasts. he doesn't kiss her, she
doesn't kiss him, he just fondles her breasts. then:

                        healy
           okey-dokey, so tomorrow night?

she smiles and as healy walks away we

                                                       cut to:
