     ext.  belltower field -- day

     ichabod and young masbath ride to the western woods, horses
     loaded for expedition.  at the belltower remnants, ichabod
     slows, looking to the wreckage.

     at forest's edge, young masbath waits.

     ichabod circles the tower.  with a sigh, he rides to join
     young masbath. they head into the woods.
