     int.  van tassel house, sitting room -- night

     katrina comes to the door.  ichabod is seated by the fire,
     eyes bleary, palms wrapped with bloodied cloth.

                             katrina 
               constable crane?

     katrina comes beside ichabod's chair.

                             ichabod
               allow me some time.  i have spent
               every hour in the company of others.
               i need to be alone.

                             katrina 
               what troubles you?

     she moves in front.  ichabod gets up and crosses to sit
     facing away.  katrina takes the chair he deserted.

                             katrina
               the things i said to you before...
               i was wrong to say them.

                             ichabod
               no, actually, you were not.  every
               word you spoke had truth in it.

                             katrina 
               what has happened?

     ichabod sits silent, puts his head back, eyes closed.

                             ichabod 
               lady van tassel... she is your
               stepmother, isn't she?  she bears so
               little resemblance.

                             katrina 
               what?

                             ichabod 
               she is not your birth mother, is she?

                             katrina 
               no, but... why do you ask that?

                             ichabod 
               what happened to your mother?  is she
               still alive?

                             katrina 
               she died.  her lungs were diseased...
               two years ago.  what is this about?

                             ichabod 
               memories have come back.  i had them
               forgotten, and wish i could forget
               them again... but they are here now. 
                     (pause) 
               lord, how i hate this place.

                             katrina 
               if you want me to go, i will.  do you
               want me to leave?

                             ichabod 
               i... i do not know.  i no longer know
               what i think or what i feel.

     katrina walks to him.  she touches his back.

                             katrina 
               why are you so afraid of that?  is
               there truly such harm in uncertainty?

     she kneels, smiles a little for him.  she reaches to touch
     his face, holds his head in her hands.  leans to kiss him.

     he rests his head against hers, weary, putting his arms
     around her.  they kiss passionately.
