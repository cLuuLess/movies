     int.  van tassel house, sitting room -- night

     pipe smoke wafts from philipse's mouth.

                             philipse
               cut off his head with his own sword.
               it's a legend told for twenty years.

                             baltus
               but, only recently has the headless
               hessian been seen prowling the
               hollow, in search of a head to suit
               his shoulders.

                             ichabod
               just a moment...
                     (sits back, incredulous)
               are you saying it is he?

                             hardenbrook
                     (aggravated, loud)
               when a goblin leaps from the nether
               world, others follow.  poltergeists
               of the air, water and earth follow
               and cheer his desecrations!

     hardenbrook bangs his cane on a table.  baltus puts a calming
     hand on senile hardenbrook's shoulder.

                             doctor lancaster
               no one knows why he chose to now to
               climb out from his grave.

                             father steenwyck
               it is very clear why.  citizens
               here have long tried to hide sins
               behind closed doors.  their failed
               faith has saturated the soil and
               called forth one of satan's own.

                             ichabod
               excuse me, gentlemen, but... who
               has seen this horseman?

                             baltus
               many have.

                             ichabod
               then, name one person who has seen
               him with their own eyes.

     a long wait.  no reply from the elders.  ichabod rises.

                             ichabod
               while i will do everything i can
               to find your assassin, i will look
               for a man of flesh and blood.  not
               some goblin-demon from hell.
