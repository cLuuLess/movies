     int.  church -- day

     baltus holds everyone's back with the pistol.

                             baltus 
               the next person to lay hands on me
               will have a bullet.  stand off!

                             katrina
               father...

                             baltus 
               no!  we're safe here.
                     (points at ichabod) 
               you said it.  the horseman will not
               have me.

     crash, the harpoon-like post spears through a window,
     trailing rope tied to it...

     crack -- skewers baltus from behind, the bloodied point
     bursting out his breast bone.

     baltus looks down, drops the gun... clutching the post with
     both hands.  blood streams out his mouth.  katrina screams.

     the rope yanks baltus back.  he slams into the window...
