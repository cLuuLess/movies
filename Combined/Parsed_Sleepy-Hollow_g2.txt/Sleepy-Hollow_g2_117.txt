     int.  notary public, records room -- day

     ichabod sticks his head in, not liking what he sees.

     hardenbrook's amidst unbelievable disarray.  tables, shelves,
     and baskets of unevenly piled documents.

     hardenbrook looks on a shelf, confused, then goes to a table,
     lifting papers, mumbling.

                             hardenbrook 
               damn... damn... damn...

                             ichabod
               master hardenbrook...

     hardenbrook turns, a bit startled.

                             ichabod 
               perhaps, i could assist in finding them?

                             hardenbrook
               well... that might be... helpful.
