     int.  van tassel house, sewing room -- night

     they enter... the room with the elaborate loom.  ichabod
     moves his lantern to make a quick search, goes to table.

     he touches the top of a candle.  his finger comes away with a
     bit of still wet wax.

                             young masbath 
               there are no other doors.  this is as
               far as she could have gone.

                             ichabod 
               it is nothing.  she comes to read books,
               so her father will not find her.
                     (to convince himself) 
               it is absolutely nothing.

                             young masbath 
               what books?

                             ichabod 
               fiction plays and novels.  baltus does
               not approve.  now, come.  it may not be
               long before lady van tassel returns.

                             young masbath 
               but, sir... what books?  where are they?

     ichabod stops, looking around.  no books anywhere.

                             young masbath 
               if there is a secret place for books...
               it could be just as good for the
               missing loan agreements.

     ichabod ponders this without saying anything.
