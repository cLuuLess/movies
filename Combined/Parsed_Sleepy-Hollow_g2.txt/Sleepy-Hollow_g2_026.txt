     ext.  sleepy hollow forest -- night

     jonathan runs past, gripping his bow.  it's quiet... till
     hoofbeats are heard in pursuit.

     trees are silhouetted against the sky.  as hoofbeats get
     louder, branches bend like arms and fingers yearning to
     touch.  as hoofbeats roar past, the trees relax.

     further on, jonathan runs.  wind begins to blow.

     behind, in motion, we see daredevil's snorting visage; eyes
     lizard-like, with vertical slits literally aglow.

     the horseman's hand yanks a wooden war hammer from a saddle
     mount.  (no clear view of the horseman.)

     horseman's p.o.v.: closing in on jonathan.

     jonathan is overtaken.  the horseman swings the hammer whoomp
     -- sends jonathan sprawling.

     hoofbeats fade.  jonathan tries to get up, but pain shoots
     through him.  he crawls to retrieve his bow.

     against a tree, he takes an arrow from his shoulder quiver
     and readies it.  waiting.  a metal tapping is heard o.s.
     clink... clink... clink.  a horse snorts.

     jonathan pulls the bow taut, pained, lips bloody.

     elsewhere, daredevil approaches slow.  the horseman taps his
     sword on his spur, clink... clink... clink...

     foliage moves as the horseman's form pushes through.

     jonathan releases -- the arrow whistles...

     thwack! -- imbeds in the horseman's chest.

     clink... clink... clink... continues -- jonathan readies a
     second arrow.  pulls and releases -- o.s. thwack!

     clink... clink... clink... jonathan cries out, crawling away
     desperately.  crawling through underbrush, over roots and
     rocks.  clink... clink... clink... jonathan gives up, spent,
     face to the dirt.  he closes his eyes.

     clinking stops.  daredevil halts astride jonathan; two legs
     on each side of jonathan's body.
