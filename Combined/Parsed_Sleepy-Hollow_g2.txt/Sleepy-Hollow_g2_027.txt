     ext.  sleepy hollow farmland -- morning

     baltus and a large, dullardly man ride.  behind, ichabod
     rides with magistrate philipse.

     ichabod is not adept at riding his old nag, gunpowder.

                             ichabod
               the van garretts died first; a man
               and his son, survived by a wife and
               two infants.  and the widow windsor
               was next...

                             philipse
               and now jonathan masbath.

                             ichabod
                     (looks back, ponders)
               why would he flee this direction,
               with so much open ground to cross
               before he reached cover?

                             philipse
               he would not have gone into the
               western woods.  no sane man would.

     philipse drinks from a whiskey flask, sees ichabod watching
     and offers some.  ichabod declines.

                             philipse
               van ripper there...

     ahead, the dullard, van ripper, sloppily spits tobacco.

                             philipse
               ... found the body this morning.
                     (pause) 
               you do believe now, don't you?

                             ichabod 
               believe?

                             lady van tassel 
               you said yourself.  what mere man
               could have downed the belltower?

                             ichabod 
               it is a prime tenet of science,
               philipse, that because one thing
               appears improbable does not mean
               you embrace the utterly fantastical.

                             philipse 
               you need less big words, and more
               common sense.

     philipse fingers an iron key talisman he wears on a cord.

                             ichabod 
               what is that you wear?

                             philipse 
               my talisman.  it will, protect
               against the horseman if i show a
               brave face.  but, i cannot run.  if
               i run in fear, it is worthless.

                             ichabod 
               well... so much for common sense.
