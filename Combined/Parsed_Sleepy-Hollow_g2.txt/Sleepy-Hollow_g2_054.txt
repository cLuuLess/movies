     ichabod and katrina lead their horses.  a heated argument.

                             katrina
               why would you do such a thing?

                             ichabod 
               no stone may be left unturned.  it
               may appear harsh...

                             katrina 
               i have misjudged you i think.  i did
               not imagine you were so cruel.

                             ichabod 
               you are not regarding it in full.
               the widow windsor had been run
               through by a sword.  i followed the
               bloodless wound, a wound whose path
               i could not comprehend till i had
               seen the horseman with my own eyes.

                             katrina 
               what are you on about?

                             ichabod 
               the child she carried was eight
               months grown at least... near to
               birthing.  the sword had pierced its
               tiny heart exactly.

                             katrina 
               must i hear this?

                             ichabod 
               there was no blind stabbing.  this
               singular thrust found its target
               omnipotently, as if the horseman made
               certain the unborn child died with
               its mother.

                             katrina 
               and this gives worth to butchery?

                             ichabod 
               it was not butchery.

                             katrina 
               what is it then?  scientific method?
               how can any of this matter in the
               slightest?

                             ichabod 
               i have no solution for its meaning
               yet, but i could not just ignore it.

                             katrina 
               take a lesson from young masbath's
               desires, ichabod crane.  he follows
               with you to avenge his father's death.
               that i understand.  but, what do you
               want?

                             ichabod 
               to avenge his father, and the others.

                             katrina 
               but, why?  tell me why.

     ichabod struggles for a reply.

                             katrina 
               you falter with your answer because
               you strive without putting the whole
               of your heart into it.  can't you see?
               you'll bring dignity to the dead even
               if you have to chop them into little
               pieces to do it.

                             ichabod
                     (fed up, growing anger) 
               if it had been surgery on a living
               person, done to save that person's
               life, you would not question it.  not
               for a moment.  so, let me be the first
               to tell you, dear girl... on the other
               side of these sheltering mountains, a
               whole world has advanced beyond such
               plebeian thinking as yours.  and
               someday, no matter how much you fear
               it, that world will come to roust
               sleepy hollow out of its slumber.

     katrina storms away.  ichabod's already regretting.
