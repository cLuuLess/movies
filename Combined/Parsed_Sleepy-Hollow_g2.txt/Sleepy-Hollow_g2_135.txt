     int.  van tassel house, sewing room -- later night

     search montage:

     - drawers are opened and searched, quietly.
     - young masbath uses a candle to look up the fireplace.
     - ichabod opens a linen cabinet, unfolding blankets.
     - young masbath looks in a closet filled with big spools of
     sewing thread, on his knees, pulls a wooden box forward.
     inside it, he finds only old cups and silverware.

     ichabod pulls up a rug, feeling along the floorboards.

     young masbath crawls, doing the same.  he climbs under the
     loom, tapping on the floor.  tap... tap... tap...

     he crawls further under the loom.  tap... tap... plonk.  a
     hollow sound.  he taps again... plonk... plonk.

                             young masbath 
               constable.

     ichabod comes over as young masbath lifts a loose board.
     under the floor, there are piles of books.  masbath brings
     them up, handing them to ichabod, who studies the spines.

     young masbath reaches in up to his shoulder.  he comes up
     with "loan agreements."

                             young masbath 
               fie!  here they are.

     ichabod takes them.  names are near the top: "masbath," "van
     garret," "philipse," and "killian."

     ichabod sits back, numb, his heart bitterly broken.
