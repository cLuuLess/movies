     int.  killian's home, white room -- day

     at the trap door, beth lowers thomas to stairs leading to the
     cellar.  thomas is crying.

                             beth
               don't let him get you.

                             thomas
               mommy...

                             beth
               you hide now... go...

     beth closes the trap door, frantically replacing the carpet.
     the room's door flies open and the horseman strides in,
     carrying killian's severed head.  beth shrieks.

     the horseman steps forward, knocks over the magic lantern.
